Here, we introduce the concept and design principles of e-textile microgrids by demonstrating a multi-module bioenergy microgrid system. Unlike earlier hybrid wearable systems, the presented e-textile microgrid relies solely on human activity to work synergistically, harvesting biochemical and biomechanical energy using sweat-based biofuel cells and triboelectric generators, and regulating the harvested energy via supercapacitors for high-power output. Through energy budgeting, the e-textile system can efficiently power liquid crystal displays continuously or a sweat sensor-electrochromic display system in pulsed sessions, with half the booting time and triple the runtime in a 10-min exercise session. Implementing “compatible form factors, commensurate performance, and complementary functionality” design principles, the flexible, textile-based bioenergy microgrid offers attractive prospects for the design and operation of efficient, sustainable, and autonomous wearable systems.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Though energy-harvesting wearable systems have been reported in the literature, their system design imposes limitations that hinder their overall performance.

In order to meet the growing power demands of wearable electronics and eliminate the need for frequent, interrupting recharges and cumbersome wired power transmission, wearable systems have integrated energy harvesters such as solar cells, triboelectric generators (TEGs), and enzymatic or microbial biofuel cells (BFCs) to enable their self-sustainable operation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Different wearable devices have recently adapted this strategy to collect energy from human or the environment followed by regulating and storing the scavenged energy in storage modules such as batteries or supercapacitors (SCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. However, the operation of these systems has relied on either a monolithic input source which shares the same limitation in energy availability (e.g., the lack of motion, biofuel, sunlight), or upon multiple harvesters that operate in parallel but are not synergistic in realistic scenarios, and introduce additional limitations instead of compensating existing ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Moreover, the early multi-input hybrid harvesting systems, such as the integration of solar cells with SCs and batteries, relied partially on energy inputs from the external environment (e.g., thermoelectric, pyroelectric, photovoltaic) which are often uncontrollable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. To scavenge energy efficiently and reliably solely from human activities, system-level considerations are urgently needed to guide the judicious selection of components with complementary characteristics and commensurate performance.</p><p id="Par4">In this regard, wearable energy systems can seek inspiration in the design and deployment of microgrids operating in “island mode”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Microgrid, namely, a micro-scale power grid with components including energy generation, energy storage, various utilities, and management functionality for regulating the flow of energy, can be made self-sustainable and independent from the main power grid by the inclusion of various renewable energy harvesters and appropriate energy storage units. Such self-sustainable microgrids can operate independently from the main grid by harvesting energy from localized sources and regulating and storing the scavenged energy in various energy storage modules. The reliability of renewable sources is fortified by coupling with other generation sources (e.g., fuel-based generators) to ensure a timely energy supply<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Furthermore, these localized sources are paired with storage modules with optimal capacities based on the load energy demands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Beyond the simple addition of harvesting and storage modules, design of the microgrid relies on the careful selection of components with compatible performance and complementary characteristics.</p><p id="Par5">Inspired by this notion, we herein propose and demonstrate the concept of a wearable e-textile microgrid system: a multi-module, textile-base system with applications powered by complementary and synergistic energy harvesters and commensurate energy storage modules. To demonstrate this concept, we describe in the following section an integrated e-textile microgrid system that unite BFCs and TEGs, two harvesters with distinct and complementary energy conversion mechanisms based on human activities, along with SC modules for regulating the powering of wearable applications with both low and high power demand (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Among many proposed integrated harvesters, the pairing of the biomechanical and biochemical harvesters is desirable as they rely solely on human activities. Previous studies demonstrated only such combination working in proof-of-concept in-vitro settings, hence are challenging to be employed for real-life scenarios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Adapting the microgrid design concept, this work seamlessly integrates biomechanical and biochemical harvesters along with energy storage devices, with carefully budgeted energy rating, into one e-textile platform. When this microgrid harvests energy during human movements, the TEG storage modules are firstly activated from the instant motion-induced charge generation to harvest biomechanical energy to rapidly boot the system, while the subsequently activated BFCs harvest biochemical energy from electroenzymatic reactions of sweat metabolites for prolonged power delivery (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The complementary relationship between the two bioenergy harvesters thus compensates for the limitations of the BFCs due to delayed perspiration and of the TEGs due to the lack of motion. The SC modules regulate low-current, high voltage inputs from the TEG modules and high-current, low-voltage inputs from the BFC modules, with optimal capacity to delivery sufficient power for designated applications while maintaining fast booting. The optimized system can thus boot quickly within 3 min to continuously power a microwatt-rated wristwatch with liquid crystal display (LCD), or a milliwatt-rated sensor-electrochromic display (ECD) system operating in pulsed sessions, and extend their operation to over 30 min in connection to a 10-min movement session (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Compared to the early integrated wearable energy systems, the present system relies solely on energy inputs from human activities and hence is not dependent on the external environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The performance of the individual modules was characterized, and the energy carefully budgeted to ensure that the limited amount of harvested energy was efficiently utilized. For compatibility with the wearable form factor, all modules are printed, textile-based, durable and flexible, and can be readily integrated onto a shirt to harvest energy from the sliding motion between the forearms and the torso by TEGs and the sweat generated above the chest by the BFCs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). These modules are connected with flexible printed silver interconnections that are secured and insulated by a hydrophobic, water-proof polystyrene-polyethylene-polybutylene-polystyrene (SEBS) block copolymer. The placement of the modules ensures the optimal collection of biomechanical energy via the TEG module from the arm movements, along with an intimate contact of BFCs to the skin for sweat collection. The placement of BFCs and SCs on the chest also minimizes the possible bending and wrinkling deformation which may affect their energy harvesting and collection efficiency. Implementing the “complementary, commensurate, compatible” design principles, the microgrid e-textile system serves as an attractive example for future integrated on-body systems that are autonomous, reliable, synergistic, sustainable and energy-efficient. While the microgrid concept is introduced here to the field of wearable electronics using complementary BFC and TEG bioenergy harvesters paired with SC storage modules, it can be applied for guiding the development of future miniaturized energy systems based on a judicious selection and integration of different modules toward a variety of self-powered electronics applications.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Design and concept of the multi-modular energy microgrid system.</title><p><bold>a</bold> System diagram of the energy microgrid system, consisting of the TEG, BFC, SC modules and wearable applications. <bold>b</bold> Graphic illustration of the synergistic effect of integrating the complementary BFC and TEG energy harvesters. <bold>c</bold> System diagram of the integrated E-textile microgrid powering an LCD or an ECD-sensor system. <bold>d</bold> Photo images illustrating the arrangement of the individual modules of the wearable microgrid system on a shirt worn on-body, including the TEG modules on the side of the torso, the SC modules on the chest, the BFC modules and potentiometric sensor inside the shirt for direct sweat contact, and wearable electronics that are powered by the microgrid.

Since their inception in 2012, TEGs have become the most studied wearable mechanical energy harvesters due to its simple generation mechanism and the abundant selection of materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. The present TEG module is composed of a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)-based negative mover and an ethylcellulose-polyurethane (EC-PU)-based positive stator in interdigitated patterns (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), and is designed to harvest energy from sliding motions as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. To ensure the compatibility of the fabrication of the TEG elements to the e-textile platform with abundant flexibility and durability, each individual layer in the TEG was formulated into a screen-printable ink with elastomeric binder that is water-proof and resistant to abrasion. The TEG modules were characterized at low sliding frequencies ranging from 0.833 Hz to 3 Hz, simulating the realistic swinging speed of human arms from during walking (below 1 Hz) to running (1.5–3 Hz). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c–d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>, the maximum peak voltage, independent from the frequency, was measured to be ca. 160 V. In contrast, the peak current grows nearly linearly with the frequency, from 45 μA at 0.833 Hz to 130 μA at 3 Hz, reflecting the linearly shortened time of transferring the same amount of charge between the mover and the stator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. To ensure that the TEG module is paired with commensurate storage rating, commercial electrolytic capacitors, with known capacitance ranging from 1 μF to 1 mF were used initially for the characterization, which were charged by a rectified TEG module in 60 s, 1.5 Hz sliding sessions while recording the capacitor voltage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>).

Using the above equations, the total amount of stored energy and the average current was calculated and summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>. The average current remained mostly unchanged at 5.8 μA against different capacitors, while the energy stored maximized at 0.49 mJ near the load of 100 μF. The charging characteristics of the TEG modules at different frequencies were also tested and plotted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g–h</xref>. These data show a near-linear growth in stored energy and average current with the sliding frequency, which corroborated with the behavior observed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>. The mechanical durability of the TEG modules was also evaluated through repeated folding, crumpling and extended abrasion (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>). The TEG modules were repeatedly folded with the radius below 1 mm for 100 cycles, and their open-circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>) during 1.5 Hz sliding motion was monitored, which has shown no discernible change (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref>). The TEG modules were also crumpled randomly and flattened repeatedly for 100 times, with their V<sub>OC</sub> when sliding monitored. The crumpling deformation had also shown no change in performance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2k</xref>). The durability of the module against constant friction and washing was also tested, where the TEG module underwent constant sliding motion for over 2000 cycles and 20-min washing, where no visible drop in V<sub>OC</sub> was observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2l</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>).

Due to the high lactate concentrations in human sweat, a variety of sweat-based BFCs have been developed as wearable energy harvesters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. The wearable BFC modules were also screen-printed using various ink composites onto textile substrates. Carbon nanotubes (CNT)-based pellets were attached to interdigitated “island-bridge” interconnections (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a-b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>) composed of flexible carbon composite as currents collectors and flexible silver composite as conductive interconnections. As illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, such bioenergy harvesting relies on the oxidation of lactate catalyzed by the lactate oxidase (LOx) immobilized on the bioanode, and on the oxygen reduction reaction facilitated by bilirubin oxidase (BOx) on the cathode. For efficient sweat bioenergy harvesting, the anode CNT pellets were preloaded with the 1,4-naphthoquinone (NQ) mediator while confining LOx with the glutaraldehyde (GA) cross-linker and chitosan; the CNT-based cathode pellets were decorated with protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) as the electron transfer promoter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, while immobilizing the BOx with Nafion. The detailed fabrication and composition of the anode and cathode pellets are described in the “Methods” section and Supplementary Notes <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>. All in-vitro tests for characterization of the BFC were carried out in 0.5 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) with pH of 7.4. Traditionally, wearable BFC devices are characterized with LSV, with scan rate near 5 mV s<sup>−1,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. However, for high-surface-area electrodes like the CNT pellets such high-speed LSV will result in an unrealistically high power due to the capacitive currents (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). Therefore, the fabricated BFC modules were characterized using chronoamperometry (CA) at different potentials in the presence of 15 mM lactate to reflect the realistic power output of the BFC in extended discharge sessions. The testing of the BFC modules resulted in a maximum power of 21.5 μW per module when discharging the BFC at 0.5 V (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d–e</xref>). The response of the BFC to different lactate concentrations has been evaluated using CA, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>, Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>, where the power per module increases from 9.7 μW at 5 mM lactate to 25.3 μW at 25 mM lactate. The mechanical durability and the stability of the BFC were also tested using CA. The module was bent 1000 times to 180° inward then outward with the radius of 1.3 cm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>), with the current at 0.5 V before and after bending in 10 mM lactate environment measured. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>, the power of the BFC did not show any noticeable change before and after the bending. Such resiliency is attributed primarily to the “island-bridge” structure where the non-flexible, functional electrode pellets as the islands are connected by flexible, conductive silver interconnections. The stability of the BFC was tested also throughout the week (as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>). The BFC under test was stored in refrigerator under 4 °C and was taken out for testing every 24 h in a 10 mM lactate environment.

A CNT and poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) hybrid capacitor, offering screen-printability and high flexibility, has been adopted as symmetrical interdigitated electrodes that are connected by flexible silver current collectors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Each SC module consists of 5 SC units connected in series to reach the desired 5 V voltage range for directly powering electronics, with each SC unit featuring four interdigitated CNT-PEDOT:PSS electrode segments covered by a solidified, transparent, flexible, sulfuric acid-crosslinked polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) electrolyte (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>). The hybrid capacitor stores electric energy via both double-layer capacitance endowed by the high specific surface area CNTs and pseudocapacitance from the PEDOT:PSS, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>. The areal capacitance of the printed SC material was characterized via both cyclic voltammetry (CV) at different scan rates and galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD) with different currents.

As agreed by both characterization methods, the capacitance of the printed SC was determined to be ca. 10 mF cm<sup>−2</sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>). Several SC modules can be connected in series or in parallel to adjust the overall capacitance to fit for harvesters and applications to obtain optimal charging speed and deliver sufficient energy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f</xref>). The stability of the module is analyzed by performing GCD cycles on the SC module. The mechanical stability of the module was evaluated by applying 1000 cycles of repeated inward-outward bending cycles at 180° with a bending radius of 0.5 cm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>, the charge-discharge behavior of the SC does not show any noticeable change before and after the 1000 cycles of bending deformation, suggesting the robust flexibility of the SC module for wearable applications. To prevent the leaching of the acidic electrolyte, the device is sealed by an additional layer of printed SEBS. The device can thus withstand extended wetting and washing without electrolyte leaching or observable degradation in its performance (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>). The electrochemical stability of the SC module was studied by 1000 cycles of GCD between 0 V and 5 V with a current of 50 μA. As demonstrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4i</xref>, the areal capacitance of the SC shows a slight drop of areal capacitance after 1000 cycles to ca. 9 mF cm<sup>−2</sup>, while the coulombic efficiency gradually increases to 95%. The electrochemical performance of the SC is thus acceptable within the use-case of the microgrid, where roughly a few hundreds of charge-discharge cycles are expected. Detailed characterization and calculation of the SC performance are described in Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> and Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>.

Using this setting, three scenarios have been simulated: (i) movement starts followed by the start of perspiration; (ii) movements and perspiration taking place simultaneously; and (iii) movements stop but the perspiration continues. In the 4-min simulations, two TEG modules rectified by a bridge rectifier and one BFC module modulated by a DC voltage booster were used to charge one SC module (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>). Each scenario was tested with only the TEG (blue curve), only the BFC (green curve), and both modules operating together (red curve). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, during the starting phase, the TEG module was able to charge the SC module immediately after starting the movement, whereas the BFC module was not able to provide power due to the lack of lactate. When lactate was spiked, the BFC started to respond to the fuel addition to provide power to the SC. The additive effect of integrating two complementary energy harvesters can be observed throughout the rest of the simulation, where their charging speed surpasses the individually operating harvesters. Such additive effect continued throughout the scenario (ii) and the first half of the scenario (iii). As soon as the sliding motion stopped, the TEG module stopped its operation instantaneously. In contrast, the BFC module continued to operate due to the presence of the lactate fuel to charge the SC module without interruption. Beyond the additive effects of two energy harvesters, the advantage of integrating the complementary TEG and BFC modules was demonstrated: at the start of the movement, the fast-booting TEG module can compensate for the slow-booting of the BFC; in return, the transiently harvesting TEG module was compensated by the extended-operating BFC module after the movement stops, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. This synergistic behavior, not offered by any previous studies, is highly desirable for the reliable and sustainable operation of a self-powered wearable system. As expected, the charging speed of the 1 Hz sliding, 10 mM lactate simulation condition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a(i)-(iii)</xref>) was the slowest amongst all three, followed by the 1.5 Hz sliding, 10 mM lactate condition (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a(iv)-(vi)</xref>), with the 1.5 Hz sliding, 15 mM lactate condition charging the capacitor fastest (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a(vii)-(ix)</xref>). In all three situations, the synergistic additive effect was observed in all 3 phases of the condition, and the complementary fast-boosting and extended-harvesting effects were observed for the starting and ending phases of all 3 conditions, correspondingly.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>In-vitro and on-body charging performance of the wearable bioenergy microgrid system.</title><p><bold>a</bold> In-vitro charging curves of the individual and integrated harvester with (i)-(iii) 1 Hz frequency and 10 mM lactate; (iv)-(vi) 1.5 Hz frequency and 10 mM lactate; and (vii)-(ix) 1.5 Hz and 15 mM lactate for the TEG modules and the BFC modules, which simulate three representative phases: starting ((i), (iv), and (vii)), exercising((ii), (v), and (viii)) and ending((iii), (vi), and (ix)) of an activity session. <bold>b</bold> Photo illustration of the on-body testing arrangement. <bold>c</bold> On-body charging of a 150 μF SC using the individual BFC or TEG module alone, and with both modules combined, in a 10-min exercise session followed by a 20-min resting. <bold>d</bold> On-body charging of capacitors from SCs with (i) 75 μF, (ii) 150 μF, and (iii) 300 μF from 0 V in a 30-min exercise session to represent the charging of the system including the cold-starting phase of the voltage-booster.

Two TEGs, two BFCs and the corresponding SC modules were printed on the left and right sides of the waist, below the collar and in front of a shirt, respectively, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, and were connected via printed silver traces and enameled wires with proper insulations. A PVA-based PBS hydrogel was applied onto the BFC module for sweat capturing. A 10-min exercise session was carried out on a cycling machine, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>, where the arm-swinging frequency was kept near 1.5 Hz, followed by 20 min of resting. Similar to the in-vitro simulation, the integrated on-body system was tested with only TEG, only BFC and with all harvesters operating together. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> demonstrates the on-body energy harvesting performance of the integrated system. For the system operating solely on TEG modules, the energy harvesting started immediately after the arm-swinging started and charged the SC module continuously throughout the 10-min exercise session. As soon as the movement stopped, the TEG stopped supplying power, and the SC module slowly self-discharged. For the system operated solely on the BFC module, the system suffered from slow booting with a 6-min delay. However, the BFC was able to supply power to the SC module quickly after sweating started, and fully charged the SC within 17 min Upon stopping the exercise, the BFC module was able to continuously supply power to the SC module over a 30-min period, reflecting the continuous presence of sweat. Lastly, the integrated system was able to compensate for both the slow booting and the transient harvesting, quickly fully charging the SC module in 7 min, maintaining maximum voltage over a 30-min period. In addition to the data presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>, the on-body operation of the system was also tested with SC modules configurated with the capacitance of 75 μF, 150 μF, and 300 μF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). The charging is started at 0 V instead of 2 V to demonstrate the booting of the voltage booster in the start of the operation. The SC modules were fully discharged to 0V and their potential monitored during charging, and the exercise sessions were only stopped when the SC is fully charged to 5.1 V or the limit of 30 min was reached. As shown in the figure, the time taken to fully charge the SC module increased as the capacitance increased for both the individual harvesters and the integrated microgrid harvesters. The synergistic and complementary behavior can still be observed in the booting phase of the charging, where the integrated harvesting system can fully charge the SC module faster than the individual harvesters, starting from the 4 min for 75 μF capacitor, to the 8 min for 150 μF capacitor and 12 min for the 300 μF capacitor. These results have thus validated the in-vitro simulation, fully illustrating the complementary and synergistic behaviors of the wearable microgrid system which offers fast-booting and extended-harvesting for energy harvesting in an activity session.

To supply 200 ms of operation assuming the lowest power of ca. 4–5 mW, the energy required was thus estimated to be ca. 0.8–1 mJ.

The capacitors were discharged with 200 ms pulsed discharge, where more differences were more pronounced. The higher capacitance capacitors were able to sustain multiple refresh sessions, and the number of sessions decreases with the capacitance, as to 1 successful discharge session from the 100 μF with a slightly excess amount of energy, and 1 discharge from the 47 μF capacitor which did not last throughout the entire 200 ms session (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29c</xref>). It is thus determined that the 75 μF SC modules should retain enough energy to sustain one complete refresh session. The required state of charge of the SC was then characterized by charging the 75 μF SC module to different potentials, and use the SC to power one refresh session, while the color on the ECD recorded to determine the minimum state of charge required for the 75 μF SC module to induce color change with sufficient contrast (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">30</xref>). It can be observed that the contrast of the on and off pixels gradually decreased with the initial state of charge of the SC modules, with the difference barely recognizable below 3.5 V.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>, the SC module was charged up to 4 V and discharged to refresh the sensor-ECD system. The fully integrated microgrid system was able to boot quickly within 3 min and intermittently refresh the results during the 30-min operation. In comparison, the BFC module suffered from slow booting due to delayed perspiration while the TEG modules were not able to sustain the operation after stopping the movement. It is worth noting that the faster boosting speed for the TEG-only scenario is due to the lack of need to supply a small amount of energy to boost the voltage booster. In both applications with different modes of operation, the wearable microgrid system—with its complementary and synergistic BFC-TEG harvesting and commensurate SC pairing—was able to deliver both fast-booting and extended-harvesting to ensure the autonomous and sustainable operation of the wearable platforms.</p><p id="Par15">A low-power wristwatch with a LCD was chosen as a representative application that is continuously powered by the wearable microgrid system.

The microgrid can store and regulate the harvested energy via efficiently paired SC modules to efficiently power wearable applications such as an LCD wristwatch and a sensor-ECD system. Implementing the “compatible, complementary, and commensurate” design principles, all modules were carefully characterized and efficiently integrated to rapidly, autonomously and sustainably deliver power using the limited amount of harvested energy. All printed modules, printed with polymer-based composite inks, are flexible, durable, and ready for seamless integration on textile platforms. Compared to previous integration of wearable energy harvesting and storage devices, this work focuses on the complementary relationship between two bioenergy harvesters that perform synergistically to scavenge energy from human motion, and their pairing with storage modules with commensurate capacity for maximized efficiency and performance. With the optimized pairing of components, such wearable microgrid can quickly boot selected applications while sustaining their operation substantially longer than the exercise sessions, hence ensuring the reliability and practicality of the wearable system. To further improve such E-textile microgrid system, more modular design concepts, such as fabricating patch-like detachable and swappable harvesters, storage devices, and sensors, can be adapted to extend the usage and applicable scenario of the E-textile system. While serving here as an example, such microgrid strategy inspires future miniaturized integrated systems that harvest thermal, chemical or mechanical energies to select complementary, synergistic, commensurate and compatible components for their designated use case. The configuration of the harvesters connection can also be further explored: instead of parallelly operating harvesters, serial connections between harvesters of the same type or different types can be considered to increase the output voltage and minimize or eliminate the need for voltage regulation. Future work in developing energy harvesting devices that rely on the harvesting from passive activities will broaden the applicable scenarios and enhance the practicality of the microgrid system. Expanding the microgrid concept from on-body to in-body applications, and utilizing the abundant amount of biofuel and biomechanical movements within the body can also allow integrated harvesting system for self-powered implantable or ingestible sensing that are no longer limited by external environment or the need for exercise. Upon improving the power density of various harvesters, high capacity energy storage options with commensurate rating can also be considered for powering of a wider range of electronics for advanced functionalities. The concept of wearable microgrids and their design principles are thus expected to promote system-level considerations for integrating various new-form-factor modules towards truly self-powered, autonomous, and sustainable systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p id="Par17">1,4‐NQ, bovine serum albumin (BSA), PPIX (≥95%), glutaraldehyde, L(+)-lactic acid, acetic acid, sulfuric acid, chitosan (from shrimp shells, &gt;200 cP, 1 wt. % in 1% acetic acid), silver flakes  (10 μm), PTFE powder (powder, free-flowing, 1 μm particle size), toluene, methanol, ethanol, PVA (MW = 89,000 – 98,000, 99+ % Hydrolyzed), polyvinyl butyral (PVB) (powder, &gt;100 cps), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 4-methyl-2-pentanone (MIBK), 1,1,1,2,3,4,4,5,5,5-decafluoropentane (DFP), Poly(sodium 4-styrene sulfonate) (MW ~ 70,000), sodium tetrakis[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate (Na-TFPB), D-sorbitol, dioctyl sebacate (DOS) and glycerol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
