Nevertheless, as with all biofuels, there is still uncertainty around their sustainability. Most life cycle assessments (LCA) of microalgae biofuels so far used lab-based, scaled-up lab experimental data or data from the scientific literature. This article, provides evidence and analysis, undertaking an LCA using real-world data from an industrial facility that uses a combination of photobioreactor and fermenter systems.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The current well-to-wheel LCA study aimed to compare the environmental impacts of microalgae biodiesel production—under different energy regimes—and with petroleum-derived diesel. The functional unit was considered as “combustion of 1 MJ (Lower Heating Value) of algal biodiesel in an internal combustion engine (as B100)”. This LCA study considers the environmental and energy impacts from the construction of the facility, as well as those impacts from the operation of the facility. The foreground LCI data was collected from a real-world one-hectare microalgae production pilot facility. ReCiPe, IPCC AR5 (GWP100 and GWP20) and Global Temperature Potential (GTP) were implemented to assess the life cycle environmental impacts.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par3">The assessment shows that when infrastructure is included, microalgae-derived biofuels are not yet favourable over petroleum-derived fuels on GWP100, and this becomes worse over shorter timescales. In terms of climate change (GWP100), whilst 1 MJ (LHV) of fossil-derived diesel would emit 8.84 × 10<sup>−2</sup> kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq, 1 MJ of microalgae-derived biodiesel from a solar photovoltaic powered facility would emit 1.48 × 10<sup>−1</sup> kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq. To be equal to petroleum-derived diesel in terms of GWP100, or perform better, productivity of the microalgae production system needs to be improved as the most effective solution. The results also showed that electricity and infrastructure were major sources of environmental impacts, as well as the yeast used within the fermenter. Moreover, it takes 0.99 MJ of direct energy per 1 MJ of microalgae biofuel produced, similar to the fossil fuel industry for 1 MJ of diesel.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Using infrastructure and operational models, the study shows that the facility does not compare well with petroleum-derived diesel unless productivity can be increased. Productivity improvements, be it through improvements to microalgae strains or improved photobioreactor designs, should be a priority to ensure microalgae become a sustainable fuel feedstock. Electricity use should be reduced as well, again, through improved cultivation system designs. In terms of the current system, the high impacts of yeast should be addressed, either through co-locating yeast production or through ensuring specific sources with lower impacts. Extracting lipids will effectively waste some high-value products, whilst the waste can be expected to be a mixture of unextracted lipids, polysaccharides or fibre, some proteins and minerals. It is also shown that harmonisations of the assessments are needed for future studies and real-world operation facilities to conclusively decide if microalgae should be used as fuel or if they would be better used for other products, such as feed or high-value products.

assessment</title><p id="Par5">Microalgae have long been considered a possible source for future low-carbon transport fuel (Laurens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>) and the most promising photoautotrophs for fixing the carbon in the atmosphere (Shahid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2020</xref>). One of the primary reasons for this is the low use of prime agricultural land and high productivity per hectare compared with other crops. Microalgae are single-celled organisms containing carbon-rich lipids; these lipids can be converted into biodiesel through transesterification, with glycerol as a by-product (Skorupskaite et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2016</xref>). Biodiesel production from aquatic biomass (such as microalgae) is a promising option that could address most of the challenges with the previous generations of biofuels and thus has received considerable attention (Barr and Landis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2018</xref>; Sander and Murthy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2010</xref>). However, there is significant debate over the sustainability of all bioenergy sources (Zheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2020</xref>), including microalgae-derived biofuels, that requires further investigation using sustainability assessments in general and environmental impact assessment in particular (Rafiaani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>; Villarroel Walker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2017</xref>). Moreover, the non-lipid parts of the microalgae can be used as biomass for energy generation or to produce high-value products such as β-carotene (Di Caprio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>), astaxanthin (García Prieto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2017</xref>), docosahexaenoic acid (Yin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2019</xref>) and extracts for use in cosmetics. Nevertheless, biomass conversion from microalgae to bioproducts encompasses complex processing stages and different process pathways that need to be examined.</p><p id="Par6">Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology can quantify the environmental aspects and potential environmental impacts associated with a product, process or service (ISO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">14040</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>). Depending on the system boundary, LCA includes the initial resource mining and refinement, transportation, fabrication, use and end-of-life (EoL). The accuracy of an LCA is highly dependent on the quality and accuracy of the underlying data and assumptions used to accomplish the analysis (Velasquez-Orta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2018</xref>; Torkayesh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2022</xref>). LCA studies of the production of microalgae-derived biofuels have shown that results vary significantly (Garcia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020</xref>) due to alternative methodologies and assumptions used (Azadi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2014</xref>; Collet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>; Quinn and Davis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Previous LCA studies on microalgae</title><p id="Par7">Although there is a great interest in microalgae biofuel LCA, there is a distinct lack of LCA studies that use real-world primary data from microalgae production facilities. In fact, the majority of microalgae biofuel LCA research is based on hypothetical industrial facilities that is further based on scaled-up or theoretical calculations. Some of these extrapolated data from their own smaller lab tests, whilst others used secondary data from the scientific literature. There are a number of issues with these, as they are based on either dramatically extrapolated data from laboratory tests or on data from multiple sources that are not representative of a particular single microalgae biofuel facility. Within the IEA 2017 State of Technology Review for Microalgae Bioenergy (Laurens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>), there was significant criticism of two highly cited papers (Chisti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2007</xref>; Hu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>), which seem to form the foundation of many LCAs of hypothetical facilities. The IEA review considered that these two papers provide unrealistically high levels of operational time, oil content and aerial productivities.</p><p id="Par8">Aside from the data gaps, there are numerous issues with the LCA of microalgae-derived biofuels, which can mostly be considered to be generic and applicable to the whole of LCA as a field. One significant issue, which can be argued to be general to LCA, is the lack of comparability within apparently similar LCAs. Although ISO 14040 and 14044 present the general framework and requirements for performing a standardised LCA, they do not propose specific methods for making the various choices within the LCA. The choice of functional unit, boundary conditions and impact categories are left up to the practitioners; thus, seemingly similar LCAs could be, in fact, quite different in assumptions, methodology and inconsistent in data quality (Sills et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2020</xref>; Valente et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2019</xref>) and thus incomparable. Additionally, elements of ISO 14040 and 14044, such as the range of impact categories to be studied, are often not followed. As a result, many LCAs provide widely different results for microalgae biodiesel for all impact categories. This research compares the environmental impacts of microalgae biodiesel production—under different energy regimes and—with petroleum-derived diesel across different impact categories using LCA approach.</p><p id="Par9">Purely looking at GHG emissions, they range from −0.75 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/MJ (Batan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>) to 3.8 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/MJ. Various meta-analyses have been undertaken to deal with this issue; however, the scientific literature uses widely differing assumptions, meaning that the results cannot be compared. Dasan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2019</xref>) compared different microalgae biofuel systems, i.e. raceway open pond (OP), bubble column photobioreactor (BC-PBR) and tubular photobioreactor (TB-PBR) cultivation systems using LCA and life cycle costing (LCC) considering a cradle-to-gate approach. The Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) for the cultivation and biofuel production was extracted from secondary sources. The results showed that the dehydration and lipid extraction of microalgae biomass required 21–30% and 39–57% of the total energy consumption in the life cycle (Dasan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2019</xref>). Therefore, the source of energy for these stages could have a significant impact on the life cycle environmental impacts of microalgae biofuel production systems. Almost all studies are based on scientific literature data, estimated cultivation and scaled-up lab experiments, with few specific exemptions that offer empirical evidence using data from large-scale, real-world facilities.</p><p id="Par10">In terms of real-world data, Passell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>) performed an LCA based on data from Seambiotic, Inc., in Israel and Solution Recovery Services (SRS) Inc. (now trading as Valicor), based in Dexter, MI, USA. The authors combined data from the two facilities which produce microalgae for commercial purposes. The Seambiotic facility is a kind of carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) facility, as it is co-located with a fossil fuel power station; thus, the CO<sub>2</sub> was treated as burden-free. The microalgae strains produced in the Seambiotic facility are <italic>Nannochloris</italic> sp. and <italic>Nannochloropsis salina</italic>. The facility uses raceways ponds with paddle wheels, producing microalgae biodiesel with a GWP100 climate change impact of 2.88 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/MJ biodiesel, with a future case of 0.18 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/MJ biodiesel. Another work by the University of Texas measured the production of <italic>Chlorella protothecoides</italic> for biofuels (including data on transesterification). The data for this is discussed in Beal et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012a</xref>) and Beal et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2012b</xref>); however, these are focused purely on the energy, not the environmental impacts.</p><p id="Par11">The All-Gas project is another example that published results on a system fed by sewerage (Maga <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>), which followed the same methodology described in Bradley et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>). As detailed in Maga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>), the climate change (GWP100) impacts of 1 MJ of microalgae-derived biogas were 2.08 × 10<sup>−2</sup> kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq, which is the most favourable result in terms of climate change for microalgae biofuels, and compared to the fossil fuel reference considered (i.e. compressed natural gas), it showed a 41% improvement. However, for particulate matter formation, photochemical oxidant formation and terrestrial acidification, the microalgae system performed worse.</p><p id="Par12">Pérez-López et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>) studied the AlgaePARC system at Wageningen UR, comparing different photobioreactor technologies. The technologies considered were Horizontal PBRs (0.56 m<sup>3</sup>), Vertical PBRs (1.06 m<sup>3</sup>) and raceways (4.73 m<sup>3</sup>). Unlike other scientific literature on real-world facilities, their study did not compare microalgae with alternative biofuels or petroleum-derived fuels. Branco-Vieira et al. studied the environmental impacts of a 2.5-hectare facility in Concepción, Chile (Branco-Vieira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020b</xref>). The facility itself was detailed by Branco-Vieira et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2018</xref>), the microalgae species was <italic>Phaeodactylum tricornutum</italic>, and the boundary conditions were cradle-to-gate. The data were taken from a single 0.8 m<sup>3</sup> bubble column photobioreactor on the site (Branco-Vieira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2018</xref>), scaled up using the methodologies from the EnAlgae project (Spruijt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2015</xref>). In terms of climate change, the impacts of microalgae biodiesel was reported as 5.74 kg CO<sub>2</sub>-eq/MJ biodiesel (Branco-Vieira et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020b</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">The EU-funded ABACUS Project, as described by Onorato and Rösch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>), undertook a detailed LCA. Three types of photobioreactors were tested in their study: Flat Panel Airlift (FPA), Unilayer Horizontal Tubular PBR (UHT-PBR) and the Green Wall Panel (GWP). These were tested at real-world facilities, specifically Subitec Gmbh, A4F and Microphyt, respectively. The Subiyrc and A4f data were based on 93 m<sup>3</sup> volume systems, whilst the Green Wall Panel data was based on a small 0.1m<sup>3</sup> system. Dependent on the technology and electricity source, the paper showed climate change impacts varying from 21 to 265 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/kg microalgae. If we consider a value of approximately 38 MJ/kg of microalgae, this gives us a range of 0.55 to 9.6 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/MJ microalgae.</p><p id="Par14">Considering the above research gaps on microalgae biofuel production, the current study assesses the environmental impacts of biofuel production (i.e. biodiesel) from microalgae using a set of primary data (i.e. real-world). It considers the cultivation stage, compares the microalgae production under different energy regimes and compares it to diesel fuel as the fossil counterpart. The novelties of our study are that (a) the work contributes to the slowly growing scientific literature in the field using real-world data for the LCA of microalgae-derived products and (b) the facility under investigation, which mixed autotrophic and heterotrophic growth methods, was unique and thus the performed LCA could be of importance. Considering the fact that biofuel production from algal resources is still in its infancy, studying the supply chain, resource management and process optimisation could significantly help the biofuel industry and specifically microalgal biofuel meet environmental targets. Therefore, the current study also aims at studying the hotspots in biofuel production from microalgae and providing some recommendations for improving the environmental profile of biofuel production from microalgae. Critically to date, whilst there is now a growing body of LCA studies of microalgae-derived fuels based on real-world data, this work is the only LCA of an integrated real-world system of fermenters and photobioreactors. In addition, with 60 m<sup>3</sup> of PBRs and 1 m<sup>3</sup> of fermenter, the data used within this work represents one of the largest industrial systems within the scientific literature from the past 5 years (with the exception of the A4f data within Onorato and Rösch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>)). </p><p id="Par15">The importance of this work is threefold. First, it is amongst a small number of real-world work pieces of research into the LCA of microalgae, not just for biofuels but for a range of other products. Secondly, it adds to the continuing debate over biofuels, which with the current political climate over energy can be reasonably expected to increase in importance. Third, it considers a mixed system of heterotrophic and phototrophic systems, which is seldom considered within the literature.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Life cycle assessment (LCA): goal and scope definition</title><p id="Par16">The current LCA study followed ISO standards for LCA (ISO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">14040</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>; ISO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">14044</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2006</xref>) and aimed to compare the environmental impacts of microalgae biodiesel production under different energy regimes and with petroleum-derived diesel.</p><p id="Par17">The system under study is from the <italic>InteSusAl</italic> (demonstration of integrated and sustainable microalgae cultivation with biodiesel validation) project, in which the consortium designed, built and operated a microalgae production facility at Necton S.A. in Olhão, Portugal.

The reason for mixing heterotrophic and autotrophic systems together was that at the time of the original project conceptualisation, this was considered a possible option to increase production efficiency. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, microalgae is produced heterotrophically within low-cost steel fermenters, feeding the microalgae an optimised concentration of glycerol, yeast extract, di-potassium hydrogen phosphate and trace levels of other chemicals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Tubular photobioreactors (TPBR) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) act as an autotrophic microalgae-based carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) system, utilising the waste CO<sub>2</sub> from the fermenters’ off-gas stream to facilitate the growth of more microalgae. The O<sub>2</sub> produced from photosynthesis within the TPBRs is fed into the fermenters to further enrich the system and promote a higher microalgae growth density. The fermenter and TPBR systems do not mix microalgae but only exchange gases. Finally, microalgae from both systems are harvested and subjected to dewatering and lipid extraction before undergoing a transesterification process, which produces fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) and glycerol. The glycerol is then recycled back into the fermenters within a process supplemented with additional glycerol from industrial sources. It should be noted that the water and nutrients in the harvesting stage are recycled back into the fermenters and TPBRs. There are four core elements to the system: (a) growth, (b) harvesting, (c) biodiesel production and (d) use.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The InteSusAl concept.

Within these scenarios, the models are split into infrastructure and operational impacts.</p><p id="Par30">The current LCA study supports decisions on the micro decision-making level rather than on the macro level, and thus, it adopts an attributional modelling framework (Rajaeifar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2017</xref>). The functional unit was considered as “combustion of 1 MJ (lower heating value) of algal biodiesel in an internal combustion engine (B100)”. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the scope of the present study and its system boundaries. Accordingly, boundary conditions were set to embrace “well-to-wheel”. The top dashed box shows the system boundaries for microalgae biodiesel, which include cultivation, harvesting and lipid extraction, biodiesel production and its combustion. The bottom dashed box shows system boundaries for petroleum diesel which include extraction of crude oil, transportation to refineries, refinery operations and combustion. It should be noted that the transportation of fuels (either biodiesel or diesel) from the facility/refinery to the pump station was not considered in the calculations, as this was considered to be similar in both life cycles. Full descriptions of the logic behind this methodology are available within Bradley et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The scope of the present study and its system boundaries</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11367_2023_2140_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par31">The LCA study is further divided into two main parts, i.e. the infrastructure model, based on considering the environmental and energy impacts from the construction of the facility, and the operational model, which is based on considering the environmental and energy impacts from the operation of the facility. Infrastructure must be considered, as microalgae biofuels require extensive new facilities to be constructed. In contrast, other biofuels can partially utilise existing supply chains and facilities within the agricultural industry, therefore not leading to an immediate additional environmental impact. To ensure the study was comparable with other European Commission funded microalgae projects, a harmonised methodology for LCA of algae biofuels presented by Bradley et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>) was agreed upon between the <italic>InteSusAl</italic>, All-Gas and BIOFAT projects. The only area in which the <italic>InteSusAl</italic> project was unable to follow the principles was with the co-products. It was assumed that co-products would be allocated based on energy content; however, there are various other possibilities for co-products, such as high-value products, as described earlier.</p><p id="Par32">In terms of co-products, the system produces glycerol, which is recycled back and thus accounted for within the analysis. Waste products are produced within the project, and the assumption used is that, as an energy-based facility, these other resources would also be used for energy production, most probably via anaerobic digestion. This moves into the issues of multifunctionality, where the system has created two useful products. Whilst it can be argued there is no correct approach to multifunctionality, we can consider the purpose of the system to guide our decisions. Within this article, an energy-based allocation has been chosen. It is important to note that the energy density of the waste materials and the lipids are similar, and hence, a mass-based allocation would provide similar results.</p><p id="Par33">The software used was Thinkstep GaBi 6.2, and the primary database used was the Ecoinvent 3.2 Cut-Off System Model (Wernet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2016</xref>). However, a small number of non-Ecoinvent processes were adopted when appropriate Ecoinvent data were not found (see further information in Sect. <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">2.2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Life cycle inventory</title><p id="Par34">The foreground data for this article was provided by the <italic>InteSusAl</italic> project, part-funded under the European Union Framework Programme 7. Additional data was provided within the project by CPI, who ran a fermenter system in Teesside, UK. As the fermenter is a closed, controlled environment, the actual location should not impact the operation. CPI produced data on lipid extraction. Since the facility itself did not convert the extracted lipids into biodiesel, the LCI data for the transesterification and use phases, data was converted from the Ecoinvent database and US Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) Database (National Renewable Energy Laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>). This data is listed in the supplementary materials Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>. It should be noted that the Ecoinvent models used were “Allocation, cut-off by classification”, based on the “recycled content” or “cut off” approach.

The system is comprised of four TPBR systems, each with a 15,000 L capacity (total capacity of 60,000 L). Three 1000 L fermenters were operated in Portugal, with a fourth 1000 L fermenter running in Wilton, UK.

During these trials, the required chemicals, energy use and microalgae volume produced were measured. The CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> gas exchange system, water recycling and glycerol recycling systems were not implemented. Thus, the LCA models do not include the processes of CO<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> gas exchange or water recycling. It is important to note that as the trials ran from 2015-2016, whilst the analysis is based on real data, productivities of facilities (including the Necton.

This esterification process is required to eliminate the free fatty acid within the algae oil (Petchsoongsakul et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2017</xref>). An examination of esterification models within Ecoinvent for a number of feedstocks showed the impacts of this stage to be negligible compared with the growth and harvesting stages, and therefore the process was eliminated from the model.

The logic for the use of this proxy was based on comparing information from Bellussi et al.

The reason for focussing on this, rather than using a Portuguese electricity mix (which is more realistic for the facility) is that to use a country specific model would essentially make this article into a proxy for comparing electricity grid mixes and would also mean that the models could not be compared with other Algae Cluster work.</p><p id="Par41">The electricity model for scenario A was the electricity mix for 2012. Whilst it may seem strange to use such an old electricity mix, there are two reasons for this. For All-Gas, InteSusAl and BioFAT, it was extremely important that the three projects were comparable, hence, the electricity mix available when all three projects commenced was used. The means that the work undertaken within the All-Gas and BIOFAT EU microalgae projects may be compared with this work if somebody is undertaking a meta-analysis of real facilities in the future. Additionally, the few papers which consider real-world data within algae facilities range from 2013 to 2020; therefore, by giving such a wide range of electricity values, these results can be considered in terms of the other scientific literature (although we accept that methodological differences would make such a comparison unwise and purely indicative). The 2012 electricity mix is based on the EU-27 grid mix from the GaBi Professional 2016 edition 3 database. Secondly, showing the impacts of electricity in 2012 and 2020 shows how dependent the emissions of the facility are due to electricity, and not purely due to the processes of the facility.</p><p id="Par42">As the modelling work within InteSusAl and All-Gas was undertaken prior to 2020, a hypothetical electricity grid mix was created. The EU-27 + UK 2020 grid mix model for scenario (B) was based on the data from National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) (Beurskens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2013</xref>; Beurskens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>) for each EU country as well as their nuclear programmes. There were two sets of NREAP data used: the data for the EU-27 + UK in 2010 and their targets for 2020. The model began with the individual 2010 EU-27 country electricity mixes from the Thinkstep Professional Database. The grid mix within this database is divided into several categories of the generation source. These were aligned with NREAP 2010 categories for electricity mix. Most of these align well. For some, the NREAP categories were condensed as follows (numbers in bracket shows the specific NREAP category number):<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par43">“(07) [%] percentage power from biomass (solid)” covered both “Solid biomass” and “Bioliquids”</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par44">“(10) [%] percentage power from hydro power” covered “Hydropower &lt; 1 MW”, “Hydropower 1 MW—10 MW”, and “Hydropower &gt; 10 MW”</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">“(11) [%] percentage power from wind power” used “Onshore wind” and “Offshore wind”</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par46">There is no concentrated solar power model within the Thinkstep Professional database or the Ecoinvent database. Therefore, a worst-case assumption was taken, and “(12) [%] percentage power from photovoltaics” was used.</p><p id="Par47">With these assumptions, the NREAP 2010 data was mapped to the Thinkstep Professional Database for individual EU-27 country grid mixes. These mostly agreed with the Thinkstep Database models. With the 2010 data mapped, the 2020 NREAP data was then mapped onto the modified Thinkstep grid mixes, taking into account the impacts of energy efficiency measures reported in the NREAP, as a percentage of total consumption. Following this, the nuclear plant capacities were also mapped. The percentage increase or decrease in renewable and nuclear generation was calculated and mapped onto the remaining fossil generation, reducing or increasing the fossil generation balance with the expected demand, to take account of the renewable/nuclear generation increase or decrease. Finally, countries that export power (France and Sweden) due to their renewable and nuclear targets being greater than their electricity demand were given credits according to the mean mix of the rest of the EU-27 + UK. Using these new grid mixes, each country’s total expected energy production was used to create a mean energy mix per kWh for the whole of the EU-27 + UK.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>PV model (scenario C)</title><p id="Par48">The PV LCA model used a PV Syst-based model for a 227 kWp rated solar farm based at the Necton site in Olhão, which would produce 409 MWh in the first year of operation. This model was based on a system with 880 “Q.PRO-G3 260” polycrystalline silicon photovoltaic modules (produced by Hanwha Q Cells) with 10 “Conext CL 20000E” inverters (produced by Schneider Electric). Using this information, an LCA model was created within GaBi by modifying existing Ecoinvent models for photovoltaic systems in Portugal. This model showed the GWP100 impact of electricity produced by photovoltaics in Olhão to be 0.05 kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh, as opposed to the EU-27 grid average electricity (2012), which emitted 0.5 kgCO<sub>2eq</sub>/kWh. This means electricity from photovoltaics had a climate change impact of only 10% of that of grid electricity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) and energy analysis</title><p id="Par49">In this LCA study, ReCiPe (Goedkoop et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2009</xref>) and IPCC AR5 (GWP100 and GWP20) (Tredici et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2015</xref>) were implemented to assess the life cycle environmental impacts. The latter were used due to the importance of climate change impacts in biofuel life cycles and could give the opportunity for a detailed analysis of the climate change impact category under different characterisation factors (CFs) and time horizons. In addition to the Algae Cluster agreed impact categories (Bradley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>), the Global Temperature Potential (GTP) for 20, 50 and 100 years was also considered. The AR5 impact categories database within GaBi was compiled by the authors and Thinkstep (now part of Sphera Solutions). As described earlier, the model used data from some GaBi Professional-based data, which did not contain data on agricultural or urban land use. Therefore, this was not included within the impact categories.</p><p id="Par50">Energy analysis, which is considered important for microalgae biofuels, is usually performed by calculating the net energy ratio (NER) (Passell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>). NER is defined as the sum of the direct energy consumed through the production of a fuel, divided by the energy content of the produced fuel (lower heating value, LHV) (Rajaeifar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2013</xref>). In the case of this study, the direct energy used consists of the measured energy used for cultivation and harvesting and the energy for the hypothetical extraction and transesterification. The output was considered as microalgae biodiesel with an energy content of 38 MJ/kg (Delrue et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sensitivity and uncertainty</title><p id="Par51">A sensitivity analysis was undertaken for the operational model, varying input variables within the cultivation, harvesting and processing phases by 5%. This enabled the major sources of impacts to be clearly identified and also understood, for which input uncertainty would have the greatest impact on the end results. The uncertainty was undertaken using the existing sensitivity tools within GaBi.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2013</xref>) itself, there was a &lt; 4% difference per impact category. The only exception was water depletion. Further investigations of the water data showed issues with the way with which this particular version of GaBi accounted for water. Thinkstep was alerted, and this issue is resolved in future versions of GaBi.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Results and discussions</title><p id="Par53">The current LCA was performed to compare microalgae biodiesel production under different energy regimes and conventional petroleum-derived diesel fuel. To ensure the assessments between all the three Algae Cluster projects were comparable, a harmonised methodology was defined in Bradley et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>) and was briefly presented in Sect. <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">2</xref>. Also, the LCA results fell into two main parts: the infrastructure model, based on the construction of the facility, and the operational model, which is based on the operation of the facility.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Infrastructure model</title><p id="Par54">Detailed information was provided from the Necton and CPI sites on the construction of the facilities and equipment (see supplementary materials, Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S12</xref>). This information was then converted into LCA models. Information on end-of-life (EoL), where appropriate Ecoinvent models did not exist, was gathered from a range of sources. Specifically, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) recycling was based on Franklin Associates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>); poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) recycling was based on standard industry practices, and data within the Advanced THermal Analysis laboratory (ATHAS) (Wunderlich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">1995</xref>); polypropylene (PP) data was from Hardwick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2015</xref>); and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) data was gathered from Stichnothe and Azapagic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par55">The top five sources of AR5 GWP100 impacts were polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), concrete, fibreglass-reinforced plastic (FRP), aluminium and stainless steel. In terms of climate change, the timescale considered is important; for example, over a 100-year period, concrete is the third largest impact (14.4% of the GWP100 impact), whereas over 20 years, the third-largest impact is that of FRP (13.7%) whilst concrete is 11.9% of the GWP20 impact.

Scenarios A and B cover the European grid average, whilst C is an LCA model of a hypothetical solar farm designed for Olhão using the solar farm design software PVSyst (PVSyst <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2020</xref>). The underlying assumptions for these models are detailed in Sect. <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">2</xref>. The results of the three scenarios compared with petroleum-derived diesel fuel are given in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, with the figures presented as percentages within the supplementary materials in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S13</xref>.</p><p id="Par57">The results proved that within scenarios A and B, the primary source of impacts for microalgae production was electricity generation. The use of photovoltaics -as also recommended in Taylor et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2013</xref>) and Tredici (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2010</xref>) decreases the non-infrastructure GWP100 impacts by 58.1% compared with scenario A, so that they were 87.8% of those petroleum-derived diesel impacts; however, the photovoltaics still contributed to all midpoint and endpoint impacts, due to the necessary construction of the PV arrays. It should be noted that the construction of PV has been included in the non-infrastructure model, as infrastructure is included in the grid electricity models.</p><p id="Par58">When considering climate change impacts, the impacts increased with the smaller timescale are considered (e.g., higher impacts for GWP20 compared with GWP100). This is due to the different global warming impact of the methane produced within a 100-year period. Most of the methane produced in the life cycle of microalgae biodiesel comes from the energy generation for both the operation of the facility in Olhão itself and for the production of the yeast. Due to its short lifetime in the atmosphere (12.4 years) (Myhre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2013</xref>), biogenic methane has an impact of 84 times that of CO<sub>2</sub> over 20 years, reducing to 28 times over 100 years. This highlights the question of whether short- or long-term timescales should be considered for climate change-based decision-making and their balance (Cooper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>; Pierrehumbert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2014</xref>; Shoemaker and Schrag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2013</xref>). A full breakdown of the contributors to GWP100 and GWP20 is given in the supplementary materials (Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S14</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S15</xref>), as produced using GaBi. It is important to note that the AR5 values were used within this study, as this work was undertaken before the 2021 AR6 figures were published. </p><p id="Par59">Global Temperature Potential (GTP) was also considered in this study. Unlike GWP, this metric accounts for the impact of the temperature of the planet normalised against CO<sub>2</sub> (Cherubini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>) rather than changes in levels of radiative forcing. For scenario C’s operational emission, the GTP varied from 7.02 × 10<sup>−2</sup> (GTP 100-year) to 7.32 × 10<sup>−2</sup> (GTP 50-year) and 8.91 × 10<sup>−2</sup> (GTP 20 year), implying 26.9% reduction from GTP-100 to 20. Less detailed figures for the operational impacts, including GWP10, GWP50 and GTP 10, are presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> (more information could be found in supplementary materials, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S16</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>GWP (<bold>a</bold>) and GTP (<bold>b</bold>) of scenario C.

When simplifying the complexity of climate change for policymakers, it is understandable that GWP100 is used; however, the reality is more complex; hence for decisions around strategic investment into new technologies, a range of methods should be considered. Also, there are further areas to consider, such as the interaction of chemicals (for example, methane and aerosols) (Drew et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2009</xref>) and the cumulative impacts of GHGs on the climatic system (Cherubini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>), which are not counted within LCA. Data for all GHGs considered are provided in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S17</xref> to allow the reader to employ their own climate change CFs.</p><p id="Par61">Of concern for all scenarios are the areas which show increased impacts when compared with petroleum-derived diesel, which, when including infrastructure, is all of them. For example, even without infrastructure, water depletion [m<sup>3</sup>] for PV-powered microalgae biodiesel was 2350% greater than petroleum diesel. Using PV reduced 12 mid-point impact categories, whilst others such as ecotoxicity, toxicity, eutrophication, metal depletion and ozone depletion were increased. It is noted that scenario C doubles ozone depletion from the operation. Within the Ecoinvent data used, the ozone depletion impact from PV was found to be from tetrafluoroethylene use in cell manufacturing. However, the PV models within another LCA database, Thinkstep Professional, show no tetrafluoroethylene use. As this is a major impact on the models, further investigation is necessary, and further evidence from real industrial data is required.</p><p id="Par62">The model itself was divided into four main stages: (a) growth, (b) harvesting, (c) biodiesel production and (d) Use. The LCI was divided into these parts, ensuring that the GaBi models would divide the impacts.</p><p id="Par63">The cultivation phase created a significantly greater climate change contribution and Ecotoxicity impact, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>. A larger set of impacts are detailed in the supplementary materials, Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S18</xref>.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison of impacts in the four main phases of microalgae biofuel production and use.

If PV-derived electricity is used (scenario C), this reduces this source to the second-largest (or joint first source of impacts), with the major or joint source the production of yeast extract for the fermenters (except in the case of terrestrial ecotoxicity and metal depletion where electricity has still the most significant impact). After these two impact sources, other contributors to impacts were freshwater and potassium pyrophosphate. Concerning AR5 GWP100 impacts, yeast was responsible for 68.2%, PV electricity 15.7%, potassium pyrophosphate 8.9% and freshwater 2.7%.</p><p id="Par65">In all the impacts considered, these were the most relevant inputs, with methanol, phosphoric acid, sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid each minor contributor to most impacts. Natural gas and organic solvents used in the transesterification process yielded minor contributions to ozone depletion (full data in supplementary materials, Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S16</xref> and S19 to S21 for scenario C). From this, it shows that engineers need to optimise the production systems and have a greater understanding of the impacts of feedstocks (particularly yeast extract if used). For example, could a microalgae biofuel facility use more sustainable yeast extract (potentially co-located on-site) and produced using electricity from renewable energy? In this case, the analysis performed during the course of this study showed that a further reduction of operational GWP100 could be achieved. By taking a critical eye and perhaps direct involvement in the production of the chemical feedstocks for microalgae biofuels, the industry can reduce impacts. For small systems, this is impractical, but for the 10–100 hectares of bio-refineries considered by industry in the near future, this could well be a viable option. Of course, yeast itself can produce a wide range of lipids (Parsons et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2018</xref>), so one could question the very logic of using yeast as a feedstock instead of using the yeast directly. This question requires a comparative analysis of fuel from algae and further work to answer that question.</p><p id="Par66">It is important to note that the current LCA is based on the assumption that the glycerol fed to the fermenters (in addition to the internally recycled glycerol) is industrial waste. Using fresh glycerol will give very different results, which would not be favourable for microalgae biofuels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Net energy ratio (NER)</title><p id="Par67">If the energy content of the co-products is taken into account, the NER would reach 0.99, i.e. 0.99 MJ of electricity/gas was used for 1 MJ of biodiesel produced; however, if the energy through the whole value chain, including the feedstock chemical production, is considered, then the NER is calculated as 1.03. These are not ideal results but should be viewed in comparison with other technologies. Work by Brandt et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>) shows that the NER can vary dramatically per oil field (in terms of crude oil, not diesel) from 0.5 to 0.01, dependent on location and technology. In terms of actual petroleum diesel, the average NER for US petroleum diesel is 1.20, although, with the increasing use of oil shale and tar sands, this has increased within the USA to 1.65 (Shirvani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2011</xref>). This shows the InteSusAl system NER is comparable with other poorly performing fossil fuel extraction/production methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Sensitivity and uncertainty</title><p id="Par68">The sensitivity analysis results are given for all three scenarios within the supplementary materials, Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S22</xref> to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S27</xref>. This shows a similar pattern to the results previously given, with the system most sensitive to electricity and yeast extract. For scenario A, an increase of 5% in the electricity use would result in an increase of 3.2% of the GWP100. An increase of 5% of the yeast input would result in a 1.45% increase in AR5 GWP100. Within scenario C, the yeast input becomes the dominant factor; taking the example of AR5 GWP100 again, yeast will vary the final result by 3.42% if it is varied by 5%. In contrast, electricity will only cause a 0.77% change in the final result.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Implications of the system modelling</title><p id="Par69">Clearly, both the operational and infrastructure impacts must be combined when compared with fossil fuels. In terms of InteSusAl, the infrastructure impacts will be larger than an established biorefinery which is optimally set out. To merge data, the impacts of the infrastructure were equally distributed, assuming 38 MJ energy content for microalgae biodiesel, 15.27 tonnes hectare<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> production of microalgae and 20 years lifetime. The 15.27 tonnes hectare<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> production was based on the extrapolated productivity from the photobioreactor and fermenter trials. This showed, for all scenarios, that microalgae biofuels do not compare well with fossil fuels in such a production quantity. If the productivity of &gt; 25.6 tonnes hectare<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> was achieved, which is a reasonable level, then a PV-powered system (scenario C) would be on a par with fossil fuels in terms of climate change (GWP100). A productivity of 31.4 tonnes hectare<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> would lead to equivalence in terms of ozone depletion, but 313.2 tonnes hectare<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> would be needed for equivalence with petroleum diesel in terms of eutrophication. This shows that the InteSusAl system is within reach of petroleum diesel in some areas of environmental impacts, such as ozone depletion, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and climate change, but not the majority of others especially impacts such as freshwater ecotoxicity, freshwater eutrophication, various types of depletion and land use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Comparisons with other works</title><p id="Par70">A comparison with other work, as previously mentioned, is difficult without a meta-analysis due to different methodological choices. In terms of Maga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>) (All-Gas project), they performed analyses mostly followed Bradley et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>), as does this article, although there are some divergences. Comparing these two similar studies (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), it shows that in terms of AR5 GWP100 climate change impacts, microalgae-derived biogas has much lower impacts than microalgae-derived biodiesel from the InteSusAl system. However, due to various emissions from the All-Gas water treatment works, in terms of other impact categories considered, the InteSusAl and All-Gas facilities are comparable in impacts per MJ of fuel. It is important to note that the sewerage system included clean water as a co-product. <table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison of impacts between this article (Scenario A) and Maga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>) (All-Gas project)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2"><p><bold>Impact category</bold></p></th><th align="left" colspan="3"><p><bold>MJ of algae fuel</bold></p></th></tr><tr><th align="left"><p><bold>This article, biodiesel, (A) 2012 EU grid</bold></p></th><th align="left"><p><bold>Biogas,</bold><bold>(Maga</bold><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref><bold>)</bold></p></th><th align="left"><p><bold>Percentage difference</bold></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>AR5 Climate change, excl biogenic, GWP100 [kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq]</p></td><td align="left"><p>2.56×10<sup>−1</sup></p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>2.08×10<sup>−2</sup></p></td><td align="left"><p>1231%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Fossil depletion [kg oil eq]</p></td><td align="left"><p>6.92×10<sup>−2</sup></p></td><td char="." align="char"><p> − 1.32×10<sup>−2</sup></p></td><td align="left"><p>negative</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Freshwater eutrophication [kg P eq]</p></td><td align="left"><p>2.37×10<sup>−5</sup></p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>1.96×10<sup>−5</sup></p></td><td align="left"><p>121%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Marine eutrophication [kg N eq]</p></td><td align="left"><p>9.49×10<sup>−5</sup></p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>4.91×10<sup>−4</sup></p></td><td align="left"><p>19%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Ozone depletion [kg CFC-11 eq]</p></td><td align="left"><p>3.16×10<sup>−8</sup></p></td><td char="." align="char"><p> − 1.90×10<sup>−8</sup></p></td><td align="left"><p>negative</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Particulate matter formation [kg PM10 eq]</p></td><td align="left"><p>4.66×10<sup>−4</sup></p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>5.26×10<sup>−4</sup></p></td><td align="left"><p>89%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Photochemical oxidant formation [kg NMVOC]</p></td><td align="left"><p>7.03×10<sup>−4</sup></p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>5.71×10<sup>−4</sup></p></td><td align="left"><p>123%</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Terrestrial acidification [kg SO2 eq]</p></td><td align="left"><p>1.10×10<sup>−3</sup></p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>3.74×10<sup>−3</sup></p></td><td align="left"><p>29%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par71">This shows the complexity in terms of comparing systems, as whilst climate change favours the system within Maga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>), marine eutrophication and terrestrial acidification favour the InteSusAl system.

Human toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine ecotoxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity are all comparable with this article’s results, although it is important to note that with the cut off at 1 kg of algae, there are the energy requirements of drying and transesterification to also include, although as shown in, this was comparatively a small element. Interestingly, extremely low impacts for ozone depletion, terrestrial ecotoxicity and photochemical oxidant formation (Pérez-López et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>) compared with this work.

Maga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>) does not dry the biomass, as it is moved towards anaerobic digestion for the production of biogas. In terms of the downstream technologies applied; the majority of current work which includes the fuel production uses transesterification, although Liu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>) use hydrothermal liquefaction and Maga (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>) uses anaerobic digestion. Ultimately, comparisons with previous work show that the differences in technology, assumptions and methodological choices require a complete in-depth analysis as a separate article.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par75">The major limitation of this work is the age of the data, which was from a project which ran from 2010 to 2015. Since then, there have been substantial changes in the industry, including the facilities which exist at Necton. One noticeable change is that Necton has constructed a photovoltaic system at their facility to supply energy and hence reduce the environmental impacts of their production. In terms of advantages, this paper does contain primary pilot-scale data, which facilitates a realistic view of microalgae production.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>High value product</title><p id="Par76">Algae contain many different types of high-value products (such as β-carotene, astaxanthin, fucoxanthin and β-glucans). The production of these can be considered to be “Conventionally Supplementary Systems”, as described by Kiatkittipong et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>). The process of extracting the lipids will effectively waste some high-value products, whilst the waste can be expected to be a mixture of unextracted lipids, polysaccharides or fibre, some proteins and minerals. Changes could be made to the downstream processes to extract further high-value products at the cost of producing less biodiesel. If the extraction of high-value products leads to low enough impacts compared with current industrial processes, then this may reduce the impacts of the whole system to the point where environmentally microalgae-derived biodiesel is competitive with petroleum-derived diesel. However, this is an open question which requires further investigation. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of high-value products could lead to the conclusion that microalgae should not be used as a feedstock for fuels. This current article does not contain enough data to draw a conclusion on this question.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par77">This life cycle assessment study demonstrates the impacts of a functioning case study microalgae production facility, which used a mixture of heterotrophic and autotrophic growth systems to generate microalgae for biodiesel production.</p><p id="Par78">In terms of the energy used by the system, a net energy ratio of ~ 1 is found. This shows the facility’s net energy ratio was similar to poorly performing oil fields. Nevertheless, since these results are for a small pilot site, they are encouraging.</p><p id="Par79">The assessment shows that, when infrastructure is included, microalgae-derived biofuels are not yet favourable over petroleum-derived fuels in terms of climate change impacts over 100 years, but this becomes worse over shorter timescales. For Fifth Assessment Report based Global Warming Potentials over 100 years, the scenarios range from 2.56 × 10<sup>−1</sup> kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/MJ (scenario A, 2012 electricity grid mix) 2.38 × 10<sup>−1</sup> kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/MJ (scenario B, 2020 electricity grid mix) and 1.48 × 10<sup>−1</sup> kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/MJ (scenario C, photovoltaic electricity). These compare with petroleum-derived diesel, with an impact of 8.84 × 10<sup>−2</sup> kg CO<sub>2</sub>eq/MJ. Additionally, when considering infrastructure, for all other environmental impacts, further improvements are necessary. For example, for scenario B, the impacts of freshwater ecotoxicity for microalgae-derived biodiesel were 1320% times that of petroleum-derived diesel. For freshwater eutrophication, the value was 1610% that is highly concerning. If these issues are shown to be common within algae facilities, then a serious rethink must be made on microalgae-derived fuels.</p><p id="Par80">In terms of relevance to industries, this work shows how the specific systems studied within this work do not have a future as biofuel production systems. Instead, other high-value products should be considered, although to understand which one is appropriate, there will be a necessity of associated LCA and techno-economic analyses.</p><p id="Par81">In terms of recommendations, aside from moving from biofuel to other products and ensuring that low carbon energy is used, the productivity of systems needs to be significantly improved to lower the impacts of microalgae production. As also stated previously, there needs to be careful consideration of the feedstocks used, to ensure that they also have as low impacts as possible.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This study was performed as part of the InteSusAl project, which received funding from the European Union’s Seventh Programme for research, technological development and demonstration (Grant Agreement 268164).
