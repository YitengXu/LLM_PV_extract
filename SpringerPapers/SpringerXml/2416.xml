</title><p id="Par1">Chronic hunger and malnutrition will eventually result from the population’s rapid growth. It is unlikely to succeed in tackling the rising challenges of delivering sustainable food for all people unless high attention is paid on the function of food processing to ensure the supply of stable food. It is impossible to overstate the importance of developing food processing and preservation technologies that can reduce food losses and wastage during surplus seasons. Therefore, sustainable food systems must be developed to provide healthy diets without damaging our world and its resources. The goal is to use various perspectives to confirm why food processing is crucial to future food supply. It is important to show the appropriate utilization of sustainability factors and effect assessments to construct for feeding the globe while staying within planetary limits. There has never been a better time to assure a plentiful food supply to feed the people than right now, when the population is expanding at a worrying rate. The sustainable food project seeks to move the food systems in a long-term, more equitable direction. Food processing, or the conversion of raw materials into functional, edible, and consumer acceptable food, is a critical link in the food value chain between consumption and production. This review looked at various existing and emerging food processing followed by preservation techniques. Food systems must also attempt to reduce food waste and losses, as well as the current and future impacts on the environment and society, to be sustainable.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sustainable food supply</kwd><kwd>Food chain</kwd><kwd>Nutrition</kwd><kwd>Food processing</kwd><kwd>Preservation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>21</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/43615_2022_Article_248.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Sustainable Development</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering Economics, Organization, Logistics, Marketing</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Waste Management/Waste Technology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Economics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Applied Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Earth and Environmental Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="CopyrightComment" specific-use="RightsRetention"><title>Copyright comment</title><p>Springer Nature or its licensor (e.g. a society or other partner) holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s); author self-archiving of the accepted manuscript version of this article is solely governed by the terms of such publishing agreement and applicable law.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction
</title><p id="Par2">The world around us is evolving at a dizzying speed. In this context of elaborating food consumption by an increasing population and changing dietary preferences, the global food system faces huge problems. A major problem is how to achieve expanding food requirements and provide nutritious foods to everyone for years to arrive without exhausting Earth’s resources or breaching planetary limitations, which could disturb humanity’s prospects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Governments all across the globe dare to change our food management, but doing so will necessitate coherent, coordinated, and emerged action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Food affects many aspects of our existence, with our health (nutrition), economy (employment), society (culture), and the environment. However, all rules that govern such fields are still formulated and executed in isolation. Government officials may share information about ongoing projects and, on occasion, create policies with joint goals. Rarely, however, will policies be emerged so that it is evident how every policy contributes to a larger goal, such as achieving sustainable food processing systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">The emphasis is increasingly on approaching sustainable diets with low environmental effects and boosting population well-being today and in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. All components of the food supply pattern, starting from production to processing, packaging, and the storage with final delivery of food items to consumer should be considered by the food industry to make proficient use of available resources in every stage to provide nutritious nourishment for all time growing society with numerous variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Various preservation techniques are frequently used in food industries (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A variety of new farming and as well as processing methods with little negative effects on the environment can be applied in cities’ controlled indoor environments. Techniques like hydroponics—where plants are grown in nutrient-rich solutions—aquaponics—where water and fish waste are used—and aeroponics—where nutrient-rich water is sprayed onto roots suspended in the air—are all promising. For instance, in New York and Chicago, hydroponic greenhouses on the rooftops of several buildings now produce fresh greens with reduced transit and storage distances for the local markets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> depicts the elements of sustainable food systems.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Frequently used food preservation techniques</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>S.

Many good things have come out of the advancements in food systems, particularly over the past three decades in developing nations. As the food industry has grown, these outcomes have included the increase of off-farm employment prospects as well as the expansion of food options beyond regional staples, satisfying customers’ preferences for taste, form, and quality. Therefore, it is essential to have a better understanding of the workings of a variety of food systems to ensure that they evolve in a way that minimizes their negative effects and optimizes their good contributions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Implementation Methods for the Waste to Energy Supply Chain</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Various Obstacle to Be Overcome</title><p id="Par5">When implementing the WTE supply chain, obstacles from the areas of technology, finance, institution, and regulation may be encountered. These hurdles are difficult to distinguish from one another since policy instruments sometimes address multiple barriers at once. This is particularly true for institutional and financial obstacles because of how frequently they are linked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Technology barriers, particularly in the individual plants or district energy industries, take the form of selecting the most eco-friendly and efficient type of technology, whereas financial barriers occasionally take the form of erroneous electricity prices, expensive grid interconnection fees, and high capital startup costs and the trained labors play important role in setting up. The major obstacles of developing effective policies and allocating government authority include the national vision (policy), aim (strategy), objective (program), target (project), and indicator (plan) being unclear. The usage of the best technology should always be emphasized by policymakers in order to assure environmental safety and facility effectiveness and effciency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Economical Raise Policies</title><p id="Par6">The main strategy put forth by GGND is to implement a “feed-in tariffs” (FITs) program to provide international price supports in order to boost the supply of renewable energy while lowering its cost. Utilities are compelled by a national FIT to purchase renewable energy at a fixed price above market rates. It forces electric providers to pay more for renewable energy for a set amount of time in a neighboring service region. More than 14% of Germany’s electricity now comes from renewable sources, making it one of the nations with the best success in implementing FITs globally. Spreading the cost of power grid connectivity and metering among all electricity users and gradually lowering the rate over time, a FIT pays these costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Government Accountability and the Policy Formulation</title><p id="Par7">The issues that are unique to the field for which guidelines are being written must be known by policymakers. It is crucial to understand that the energy demands, local environments, local economies, and environmental protection regulations of various towns around the world will vary. To ensure compatibility and project viability, it is crucial to implement the proper policy measures. Sometimes, a policy only needs to remove a few small local obstacles rather than implementing significant, domineering financial structures. For instance, a successful strategic decision-making process for the WTE supply chain should consider the following: (1) supply and demand contracts; (2) network configuration, such as sourcing, location and capacity of energy production facilities; (3) assuring sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Different Types of Processing Methods</title><p id="Par8">Numerous methods have been employed in the food processing industries; however, the researcher is working on developing new processing methods that will minimize the nutritional loss during processing and production costs and should be user-friendly to operate. Nowadays, there are different types of processing techniques but researchers divided the processing techniques into two categories thermal and non-thermal processing methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, in non-thermal processing, there is no external heat provided in the processing system. Thermal processing procedures entail the inclusion of external heat in the processing system. Traditionally thermal processing methods are broadly employed in the food processing sector but as they are consuming high energy and decrease the nutritional, sensorial, and photochemical content, especially those that are heat-sensitive, make the shift towards nonthermal processing methods. Minimal processed and fewer additives mixed food treated with non-thermal processing has gained the interest of the consumer because of their enhanced quality with health beneficial properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Some of the novel processing methods that are employed in food industries for the processing of various food constituents involve high-pressure processing, high-pressure carbon dioxide, high hydrostatic processing, ionizing, microwave, ultraviolet, magnetic field, pulsed electric field, ultrasonic, high electric discharge, etc. are employed widely for the processing of various food products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These novel processing methods are creating a huge demand with increases the chances of product innovation for better product quality and leads to develop more consumer-oriented food products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In food processing, the researcher is working on the development of new techniques that are known for higher efficiency in terms of product processing, productivity, quality, safety, shelf life, and healthier diverse food products that will surely benefit a healthier food system and have sustainability too for the uncontrolled growth of populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The safety of food products with high production while processing, however, is a major worry, and in recent decades, advancements in the food processing procedures have been documented that exhibit superior quality without affecting the phytochemicals in comparison to the traditional processing. The major challenge for a healthier food system is the unpredicted growth of populations, globalization, and other factors like the environment, user-friendly techniques with matched consumer specification has to be taken care of while processing the food products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, many thermal techniques were reported that are used for the processing of various food products but the continuous improvement has been done to them so that they can achieve maximum efficiency in delivering the food product with better quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, apart from the nutritional, phytochemical processing, and product quality, there are other factors like food laws, market influence, and technological and commerciality of the techniques, and the product related to the specific technique is very important while adopting the processing techniques in the food industries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Many techniques are used in food processing industries but the most current and updated techniques which are mainly employed in the food processing industries were mentioned below.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Novel processing methods employed in the food industry (Barbhuiya et al., 2021)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43615_2022_248_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Novel Thermal Processing Methods</title><p id="Par9">One of the novel approaches to preserve food is heat or thermal treatment. A previous investigation also revealed 5 different varieties of rice that, when subjected to hydrothermal treatment, produced outcomes comparable to market rice grade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Food heating reduces the presence of pathogens. Significant research has discovered nutrient losses, energy waste, flavor changes, and food matrix damage, though. Researchers found post-treatment variations in the physico-chemical characteristics, antioxidant activity, and nutritional differences between light and dark honey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Some novel techniques are explained below.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Radiofrequency Heating Processing</title><p id="Par10">Radiofrequency heating is a novel thermal processing technique, also known as dielectric heating. In this technique, a radio frequency generator plays a crucial role by generating the alternating electric field to heat the dielectric materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The dielectric energy causes the vibration in the water molecules which is present in the sample, and this vibration produces the heat inside the sample causing to inactive the microorganism and enhanced the shelf life of the sample. The dielectric field of the food samples is depending upon many factors like moisture content, viscosity, soluble solids, phytochemical composition, pH, and other factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This processing technique is used in the industries but in batch processes, not in the continuous process but still, a researcher reported that this technique is one of the best and most promising future in the food applications like baking, cereal processing, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Radio frequency functioning between two electrodes is represented schematically in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic representation of radio frequency heating</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43615_2022_248_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Microwave Heating Processing</title><p id="Par11">Microwave heating is the thermal processing technique, which uses electromagnetic radiation in the range of 1–100 GHz for the heating of food samples. This technique gains popularity because of its high efficiency in achieving heating rates in a short time, uniform heating, and low maintenance with safe handling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In microwave heating, the electromagnetic wave will oscillate in the most effective frequency range of 0.915 and 0.245 GHz, and absorption of energy is dependent upon the dielectric and magnetic properties of food materials. In industries, microwave heating is broadly employed in numerous food applications because it is a user-friendly technique, rapid and uniform energy transfer, safe, and economical with good productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Understanding purchasing trends, societal conventions, behavior, and lifestyles require a multidisciplinary approach. This strategy will assist in the modification of appropriate transformations to reduce waste, ecological footprints, and carbon emissions to construct food ecosystems for long-term urbanization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. More emphasis is needed on the preparation of business models that use an interdisciplinary approach to construct plausible business arguments for a wide range of stakeholders, while there is widespread agreement on the significance of employing approaches to improve closed-loop system to build circular biological economy, adoption, and realization of opportunities at reduced speed. Microorganism–host (human, plant, animal) interactions, along with food–microbiome–human interrelations, will be crucial to future resource-efficient food processing. Edible microbial biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], culture and enzymes techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], and the utilization of fermentation methods to minimize toxins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] are all its examples. Processed foods must contribute to nutrition and health in a scientifically supported way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Such multidisciplinary talks and activities have been attempted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Food scientists and nutrition scientists must collaborate and communicate more effectively. Integration of food value chain, which will need concerted interdisciplinary operations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>], is a huge issue, particularly shifting from “precision” agriculture to “precision” food waste and water management to establish sustainable and responsible food chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Future Perspectives</title><p id="Par36">The development of efficient processes that use less energy and resources, as well as a decline in the material and energy content of goods and packaging, defines the industrial economy of the twenty-first century. Although nearly all of this is being driven by economics, corporations are naturally publicizing their successes in this field given the growing consumer (and subsequently governmental and media) interest in sustainability. Retailers are forcing their suppliers to submit details of different characteristics that relate to consumer expectations for more sustainable and ecologically friendly products and packaging. The metrics used to evaluate the sustainability of packaging will be improved and, ideally, included into an international standard as this trend continues. To ensure that the policies governments and socially conscious firms implement actually do result in a more sustainable society with the fewest possible unintended consequences, much more research is still needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec34" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par37">Contrarily, a complex-multiface issue like sustainable food systems is unlikely to be resolved in many other nations due to inadequate budgetary funding or the lack of an integrated plan. According to the data, the plans that addressed sustainability received the least funding, and several significant restrictions on food consumption made no mention of environmental sustainability. The results point to a technique that can aid in the integration of sustainability throughout the whole food supply chain by policymakers. This does not imply a preference for a single sustainable diet, one sustainable farming method, or one model of sustainable food systems in a nation as diverse as India in terms of geographical and sociocultural variety. With only 10 years to complete the sustainable development goals, policymakers, researchers, and practitioners are examining how food management systems might be strengthened and beneficial for the long-term wellbeing of people and planets. Behavioral food policy, an approach to policy that emphasizes behavior, is said to be able to support and maintain systemic improvements. Many nations, towns, and regions are turning more and more to behavioral insights to alter their food systems. According to the findings, context-sensitive approaches that take into account a population’s choices and behavior produce strategies, policies, and measures that are more effective, acceptable, adequate, and suited to their intended purposes than conventional model-based approaches. A fundamental change in societal values (such as the rejection of food waste), a disruptive crisis (such as the COVID pandemic), disruptive innovations using newer technologies (such as digitization and biotechnology), and, on rare occasions, visions and better ideas promoted by charismatic and reliable leaders. The current double crisis contains all four variables. It might also be advantageous by enabling people to work together to develop and test new policy tools that can feed the world while protecting the environment’s resources and biodiversity and ensuring equal access for everyone. The first noticeable effects of such revolutionary changes to the food system may be seen at the UN Food Systems Summit, which will bring together researchers, social workers, practitioners, and policymakers from all over the world to discuss and sponsor game-changing solutions for a more sustainable, just, and health-promoting food system.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contribution</title><p>Aamir Hussain Dar and Rahul Singh proposed the title of the manuscript.
