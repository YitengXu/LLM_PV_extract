However, these technologies rely on rare metals whose extraction requires large amounts of energy and water and are high in carbon emissions. Here we consider the sustainability of both technologies and the impacts of rare earth elements co-extraction. We use a global dynamic material flow-stock model and several scenarios for rare earth elements demand and supply. Cumulative carbon dioxide equivalent emissions associated with rare earth metals oversupply was between 5.5 and 6.4 times the emissions associated with dysprosium and neodymium production when dysprosium demand was increased. Carbon dioxide equivalent emissions associated with metals extraction and production were equivalent to between 10% and 29% of carbon dioxide emissions reduction through electric vehicle use. Targeting metal rich deposits and increased material efficiency and recycling reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 78%, 39% and 35%, and combined by 90%. Our findings highlight the role of resource efficiency and recycling in enhancing clean energy technologies.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Energy and transportation are two of the main economic sectors, yet responsible for most CO<sub>2</sub> emissions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and several other environmental impacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In addition, there are increasing concerns in the two sectors regarding the fossil fuel sources depletion and energy supply<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Wind power (WP) and electric vehicles (EVs) are seen as possible solution for the problems associated with the two sectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The use of the two technologies has increased in recent years and expected to significantly increase in the future as a result of their advantages over traditional energy and transportation technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Although the two technologies are expected to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, improve air quality, and reduce dependency on fossil fuel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, both rely on metals that have limited availability and production capacity, mostly produced as companion metals in few countries, and associated with large amounts of energy and water, high CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and other impacts including air pollution and human health problems. For example, Neodymium (Nd) and Dysprosium (Dy) required for the two technologies are produced with other REEs mainly from other metals deposits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Increasing demand for technologies target metals (Nd and Dy) may result in increasing companion metals (other rare earth elements (REEs)) production with several implications on the sustainability of these technologies, especially if companion metals demand does not increase at the same level as target metals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Supply-demand balance problem, which is the balance between metals demand and natural presence of metals in ores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, associated with metals required for emerging technologies is not limited to critical metals used in these technologies but also to other metals in which increasing use of technologies may result in reducing their demand. For example, Li ion batteries use for EVs is expected to replace nickel-metal hybrid (NiMH) batteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and consequently reduce Lanthanum (La), Cerium (Ce) and other REEs demand, which could increase supply-demand balance problem related to Nd and Dy increasing demand. Similar trends are also expected as a result of light-emitting diode (LED) technology increasing use. In addition, EVs use is expected to reduce Lead (Pb) demand in conventional vehicles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, consequently either its production from secondary sources or extraction from primary sources has to be reduced. Reducing Pb production from secondary sources would have adverse environmental impacts due to lower energy and emissions associated with secondary production compared to primary production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, while reducing its production from primary sources would reduce the supply of its companion metals; Bismuth (Bi), Antimony (Sb), Barium (Ba), Tellurium (Te), Selenium (Se), and Indium (In)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, some of which have been identified critical and essential for renewable technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Critical metals are defined as those that have high strategic and economic importance and have high supply risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">REEs are among the metals that have been identified critical in most criticality assessment methodologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and for energy and transportation sectors transition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> in most studies addressing metals limited resources availability and production capacity, mainly due to limited production capacity, geographical concentration of their production, and environmental problems associated with their production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. REEs production is known for being associated with high energy, water, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, permanent loss of ecosystems, soil erosion, air pollution, and human health problems, which caused the closure of several mining projects or the shift in operation location as a result of social resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. However, when the environmental impacts of emerging technologies are evaluated, the impacts associated with naturally coexisting metals with those utilized in the technologies are not fully captured in life cycle analysis (LCA) models and energy system models (ESMs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. It is argued that the mitigation potential of energy technologies will be overestimated unless the emissions associated with technology manufacture explicitly considered in ESMs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Although LCA models have a detailed representation of energy infrastructure, these models include the impacts associated with materials directly utilized in the technology and mostly the bulk materials, with little attention to minor metals that may have impacts on both the supply and demand side of energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In addition, allocation of the environmental impacts to the jointly produced outputs, which is done if not possible to avoid by either mass allocation or economic allocation, is a controversial issue in LCA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Joint production, either as co-products or by-products, is challenging to assess with LCA because it introduces the methodological problem of allocation, in addition to the increased risk of price volatility for specific materials including REEs which further confound the allocation approaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The restrictions, environmental impacts, and risk of disruption associated with REEs supply chain due to market imbalances or governmental policies increase the uncertainties related to their price and make the mass allocation is the preferred approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Several studies have addressed the impacts of metals coproduction on the criticality score of metals by including the coproduction fraction as indicator in the supply risk dimension of the criticality methodologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In addition, several studies have addressed supply-demand balance in general or for wind power technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, none of these studies quantify supply-demand balance associated with naturally coexisting metals with critical metals required for energy and transportation technologies, which utilize the same metals, and their impacts on energy, water, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and radioactive materials and ultimately the sustainability of emerging technologies.</p><p id="Par6">This paper is aimed at analysing the global implications of utilizing a number of REEs in WP and EVs technologies on the supply of other naturally coexisting REEs and consequently the environmental impacts associated with the two technologies and their long-term sustainability. The analysis is carried out on a global level using a dynamic material flow-stock model and a number of international scenarios for REEs demand in the two technologies and several scenarios for their supply. Several options for possible mitigation of the supply-demand balance problem, on demand and supply sides of metals, have been analysed including reducing WP and EVs shares in electricity production and vehicles market, reducing REEs content in the technologies, limiting target metals supply to their rich deposits, increasing target metals recycling, producing target metals from other sources including coal, bauxite, and phosphorus, and increasing other co-produced metals demand. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study that addresses the impacts of naturally coexisting metals on the sustainability of emerging technologies utilizing same materials, and quantifies the impacts of possible solutions for supply-demand balance problem. The multidisciplinary approach used in this analysis enhance current analysis carried out by prospective LCA and integrated assessment modelling (IAM) studies by adding detailed assessment of energy, water, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and other radioactive materials associated with the oversupply of naturally coexisting metals with the metals required for emerging technologies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par7">The results described below are based on several scenarios for the demand and supply of REEs, and energy, water, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and radioactive materials associated with their production. Two scenarios for the demand for metals utilized in WP and EVs (Nd, Dy, Pr, and Tb) have been used; low demand scenario (Low D SC) that is based on a changing material content (MC) of the two technologies, and high demand scenario (High D SC) that is based on a constant MC in the two technologies. REEs demand in all end-use applications is based on one scenario. Three scenarios for REEs supply have been used; supply from all global deposits without accounting for secondary sources supply, supply from all deposits while accounting for secondary sources supply, and supply from Dy rich deposits. Two scenarios for supply from secondary sources have been used; first recycling scenario (RSC1) assumes Dy supply is partly met by secondary sources while no recycling of other REEs and the second (RSC2) assumes Dy supply is partly met by secondary sources and there is a recycling of other REEs. Three scenarios for energy, water and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions associated with the REEs production have been used based on low, high, and average intensities.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>REEs demand and supply</title><p id="Par8">Expected annual and cumulative demand for Nd and Dy in the two demand scenarios, based on their demands in WP and EVs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>), and annual and cumulative global demand for all REEs (including Nd and Dy) based on their demand in end-use applications (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>) are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Nd annual demand in the two technologies is expected to reach 348.3 kt by 2050 in high demand scenarios (MC constant scenario), while expected to reach 219.5 kt in low demand scenario (MC changing scenario). Nd demand in WP and EVs is expected to be 8.2%, and 91.8% of Nd total demand in high demand scenario respectively, and 5.3%, and 94.7% in low demand scenario. Dy annual demand is expected to reach 52.1 kt by 2050 in high demand scenarios, while it is expected to reach 33.1 kt in low demand scenarios. Dy demand in WP and EVs is expected to be 7.7 and 92.3% of Dy total demand in the high demand scenario and expected to be 5.6 and 94.4% in the low demand scenario.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>REEs demand.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Nd annual demand; <bold>b</bold> Nd cumulative demand; <bold>c</bold> Dy annual demand; <bold>d</bold> Dy cumulative demand in WP and EVs in the two demand scenarios; <bold>e</bold> individual REEs annual demand in all applications; and <bold>f</bold> individual REEs cumulative demand in all applications.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43247_2021_262_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">The potential supply of REEs as a result Nd, Dy, Pr, and Tb demand in WP in the two demand scenarios (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2a</xref>) is expected to be lower than REEs current demand except the supply as a result of Tb and Dy demand in the high demand scenario. However, this supply is only the result of these metals demand in one technology. The potential annual supply of REEs as a result of Dy demand in EVs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2b</xref>) is expected to be higher than the supply associated with Nd demand in EVs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2b</xref>), and Dy and Tb demand in WP. The total supply of REEs as a result of Dy and Nd demand in EVs is higher than current REEs demand although this supply is only the result of their demand in one technology. Annual total REEs supply in 2050 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) as a result of Nd demand in the two technologies is expected to be between 1388 and 2202 kt, and as a result of Dy demand between 2325 and 3660 kt in all scenarios. The highest cumulative supply of total REEs is the one associated with Dy demand in the high demand scenario (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). In 2050, Nd demand in the two technologies is expected to lead to the production of between 323.9 and 513.9 kt of La and between 554.2 and 879.3 kt of Ce (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Nd demand is expected to lead to the production of between 19.8 and 31.4 kt of Dy, while Dy demand for WP and EVs is expected to reach between 33.1 and 52.1 kt by 2050. The amount of Dy that could be supplied as a result of Nd demand is about 60% of Dy required. This means that REE production should be increased further to meet the demand for Dy with a possible increase in all other REEs including Nd. Meanwhile, Dy demand in the two technologies is expected to reach between 33.1 and 52.1 kt by 2050 and expected to lead to the production of between 367.8 and 578.9 kt of Nd. It is clear that Dy demand is expected to lead to more REEs supply than Nd demand. It is also clear that Nd supply as a result of Dy demand is more than its demand in the two technologies. Tb supply as a result of Dy demand and supply is expected to exceed its demand in WP technologies making Dy is main metal controlling the supply when the two technologies are considered.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>REEs supply.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Annual supply of individual REEs; and <bold>b</bold> Cumulative supply of total REEs as a result of the demand for Nd and Dy in WP and EVs in the high and low demand scenarios.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43247_2021_262_Fig2_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">Nd, Dy, and Pr demand in WP (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">3a</xref>) is not expected to lead to an oversupply of most REEs, while Tb demand is expected to lead to an oversupply of most REEs especially in high demand scenario. Nd demand in EVs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">3b</xref>) is expected to lead to an oversupply of most REEs except Dy, Nd, and Pr in low demand scenario and Dy in high demand scenario, while Dy demand in EVs is expected to lead to a substantial oversupply for all REEs. Nd demand in the two technologies is expected to lead to an oversupply of all REEs except Dy, Pr, and Nd in low demand scenario indicating that the supply of the remaining demand for Nd, Dy, and Pr on a global level, may still lead to more oversupply of other metals, while it is expected to lead to substantial amounts of oversupply of all metals except Dy in high demand scenario (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).

The highest amount of water associated with Dy and Nd demand is associated with high demand and Dy rich deposits supply scenario, followed by low demand and Dy rich deposits supply scenario, high demand and all deposits supply scenario, and low demand and all deposits supply scenario. This indicates that Dy supply from Dy-rich deposits would reduce E-W-CO<sub>2</sub> associated with oversupplied REEs, while increase those associated with Dy and Nd demand. This is mainly due to the high E-W-CO<sub>2</sub> allocated to Dy when produced from its rich deposits. In addition to the possibility of underestimating the impacts associated with REEs used in emerging technologies using LCA, the results of the impacts of shifting Dy supply to Dy-rich deposits would also be different compared to LCA results. LCA studies are considering materials that are utilized in technologies only. The impacts associated with Nd and Dy production when Dy is supplied from Dy rich deposits would be higher than the impacts when Dy is supplied from all deposits.

Consequently, the supply of these REEs from traditional sources could lead to a substantial oversupply of other REEs that are naturally coexisting with them. When WP and EVs are analysed separately, Tb demand in WP is the only metal that could lead to oversupply of other REEs, while Dy demand is the main cause of oversupply in EVs case. When the two technologies are analysed together, Dy is the metal that could lead to oversupply (Tb demand is covered as a result of Dy supply). Energy, water, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and radioactive materials associated with the oversupplied REEs are several times more than those associated with metals utilized in the two technologies; Dy and Nd, and combined should be allocated to the two technologies. Therefore the sustainability of emerging technologies is not only determined by the impacts of materials used in these technologies but also by other oversupplied materials that are naturally coexisting with them. To analyse emerging technologies sustainability, it is necessary to include all metals coexisting in nature together even if only one of them is utilized in these technologies to determine whether an oversupply occurs or not. In addition, it is necessary to analyse technologies together especially those using the same metals, since the demand for one metal in specific technology could lead to an oversupply of its companion metals, while this metal demand could be covered as a result of the demand for one of its companion metal used in other technology.</p><p id="Par25">Several options could reduce supply-demand balance problem including reducing metals demand, increasing other coproduced metals demand, increasing supply from target metals rich deposits, supply of REE from ores with different REEs distribution, increasing metals recycling, and others such as reuse and remanufacturing.</p><p id="Par26">Metals demand estimates in this analysis are based on two scenarios for future development in WP and EVs developed by the IEA, which are lower than most other international scenarios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Scenarios that include more potential for WP and EVs would lead to higher demand for required metals and therefore the oversupply of naturally coexisting metals. Several other factors may have impacts on metals demand including sub-technologies MS, MC, and LT. The values used for these factors in this analysis are either taken directly from the original scenarios or assumed to cover the wide range of assumptions in literature. Although the MS of sub-technologies has direct impact on Nd and Dy demand, the assumption on WP technologies utilizing permanent magnet generator (PMG) in the analysis, which is assumed to increase reaching a maximum of 50% by 2050, is not expected to have a major impact on the results as the main demand for the two metals is a result of EVs. MC has major impacts on reducing Nd, Dy, Tb, and Pr demand as illustrated in MC changing scenario. Detailed discussion on the two factors can be found in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Technologies LT is taken as an average value among assumed values in literature. Lower LT is expected to increase Nd and Dy demand and consequently increase other REEs oversupply, while higher LT is expected to lower Nd and Dy demand but increase demand for other metals used for the battery system such as Li and Co with several consequences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Another option that could reduce Nd and Dy demand includes the substitution on element or component levels. It is indicated that Tb could replace Dy however its use has been limited due to its higher price<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In terms of supply-demand balance, Tb is expected to lead to higher oversupply of other REEs compared to Dy due to its lower concentration in the deposits, which leads to higher other REEs production to Tb production ratios (see Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">3</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">1</xref>). Although Sm-Co could be used instead of Nd<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>14</sub>B, this option is not practical due to the low energy product of SmCo<sub>5</sub> magnets and the high price of Sm and Co as well as their limited availability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In terms of coproduction, both Sm demand would lead to oversupply of other REEs as a result of its lower concentration in the deposits, and Co demand is expected to increase as a result of increasing use of Li ion batteries, while its supply is connected to Ni and Cu production.</p><p id="Par27">Increasing other REEs demand is an option but not always possible. For example, Sm-Co magnet could not only decrease Dy and Nd demand but also increase Sm demand, however, there is a problem with Sm and Co demand and supply since both are companion metals with low concentrations compared to their host metals as mentioned before. La market was in balance largely due to its use in NiMH batteries however in the future the use of these batteries could be phased out<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> due to the use of Li batteries for EVs. However, the possibility of finding new applications for the oversupplied REEs or expanding their current use applications remains an option that could potentially reduce the balance problem.

The alternative scenario proposed also in Alonso et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> with slightly higher demand growth in these applications could minimize the balance problem.</p><p id="Par28">The supply of metals is based on the production of REOs from currently operating and planned projects. Currently, China provides 84% of total REOs supply<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> and Australia 11%, while based on the scenario used for current and expected REOs production in this analysis (See the “Method” section), China is expected to provide 45% of the total REOs supply, Australia 16%, Canada 9%, Greenland 8% and the remaining (more than 20%) from other countries. Producing REEs from Chinese deposits has higher impacts compared to the production in other projects in most impact categories including global warming addressed in this analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Therefore the assumed scenario in the analysis would lead to lower impacts compared to the possibility of a continuation of the current trend of Chinese dominant REEs production and should be seen as an optimistic scenario. Dy supply from its rich deposits would increase the impacts associated with its production but reduce the impacts associated with the oversupply of other REEs and consequently reduce the overall impacts as illustrated by the second supply scenario. Recycling of Dy and Nd would reduce their extraction from primary sources but not necessarily reduce supply-demand balance problem. Recycling of Dy, and Nd would reduce the amounts required from primary sources on the long term and consequently the supply of other naturally existing REEs with them.

Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">6</xref>a and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">b</xref> show WP installed capacity (stock) and EVs on the road (stock) scenarios used in this analysis. WP installed capacity and EVs stocks in the IEA scenarios are given until 2040 and 2030 respectively. Data given in the IEA scenario are extrapolated until 2050 and the total numbers of EVs are comparable to other scenarios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The MS of WP technologies utilizing PMG in the WP market is assumed to increase reaching a maximum of 50% by 2050<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. Stocks of PHEV and BEVs are given directly in the IEA scenario and the stock of HEVs is assumed to be similar to PHEVs. The sales (inflows) of WP technologies and EVs are estimated based on the installed capacity given in the scenarios, historical inflows of these technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and their LTs, which are assumed 20 years for WP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> and 12 years for EVs as an average value among different values given in literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Two scenarios have been used for the MC of WP and EVs. The first assumes a constant MC based on data given in Elshkaki and Graedel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> for WP and in Moss et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> for EVs. The second assumes a changing MC with a reduction in MC of WP (based on the magnet size, a reduction in the PM by 45% and an increase in the manufacturing efficiency by 20%) by 55% for Nd and Dy by 2050 based on a scenario constructed in Elshkaki and Shen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>, and a reduction in MC of EVs by 35% for Nd and Dy based on a scenario constructed in Harvey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>.

Two scenarios for REEs recycling have been used in the analysis. The first (RSC1) assumes Dy supply is partly met by secondary sources while no recycling of other REEs and the second (RSC2) assumes Dy supply is partly met by secondary sources and there is a recycling of other REEs.

Dy supply from secondary sources is expected to cover between 27 and 39% of Dy total demand in WP and between 43 and 48% of Dy total demand in EVs by 2050 in the two MC scenarios.

The supply of the four metals from each deposit is estimated based on the demand for these metals and the share of each deposit in their production. On a global level, the supply of the four metals is assumed to be their demand.
