Though previous studies have found that serum neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is predictive of survival post liver transplant (LT), peritumoral neutrophil (PMN) infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (TME) of HCC has not been thoroughly investigated yet. In this study we sought to evaluate tissue based PMN infiltration in HCC post LT using quantitative multiplex immunofluorescence (qmIF), previously used to study the TME of several other tumor types[1].</p><p id="Par3"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4">A database of 634 patients was created at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) including adult patients with available clinical follow up who underwent liver transplantation (LT) for HCC between 1998 and 2018. We evaluated a preliminary cohort of 10 patients using qmIF, excluding patients with viral hepatitis. FFPE tumor sections were pre-selected by a GI pathologist. Slides were stained using qmIF for MPO (PMNs), CD3 (T cells), CD8 (cytotoxic T cells), CD68 (macrophages), HLA-DR (immune activation), and Hep-Par1 (hepatocytes/tumor). Multiplex images were visualized using Vectra (Akoya) and processed using inForm (Akoya). Data was analyzed using R Studio for concatenation, density, nearest neighbor and statistical analysis. Serum NLR was calculated using complete blood counts collected prior to LT(Figure 1).</p><p id="Par5"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par6">Preliminary cohort of 10 patients includes 4 with recurrence at a median of 2.4 years and 6 with no recurrence at a median of 12 years post-LT. We found that patients with recurrence post-LT have significantly higher densities of MPO+ PMNs compared to those with no recurrence. This difference is primarily driven by PMNs located within the peritumoral stroma (Median [interquartile range [IQR] 2.46 [1.99 - 2.92] vs 1.23 [0.723 -1.78], p=0.019). Intratumoral PMN infiltration was not associated with recurrence (Median [IQR] 0.91 [0.59 - 1.20] vs 1.33 [0.56 – 1.90], p=0.308). Moreover, density of CD3, both intratumoral and peritumoral, did not correlate with recurrence, nor did the tissue-derived NLR. Further, we found that the tissue-derived NLR did not correlate with NLR in blood.</p><p id="Par7"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par8">Higher densities of peritumoral PMNs are associated with post-LT HCC recurrence. Evaluation of TME using qmIF can be used to predict recurrence in post-LT HCC. Further, tissue based analysis of PMNs does not correlate with serum NLR allowing potential for composite biomarkers. As this is preliminary, further analysis is underway and will be validated on the larger cohort of patients.</p><p id="Par9"><bold>Reference</bold></p><p id="Par10">1.

Tumor tissue samples are an integral part of identifying and understanding potential therapeutic targets within the tumor microenvironment of multiple cancer indications. As early biomarker discovery is often hindered by the logistical demands of sourcing fresh human tumor tissue, cryopreserved dissociated tumor cell suspensions provide a viable alternative for accessing multiple, highly-annotated tumor samples for complex studies. Previous evaluations of cryopreservation on viable tumor tissue have relied on flow or mass cytometry which, while powerful, are limited in the number of targets that can be analyzed. Single cell gene expression can analyze the expression of significantly more targets and provide a clearer picture on the effects of cryopreservation on the cellular composition of the tumor.</p><p id="Par14"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par15">Multiple unique primary tumor samples were dissociated to the single-cell level and profiled by flow cytometry. These single cell suspensions were subsequently subjected to single cell RNASeq using the 10X Genomics platform prior to, and immediately following, cryopreservation. Data was subsequently analyzed to determine how cryopreservation impacted the cellular composition of the tumor microenvironment.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>P3 Predicting patient response to checkpoint blockade therapy using in vitro 3D cultures</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Kathryn Appleton, PhD, Ashley Elrod, Qi Jin Guo, Dennis Ruder, Tessa DesRochers, PhD</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>KIYATEC, Inc., Greenville, SC, United States</title><sec id="Sec13"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Tessa DesRochers (tessa.desrochers@kiyatec.com)</title><p id="Par16"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par17">Knowledge of immune responses that correlate with clinical outcome is essential for the development of strategies to harness a patient’s immune system to eradicate cancer. Pre-clinical platforms that recapitulate the immune response in the context of cancer are necessary for adequate understanding and detection of clinical efficacy, however, the technology to accurately test immuno-oncology (I/O) therapy response is lacking. Despite the value animal models provide in a pre-clinical setting, they lack matched patient tumor and immune cell interactions. To address this shortcoming, we developed in vitro 3D tissue models that maintain autologous patient tumor cells and immune cells for the testing and prediction of immune cell responses. We hypothesize that these 3D tissue models will recapitulate the patient tumor microenvironment and detect response to I/O agents.</p><p id="Par18"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par19">Tumor cells and T-cells were obtained from seven melanoma patient biopsies and screened for PD-L1 and lymphocyte populations prior to incorporation into 3D culture. Effector cell to Tumor cell (E:T) optimization assays were conducted with expanded T-cells at different densities and co-cultured at different time points with tumor cells. Viability was measured using CellTiter-Glo® 3D. T-cell response was determined using flow cytometry following 24-hour co-culture with tumor cells. Microtumors were established using a biologically inert scaffold and extracellular matrix components. Microtumor viability was determined using PrestoBlue and T-cell infiltration was determined via flow cytometry. Analyte secretion was determined from supernatant using Milliplex MAP Human CD8+ T-cell Panel.</p><p id="Par20"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par21">We detected pembrolizumab binding to T-cells in a dose dependent manner and an increase in the activation marker CD69 on T-cells following tumor cell and pembrolizumab treatment in three of four patients tested. We devised an initial E:T optimization screen to identify a patient-specific ratio which renders our subsequent therapy response profiling highly personalized. CD3+CD8+ T-cell mediated tumor cell death and enhanced killing was detected in the presence of pembrolizumab. Immune cell infiltration as well as therapy related cell death was observed in our 3D microtumors. Altered patient specific cytokine secretion was measured when the cultures were treated with pembrolizumab and significantly correlated with pembrolizumab induced reduction of microtumor growth rates.</p><p id="Par22"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par23">The data generated from these two complex 3D in vitro models allows us to better understand immune responses to autologous tumor cells and checkpoint blockade. Our models are therefore ideal and complimentary for preclinical testing of new I/O agents as well as patient response predictions to I/O based therapies.</p><p id="Par24"><bold>Ethics Approval</bold></p><p id="Par25">Tissue was acquired with approval from Prisma Health's Institutional Review Board, PRO# 00069834.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>P4 Novel immune competent murine glioblastoma models derived from Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup>; Quaking<sup>L/L</sup>; P53<sup>L/L</sup>; PTEN<sup>L/L</sup> mice</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Chao-Hsien Chen, MD<sup>1</sup>, Renee Chin, MS<sup>1</sup>, Genevieve Hartley, PhD<sup>2</sup>, Cheng-En Hsieh, MD<sup>1</sup>, Rishika Prasad, MS<sup>2</sup>, Takashi Shingu, PhD<sup>2</sup>, David Hong, MD<sup>2</sup>, Jian Hu, PhD<sup>2</sup>, Michael Curran, PhD<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec16"><title><sup>1</sup>The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center UTHealth Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Houston, TX, United States; <sup>2</sup>The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States</title><sec id="Sec17"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Michael Curran (MCurran@mdanderson.org)</title><p id="Par26"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par27">The widely used glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) model GL261 is highly immunogenic and readily cured by checkpoint blockade limiting its use for pre-clinical modeling of immunotherapy for human GBM [1,2]. We developed four novel murine immunocompetent glioblastoma stem cell (QPP) lines derived from Nestin-CreER<sup>T2</sup> Quaking (QKI)<sup>L/L</sup>; P53<sup>L/L</sup>; PTEN<sup>L/L</sup> mice, reflecting a common set of alterations in patients [3-5]. The four QPP cell lines are syngeneic to C57BL/6J mice and exhibit distinct responses to T-cell checkpoint blockade.</p><p id="Par28"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par29">The differential responsiveness of each QPP line was assessed through analysis of tumor growth in the brain versus the flank in untreated, αPD-1, or αCTLA-4 treated mice. The impact of tumor genomic landscape on responsiveness at each site was measured through whole exome sequencing. To understand cellular factors modulating responsiveness of these GBM lines to checkpoint blockade, the immune microenvironments of sensitive (QPP7) versus resistant (QPP8) lines were compared in the brain using high parameter flow cytometry. Drivers of flank sensitivity versus brain resistance were also measured for QPP8.</p><p id="Par30"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par31">QPP GBM lines demonstrate a range of sensitivities to CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade when implanted on the flank ranging from complete sensitivity (QPP7) to complete resistance (QPP4). In the brain, QPP7 remains sensitive to both antibodies, but QPP4 and QPP8 fail to respond to blockade of either checkpoint (Figure 1). Analysis of the QPP8 immune infiltrate in skin reveals enhanced ratios of CD8s to Treg and myeloid suppressors in response to checkpoint blockade; however, none of these benefits manifest in the brain QPP8 except a very specific increase in CD8s relative to granulocytic suppressors (Figure 2). Brain-implanted QPP8 reacts adaptively to checkpoint blockade by upregulating PD-L1 expression across its myeloid stroma. In contrast, immune-responsive QPP7 does not induce PD-L1 and shows markers of enhanced CD8 T cell fitness. Consistent with these observations, genomic analysis reveals a higher mutation density in QPP7 versus the other QPP lines. Using checkpoint-insensitive QPP4/8, we have now identified agonists of the Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) pathway as highly promising therapeutics for treating these tumors in the brain.</p><p id="Par32"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par33">We have developed novel syngeneic models of GBM with relevant genetics and immune sensitivities relative to human disease. Through comparing T cell checkpoint blockade sensitive versus insensitive variants of these QPP lines, and through comparing variant sensitivity dictated by site of implantation, we have begun to identify the genetic and cellular components that govern immunotherapeutic sensitivity of GBM.</p><p id="Par34"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par35">1.

While a growing number of preclinical mouse models is under development, the heterogeneity of the cell composition in a solid tumor poses considerable technical challenges in isolating and characterizing the TILs for the downstream analysis. One common problem with TILs preparation occurs during solid tumor dissociation, whereby the TILs are left in a mixture with tissue debris and dead cells in suspension. Consequently, a preparation of autologous TILs often requires further costly and laborious processing such as density gradient centrifugation, immune cell sorting and enrichment, and dead cell and debris removal in combination with multiple centrifugation steps. We introduce a novel Laminar Wash™ technology, which can help overcome these technical challenges.</p><p id="Par46"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par47">We performed pilot studies on syngeneic (MC38, CT26, CloudmanS91, 4T1) and humanized mouse tumor models as well as with human PBMCs and tumor biopsies using the Laminar Wash™ technology. Briefly, we evaluated various functional parameters of TILs such as polyfunctional CD8+ T cell responses and glucose update efficiency (2-NBDG) as well as conducting a side-by-side comparison of the TIL recovery rate and immunophenotypic characteristics of lymphoid and myeloid subsets on the Laminar Wash™ and the centrifugation-based systems. In addition, the cell retention rate, cell viability, debris removal, epitope preservation and the overall processing time were assessed and compared. Furthermore, we introduce a complete walk-away approach to sample preparation that eliminates operator-based variability while significantly enhancing reproducibility and consistency of downstream analysis.</p><p id="Par48"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par49">Our data demonstrate that the Laminar Wash™ method resulted in higher cell retention and viability, more clearly defined immune subsets, a lowered background signal, and an enhanced yield of the TILs from freshly dissociated tumor samples compared to the centrifugation-based counterparts. The Laminar Wash™ system can effectively remove the floating debris in suspension while keeping the live cells unperturbed, allowing the cell surface architecture and epitopes better retained for improved downstream analysis with flow cytometer. Additionally, the Laminar Wash™ AUTO system offers a completely automated sample processing solution for dissociated tumor samples, simplifying and expediting cell preparation with enhanced consistency and reproducibility.</p><p id="Par50"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par51">Laminar Wash™ results in healthy, viable, and well defined population of TILs, while improving the overall quality of data.

Humanization of immunodeficient mice through the adoptive transfer of normal adult PBMC leads to rapid engraftment of human T cells to study immune-modulatory agents in the context of human tumor xenografts, but is limited by the development of xenogeneic graft-versus host disease (xGVHD). In this study, we evaluated the engraftment of PBMC in β2microglobulin null super-immunodeficient mice NSG-B2M mice, that lack MHC Class I on host tissues. A cell line-derived xenograft model (CDX) co-engrafted with PBMC (PBMC-ImmunoGraft) was characterized for humanization, tumor infiltrating leukocytes (TIL) phenotype and tumor response to checkpoint inhibitors.</p><p id="Par56"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par57">PBMC from healthy donors (N=7) were implanted and engraftment in peripheral blood was assessed by flow cytometry. T cell memory phenotypes were assessed over time in a small cohort, and costimulatory and inhibitory T cell subsets were evaluated at the terminal time point in blood and secondary lymphoid organs.

T cells were detectable in the periphery starting at 2 weeks with stable levels (up to 40% of live cells to 8 weeks) with increasing T effector memory cells over the course of study. All tumors evaluated had high levels of TIL as measured by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Costimulatory and inhibitory molecules evaluated on CD4 and CD8 included 4-1BB, TIM-3, LAG-3, OX-40, as well as PD-1, which was expressed on both peripheral blood cells and in TIL.

Our purpose is to develop the drug efficacy index by rapid analysis of antibodies accumulating in cancer tissue using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and by characterization of the antibody distribution in the tumor microenvironment. Using a novel proteolysis method in which antibody molecules are collected on a 100 nm resin pore and trypsin is immobilized on a 200 nm nanoparticle surface, we have developed a method for physicochemically limiting trypsin access to antibody and identifying the structural specificity of complementarity-determining regions while minimizing extra peptides and protease without depending on the type of antibody. Using this method to detect antibodies from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues, we aim to develop novel diagnostics that can aid in therapeutic dosing and predicting responses to antibody-based therapies.</p><p id="Par76"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par77">To demonstrate the feasibility of these approaches, the human breast and epidermoid carcinoma cell lines SKBR3 and A431 were incubated with either trastuzumab and cetuximab, which bind to erbB2 and EGFR, respectively. FFPE cell blocks were then prepared and proteins were extracted from 8 μm sections after deparaffinization and decrosslinking. The extracted proteins were subjected to the Fab-selective proteolysis nSMOL, and the signature peptides of each antibody, IYPTNGYTR for trastuzumab and SQVFFK for cetuximab, were detected via triple-quadrupole LC-MS/MS. SCID mice were subcutaneously implanted with BT474 cells and 5 days later were infused with 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg trastuzumab. 24 h after administration, tumor and other tissues were harvested and FFPE block were prepared for trastuzumab quantitation in FFPE tissues.</p><p id="Par78"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par79">As a result of the pretreatment protocol using the cell block, the conditions of deparaffinization, decrosslinking, and protein extraction were optimized. Mass spectra of the signature peptides from trastuzumab and cetuximab could be detected using 20,000 cells. This condition was also applied to xenograft tissue and the degree of trastuzumab accumulation was detected in FFPE tumor tissue in a dose-dependent manner.</p><p id="Par80"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par81">We show that these approaches can be utilized to quantify antibody concentrations in typically-challenging FFPE specimens with good sensitivity and as such could be utilized to assess efficacy of the monoclonal antibody administered.

Despite its labor-intensiveness and variability, density gradient centrifugation-based method (DGM) has remained the primary method of upstream cell isolation for decades due to a lack of viable alternatives. This is problematic as DGM is a non-scalable, manual process. To address this lack of innovation, we have developed an automated Microfluidic System based on inertial focusing that enables label-free white blood cell (WBC) separation and concentration from 3-75mL of whole blood in short timescale with high consistency, providing reliable sample preparation for downstream functional assays.</p><p id="Par97"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par98">WBCs were isolated from 15% ACD-A anticoagulated peripheral human blood using the Microfluidic System or DGM. Cell number, viability, and immune phenotype were evaluated by hematology analyzer and flow cytometry. To assess B-cell function, cells were cryopreserved post separation, thawed, and stimulated with IL-2 and R848, followed by Human IgG and IgM ELISPOT. To assess T-cell function, thawed cells underwent bead-based granulocyte depletion and stimulation with CEF peptide pool, followed by Human IFNγ ELISPOT.</p><p id="Par99"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par100">The prototype Microfluidic System consistently processed 40mL of anticoagulated blood in approximately 20 minutes with minimal hands-on time as opposed to 60–90 minutes for DGM with significant hands-on time. While DGM collects only peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs), the System isolates the total WBC population and may be beneficial for immunophenotyping. As shown in Table 1, the Microfluidic System consistently provided improved WBC or PBMC recovery, viability, purity, RBC depletion, and platelet depletion as compared to DGM. Immune phenotyping shows that the Microfluidic System also consistently resulted in improved recovery of lymphocyte subsets, including CD19+, CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells (Table 2). B-cell and T-cell functionality were found to be equivalent between the two cell isolation methods based on IgM/IgG and IFNγ secretion, respectively. With the improved cell recovery using the Microfluidic System, more target cells from the same blood sample may be collected for downstream assays.</p><p id="Par101"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par102">The Microfluidic System offers a faster, more reliable method than DGM for upstream cell separation from whole blood. The System consistently recovers more cells, including functional lymphocytes of different subsets, compared to DGM, potentially allowing more assays to be executed from the same blood sample. Overall, this technology has the potential to transform cell separation by automating a variable and labor-intensive processes, and therefore has utility in applications that require consistent cell quality and functionality.</p><p id="Par103"><table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 1 (abstract P10).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>See text for description</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Tab2_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></table-wrap></p><p id="Par104"><table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 2 (abstract P10).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>See text for description</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Tab3_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></table-wrap></p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>P11 Early detection of breast cancer (BCa) through MDSC and lymphocyte immunophenotyping: from manual gating to pattern recognition neural networks</title><sec id="Sec43"><title>George Dominguez, PhD<sup>1</sup>, John Roop<sup>1</sup>, Alexander Polo, BS<sup>1</sup>, Anthony Campisi, BS<sup>1</sup>, Dmitry Gabrilovich, MD/PhD<sup>2</sup>, Amit Kumar, PhD<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec44"><title><sup>1</sup>Anixa Biosciences, San Jose, CA, United States; <sup>2</sup>The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, United States</title><sec id="Sec45"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> George Dominguez (george@anixa.com)</title><p id="Par105"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par106">Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are contributors in supporting tumor progression and escape [1,2].

In microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors, defects in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) can cause a hypermutated phenotype where alterations accumulate in the repetitive microsatellite regions of DNA. MSI detection is typically performed by subjecting tumor tissue (“solid biopsy”) to clinical next-generation sequencing or specific assays, such as MMR IHC or MSI PCR. Circulating cell-free tumor DNA (cfDNA) testing (“liquid biopsy”) is rapidly emerging as a less invasive method for cancer detection and monitoring disease progression. Here, we explore the possibility of detecting MSI in cfDNA and develop a novel cfDNA MSI detection assay with high specificity.</p><p id="Par156"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par157">The Tempus cfDNA targeted panel contains 39 highly informative microsatellite loci previously used by the clinically validated Tempus xT 595-gene panel. For each microsatellite locus, we identified all sequencing reads that mapped to the corresponding microsatellite region and quantified the number of repeat units contained within the sequencing read. Next, three distinct summary statistics were calculated to characterize the distribution of the number of repeat units for each locus. Finally, using 54 labeled patient samples (17 MSI-H, 37 microsatellite stable) sequenced with the Tempus cfDNA panel, a k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classifier was trained to classify each locus for a new sample. Patient samples with more than 50% unstable loci were classified as MSI-H.</p><p id="Par158"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par159">We validated the ability of our model to detect MSI on a new independent validation dataset. MSI-H status was detected in 6 patient samples. In 3 of these patients (2 colorectal, 1 skin cancer), abnormal MMR IHC confirmed the detected MSI-H status. In the other 3 patients (1 colorectal, 1 non-small cell lung cancer, and 1 endometrial cancer), MSI-H status was confirmed by our clinically validated solid tumor MSI assay. Furthermore, the reliability of the model was validated in 10 technical replicates from 2 MSI-H patients in our training dataset. The results were 100% concordant with all 10 replicates classified as MSI-H.</p><p id="Par160"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par161">These results demonstrate the ability of our assay to detect MSI in cfDNA with high specificity, providing a transformative opportunity to report a clinically actionable insight alongside other somatic changes detected from cfDNA.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec62"><title>P16 Circulating immunological biomarkers for predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC patients</title><sec id="Sec63"><title>Charlotte Milton, PhD, Thanussuyah Alaguthurai, Atousa khiabany, Mres, Sheeba Irshad, MD PhD</title><sec id="Sec64"><title>Kings College London, London, United Kingdom</title><sec id="Sec65"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Sheeba Irshad (sheeba.irshad@kcl.ac.uk)</title><p id="Par162"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par163">Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 10-20% of breast cancer and is associated with particularly poor prognosis. Patients are commonly treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and response to treatment is a strong predictor of overall survival. Recently, the ability of chemotherapeutics to stimulate an anti-tumour immune response has been appreciated as an important mechanism of action; possibly contributing to the elimination of distant micro-metastatic disease by resetting of the attenuated functional immunity. In TNBCs, higher levels of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes correlate with response to NAC and high intra-tumoral levels of immune-related genes, including those associated with type I interferon responses, and the presence of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, correlate with improved disease outcome.</p><p id="Par164"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par165">The underlying hypothesis of this study is that phenotypic profiling of peripheral blood cells have the potential to inform clinical decisions and help predict therapeutic response, with lower costs and higher compliance than serial tumour biopsies, due to their minimal invasiveness. Whilst significant research efforts have been made to assess circulating markers such as circulating tumour cells and circulating tumour DNA as potential biomarkers; understanding the evolving peripheral “immunological status” of TNBC patients on NAC is warranted.</p><p id="Par166">We therefore set out to analyse serial blood samples from TNBC patients receiving NAC to monitor the changes in the peripheral immune response through deep analysis of functional and phenotypic immune markers. We investigated (1) whether chemotherapy affects the immune phenotype; and (2) whether a defined peripheral blood immune phenotypic profile relates to treatment response.</p><p id="Par167"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par168">Here we present preliminary results from 10 TNBC patients receiving NAC. Analysis of 39 PBMC populations using mass cytometry by time-of-flight (CyTOF), highlighted phenotypic changes in B cell populations in response to treatment, in particular a dramatic increase in circulating regulatory B cells (CD19+CD24+CD38+) post-chemotherapy (5.4% and 46.2% of B cells pre- and post-chemotherapy, respectively, p=0.0004). We also detected an increase in expression of exhaustion markers (CD38+CD39+) on CD8+ T cells which was associated with poor response to chemotherapy (0.8 and 2.7 fold increase from baseline in exhausted CD8+ T cells in patients with pathological complete response and residual disease, respectively, p=0.008).</p><p id="Par169"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par170">We now plan to integrate these data with Luminex profiling of 36 serum cytokines, mass spectrometry analysis of circulating exosomes and clinicopathological and standard of care blood monitoring.

Despite recent successes, many patients fail to respond or are overcome by severe toxicities that limit further treatment. To date, there are no non-invasive predictors of response and toxicity that can guide treatment decisions. In this work, we perform whole plasma and plasma-derived exosome proteomic profiling to construct a predictive model of immunotherapy response and toxicity, and to glean further biologic insight into the mechanisms underlying resistance to ICB.</p><p id="Par175"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par176">Whole plasma was analyzed in a cohort of 55metastatic melanoma patients receiving anti-PD1 antibodies (MGH IRB #11-181) at baseline, and on-treatment at 6 week and 6 month time-points. Exosomes were analyzed in 15 of these patients for all time-points. Proteomic analysis was performed using an innovative multiplex proximity extension assay that enabled detection of more than 1000 proteins simultaneously. A linear mixed model with maximum likelihood estimation for model parameters was used to analyze differences between patient groups, and significant differences were determined after Benjamini and Hochberg multiple hypothesis correction.</p><p id="Par177"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par178">Between plasma baseline and on-treatment time-points, 67 differentially expressed proteins were identified including markers of inflammation such as PD1, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, IL10, CCL3 and TNFR2. Exosome samples had a distinct protein signature over the treatment period compared to plasma, including differential expression of CXCL16, CCL18, CCL20, and IL6, among others. 41 proteins were differentially expressed in plasma between ICB responders and non-responders including several inflammatory proteins such as CD28, TNFb, MCSFRa and IL8, and others implicated in melanoma resistance, such as MIA and ERBB2. Similarly, exosome revealed a distinct protein signature between responders and non-responders compared to plasma consisting of CXCL9, CXCL13, CXCL16, CCL19, CD8a, GZMA and CD5 expression. Whereas plasma proteins reflected a myeloid signature, exosome proteins reflected a lymphoid signature, suggesting that the two compartments may capture elements of different immune processes. Integrating data from both plasma and exosome proteomics, we applied machine learning tools to build a predictor of response. Further analysis to look for predictors of toxicity is currently underway.</p><p id="Par179"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par180">Overall, our work suggests that plasma and exosome protein signatures are distinct and may reflect unique immunological processes.

At 6-weeks on-treatment time point, 80 proteins were found differentially expressed between R and NR including several proteins implicated in primary or acquired resistance (IL8, MIA, TNFR1 among others). Several 6-weeks differentially expressed proteins were highly predictive of survival (ICOSL, IL8, MIA). Furthermore, 160 significantly differentially expressed (DE) proteins were identified across the treatment period majority of which are reflective of immune activation under the pressure of the immunotherapy.

The role of Sema4D as an inflammatory mediator in several pathological aspects and its role in tumor immune suppression [2,3], highlights its significance as a molecule to be further investigated for translational potential.

Thirty eight patients of classic autoimmune conditions, thirteen allergy patients, seven osteoarthritis patients and thirty-one healthy donors were included as controls. The level of Sema4D in plasma was detected using tailored direct ELISA assay.

Three histological patterns of tumor inflammation were defined according to the extent of stromal inflammation and TAIs infiltrate into the tumor islands. First; the inflamed type (TAIs infiltrated the tumor cells), second the TAIs excluded type (inflamed stroma but TAIs did not infiltrate the tumor islands and/or were excluded by a thin peri-tumoral fibromyxoid zone) and third as deserted ( minimal to no TAIs in the peri-tumroal stroma or the tumor islands).

Immunotherapies including immune checkpoint blockade have demonstrated therapeutic efficacy and durable responses for several tumor types, however most patients are nonresponsive or develop resistance to such immunotherapies. To identify new predictive biomarkers to better stratify patients, it is essential to comprehensively characterize the immune cells within the TME at the molecular level. Traditional methods to assess gene expression in tissues lack either spatial information or sensitivity/specificity. To address this, we have developed a novel workflow combining the single molecule and single cell visualization capabilities of the RNAscope in situ hybridization (ISH) assay with the highly multiplexed spatial profiling capabilities of the GeoMx™ Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP) RNA assays (Research Use Only).</p><p id="Par244"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par245">The fully automated RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescent assay was used to visually identify CD3E (T-cell)-enriched regions and CD19 and CD20 (B-cell)-enriched regions within FFPE human lung cancer tissues. Using the GeoMx DSP, 10 CD3E-enriched regions of interest (ROI) and 10 CD19-enriched ROI were spatially profiled for 78 genes related to immune-oncology research. The RNAscope Multiplex Fluorescence assay was used again to visually confirm the differentially expressed genes between the T and B-cell-enriched regions with single cell resolution.</p><p id="Par246"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par247">To show a workflow combining RNAscope molecularly guided visualization and GeoMx DSP profiling is feasible, we confirmed that both assay protocols are compatible. We then examined concordance between GeoMx DSP and RNAscope ISH data, demonstrating that RNAscope and GeoMx DSP data can be obtained on the same section. To test the full automated workflow, we compared the differentially expressed genes within the T cell and B cell-enriched ROI. The RNAscope assay confirmed that, while the expression of the immunoregulatory molecules CTLA4, PD-L1, PD-1, and ICOSLG were detected in both ROI, the CD3E (T-cell)-enriched ROI demonstrated significantly higher expression of these checkpoint markers. Compared to the CD19-enriched ROI, the CD3-enriched ROI also showed increased inflammatory signature, demonstrated by elevated levels of cytokines and chemokines such as CCL5, CXCL9 and IFNG.</p><p id="Par248"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par249">We present a robust workflow that overcomes the historical limitations of ISH and IHC by combining high resolution imaging with high plex profiling. With this workflow, the RNAscope ISH technology can molecularly guide the GeoMx DSP to precisely profile ROI while retaining the morphological context of heterogenous tumors. Furthermore, RNAscope assays can be used to confirm GeoMx DSP-identified gene expression signatures at single cell resolution.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec94"><title>P25 A conserved MART-1 T cell receptor motif is predictive of responses to checkpoint blockade</title><sec id="Sec95"><title>Ariel Isser, BS<sup>1</sup>, Tatsuya Yoshida<sup>2</sup>, Junya Ichikawa<sup>2</sup>, Jeffrey Weber, MD, PhD<sup>2</sup>, Jonathan Schneck, MD, PhD<sup>3</sup></title><sec id="Sec96"><title><sup>1</sup>Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States; <sup>2</sup>New York School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States; <sup>3</sup>Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States</title><sec id="Sec97"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Jeffrey Weber (jeffrey.weber@nyulangone.org); Jonathan Schneck (jschnec1@jhmi.edu)</title><p id="Par250"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par251">Since the introduction of checkpoint blockade inhibitors for cancer immunotherapy, numerous studies have sought to identify biomarkers predictive of patient response [1]. However, the relevance of antigen-driven responses to the tumor has yet to be investigated. To address this question, we examined T cell responses to MART-1, an antigen overexpressed in melanoma cells and a target for melanoma clinical trials that have had variable degrees of success. We hypothesized that features of patients’ MART-1 CD8+ T cell repertoires could predict their response to checkpoint blockade.</p><p id="Par252"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par253">To understand the MART-1 T cell repertoire, MART-1 CD8+ T cells were expanded from HLA-A2+ melanoma patients and healthy donors using artificial antigen presenting cells (aAPC) or peptide-pulsed dendritic cells. Tetramer positive cells were sorted after 14-22 days and CDR3β sequenced. Motif analysis based on sequence homology was performed using the Immunomap algorithm by clustering 11,252 unique MART-1 CDR3β sequences from 33 samples and 20 donors, including five nivolumab responders and five non-responders [2].</p><p id="Par254"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par255">No significant difference in the frequency of MART-1 expanded T cells was seen between healthy donors and melanoma patients with or without checkpoint therapy. There was no immunodominant Vβ gene usage and limited clonotype overlap between donors. However, sequence homology showed extensive overlap between donors, driven by two clusters present in 60% and 80% of samples at average frequencies of 10% and 14%, respectively. These clusters were homologous to each other as well as the DMF4 T cell receptor (TCR), one of the first clinically used genetically engineered T cells, with a known crystal structure [3,4]. The core region of these clusters contained a conserved amino acid motif that was identical to contact residues between the DMF4 TCR and MART-1 peptide bound to HLA-A2. The motif identified from the core region of these clusters was highly conserved across samples, present almost exclusively in the junctional region between the D and J genes of the CDR3β, and encoded by a diverse range of nucleotides, all evidence of selective pressure. Despite its conservation, the frequency of this motif was nearly six times lower in pre-therapy samples expanded from non-responders compared to responders (40% vs. 7%, p=0.0045, Figure 1).</p><p id="Par256"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par257">Since the frequency of the identified MART-1 TCR motif is significantly lower in non-responders compared to responders, it could potentially be used as a biomarker to predict response of HLA-A2+ melanoma patients to checkpoint blockade prior to the onset of therapy.</p><p id="Par258"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par259">1.

In this context, whether testing CAR-T cells, checkpoint inhibitors, or novel bispecific antibodies, the ultimate goal is to modulate the immune system to harness its tumor killing power. T cells play a critical role in immune-regulated clearance of both liquid and solid tumors. Upon antigenic stimulation and activation, T cells rapidly expand, secrete cytokines, and differentiate to various functional subsets (e.g. effector T cells, memory T cells). On the other hand, suppression of T cells (i.e. exhaustion) leads to immune escape and the spread of tumor cells. Mouse models remain the most commonly used animal system for in vivo and in vitro cancer biology research and drug discovery. As researchers move forward to either better understand the role of T cells in cancer biology or to develop novel immunotherapies, there is a need for improved methods to quickly gather comprehensive data on T cell biology in this model. To address this, we demonstrate a multiplexed, high-throughput, robust assay workflow capable of measuring multiple murine T cell biology endpoints quickly and reproducibly in a single-well format.</p><p id="Par268"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par269">In our workflow, stimulated mouse T cells were assayed in a 96-well plate using fluorescent antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8, CD69, CD44, CD62L, and PD-1, QBeads for cytokine detection, and markers for cell viability and proliferation.

Approximately 15% of human colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) display mismatch repair deficiency (MSI-H) associated with increased somatic mutations and sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockers. Advanced tumors can harbor additional DNA-repair alterations with functional/therapeutic implications. Increased double strand DNA breaks have been reported across solid tumors and can be detected by changes in Serine139-phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX).

MSI-H cases displayed lower tumor-cell B2M and increased stromal HLA-class II expression. MSI-H tumors also showed significantly higher levels of IL-8 and MPO+ cells than MSS counterpart. The level of γH2AX was comparable between MSI-H and MSS malignancies. Cases with increased tumor-cell γH2AX (&gt; cohort median) showed significantly higher levels of PD-L1 and all studied lymphocyte markers than cases with lower γH2AX. In addition, these tumors displayed significantly higher T-cell proliferation, mild increases in T-cell GZB and higher levels of HLA-class I/class II proteins.

The immune microenvironment of NSCLC is diverse with many players that can impact tumor development and clinical outcomes. In particular, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are important components of the immunosuppressive network that can hinder the activity of T cells, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells. MDSC in the blood may represent prognostic markers for NSCLC patients and for monitoring a patient’s response to immunotherapies. There is a gap in the relevance of MDSC within the tissue context due to limitations with conventional immunohistochemistry. Multiplex immunofluorescence offers a technical advantage by allowing the detection of co-expression and spatial organization of multiple targets within a preserved tissue architecture on a single slide.</p><p id="Par373"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par374">We have developed the multiplex immunofluorescence Histoprofile-MDSC panel to identify monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC) and polymorphonuclear MDSC (PMN-MDSC) in situ.

Thirty percent of a glioma’s cellular mass may be attributed to immunosuppressive and pro-tumoral tumor-associated myeloid cells (TAMCs), primarily myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) [1-4]. Multiple preclinical studies and clinical trials have attempted to target these cells; however, monitoring responses to these therapies remains a challenge. Quantifying TAMCs within gliomas using an antibody-based tracer for non-invasive positron emission tomography (immunoPET) may allow for better patient stratification, monitoring of treatment efficacy, and ultimately improve survival rates [5-9]. Integrin CD11b is a cellular marker expressed on the surface of TAMCs frequently used to identify macrophages and microglia.

Additionally, no uptake was observed in the brain of non-tumor bearing mice that received 89Zr-ant- CD11b.

A third subtype of dMMR colorectal cancer (CRC) and endometrial cancer (EC) have neither LS nor MLH1 promoter methylation and are referred to as suspected Lynch syndrome (SLS). There remains a knowledge gap as to whether the tumour microenvironment (TiME) is different between LS, MLH1-methylated and SLS dMMR CRC and EC. The aim of this study was to characterise and identify immune patterns within the TiME that may enhance the current clinical triaging of LS, SLS and MLH1-methylated subtypes of dMMR CRC and EC.</p><p id="Par424"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par425">Ten FFPE samples from seven individuals were studied: CRC (N=5; 1xLS, 2xMLH1 methylated, 1xSLS and 1x proficient MMR (pMMR)) and EC (N=2; 1xLS and 1xpMMR) and where available adjacent normal tissue (N=5: 3xcolon and 2xendometrium) were characterized using the Ultivue UltiMapper I/O portfolio (InSituPlex) on a Leica Bond autostainer and digitally acquired using the Zeiss Axio Scan Z1. We evaluated CD3, CD8, CD11c, CD20, CD45RO, CD68, CD163, Granzyme B, Ki-67, MHC II, PD-1, PD-L1, and pan-cytokeratin. Tissue phenomic approaches were developed to spatially characterize, quantify immune cell patterns and visualize heterogeneity within the TiME (Figure 1).</p><p id="Par426"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par427">InSituPlex technology enabled the visualization of the heterogenous infiltration and co-localization patterns across LS dMMR CRC (Figures 2&amp;3). Tissue phenomic approaches demonstrated the following; within the SLS category the colon cancer had higher mean areas of intraepithelial (IE) PD-L1 (6% vs. 2%), CD8 (18% vs. 8%) and CD68 (28% vs. 12%) compared to the pMMR EC. The MLH1 methylated tumour with a high tumour mutation burden (33.84 mutations/MB) had a higher mean area of IE PD-L1 (8% vs. 2%) and CD8 (30% vs. 5%) while the tumour with low TMB had a higher mean area of IE CD68 (15% vs. 8%). Within LS, the EC had a higher mean area of IE PD-L1 compared to the CRC (14% vs. 0%), in contrast the CRC had a higher IE CD8 area (27% vs. 10%) (Figures 4&amp;5).</p><p id="Par428"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par429">This study evaluated the immune contexture within inherited and sporadic subtypes of dMMR CRCs and ECs, highlighting differing immune infiltration patterns and phenomic densities.

Here, we developed viralMIBI, a highly sensitive method capable of detecting down to single copies of nucleic acids, in addition to protein epitopes. ViralMIBI enables the functional dissection of the immune landscape in viral driven diseases, such as that of tumor viruses (HBV, EBV, LCV) and others (HIV, SIV, Zika, Ebola). The combination of viralMIBI and cutting-edge cell neighborhood analytical methods will be paramount to better understand the immunological host-pathogen interactions for viral diseases, revealing insights into virus-induced immunodeficiency as well as virus-driven cancers.</p><p id="Par439"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par440">To allow for the sensitive detection of nucleic acids, we took advantage of a customized branched DNA amplification method that can be easily adapted to a variety of multiplexed imaging platforms.

The main current treatment for GCT is surgery, however a subset require chemotherapy for residual and recurrent disease. GCT malignancies are often low-grade, however a clinical characteristic of these tumors is a tendency for late recurrence which is the most critical factor for GCT death. As the onset of recurrence is unpredictable, future research should focus on identifying both biomarkers for prognosis prediction, as well as targets that could help guide clinical trials in the development of targeted therapies for this rare indication. As GCTs are rare tumors making tissue availability very limited, we used a dual multiplexing approach in order to maximize the data output from a total of 14 FFPE tumor samples (6 primary tumors, and 8 recurrent tumors).</p><p id="Par451"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par452">For protein multiplexing we have used MultiOmyx™, an immunofluorescence (IF) multiplexing assay utilizing a pair of directly conjugated Cyanine dye-labeled (Cy3, Cy5) antibodies per round of staining (Figure 1). Each round of staining is imaged and followed by dye inactivation enabling repeated rounds of staining and deactivation, while deep learning based cell classification algorithms identify positive cells for each biomarker. We generated a 15-marker panel consisting of CD3, CD4, CD8, FoxP3, CD68, CD163, HLA-DR, CD34, CTLA-4, PD-1, PD-L1, Ki67, vimentin, S100, and Pan Cytokeratin. For the gene expression analysis RNA was extracted from the adjacent 10 μm section and then analyzed using the Nanostring nCounter assay, specifically the 770 gene PanCancer Immune Panel. Hybridization, purification and immobilization and counts were based on manufacturer’s protocol.</p><p id="Par453"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par454">On protein level we confirmed previous findings that ovarian GCTs are so-called “cold” tumors, with a very low density of T cell infiltration. When we analyzed the presence of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment however, we found a 113% increase in TAM density in recurrent tumors compared to primary tumors. When searching for markers differentially expressed between primary and recurrent tumors we detected 4 genes in our PanCancer immune panel that were either significantly down-regulated (CCND3 or TOLLIP), or up-regulated (MAP3K and TNFSF4) in recurrent tumors. TNFSF4 encodes the protein OX40L, and interestingly a high expression of its receptor OX40 has previously been shown to be indicative for response to chemotherapy in recurrent ovarian cancer [1].</p><p id="Par455"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par456">We have used a dual multiplexing approach on both gene and protein level in order to immunoprofile the tumor microenvironment of ovarian rare granulosa tumors.</p><p id="Par457"><bold>Reference</bold></p><p id="Par458">1.

Until recently, characterizing protein markers on single cells was limited to a handful of markers due to the technical and logistical challenges of flow cytometry platforms. New advancements in single cell analysis technologies have enabled researchers to study more than 30 parameters per cell. But these platforms are expensive and require significant panel design, thereby limiting access and usability. Here we demonstrate the use of the recently launched CODEX System to generate an in-depth immune profile of human PBMC samples.</p><p id="Par462"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par463">The CODEX® System is an affordable, benchtop instrument that integrates with existing fluorescence microscopes and enables highly multiplexed imaging of over 40 markers in fresh frozen and FFPE tissue samples. The CODEX technology uses a DNA-based barcode library to label antibodies and iterative cycles of adding and removing cognate dye-labeled oligonucleotides to reveal the staining of three markers per cycle. Data acquisition is fully automated by the CODEX instrument. We tested a custom panel of more than 25 markers on the PBMC samples and acquired the images using a Keyence benchtop microscope.</p><p id="Par464"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par465">The CODEX system was used to generate highly multiplexed immune profiles of human PBMC samples using an optimized custom panel of CODEX antibodies. The images were processed using the CODEX Software Suite and cell phenotypes were clustered and annotated using the Multiplexed Analysis Viewer (MAV). Antibody specificity and panel performance were evaluated by assessing co-expression and mutually exclusive expression of relevant immune markers with the CODEX analysis pipeline.</p><p id="Par466"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par467">Simultaneous analysis of tens of markers in blood or plasma samples can have several applications in the discovery of cellular biomarkers, immune monitoring and drug discovery and development. This preliminary study shows the compatibility of the CODEX system with cell suspensions for highly multiplexed, single-cell analysis and offers a more cost-effective method for immune profiling of blood samples.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec170"><title>P44 Solar-IHC: Cell-to-cell distances in the tumour immune microenvironment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma has the potential to prognosticate survival</title><sec id="Sec171"><title>Matthew Leong, NA<sup>1</sup>, Toh Han Chong<sup>2</sup>, Choo Su Pin<sup>2</sup>, Kiat Hon Lim Tony<sup>3</sup>, Joycelyn Lee<sup>2</sup>, David Wai<sup>2</sup>, Poh Sheng Joe Yeong<sup>4</sup>, Jin Miao Chen, PhD<sup>5</sup></title><sec id="Sec172"><title><sup>1</sup>Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; <sup>2</sup>National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; <sup>3</sup>Singapore General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; <sup>4</sup>Department of Anatomical Pathology, Singapore General hospital, Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; <sup>5</sup>Singapore Immunology Network, Agency of Science, Technology and Research, Singapore, Singapore, Singapore</title><sec id="Sec173"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Jin Miao Chen (Chen_Jinmiao@immunol.a-star.edu.sg)</title><p id="Par468"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par469">Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal cancer, being the fourth leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide due to its low five-year survival and high reoccurrence rates [1], and identifying indicators of prognosis is key in developing novel treatments and improving survival of HCC patients. With the advent of digital pathology, the immune-architecture of solid tumours has become a central interest of cancer research and has been studied for the development of predictive and diagnostic applications. Here, we have assessed if intercellular Euclidean distances in the tumour immune microenvironment can possibly be used to predict patient prognosis.</p><p id="Par470"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par471">In this study, biopsies were taken from 110 HCC patients who underwent surgical resection. The solar-IHC pipeline involves arranging the liver biopsies into tissue arrays and subsequently studying them using automated multiplex immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence (mIHC/IF) protocol developed in Singapore General Hospital, with biomarkers Ecadherin, CD3, CD8, CD103 and PD1 [2], followed by image analysis software inForm version 2.4.2.</p><p id="Par472"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par473">Ecadherin was adopted as the tumour cell marker, and 26 immune cell phenotypes are defined by variable levels of immune markers CD8, CD103, and PD-1 (as shown in Table 1) Dimensionality reduction and unsupervised clustering of the distances between tumour and immune cell phenotypes showed distinct clusters of patients with significant differences in clinical outcomes. Long cell-cell distances between immune cell phenotypes and tumor cells was associated with an improved overall survival (p-value = 0.02) and disease-free survival (p-value = 0.01), while the opposite was true for short cell-cell distances between immune cell phenotypes and tumor cells. This was observed in the analysis of all CD8+, CD8-, CD103+, CD103-, PD1+ and PD1- cells, possibly due to the suppressive immunomodulatory effect Ecadherin+ tumour cells has on neighbouring immune cells [3]. Furthermore, machine learning enabled the prediction of clusters with considerable accuracy, with a K-fold cross-validation of 91%. This indicates a strong association of cell-cell distances with patient survival, and a robust reproducibility of distance pattern-based predictors.</p><p id="Par474"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par475">In this study, our data suggests that the analysis of intercellular distances has the potential to be used as a prognostic indicator in HCC. Coupled with next generation machine learning techniques, this novel approach to cell-to-cell distance analysis has the potential to be an easily implementable algorithm to predict patient prognosis in HCC. This bioinformatics approach can also be utilized in the analysis of other biomarkers and cancer types, and this brings exciting prospects for the future of cancer research.</p><p id="Par476"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par477">1.

Depending on biological interactions and functional state, immune cell populations can either promote or suppress tumor progression. CD8+ T cells, for example, are the primary mediators of anti-tumor immunity; however, they are often ineffective either because they are unable to infiltrate the tumor or because they become functionally exhausted [1,2], Pathologically activated myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) which infiltrate the tumor are also associated with tumor progression [3,4]. Multiple biomarkers are required to accurately identify these individual immune cell types and their functional states. In this work, we employ advanced multiplexing techniques to observe biologically and functionally distinct T cell and MDSC populations and to quantify their density and distribution within the TME of several tumor types.</p><p id="Par485"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par486">UltiMapper assays were used to perform multiplex immunofluorescence on multiple tumor FFPE samples (lung, colorectal, breast).

Current immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods limit the depth of information from a single tissue sample to a single target in the case of chromogenic staining, or to sample morphology and general cell identification in the case of hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&amp;E). True phenotyping requires the use of a single section, as serial sections may not contain the same cells, especially small immune cells such as T-cells. Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) methods have been established to provide insights into a wide number of markers of interest and their spatial context in a single sample.

Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a novel tomographic molecular imaging technique that can be used to non-invasively track iron-oxide tagged immune cells in 3D in vivo, with contrast similar to nuclear medicine but without the complex workflow, safety, and half-life limitations. In this study, we compared the behavior of monocytes loaded with nanoparticles in vitro and nanoparticles injected intravenously and subsequently taken up by phagocytic cells (in situ loading) and imaged using MPI the differences in biodistribution and migration of monocytes in in naïve and tumor-bearing and naïve (control) mice.</p><p id="Par506"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par507">Twenty mice were implanted with 300,000 4T1 tumour cells in the 4th mammary fat pad. CD11b+ mouse monocytes were harvested using EasySep® Mouse CD11b positive selection kit II (StemCell Technologies). The isolated monocytes were prelabeled with Vivotrax® (100 μg/mL). On day 7 post-implantation, either 5 million prelabeled cells or free Vivotrax (6 mg/kg) were intravenously injected into normal or tumor-bearing mice for in vitro or in situ targeting experiments (N=5 mice for all four groups). 3D MPI images using a MOMENTUM MPI system (Magnetic Insight) were acquired 1, 4, 7 and 10 days after injection.

Although hugely successful, there are limitations. In many studies, less than half the patients are responsive to therapy. One hypothesis is that refractory tumours are immunologically ‘cold’ – i.e., there are insufficient immune cells in the tumour for the therapy to be efficacious [2]. Thus, methods to stimulate an immunogenic response in solid tumours to improve immunotherapy efficacy are desirable.</p><p id="Par514">Hyperthermia is known to induce a local immunogenic response, making it a potential adjunct to radiation and immune therapies. One hyperthermia method is Magnetic Fluid Hyperthermia (MFH), which is based on electromagnetic heating of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) [3,4]. , However, poor control of heating localization and magnitude have prevented MFH’s widespread clinical adoption.</p><p id="Par515">Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is an emerging tracer imaging technique that directly detects and quantitates superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles with exceptional contrast and high sensitivity at millimeter-scale resolutions [5]. MPI’s contrast is similar to nuclear medicine, but without the complex workflow, safety, and half-life limitations of a radioactive tracer.</p><p id="Par516"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par517">Here we describe how MPI and MFH can be combined to produce spatially localized heating and accurate control of heating magnitude. Spatial localization is achieved using a unique mechanism, magnetic localization. Localization is effected by using a strong magnetic field gradient to produce a “field-free region” (FFR) where nanoparticles are heated, while nanoparticles outside the FFR are quenched and do not heat. The use of an FFR thus enables millimeter-scale control over which MNPs are heated [6-8].</p><p id="Par518"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par519">MPI is first used to quantitate the MNPs prior to heating, to enable treatment planning and prediction of the heating dose. MFH can then be induced in target regions of interest located anywhere in the body while avoiding regions containing MNPs that should not be heated, such as the liver or lymph nodes.</p><p id="Par520"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par521">Combined MPI-MFH enables new treatment workflows that exploit spatially localized MFH and accurate control of heating magnitude. These workflows may resemble image-guided radiation therapy or image-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound. Combined MPI-MFH also prevents damage to nearby healthy tissue while enabling new applications such as targeted immunogenic stimulation. MPI-MFH also enables new heat-actuation applications involving systemic injection of MNPs followed by local targeting such as local release of a drug [9] (break thermally labile bonds/nanocarriers) without requiring active chemical targeting.

The pathogenesis of these disorders is thought to involve dysregulation of mucosal immune homeostasis in the GIT in response to environmental factors in genetically susceptible individuals [2]. Regulatory T cells (Treg) are CD4+ T lymphocytes that play a central role in peripheral immune tolerance, actively inhibiting inflammation upon antigenic stimulation. There are two major populations of Treg: conventional Treg and TR1 cells [3]. Conventional Treg arise from the thymus (tTreg) or can be induced in the periphery (pTreg); both tTreg and pTreg constitutively express FoxP3 and CD25 (IL-2Rα). An imbalance in conventional Treg and effector T cells in the GIT microenvironment is thought to play a part in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [4]. Thus, we sought to quantify conventional Treg and CTL populations in GIT tissue sections from IBD patients versus normal individuals by multiplex immunofluorescence.</p><p id="Par534"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par535">Conventional Treg are typically defined as lymphocytes with a CD3+/CD4+/CD25+/FoxP3+ immuno-phenotype. This complex antigenic signature has made it difficult to definitively label Treg populations in tissue sections by immunohistochemistry. We combined a 5-plex (CD3, CD4, CD8α, CD25, FoxP3) immunofluorescence assay using Ultivue InSituPlex® multiplex technology with image analysis using Indica Labs HaloTM software to identify, localize and enumerate: 1) total CD3+ T cells, 2) CD8α+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and 3) CD3+/CD4+/CD25+/FoxP3+ conventional Treg in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections of GIT from patients with UC and CD versus controls.

Multiplex immunostainings allow studying the interaction of different cell types in the tumor microenvironment using a single tissue slide. Though several techniques are available to perform high-plex stainings, they require intensive manual handling, are highly time consuming or not compatible with tissue sections on standard microscope slides. Here we present a fully automated microscope integrated method for rapid high-plex sequential fluorescent immunostaining and imaging of tissue sections.</p><p id="Par549"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par550">Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections underwent manual dewaxing and antigen retrieval step. All subsequent steps of staining, antibody elution and imaging were automated on the microscope integrated microfluidic device. A single tissue section was stained sequentially for 24 different immunophenotyping and tissue structural markers. Each staining cycle consisted of incubation of the tissue section with a pair of mouse and rabbit primary antibodies, followed by the corresponding fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies and DAPI. The section was imaged after each staining cycle and subsequently eluted before staining the next pair of markers.</p><p id="Par551"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par552">Our microscope integrated microfluidic system allowed automated 24-plex staining with conventional primary and fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies in less than five hours, including image acquisition steps. The microfluidic tissue processor enabled fast fluidic exchange and thereby resulted in reduced staining time down to 10-12min per marker. Integration of a window into the microfluidic chip allowed direct tissue imaging under the microscope avoiding the removal and mounting of the slide. Protocol optimization resulted in a high signal to background noise ratio for each marker and complete elution of antibodies from the previous staining step. A comparison of a 10-plex staining with standard chromogenic stainings on sequential sections showed high concordance for the stained area on tonsil as well as lung cancer tissue sections (Figure 1).</p><p id="Par553"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par554">With the microscope integrated microfluidic system, it is possible to perform fast multiplex stainings including image acquisition without the need to handle the tissue slide.

At the highest level, cells were classified as positive for markers that are indicative of immune and tumor cells based on measured intensities of marker expression, such as CD45+ and keratin+ cells in epithelial cancers, respectively. Co-expression of markers were used to classify immune cells into subsets, including T cells and macrophages (Figure 1).

Multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) instead, allows for visualization of plenty of biomarkers at once with true co-localization. However, visualizing tissue morphology in mIF images can be challenging and the vast color combinations overwhelming. Pathologists are key to retrieve biological information from multiplex assays and provide annotations for assay validation. To support pathologist analysis, resections of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients were stained with mIF and displayed as pseudo mIHC images. Additionally, consecutive slides were stained with a mIHC panel. PD-L1 positive macrophages from the pseudo mIHC images were quantified and compared to the readouts identified in the real chromogenic IHC.</p><p id="Par599"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par600">7 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) resections from NSCLC patients were stained using Ultivue’s UltiMapper I/O PD-L1 kit and I/O PD-1 kit and whole image scans were acquired with a Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 scanner (Zeiss). Consecutive slides were stained with a multiplex chromogenic panel (including CD68, CD8, PD-1) at Mosaic Laboratories (1) and scanned with an Aperio AT Turbo scanner (Leica). Images were analyzed using an automated workflow for quantitative multiplex image analysis developed at Definiens (2). Afterwards, mIF images were converted into pseudo mIHC images.

We characterized the spatial arrangement of myeloid subpopulations, ex vivo and correlated the changes in spatial orientation, quantity and localization of cells to the tumor.

However, there is a critical gap in our understanding for the role of immune cells to drive response or resistance to drugs and immunotherapies at the individual patient level. This is primarily due to limitations in complex tumor-immune interfaces that exist in many current tumor models.</p><p id="Par625"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par626">Here, we deployed an ex-vivo human system that uses an explant of native, patient-derived solid tumors including autologous immune cells. Utilizing biopsied tumor tissue from patients diagnosed with triple-negative (ER- PR- HER2-) breast cancers (TNBC, N=7), we studied drug-induced cell death (cleaved caspase-3) and spatial heterogeneity of NK cells (CD3-CD56+PanCK-) using multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC). Spatial orientation of cells in the microenvironment, including proximity of NK to tumor and NK cell density within regions of the tumor vs. stroma were performed using HALO-based quantitative analyses.

Finally, using the 3-D tumor organoid cultures with NK cells, we determined that activity and tumor cytolysis by NK cells is hampered through cancer cell-activated cytokines, which diminish expression of activating biomarkers including NKG2D/C.</p><p id="Par629"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par630">Taken together, these results provide a method to study the spatial arrangement of immune cells in an entirely human system, which can be perturbed with anticancer drugs to reliably influence the expression and growth patterns of immune cells.

Although this method can provide reliable data, they can show variability in consistency depending on the markers [1], which affects the reliability of mIF for use in clinical trials.

The mIF panel was developed with a secondary antibody detection and TSA, using specific fluorophores for each marker. Once optimized, the miF panel was tested on serial sections of formalin-fixed human tonsil controls and six non-small cell lung carcinomas, including replicates, together with standard IHC staining of each individual marker for comparison.

Recently, with the development of multiplexed ion beam imaging (MIBI), 40+ biomarkers can be simultaneously measured in a single scan [1]. By probing with an ion beam, tissue sections can be imaged at a spatial resolution on the same order of magnitude as light based techniques, providing subcellular resolution.

The centroids of each predicted cell instance were used as seed points and, after manual refinement of these seed points, watershed segmentation was performed to determine boundaries between instances.

Whole slide scans were generated using the Vectra Polaris® and analyzed using InForm® image analysis package.</p><p id="Par686"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par687">Development time of a seven-color mIF was reduced using IHC validated antibodies and the optimized dilution. Antibody order was guided by results of three slides stained after first, third or sixth HEIR. The ratio of target staining/DAPI nuclear counts, average intensity and overall background predicts the optimal order of staining. Some targets reveal larger average area staining, higher intensity and lower background when stained last, for example FOXP3 (Table 1, Figure 1), while the inverse may be true, or no effect for other targets. There are 720 possible combinations for a seven-color panel. Using this method, the number of slides was reduced to three per target (18) plus confirmation seven-color slides resulting in a panel containing CD3, CD8, CD68, Cytokeratin, FOXP3 and PD-L1 (Figure 2).</p><p id="Par688"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par689">Multiplex IF is a powerful technique that allows for examination of spatial arrangement of proteins of interest as well as protein interaction/co-localization of multiple targets within a single tissue specimen.

The spatial relationships between infiltrating immune cells and the remodeling of the cellular matrix is widely recognized as a key component to defining tumor heterogeneity. Current methodologies for analyzing the spatial dimension in tissues, like traditional immunofluorescence (IF) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), are limited to a few parameters at a time, restricting the scope of identifiable cells. Conversely, single-cell technologies like mass cytometry and NGS-based tools provide multiplexing capabilities, but at the expense of the associated spatial information. Here, we present the analysis of human lung cancer FFPE tissues with CODEX using a panel of more than 20 markers targeting the tumor microenvironment.</p><p id="Par703"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par704">The CODEX technology, developed by Akoya, is comprised of a fluidics instrument that interfaces with existing microscope hardware, as well as a suite of reagents and associated control and analysis software. The CODEX technology involves labeling antibodies with oligonucleotide-based Barcodes followed by a single staining step. Around 40 parameters can be measured within a single tissue through fully-automated, iterative cycles of adding and removing corresponding dye-conjugated Reporters. Here, we apply this technology using a panel of antibodies targeting immune, cancer and other architectural features to measure cell subsets in cancer FFPE tissues. Image data is processed using the CODEX analysis pipeline, including clustering, annotation and mapping of cell types to the original image data with the Multiplexed Analysis Viewer (MAV).</p><p id="Par705"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par706">The CODEX technology was used to ascertain complex cellular niches and spatial associations between multiple cell types based on the staining pattern of more than 20 parameters. The high-parameter antibody panel used was optimized with human FFPE tonsil tissues. Human lung cancer FFPE tissues were then analyzed with this same panel. Cell clustering using the MAV software identified tens of cell types within the tumor tissues. Immune cell sub-types were mapped onto the original image data to assess infiltration and spatial associations.</p><p id="Par707"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par708">Unlike other cyclic IF approaches involving multiple antibody staining and stripping steps, the CODEX platform involves a single initial staining step and subsequent gentle and relatively fast manipulation of the tissue thereafter. This provides a superior workflow and prevents tissue degradation. CODEX data from various normal and cancer human FFPE tissue types is shown here with corresponding single-cell analysis of key tissue features. Overall, the CODEX platform is an accessible and versatile technology for high parameter, spatial profiling of tissue specimens.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec254"><title>P65 Mutation-targeted T cell responses in blood from patients with solid tumors prior to treatment and which evolve with clinical benefit from anti-PD-1 therapies</title><sec id="Sec255"><title>Benjamin Yuen, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Fangfang Yin, PhD<sup>2</sup>, Duo An, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Boi Quach<sup>1</sup>, Linlin Guo, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Joanne Tan, PhD<sup>2</sup>, Songming Peng, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Zheng Pan, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Olivier Dalmas, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Robert Bao, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Kyle Jacoby, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Barbara Sennino, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Stefanie Mandl, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Matt Walters, PhD<sup>2</sup>, Juan Jaen, PhD<sup>2</sup>, Alex Franzusoff, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Benjamin Yuen, PhD<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec256"><title><sup>1</sup>PACT Pharma, South San Francisco, CA, United States; <sup>2</sup>Arcus Biosciences, Hayward, CA, United States</title><sec id="Sec257"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Songming Peng (speng@pactpharma.com)</title><p id="Par709"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par710">T cells targeting tumor-exclusive neoepitopes (neoE) have been postulated to represent the primary mediators of clinical benefit for patients with solid tumors treated with immunotherapies. Identifying and tracking these T cells in patients can help to understand the mechanism for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies, as well as provide new therapeutic candidates for personalized adoptive cell therapies. However, this has been hampered by the low frequency of neoE-specific T cells in peripheral blood. To this end, we demonstrate the use of the imPACT Isolation Technology®, an ultra-sensitive high-throughput technology, to capture neoE-specific CD8 T (neoE-T) cells from peripheral blood. In addition, this technology can be utilized to quantify and monitor neoE-T cells longitudinally during therapy.

Given the proximity of DIPG to parenchymal regions that play vital homeostatic functions, surgical resections are often restricted in size and scope, leaving irradiation and chemotherapy as the primary management options. The ongoing development of immunotherapy has shown significant promise in many fields, including that of gliomas. Genetic studies revealed that greater than 70% of DIPG cases harbor an amino acid substitution from lysine (K) to methionine (M) at position 27 of histone 3 variant 3 (H3.3). We previously identified a novel HLA-A*02:01-restricted neoantigen epitope encompassing the H3.3K27M mutation. Accordingly, we have implemented a pilot vaccine through the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC).</p><p id="Par721"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par722">Twenty-nine newly diagnosed DIPG patients who are HLA-A2+ and H3.3K27M+ underwent radiation therapy, and then received the H3.3K27M peptide vaccine and tetanus toxoid (TT) peptide emulsified in Montanide in combination with poly-ICLC every 3 weeks for a total of 24 weeks. Our objective is to characterize vaccine-induced H3.3K27M-specific CD8+ T-cell and myeloid-derived immunosuppressive subpopulations in peripheral blood mononuclear cells utilizing a novel H3.3K27M-specific dextramer-based mass cytometry (CyTOF) method [1,2].</p><p id="Par723"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par724">Through this approach, the temporal expansion of vaccine-reactive CD8+ T-cells was observed in all patients who completed a minimum of 24 weeks on the study (n = 4).

These T-cells were clustered on a tSNE plot using canonical CD8+ T-cell activation markers and further classified by their expression profiles, revealing distinct effector memory, central memory and transitional effector subpopulations. Chronological monitoring of these groups indicates the time course-dependent development and persistence of vaccine-reactive exhausted and effector memory CD8+ T-cells in 3 of the 4 initial patients analyzed. Furthermore, an analogous clustering and phenotyping approach was used for myeloid cells, allowing for the identification of myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) subpopulations.

Currently, most data about the incidence of irAE comes from clinical trials with restrictive eligibility requirements. With the wide use of ICI therapy as standard of care for many cancers, it is important to assess incidence of irAE in a general patient population. The Chicago Area Patient Reported Outcomes Research Network (CAPriCORN) is a clinical data research network containing medical records for &gt;9.5M patients who receive care in 11 institutions spanning diverse patient populations and healthcare settings [1].

This has provided a better understanding of the role this pathway plays in tumor immunology and of its clinical utility in predicting responsiveness to checkpoint inhibitor therapies. T cell exhaustion is not only associated with tumor progression, but has recently been associated with better prognosis and milder course of disease for a number of autoimmune and autoinflammatory disorders. We set out to characterize and contrast the T-cell exhaustion environment between colonic Crohn’s disease (CD) and colorectal cancer (CRC). We applied the Ultivue UltiMapper multiplex fluorescence IHC platform to capture complex immune cell phenotypes and provide a more in depth characterization than traditional IHC.</p><p id="Par779"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par780">Commercially sourced FFPE surgical resections from n=5 colonic CD patients (matched lesional and non-lesional tissue) were compared to n=5 CRC tumor resections (3 hot and 2 cold tumors) using the Ultivue UltiMapper multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry platform. Two UltiMapper kits were used to evaluate the T cell environment in these tissues: UltiMapper I/O PD-L1 panel included the markers CD8, CD68, PD-L1, and pan-Cytokeratin/Sox10; UltiMapper I/O PD-1 panel included the markers CD3, CD45RO, PD-1, and pan-Cytokeratin/Sox10. All assays were stained on Leica BOND RX autostainers. Whole-slide images were acquired on a ZEISS Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner. Image analysis was performed using Indica Labs HALO software.</p><p id="Par781"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par782">Contrasted to non-lesional CD tissues, several similarities were observed between CD lesional tissue and CRC, including the presence of PD-L1+ immunoreactivity in epithelial/tumor cells, increased immunoreactivity for PD-L1 in CD68+ cells, and a closer relationship between intra-epithelial and stromal CD8+ cells with PD-L1+ cells. In addition, areas in CRC and CD heavily infiltrated by immune cells or with tertiary lymphoid structures contained clusters of PD-L1+ cells that were negative for both CD68 and pan-Cytokeratin. Most of the CD3+ cells in non-lesional CD were PD-1 negative, except around tertiary lymphoid structures. In contrast, a greater percentage of CD3+ cells were also PD-1+ in CRC, and more so in lesional CD tissue.</p><p id="Par783"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par784">The Ultivue UltiMapper multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemistry platform was effective in characterizing the PD-L1/PD-1 axis and T cell exhaustion environment in FFPE tissue, in part due to the ability to clearly identify more complex immune cell phenotypes than traditional multiplex IHC.

While IO treatment of patients with high TMB has led to success and excitement in the field, not all high TMB patients respond to IO treatment.

Adding this correction to the TMB calculation, including only variants that are expressed in the tumor in the TMB calculation, changes the average TMB values found among different cancer types, and corrects the TMB in individual samples.

Advances in immuno-affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) have enabled direct detection of MHC-bound peptides and can therefore be used for modelling native MHC-peptide presentation. Further, genetically engineered cell lines that express a single HLA allele enable unambiguous HLA-peptide assignment.

Identifying the full complement of peptides derived from a protein presented on a major class-I HLA restriction provides a vital step toward increasing the speed and viability of many immunotherapeutic strategies. Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) and single-cell technologies have enabled the accurate capture of somatic mutations accumulated by a tumour, yet a significant hurdle remains how this information can be utilized for immunotherapeutic benefit. Identifying which somatic mutations produce neoantigens is crucial in providing the link between genetic change and immunological impact.</p><p id="Par804"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par805">Directly identifying potential neoantigens using mass spectrometry offers a significant improvement over traditional approaches based on prediction.

Comparing predicted neoantigens with those directly identified by mass spectrometry, we show effective prioritization of mutations by accurately predicting the presence and relative abundance of neoantigens. Applying this process toward the five most commonly mutated genes in cancer reveals a marked bias toward mutations that either act negatively or are in ‘quiet’ areas of the immune landscape. As all mutated peptides contain novel amino acid sequence, and are hence able to elicit an immune response, this ability to convert ‘potential’ into ‘actual’ is crucial in establishing a mechanism for identifying false positive results observed in cell-based assays.</p><p id="Par809"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par810">An integrative multiomics approach to neoantigen identification has delivered a powerful reference for developing novel immunotherapies</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec290"><title>P74 Integrating CD8 and CD4 effector neo-epitope content with regulatory T cell epitope exclusion is a superior prognostic biomarker for bladder cancer patient compared to their tumor mutation burden</title><sec id="Sec291"><title>Guilhem Richard, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Randy Sweis, MD<sup>2</sup>, Matthew Ardito, BA<sup>1</sup>, Tzintzuni Garcia<sup>2</sup>, Leonard Moise, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Michael Princiotta, MS, PhD<sup>3</sup>, Dominique Bridon<sup>3</sup>, William Martin, BA MD<sup>1</sup>, Gad Berdugo, MSc, MBA<sup>3</sup>, Arjun Balar<sup>4</sup>, Gary Steinberg<sup>4</sup>, Anne de Groot, MD<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec292"><title><sup>1</sup>EpiVax, Inc., Providence, RI, United States; <sup>2</sup>University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, United States; <sup>3</sup>EpiVax Oncology, New York, NY, United States; <sup>4</sup>NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, United States</title><sec id="Sec293"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Gad Berdugo (gberdugo@epivaxonco.com)</title><p id="Par811"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par812">We hypothesized that neo-epitope-based prediction using an advanced in silico T cell epitope screening system (Ancer™) may better identify patients with improved prognosis than tumor mutation burden.

Adding Class II neo-epitope burden further increased separation of OS times, showcased by a 69.6-month increase in median survival for BLCA patients with both high CD8 and high CD4 neo-epitope contents compared to other patients (p = 0.0001). Since we discovered that Class II neo-epitopes can induce inhibitory responses, we further evaluated whether the screening of these detrimental sequences could improve our analysis. Upon identifying Class II neo-epitopes likely to induce T effector (Teff) responses, we found that the median survival of patients with high CD8 and high CD4 Teff contents was extended by nearly 4 months to 73.4 months compared, to the remainder of the cohort (p &lt; 0.0001, Figure 2).</p><p id="Par817"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par818">Our analysis suggests that optimal host-immune recognition of CD8+, CD4+, and Treg epitopes plays a key role in cancer survival.

At the variant level, samples with high deamination scores were analyzed dynamically as a function of allele frequency to study TMB values for correlation with WES.</p><p id="Par849"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par850">OTMLA TMB values showed good correlation with WES-derived TMB; however ~10% of tumor DNA samples had high TMB and deamination values outside the expected range. These samples were included as a subset of samples tested with and without the UDG repair step. UDG treatment decreased TMB and deamination scores, resulting in higher correlation with WES TMB values. Some samples with very high deamination scores were unable to be rescued; however, TMB values in samples with low deamination and minimal damage were not affected.</p><p id="Par851"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par852">We show that deaminated cytosine bases can be enzymatically removed by treatment with UDG. In a subset of FFPE samples tested, UDG treatment was demonstrated to reduce the OTMLA estimated SNP proportion consistent with deamination. This results in consistent and effective reduction of C&gt;T artifacts without affecting true variants and can provide TMB values in a biologically relevant range.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec310"><title>P79 Molecular comparison of tumor microenvironment in primary lung, melanoma, and kidney tumors versus paired lung metastases reveals shared perturbations of the immune milieu during oligoprogression</title><sec id="Sec311"><title>Davide Bedognetti, MD, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Jessica Roelands, Master<sup>1</sup>, Angelo Manfredi<sup>2</sup>, Norma Maugeri<sup>2</sup>, Francesca De Nicola<sup>3</sup>, Ludovica Ciuffreda<sup>3</sup>, Matteo Pallocca<sup>3</sup>, Maurizio Fanciulli<sup>3</sup>, Francesca Di Modugno, PhD<sup>3</sup>, Paolo Visca<sup>3</sup>, Barbara Antoniani<sup>3</sup>, Gabriele Alessandrini<sup>3</sup>, Darawan Rinchai, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Wouter Hendrickx, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Paola Nistico', MD<sup>3</sup>, Gennaro Ciliberto, MD<sup>3</sup></title><sec id="Sec312"><title><sup>1</sup>Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar; <sup>2</sup>IRCCS Ospedale San Raffaele, Milano, Italy; <sup>3</sup>Istituto Nazionale Tumori Regina Elena, Rome, Italy</title><sec id="Sec313"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Gennaro Ciliberto (gennaro.ciliberto@ifo.gov.it)</title><p id="Par853"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par854">The importance of tumor-host interactions during cancerogenesis and metastatic progression has been now widely appreciated. More recently, the impact of the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) to mold tumor evolution was convincingly demonstrated [1]. Solid tumors systemically reprogram the lung unique immune environment, dominated by intravascular neutrophil functions [2], to colonize this site. The concept of ‘oligoprogression’ has recently received mounting attention, due to its relevance and because it represents an interesting in vivo model to study TIME, although the specific mechanisms of oligometastatic process are relatively underinvestigated [3, 4].</p><p id="Par855"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par856">RNA sequencing was performed on a retrospective collection of tissue samples from primary renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and NSCLC and paired lung oligometastases of untreated patients (Figure 1). Enrichment of tumor-related pathways and transcripts that reflect the enrichment of immune cell subsets was assessed by single sample gene set enrichment analysis. Differentially expressed genes between primary tumors versus the corresponding lung metastases were used for pathway analysis. Neutrophils extracellular traps (NETs) were revealed by immunofluorescence, assessing extracellular DNA and citrullinated H4 histone co-localization and/or myeloperoxidase [5]. Autophagy was assessed the CYTO-ID® kit [5].</p><p id="Par857"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par858">While tumor-related pathway enrichment differed mostly according to the primary tumor histology, perturbations of immune-regulatory pathways was observed during oligoprogression in the lung. Deconvolution of immune cell subpopulations identified increased immature dendritic cells and reduced T cell abundance in oligometastatic lesions. Strikingly, a large proportion of differentially modulated pathways were “immune” rather than “cancer-cell”-related. Core analysis confirmed that the main transcriptomic network that is affected during disease progression is immune-based, centered on a cross-link between innate and adaptive immunity. Specifically, it was associated with decreased HLA, iCOS, IL-9, and IL-17 pathway activity and downregulation of interferon signaling. During progression, we observed coherent modulation of transcripts associated with NET generation, related to upregulation of key autophagic genes, to competition of the HMGB1 molecule with CXCL12 and CXCR4 and RAGE receptor (AGER) activation. Accordingly, NET expression was strikingly more abundant in lung metastases than in primary tumors.</p><p id="Par859"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par860">Our results identify evident molecular mechanisms associated with suppression of the immune milieu during disease oligoprogression in the lung across different tumors. They include innate-adaptive immune dysfunction HLA-mediated, and interferon dysregulation associated with neutrophil-mediated immune suppression. Since these tumors are targeted by immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) our data highlights the relevance of characterizing the TIME composition in paired primary and oligometastatic lesions during ICB treatment to optimize treatment approaches.</p><p id="Par861"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par862">Paola Nistico' and Gennaro Ciliberto are co-last authors.</p><p id="Par863"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par864">1.

Pharmacodynamic analyses demonstrated little to no impact of andecaliximab [3]. This exploratory biomarker analysis included all patients as a nivolumab-treated population.</p><p id="Par874"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par875">Evaluation of archival tumor tissue was described [2,3].

Differential gene expression analysis identified GRB7, a downstream mediator of HER2 signaling and part of the HER2/ERBB2 amplicon in breast cancer [4], as one of two genes associated with survival &gt;1 year (FDR=0.027). HER2-positivity (medical record) was associated with a 3.5-fold higher median expression of GRB7. Prolonged survival was associated with both HER2-positivity (n=43/132; HR=0.58, p=0.01) and the top quartile of GRB7 expression (n=25/94; HR=0.48, p=0.007). The median survival for HER2-positive patients was 10.1 months versus 5.95 months for HER2-negative. HER2 status was not associated with PD-L1 status or CD8+ infiltrate. Nearly all HER2-positive (n=40/43) and 2 HER2-negative patients received trastuzumab (median 62 days post-trastuzumab). Prior or best response was not related to 1 year survival and 2 of 3 HER2-positive patients that did not receive trastuzumab had &gt;1 year survival. TMB was also evaluated and significantly associated with HER2-positivity (N=61, p=0.041). In the subset of 61 patients with TMB data, patients with high TMB plus HER2-positivity had the longest median survival of 15.4 months compared to all other patients at 6.7 months (N=14 vs 47; HR=0.47; p=0.04).</p><p id="Par878"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par879">HER2 was associated with improved survival with checkpoint blockade in advanced GEA patients, regardless of response to prior trastuzumab.

TCRs typically contain both an alpha (α) and beta (β) chain that contribute to antigen specificity; however, we have seen multiple cases of a single cell containing dual α or dual β chains as well. When analyzing bulk repertoires, information about endogenous pairing of α and/or β chains is lost after bulk lysis of T-cell populations. Pairing α and β chains from a single cell while also analyzing the phenotypic expression allows us to track TCR specificity and T cell function. This information can provide direct calculations of clonal frequency in various cell subsets, allow tracking of specific lymphocytes with treatment, and reveal paired information for both chains of the receptor for downstream Car-T development.</p><p id="Par906"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par907">Here, we developed a method for high-throughput pairing of TCR α and β chains along with expression profiling.

Decision support tools were used for variant interpretation and evaluation of potential variant relevance.</p><p id="Par937"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par938">Over 500 genes with known DNA and RNA alterations were included. The panel has broad capability for variant calling, fusion detection, MSI status, in addition to TMB. Specifically, for TMB, DNA repair pathways were comprehensively represented as alterations in these genes may lead to high mutation burden. A coding sequence footprint to support TMB was generated. In development studies, the assay displayed high uniformity and consistent read depth to support robust variant calling. The automated workflow required minimal input of FFPE tumor only DNA and RNA material. Sample to report turnaround time was less than five days. In-silico assessment of TMB using publicly available whole-exome cancer sequencing data resulted in high correlation (R2 = 0.902, 0-40 mutations/Mb) and was parallel to the performance of our existing Oncomine Tumor Mutation Load Assay (R2 = 0.901, 0-40 mutations/Mb). Empirical analysis and performance of the assay on a common set of cell lines based on a universal reference standard also resulted in a positive correlation.</p><p id="Par939"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par940">A larger tumor only NGS assay was developed to support comprehensive genomic profiling and routine clinical research in oncology. The assay design and informatics workflow support characterization of mutational signatures and provide normalized TMB estimates.

This is driven by a dependency on legacy diagnostics, built on single-analyte biomarkers such as PD-L1, which have failed to capture the complexity of disease [2]. Even in the case of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), an indication where the benefit of IO therapies is considered significant, there is much to be learned about the biology of the patients who respond, or do not respond to these therapies.</p><p id="Par943"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par944">Multidimensional RNA models have emerged to move beyond these legacy methods to reveal the full scope of disease complexity, resulting in increased predictive accuracy. Leveraging a database of gene expression models built using Predictive Immune Modeling, immune context of the tumor microenvironment is quantified. In this study, a cohort of NSCLC patients who received second-line immunotherapies (checkpoint inhibitors) were evaluated retrospectively. Pre-treatment solid tumor FFPE tissue samples were processed using the ImmunoPrism immune profiling assay to generate comprehensive, individual immune profiles.

This is accomplished through the study of all seven TCR and BCR chains together (i.e., TCR-alpha, TCR-beta, TCR-delta, TCR-gamma, and BCR-IgK and -IgL).

This model was tested in the normal weight, overweight and obese populations.</p><p id="Par975"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par976">TCGA-SKCM melanoma tumor mRNA expression and clinical data for metastatic melanoma patients were downloaded from the GDC legacy archive (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/legacy-archive) (n = 471).[5] Biomarkers were defined as “high” or “low” expression in each patient.

We have previously introduced a gene signature, called Immunology Constant of Rejection (ICR), that reflects these immune components.[1–4] This signature was able to differentiate quite well the patients with an active immune environment and improved survival vs those who did not[5].</p><p id="Par1018">Virtually, all correlative analyses integrating exome and transcriptomic data in colon cancer based on publicly available date use the TCGA cohort. Although it is broadly accepted that T-cell infiltration influences prognosis in colon cancer[6], the association between transcriptomic immune signature and patient survival could not be observed in the TCGA colon cancer cohort. This is likely due to the per protocol exclusion of samples with low tumor purity (i.e., higher stromal/immune infiltration), as at that time TCGA consortium focused on defining cancer genetic makeup.

Recently, some reports have shown encouraging efficacy among patients who discontinued ICIs, leading to the hypothesis that irAEs-experienced patients have strong and long-lasting anti-cancer immune responses. So far, the molecular mechanisms of the immune response, particularly for T cells that play pivotal roles in attacking cancer cells, still remain unclear. Thus, characterization of T cell repertoire and immune signatures in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tumors before and after ICIs treatment should contribute to better understanding of irAEs-related anti-cancer immune responses.</p><p id="Par1041"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1042">In this study, we collected PBMCs from 4 urological cancer patients, before ICIs treatment and at the onset of severe irAEs. For 1 kidney cancer patient who had long durable response after discontinuation of ICIs, we also collected metastatic tissue sample and applied a next generation sequencing approach to characterize T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires using RNAs isolated from tumors and PBMCs.

Current biomarker strategies are based on cellular markers (eg, immunohistochemistry) or bulk molecular averages (eg, whole-exome sequencing). However, there is limited ability to integrate cellular and molecular data. Single-cell RNAseq (scRNAseq) is a promising technology allowing for an unbiased analysis of the tumor microenviroment (TME) at cellular resolution. Despite the immense potential, implementation of this technology in clinical trials has been limited due to lack of methodologies applicable to clinically relevant specimens such as core-needle biopsies (CNB). Here, we describe the development of clinically applicable scRNAseq technology and analysis.</p><p id="Par1051"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1052">Treatment-naïve commercially sourced tumor resections were used to generate ex-vivo CNB for scRNAseq analysis with 10X genomics. Post-clustering, unsupervised cell-type identification was performed (SingleR), and downstream analyses were carried out (Seurat v2, custom R). Cells from multiple patients/tumor types (endometrial, TNBC, NSCLC, ccRCC, gastrointestinal; n=8), and healthy donors (peripheral blood mononuclear cells; n=3) were combined, batch-corrected and aligned using canonical correlation analysis (CCA); and differential gene expression was performed (MAST algorithm).</p><p id="Par1053"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1054">CNB scRNAseq was optimized across 5 tumor types, and the resulting data from ~43,000 cells allowed for the unbiased identification of TME cellular components (stromal, epithelial, immune-cell subtypes). The cellular resolution of this dataset allowed us to identify cell populations with distinct gene signatures. For example, we identified 2 macrophage subclusters—a lung tumor-specific cluster and a tumor-independent cluster. Lung-specific macrophages showed upregulation of genes including SPP1, G0S2, RGCC, PHLDA1, and TREM. Differential gene expression analysis evaluated similarities and differences between TME vs healthy PB cells and allowed for surrogate pharmacodynamics marker assessment. In our analysis, 1197 genes were differentially expressed; the most enriched genes in tumor-derived monocytes included HSPA1A, IL8, APOE, and SPP1 whereas PB monocytes were enriched for genes including LGALS2, S100A12, S100A9, AHNAK, and CSTA.</p><p id="Par1055"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1056">We have demonstrated the feasibility of scRNAseq from single CNB through the development of protocols to enable identification of biomarkers related to pharmacodynamics, therapeutic response, or disease progression.

We then analyze the clonal diversity of pre-treatment tumor samples in a cohort of melanoma patients who underwent PD-1 blockade.

Chi-squared test was used to determine the association between categorical variables. Next, we performed RNA-seq analysis of 13 gastric cancer FFPE specimens (8 obese and 5 normal weight) to identify differential gene expression between these two groups. Gene expression was quantified by log-fold changes. Differentially expressed genes were identified by using DESeq2. Then we looked at the association between the expression of leptin and immune-related genes from those specimens, using generalized linear model implemented in DESeq2.

Three immune clusters (IG) were subsequently defined based on Th2 and CTC immune infiltration levels: IG1 (54.5% of samples) had high Th2/low CTC levels, IG2 (37%) had either low or high levels of both fractions, and IG3 (8.5%) had low Th2/high CTC levels. Immune clusters were associated with overall survival independently of tumor histology, with an improving survival from IG1 to IG3 (HR IG2=0.52, 95% CI 0.39–0.69; HR IG3=0.32, 95% CI 0.19–0.53; p=8.4x10-8; Figure 1). IG3 was significantly enriched in epithelioid tumors (90% IG3 vs. 62% IG1, p=0.001) and patients were younger compared to the other groups (60 years IG3 vs. 66 years IG1, p=0.021). These groups showed differential molecular profiles, being IG1 enriched for CDKN2A and IFN-related genes deletions.

With their highly immunogenic expression limited to tumor cells, CT antigens have become a prime target for cancer vaccinations and T-cell based therapy with chimeric T-cell receptors. In this study, we investigated the association of two CT antigens (NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1a) with the immune microenvironment of real-world clinical tumors spanning multiple histologies. Furthermore, we describe the association of CT antigens with traditional biomarkers of immunotherapy such as PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) and tumor mutational burden (TMB), with inflammatory status and cell proliferation status with confirmatory studies performed on a large TCGA pan-cancer cohort of 11,001 tumors.</p><p id="Par1126"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1127">Unsupervised clustering was performed on gene-expression data of 395 immune transcripts of 1323 FFPE tumors to reveal three inflammatory patient clusters and three distinct gene groups; CT-antigen, inflammatory and neoplastic clusters.

A retrospective cohort (n=242) of checkpoint inhibition (CPI) treated tumors was utilized to perform overall survival (Kaplan-Meier curves) and response to CPI therapy for CT antigen+ tumors.

Interestingly, LAGE-1a positive cases were over-represented in TMB high cases (p=0.016), whereas, NY-ESO-1 status was not associated with TMB. NY-ESO-1 positive cases were highly over-represented in non-inflamed cluster (p=0.006), whereas, LAGE-1a status was not associated with inflammation status. Both NY-ESO-1 (p=0.031) and LAGE-1a (p=0.008) were significantly associated with cell-proliferation status. NY-ESO-1 positive tumors have significantly (p=0.014) higher response rate in retrospective cohort but this was not observed for LAGE-1a status.

When tumor-specific mutations (neoantigens) are presented on HLA molecules to CD8+ T cells, this recognition can drive immune responses against the tumor and lead to tumor destruction. One mechanism of immune escape for tumors is loss of heterozygosity in HLA genes (HLA-LOH), which reduces the total number of neoantigens available for presentation to T cells. Due to the highly polymorphic nature of HLA, the copy number status of HLA genes is extremely challenging to assess by standard bioinformatics approaches. To investigate the prevalence of HLA-LOH, we developed a specialized pipeline to detect HLA-LOH by DNA next-generation sequencing (NGS).</p><p id="Par1136"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1137">A cohort of colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer samples underwent DNA sequencing on the Tempus xT panel using paired, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor and normal (blood or saliva) samples. To detect HLA-LOH from NGS data, we used NGS-based HLA typing to resolve the patient’s most probable HLA haplotype. Based on this haplotype, we adaptively realigned reads, extracted a number of features describing the relative allele coverage in the tumor and normal samples, and used these features to make a confident determination of allelic loss in the patient’s tumor sample.</p><p id="Par1138"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1139">Evidence of HLA-LOH was detected in 16% of non-small cell lung tumor samples and 17% of colorectal tumor samples.

Therefore, anti-PD-L1 molecules may not effectively target PD-L1 in patients harboring the deltaExon2_PD-L1 isoform and may lack clinical activity. The prevalence of the deltaExon2_PD-L1 isoform across TCGA tumors is shown in Figure 1. There are 8 cancers where the isoform is present above 5%, including liver and endometrial cancers.</p><p id="Par1158">The deltaExon2_PD-L1 isoform was successfully transfected into BW5147 as demonstrated by mRNA expression. In co-cultures of HuT78/P3Z with BW5147/PD-L1 (both the wildtype and deltaEexon2_PD-L1), IL-2 was secreted from the wildtype but not from the deltaExon2_PD-L1.

Using a gene expression profiling (GEP)-based inflammation assay, we previously derived gene signatures that defined CD8+ T-cell infiltration (CD8 signature) and localization to tumor parenchymal and stromal compartments (CD8-topology signatures) in multiple tumor types [1,2]. In patients with urothelial carcinoma (UC), high stromal/epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) gene expression has been associated with T-cell exclusion and poor response to immunotherapy [3]. Here, we assess three CD8-derived signatures and compare them with a CD8 immunohistochemistry (IHC)-derived score combined with EMT gene expression (CD8.IHC_EMT) to evaluate associations between these biomarkers and with response to nivolumab in patients with UC in CheckMate 275 [4].</p><p id="Par1222"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1223">270 patients with platinum-resistant metastatic UC received nivolumab, with response assessed by blinded central review [4]. CD8+ T-cell infiltration in the TME (assessed using the CD8 signature [1], CD8-topology signatures (parenchymal, stromal) [2], and by IHC using a proprietary commercial assay [Dako mouse clone C8/144B antibody; Agilent Technologies Co]) and PD-L1 expression on tumor cells (Dako PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx) were assessed on baseline tumor samples. Predictive performance of the CD8 signature and CD8-topology signatures individually, the combined CD8-derived signatures (triple CD8), and CD8.IHC_EMT, was evaluated using Cox proportional-hazards regression for overall and progression-free survival (OS, PFS) and with logistic regression for objective response (OR). Odds ratios were scaled to reflect the difference between the 75th and 25th biomarker percentiles. Two-sided likelihood-ratio tests were used to assess biomarker and interaction effects. Associations with PFS and OS were also investigated using Kaplan–Meier analyses with biomarker scores categorized by tertile.</p><p id="Par1224"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1225">GEP was evaluable in 205/270 (76%) patients. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were similar in the overall population and the GEP-evaluable cohort.

Odds ratios for OR were 2.59 (95% CI, 1.59–4.21) for triple CD8, 2.12 (1.47–3.07) for CD8.IHC_EMT, 2.51 (1.42–4.43) for the CD8 signature, and 1.74 (1.22–2.49) for the parenchymal CD8-topology signature.</p><p id="Par1226"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1227">Combined CD8 and CD8-topology gene signatures (triple CD8) showed similar performance to CD8.IHC_EMT for predicting response and survival in nivolumab-treated patients with UC.

MANTIS score was originally developed to identify microsatellite instability through next-generation sequencing (NGS). Although the 0.4 cutoff identifies MSI-high status, there is insufficient data for this score's repercussion for MSI-stable patients [1]. MSI-high status rarely occurs in lung cancer patients representing less than 1% of the cases. Therefore, we aim to identify how MANTIS score correlates with immune profile and clinical outcomes in MSI-stable lung cancer.</p><p id="Par1241"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1242">MANTIS score was calculated for two TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) cohorts: squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC, n= 501) and adenocarcinoma (ADC, n=517). After excluding MSI-high patients (n=3 and 1, respectively) we stratified each cohort into quartiles. The highest quartile was named MANTIS-high (M-H) and the lowest quartile MANTIS-low (M-L). Immune profile (immune cell infiltration and PD-L1 expression), tumor mutational burden (TMB), neoantigen burden and survival outcomes were compared between M-H and M-L.

M-H patients had a higher TMB when compared with M-L patients in ADC (p&lt;0.05) and the same tendency was observed for SqCC (p=0.10) (Figure 3). Additionally, M-H correlated with lower PD-L1 (CD274) expression in both SqCC and ADC (each p&lt;0.05) when compared with M-L. No significant differences in neoantigen burden were demonstrated.

Siglecs (sialic acid-recognizing Ig-superfamily lectins) are type I transmembrane sialoglycan binding proteins expressed on various immune cells (innate and adaptive). Humans express at least fourteen unique Siglecs which have distinct preferred sialoglycan ligands. Tumors upregulate certain sialoglycan patterns to facilitate immune cell evasion by engaging these inhibitory Siglec receptors. This tumor inhibitory “glyco-code” consists of a heterogenous mixture of numerous sialoglycans, binding to Siglecs through low affinity and high avidity interactions.</p><p id="Par1318"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1319">Deciphering the hypersialylation glyco-code of tumors is key to identifying cancer patients for glyco-immune checkpoint blockade therapies. However, the heterogeneity and complexity of sialoglycans make characterization of the tumor surface sialoglycome difficult with current technologies. To overcome this challenge, we developed a proprietary sialoglycan-probing reagent, HYDRA, to functionally detect inhibitory tumor sialoglycans engaging Siglecs. HYDRA mimics this natural avidity driven Siglec-sialoglycan interaction, consisting of multimeric fusions of a Siglec N-terminal extracellular domain containing the carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), a trimerization motif, and a Fc dimerization domain.</p><p id="Par1320"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1321">We have generated several HYDRA constructs with robust expression using a mammalian HEK293 system. Size-exclusion chromatography profiles of HYDRA demonstrate high purity and confirmed multimeric assembly. HYDRAs have greater than fifteen-fold increase in binding affinity compared to Siglec-Fc dimers as measured using bio-layer interferometry Octet. HYDRA also demonstrates sialoglycan-specific binding, as its binding was eliminated when cells were treated with sialidase (which removes terminal sialic-acids of sialoglycan) or using cells lacking sialoglycans from knocking out UDP-GlcNAc 2-Epimerase. Glycan array binding of HYDRA confirmed similar sialoglycan preferences of its Siglec counterpart as described in the literature, suggesting engineering did not alter glyco-recognition properties. These high-affinity and sialoglycan-specific HYDRAs enabled us to develop a robust immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay to analyze cancer patient samples. A cohort of tissues (&gt;2,500 patients) from various indications were analyzed to enable indication prioritization for glyco-immune checkpoint therapies. HYDRA IHC on healthy and cancerous human tissues demonstrate unique binding patterns with concordance between duplicate primary tumor cores and primary tumor versus metastatic cores from the same patient in non-small cell lung, kidney and colon cancer samples.</p><p id="Par1322"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1323">In summary, the HYDRA technology distills the structural heterogeneity of tumor surface sialoglycans to a straightforward functional readout of immunosuppressive glyco-codes engaging inhibitory Siglecs, which may allow patient stratification based on deciphering a tumor-specific surface glycan pattern.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec469"><title>P119 Analytical validation of run-to-run and site-to-site performance of a human immune profiling assay and automated data analysis solution for CyTOF mass cytometry technology</title><sec id="Sec470"><title>Clare Rogers (clare.rogers@fluidigm.com)</title><sec id="Sec471"><title>Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA, United States</title><p id="Par1324"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par1325">Immune profiling is an essential method for quantifying changes in immune population numbers and states over time in health and disease. A cornerstone in translational and clinical research, it is frequently used to investigate chronic inflammation, infectious disease, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. The diversity of immune populations demands a high parameter approach to more fully and efficiently quantify these changes. Mass cytometry, which utilizes CyTOF® technology, is a single-cell analysis platform that has used as many as 50 metal-tagged antibodies [1] to resolve discrete cell populations, all in a single tube of sample.

Pre-existing tumor-infiltrating CD8+T cell infiltrates (TIL), neoantigen burden and IFN-γ gene expression signature (GES) correlate with clinical anti-tumor response [3-5] to PD1 blockade. However, neoantigen burden and IFN-γ GES are cost-prohibitive and time-consuming assays that are not available for clinical use; while CD8 T cell analysis by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is cost-effective and operator-independent.

In that perspective, the concept of Immunoscore proposed by Galon et al [1, 2, 3] has highlighted the crucial role of immune response to the tumor. In parallel, immunotherapies by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) anti-PD-1/PD-L1 were approved in several cancer indications, such as Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer or melanoma, even if only a minority of these patients respond positively to the treatment. In addition, ICI are far less effective for other high-incidence indications like colorectal cancer (CRC), thus suggesting that multiple factors may be critical for capturing the exact nature of the tumour microenvironment (TME). In this context, the comprehensive identification and assessment of these factors could be key to stratify patients and allow the selection of the optimal treatment.</p><p id="Par1354"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1355">In order to support clinical researchers and biopharmaceutical companies in the evaluation of the efficacy of candidate drugs, HalioDx has developed the Cancer Immunogram, a solution based on Blank CU et al.

It utilizes a synthetic nanoparticle delivery system comprised of three components: a neutral stealth liposome, encapsulated synthetic immunogenic HLA class I restricted peptides derived from measles virus (MV), and a tumor-targeting peptide on the external surface of the liposome. The targeting peptide results in accumulation of liposomes specifically inside cancer cells, and facilitates presentation of MV-derived immunogenic peptides in HLA class I molecules (Figure 1). We refer to this system as TALL (Targeted Antigen Loaded Liposomes). Therefore, TALL can generate a secondary immune response specifically against the targeted tumor cells in a patient who has been previously vaccinated against or infected by MV. In short, we are attempting to trick the immune system into responding as though the cancer cell is infected with MV without the use of viral particles.</p><p id="Par1389"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1390">We synthesized liposomes encapsulating H250, an immunogenic HLA class I restricted peptide identified from measles hemagglutinin protein.

Treatment of lung cancer cells with TALL results in functional presentation of H250 in both MHC and HLA class I molecules. Our in-vitro and in-vivo studies indicate that presentation of H250 is dependent on the cancer targeting peptide; liposomes that lack the targeting peptide did not accumulate in the cancer cells and presentation of H250 was abrogated. Treatment with TALL substantially reduced growth of LLC1 and 4T1 tumors in vaccinated C57BL/6 and Balb/c mice respectively.</p><p id="Par1391"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1392">The outcome of our therapy is a robust cytotoxic T lymphocyte response directed specifically against the tumor.

It also does not require isolation or ex-vivo manipulation of patient’s cells, reducing production time and costs.</p><p id="Par1393"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par1394">Research reported in this work was supported by DOD under grant number W81XWH-16-1-0262 and SRI internal research funds</p><p id="Par1395"><fig id="Fig42"><label>Fig. 1 (abstract P124).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TALL mechanism of action</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig42_HTML.png" id="MO54"/></fig></p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec492"><title>P125 Adenosine and AMP gene expression profiles predict response to adenosine pathway therapies and indicate a need for dual blockade of CD73 and A2AR with CD73 inhibitors</title><sec id="Sec493"><title>Stephen Willingham, PhD, Drew Hotson, PhD, Jessica Hsieh, Brian Munneke, Long Kwei, PhD, Joseph Buggy, Richard Miller, MD</title><sec id="Sec494"><title>Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA, United States</title><sec id="Sec495"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Stephen Willingham (swillingham@corvuspharma.com)</title><p id="Par1396"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par1397">Extracellular adenosine in the tumor microenvironment generates an immunosuppressive niche that promotes tumor growth and metastasis by signaling through the A2A receptor (A2AR) on immune cells. Various agents targeting the adenosine pathway are now in clinical trials as cancer therapies. Ciforadenant is a selective A2AR antagonist and CPI-006 is an anti-CD73 antibody (Fc-mutant IgG1) that blocks the enzymatic conversion of AMP to adenosine and directly stimulates immunity. Both agents are now being studied in clinical trials (NCT02655822 and NCT03454451). In this report, we evaluate the role of adenosine and AMP-related gene expression profiles (GEPs) that may predict the response of patients receiving adenosine pathway therapies. Ex vivo studies reveal a requirement for dual blockade of CD73 and A2AR for optimal neutralization of AMP mediated immunosuppression.</p><p id="Par1398"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1399">Normal human PBMCs were stimulated ex vivo with NECA (stable adenosine analog) or AMP. RNA from tumor biopsies and PBMC was analyzed using NanoString. Renal cell cancer (RCC) tumor biopsies collected from patients treated with ciforadenant (100 mg BID) either as a single agent (n=18) or in combination with atezolizumab (n=14).</p><p id="Par1400"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1401">Ex vivo A2AR agonism resulted in dose-dependent increases in CXCR2 ligands (CXCL1,2,3,5,8) and key mediators of neutrophil/MDSC biology (CSF3, IL-23). Increases in monocyte/macrophage inflammatory mediators such as IL-1beta and CCL2,3,7,8, 20 were also observed, as were increases in SERPINB2, S100A8, PTGS2, THBS1. Preliminary biomarker analysis suggests ciforadenant anti-tumor activity in RCC was associated with increased expression of select analytes (AdenoSig) in pretreatment biopsies (Figure 1).</p><p id="Par1402">Ex vivo AMP or AMPalphaS (a non-hydrolyzable AMP analog) stimulation induced a similar GEP (AMPSig), but included specific decreases in OAS3, BIRC5, CDK1, MX1, IFI27, and IFIT1. CD73 antibody and small molecule antagonists amplified the AMPSig by preserving AMP, which itself directly stimulates adenosine receptors. In contrast, ciforadenant inhibited induction of the AdenoSig and AMPSig in all experimental settings at the transcript and protein level.</p><p id="Par1403"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1404">A2AR agonists and AMP induce specific GEPs dominated by immunosuppressive mediators of MDSC and monocyte/macrophage biology. These GEPs may be used as biomarkers for patient selection. CD73 antagonists alone may be limited by the induction of compensatory immunosuppressive pathways mediated by AMP accumulation. Combination ciforadenant and CPI-006 treatment may synergize to activate anti-tumor immunity by 1) blocking adenosine production and signaling, 2) directly activating immune cells, and 3) blocking a compensatory induction of AMPSig. This combination strategy is being evaluated in an ongoing Ph1/1b clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors.</p><p id="Par1405"><bold>Trial Registration</bold></p><p id="Par1406">NCT02655822 and NCT03454451</p><p id="Par1407"><fig id="Fig43"><label>Fig. 1 (abstract P125).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>See text for description</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig43_HTML.png" id="MO55"/></fig></p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec496"><title>P126 Discovery of biomarkers associated with benefit from PD-1 checkpoint blockade in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using high-plex digital spatial profiling</title><sec id="Sec497"><title>Jon Zugazagoitia, MD, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Swati Gupta, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Kit Fuhrman, MS PhD<sup>2</sup>, Scott Gettinger, MD<sup>1</sup>, Roy Herbst, MD, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Kurt Schalper, MD, PhD<sup>1</sup>, David Rimm, MD, PhD<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec498"><title><sup>1</sup>Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, United States; <sup>2</sup>Nanostring, Inc., Seattle, WA, United States</title><sec id="Sec499"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> David Rimm (david.rimm@yale.edu)</title><p id="Par1408"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par1409">Only a minority of patients with advanced NSCLC truly benefit from single-agent PD-1 checkpoint blockade, and more robust predictive biomarkers are needed to optimally deliver these therapies.

Several factors have limited the study of PD-L1 expression. Most trials use of hazard ratios (HRs) to measure treatment effects on survival outcomes, a questionable practice for immunotherapy studies. Additionally, trials use different cut-off values to dichotomize PD-L1 scores, complicating meta-analyses. Therefore, we performed a pooled analysis to: i) estimate the distribution of PD-L1 expression scores in clinical populations, and ii) assess the relationship between PD-L1 levels and ICIs’ effects on overall survival (OS). Instead of HRs, we used a more robust metric, i.e. differences in restricted mean survival times (ΔRMSTs).</p><p id="Par1428"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1429">Following PRISMA guidelines, we analyzed individual-level data reconstructed from the publications of 14 randomized clinical trials of ICIs. We used an imputation-based approach to estimate i) the distribution of PD-L1 scores, ii) the survival distribution in different PD-L1 classes, and iii) pooled ΔRMST estimates. We show the advantage provided by meta-analytic estimates such as ours for the design of future studies in a simulation study. We simulated 10,000 NSCLC trials (1:1 randomization; sample size: 500 patients) that compared ICIs with standard chemotherapy. Simulated trials followed either i) a design that does not use prior information on the distribution of PD-L1 levels and their association with ICIs’ effects, or ii) a design tailored to our meta-analytic estimates.</p><p id="Par1430"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1431">We reconstructed data on 7,918 individual patients, 3,496 with NSCLC, 4,529 with other tumors. The estimated distribution of PD-L1 expression is U-shaped, with most patients presenting a low or high expression: only about 7% had an expression in the 5%-50% range. ΔRMST estimates suggest that i) ICIs provide an OS benefit to all patients, and ii) the magnitude of OS benefits increases along with PD-L1 score, although changes in ΔRMSTs were greater in NSCLC (Figure 1). In the simulations, the power to detect a positive treatment effect increased from 80% to 93% using a design tailored to meta-analytic information.</p><p id="Par1432"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1433">By highlighting that higher PD-L1 scores predict increasing OS benefits, our findings extend those of recent meta-analyses that evaluated PD-L1 expression scores as predictors of ICIs’ efficacy. They also illustrate how meta-analytic estimates like ours can improve the power of future trials to detect ICIs’ benefits. Our findings also suggest that the practice of dichotomizing the range of PD-L1 expression scores is inadequate for patient stratification.</p><p id="Par1434"><fig id="Fig44"><label>Fig. 1 (abstract P128).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>See text for description</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig44_HTML.png" id="MO56"/></fig></p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec508"><title>P129 Correlation of circulating CD8 T cell activation with response to immunotherapy in advanced renal cell carcinoma</title><sec id="Sec509"><title>Jennifer Carlisle, MD, Caroline Jansen, BS, Adriana Reyes, Nataliya Prokhnevska, BS, Deborah Baumgarten, MD, Viraj Master, MD, PhD, R.

Prior peripheral blood immune profiling studies have shown that a transient rise in activated CD8 T cells correlates with clinical response to PD1 blockade in lung cancer [3, 4] and melanoma [5]. The effect of checkpoint blockade on circulating CD8 T cells in RCC is unknown, as is the T cell biology underlying clinical response.</p><p id="Par1437"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1438">Serial peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from patients with RCC undergoing immunotherapy. Samples were obtained at baseline (cycle 1) and initiation of each subsequent cycle (up to cycle 6). Flow cytometry identified longitudinal changes in T cell subsets. Additionally, recently activated CD8 T cells, identified by surface expression of CD38 and HLA-DR, were sorted at baseline, post-cycle 1, and post-cycle 2, and analyzed by RNA seq. Clinical responses were determined at the first restaging scans using RECIST v1.1 criteria, to define those with clinical benefit (complete response, partial response, or stable disease) or no clinical benefit (progressive disease).</p><p id="Par1439"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1440">Of 27 patients analyzed, 10 received nivolumab, 7 nivolumab + NKTR-214, and 10 nivolumab + ipilimumab. Median age was 58 years (range 33-78) with a male (70%), Caucasian (89%), and solely clear cell histology (83%) predominance. A burst in circulating activated CD8 T cells as defined by a ≥1.8 fold increase in CD38+HLA-DR+ CD8 T cells from baseline to post-cycle 1 (Figure 1A) was observed in 8/12 patients who had clinical benefit and 6/15 patients with no clinical benefit (Figure 1B). Transcriptional analysis revealed that in patients with the aforementioned immunological response, T-cells had upregulated TCR signaling, CD28 signaling, enhanced glycolysis and iron uptake, and reduced TGF-beta signaling compared to patients without an immunologic response.</p><p id="Par1441"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1442">Peripheral blood immune monitoring of RCC patients while on immunotherapy may provide an early predictor of response. One important limitation identified is the treatment specific cycle length defined sample collection timing and therefore may miss transient early immunologic changes.

Averaging the characteristics of all cells in a cancerous tissue no doubt obscures important variations in biomarkers among minority, but critical, pathogenic cell populations. High resolution, single-cell analyses are thus needed in the clinic to precisely delineate the inherent heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment underlying oncogenesis in each patient. Biopsies derived from tumor microenvironment are routinely used for medical diagnosis or prognostications. The number of cells typically available from a biopsy is limited and heterogeneous. The ability to distinguish, select, and sort rare malignant or pathogenic immune cells from either tissue or liquid biopsies poses a unique challenge for single-cell based diagnosis and prognostication. Heterogeneous cell populations with non-target immunoreactive cells in pausicellular biopsies complicate conventional bulk-cell analysis, and could lead to disease misdiagnosis or prognostication.</p><p id="Par1494"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1495">We adopted a state-of-the-art multi-modal strategy including the real-time imaging-based DEPArray with downstream molecular and genomic assays [1], and quantitative multiplex immunofluorescent technique [2] in order to predict clinical outcome or direct therapy, based on single-cell based diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers derived from tumor microenvironment.</p><p id="Par1496"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1497">We provided proof-of concepts that DEPArray technology enabled automated isolation and recovery of rare malignant or pathogenic immune cells from liquid or tissue biopsies in several malignancies including vitreoretinal lymphoma (VRL), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Rare target B lymphoma cells were distinguished and sorted from pausicellular ocular vitreous biopsies with high resolution and purity required for sensitive single-cell based MYD88 mutational profiling to aid VRL diagnosis [1]. Single cellular imaging revealed the presence of large (&gt;10μm), irregular shaped of a novel population of HCC-infiltrating macrophages in association with improved prognosis after surgery. A unique signature regulatory T-cells (Tregs) population was identified in both blood circulation and cancerous tissues of CRC. These signature Tregs expressed phenotypically distinct surface markers in association with better disease-free and overall survival of CRC patients.</p><p id="Par1498"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1499">Using real-time imaging-based, digital sorting DEPArray, we could distinguish, select and sort different types of malignant or target immune cells including B-cells, T-cells and macrophages from heterogeneous tumor microenvironment or liquid biopsies with low cellularity. Comprehensive genomic and molecular characterizations at single cell resolution revealed crucial biomarkers associated with clinicopathological features that impact clinical outcome of patients. The single cell interrogation using DEPArray technology provides a novel precision medicine tool for diagnostics and prognostications of malignancies in future.</p><p id="Par1500"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par1501">This study was supported by research funding from the research collaboration between A.

Notably, multiplex-immunofluorescence (mIF) can perform measurements for 7 markers, flow cytometry can handle 20, and imaging mass cytometry can process up to 37 biomarkers simultaneously. Hence, dimensionality reduction techniques such as t-SNE and UMAP are becoming increasingly important for tumour single-cell data analysis. Using human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue samples, we aim to compare and evaluate the use of a new technique, UMAP, as an alternative to t-SNE in mIF derived single-cell data.</p><p id="Par1509"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1510">We adopted an unsupervised clustering approach using FlowSOM to identify 8 major cell types present in human HCC tissues by staining them with 7 markers, including immune-checkpoint molecules and one nuclear counterstain. Following that, UMAP and t-SNE were ran independently on the dataset to qualitatively compare the distribution of clustered cell types in both dimensionality reduction tools.</p><p id="Par1511"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1512">The key advantage of UMAP is its superior runtime – it takes approximately one-fifth the time required to run t-SNE. Both techniques provide similar arrangements of cell clusters, with the key difference being UMAP’s extensive characteristic branching. Also, increasing perplexity values in t-SNE results in a t-SNE visualisation with certain degrees of branching like that of UMAP’s, albeit limited. When parameters such as standard deviation, minimum and maximum intensity from the mIF image cytometry data were included, a t-SNE plot with virtually the same morphology as the resulting UMAP plot can be visualised. Most interestingly, UMAP’s branching highlighted biological lineages, especially in identifying potential hybrid tumour cells (HTC). Survival analysis shows patients with higher proportion of HTC have a worse prognosis (p-value = 0.019).</p><p id="Par1513"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1514">We conclude that both techniques are similar in their visualisation capabilities, but UMAP has a clear advantage over t-SNE in runtime, making it highly plausible to employ UMAP as an alternative to t-SNE in single-cell data analysis.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec524"><title>P133 High tumor expression of DKK1 is associated with improved clinical benefit and longer progression free survival across multiple solid tumors when treated with a targeted anti-DKK1 antibody (DKN-01)</title><sec id="Sec525"><title>Michael Kagey, PhD, Girish Naik, MD, Michael Haas, PhD, Heidi Heath, Franziska Schurpf-Huber, Walter Newman, PhD, Cynthia Sirard, MD</title><sec id="Sec526"><title>Leap Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA, United States</title><sec id="Sec527"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Cynthia Sirard (csirard@leaptx.com)</title><p id="Par1515"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par1516">Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), a secreted modulator of Wnt signaling, contributes to an immune suppressive tumor microenvironment and promotes tumor growth, angiogenesis and metastasis. DKN-01, a DKK1 neutralizing antibody, has demonstrated clinical activity across multiple solid tumors as both a monotherapy and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and chemotherapies. Nonclinical studies indicate that DKN-01 efficacy depends on a functioning immune system, notably natural killer (NK) cells. High tumor expression of DKK1 correlates with a worse clinical prognosis in many solid tumors.

There was no consistent association between Treg levels and patient age, gender, smoking status, clinical stage or tumor histology. However, Tregs were significantly higher in KRAS mutated lung adenocarcinomas than in EGFR mutant or KRAS/EGFR wild-type cases. As a single marker, the level of Tregs was not significantly associated with survival. However, the Treg to CD8 signal ratio was associated with shorter 5-year overall survival across the cohorts. Reduced survival was also seen in cases with a higher 5-nearest neighbor (5NN) mean distance between CD4+/Tregs and CD8+/CD4+ cells.

However, the tumor-immune interaction is complex: PD-L1 expression alone is not predictive of patient response [2]. This has led to the investigation of other PD-1 ligands such as PD-L2 [2]. PD-L2 even in the absence of PD-L1 has been associated with clinical response to PD-1 blockade in multiple tumor types [2]. PD-L2 status has also been investigated where immunotherapy based on PD-L1 has been less successful, such as prostate cancer, where PD-L1 expression is typically low [3]. Here, significantly higher levels of PD-L2 were associated with multiple survival and response measures [3]. Due to the diagnostic and therapeutic potential indicated by the presence of this key immune checkpoint ligand in patients irrespective of PD-L1 expression [2-4], dependable detection tools for investigating the presence and role of PD-L2 are crucial. To address this need, Abcam have developed and extensively characterized and validated a recombinant rabbit monoclonal antibody specific to PD-L2 (CAL28).

Clinical outcomes appear to be different in patients with MSI-H/mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient status versus MSS/MMR-proficient status when receiving anti-programmed cell death (ligand) 1 (PD-[L]1) therapies [1,2]. It is unclear if these differences are due to the therapies themselves or to differences inherent to the patient populations.</p><p id="Par1583">We sought to evaluate the association between MSI-H/deficient MMR (dMMR) status and response among patients with advanced or recurrent EC.</p><p id="Par1584"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1585">We conducted a systematic review of the Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases from 2000 to present to identify publications (manuscripts and conference proceedings) on studies using chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, or biological therapy (or any combination thereof) in adult patients (≥18 years) with stage III or IV advanced or recurrent EC, and where MMR or MSI status was identified (by any means). To better understand the prognostic value of MSI-H/MSS status, we excluded anti-PD-(L)1 therapies from the analysis, as recent evidence suggests that there is a positive predictive value for these agents in patients with MSI-H/dMMR status [2-4].</p><p id="Par1586"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1587">Our systematic review of MSI/MMR status and recurrence-free survival (RFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) identified a total of 5 studies.

A third study reported a trend towards a higher rate of recurrence among patients with advanced-stage EC with dMMR than among patients with MMR proficiency (P value not reported) [7]. Two studies reported no significant association between PFS and dMMR status [8,9].

For RFS, where differences were present, they trended towards worse outcomes for patients with MSI-H/dMMR status. Consequently, we have identified no evidence of a prognostic or predictive value of MSI-H or dMMR biomarker status for efficacy outcomes in patients with advanced or recurrent EC receiving non–anti-PD-(L)1 therapy.

While interfering with the PD-1/PD-L1 axis improves outcomes, the majority of patients progress and die of their disease. To address this lack of efficacy our group has explored the immune makeup of HNSCC, hypothesizing that a better characterization of responders and non-responders will result in improved predictive biomarkers and insights into strategies to improve outcomes for the majority of patients.</p><p id="Par1604"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1605">Over the past 7 years we have collected and processed more than 350 HNSCC specimens. When sufficient tumor material was available, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and primary tumor cultures were initiated and characterized for autologous tumor reactivity. Once established, tumor cell lines were characterized for phenotypic markers by flow cytometry. Flow cytometric analysis and RNASeq has been performed on some established cell lines and on FFPE tumor specimens.</p><p id="Par1606"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1607">Consistent with previous reports increased expression of CD8 T cells was associated with improved outcome.

Using flow cytometry we detected low level GITR expression on 3 HNSCC cell lines and low to high level expression of GITR-L on a 8 HNSCC cell lines.

It exerts various functions in shaping cancer vascularization, cell dedifferentiation and inflammation/immunity. IL-8 was described as a chemotactic factor for neutrophils and it has been proposed to mediate recruitment of tolerogenic myeloid cells favoring a pro-tumorigenic microenvironment. Although clinical trials targeting IL-8 are ongoing, its expression and role in NSCLC is unclear.</p><p id="Par1616"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1617">We developed a multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) panel for simultaneous and localized measurement of IL-8, myeloperoxidase (MPO), CD15, cytokeratin (CK) and DAPI. We analyzed the expression of these markers and their association with PD-L1, CD4 and CD8-positive cells in 3 retrospective NSCLC immunotherapy-naive cohorts represented in tissue microarrays (cohort #1, n=262; #2, n=145; and #3, n=132); 1 cohort of NSCLC patients treated with immune checkpoint blockers (#4, n=59) and 1 collection of lung adenocarcinomas (LAC) analyzed for activating mutations in EGFR and KRAS (#5, n=121). We studied the level of the targets, their distribution and association with immune features, clinicopathological variables and survival.</p><p id="Par1618"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1619">IL-8 protein signal was detected in ~85% of cases with cytoplasmic staining pattern and was higher in tumor than in stromal cells. Elevated tumor IL-8 was consistently associated with higher MPO+ neutrophils and CD15+ tumor-associated myeloid cells across the cohorts, but not with CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. Increased IL-8 expression was not associated with major clinicopathologic variables. Elevated MPO+ and CD15+ cells was significantly higher in KRAS mutated than in EGFR mutated LACs. High MPO and CD15 signal was associated with shorter 5-year overall survival in all NSCLC cohorts. The negative prognostic effect of MPO and CD15 was comparable in both immunotherapy-naïve and immunotherapy-treated NSCLC collections.</p><p id="Par1620"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1621">IL-8 protein is frequently expressed in NSCLCs associated with increased tumor-associated myeloid cells but independent from intratumor T-cell responses.

However, widespread use of PD-(L)1 inhibitors has been limited by a low response rate and immune-related adverse events. Therefore, an improved method for predicting response to the immune checkpoint blockade would better identify patients misclassified by conventional testing. We have evaluated a proprietary algorithm which utilizes gene expression in solid tumors to assess the presence of an immunomodulatory (IM) signature intended to predict immunotherapy response. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of the IM signature against progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.</p><p id="Par1626"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1627">In this retrospective study, archival tumor tissue from metastatic lung cancer patients treated with one of three PD-(L)1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab, nivolumab, and atezolizumab) either as a single agent or in conjunction with standard chemotherapy, from whom response data was available, was tested for the IM signature. Patients were stratified into two groups based on IM signature classification as positive or negative, which was compared to immunohistochemistry PD-(L)1 testing with a primary endpoint of one-year progression-free survival.

Head-to-head analysis of PD-L1 and IM signature on these patients found the one-year PFS hazard ratio for the IM group to be 0.30 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.71; p=0.006) and the one-year PFS hazard ratio for PD-L1 positive staining to be 0.76 (95% CI 0.31 to 1.82; p=0.533).

However, CART persistence was limited and clinical activity transient and incomplete.</p><p id="Par1689">Building on the GD2 CAR used in this study, we have developed a next generation T-cell product candidate termed AUTO6NG. The AUTO6NG product consists of 3 distinct populations of GD2-targeted CAR T-cells, produced by dual transduction of T-cells with two separate retroviral vectors. The first vector directs the expression of a GD2-targeting CAR, co-expressed with a constitutively signalling IL7 cytokine receptor (IL7R_CCR) (product A), while the second vector is a tri-cistronic retroviral vector encoding the same GD2 CAR, co-expressed with dominant negative TGFbRII (dnTGFbRII) and truncated SHP2 (dSHP2) (product B). dSHP2 confers resistance to inhibitory signals such as those from PD1.</p><p id="Par1690"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1691">Human T-cells were either dual transduced with both vectors yielding a mix of product A/B/A+B (AUTO6NG) or single transduced with each vector individually giving raise to product A or B.

Previous studies associated the anti-tumour effect of CAR T-cells to their long-term persistence. Most studies use cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (CyFlu) preconditioning chemotherapy to facilitate CAR T-cell persistence. However, the effect of CyFlu preconditioning was rarely compared to other chemotherapies or to CAR T-cells alone. The THINK, SHRINK and ALLOSHRINK trials evaluate the safety and clinical activity of NKG2D receptor-based CAR T-cells in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients. THINK and SHRINK utilize autologous CAR T-cells, whereas ALLOSHRINK utilizes allogeneic CAR T-cells. In THINK, CAR T-cells are injected without preconditioning chemotherapy or after CyFlu.

Ongoing Phase II clinical trials of Iovance’s lifileucel and LN-145 TIL products have demonstrated efficacy with ORRs of 38% and 44% in patients with melanoma and cervical cancer, respectively [1,2]. Anti-PD-1 therapy has been widely used as a first-line therapy in several types of cancer. TIL infusion products from the patients previously treated with anti-PD-1 therapy still sustain PD-1 expression, especially the subset of tumor antigen-specific TIL [3]. Building on the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1 blockade, we reasoned that intrinsic silencing of PD-1 in our TIL products, may provide similar benefits to systemic administration of anti-PD-1 therapy, while decreasing the side effects associated with systemic anti-PD-1 [3]. Self-delivering small interfering RNA (sd-rxRNA) is a chemically modified siRNA molecule, which has ability to penetrate cell types with high knockdown efficiency of specific target genes [4]. Furthermore, a knockdown approach yields a transient effect, which may prove a more favorable approach when compared with permanent genetic modification.

Expression of T-cell activation markers including 4-1BB and OX40 was significantly increased in TIL expanded with PH-762. Importantly, other inhibitory and exhaustion molecules remained unaffected, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms were not triggered by PD-1 silencing.

All previous, failed attempts to therapeutically target MUC1 have targeted the tandem repeat domains, which are cleaved and shed from the surface of cancer cells. Cleavage and shedding of the tandem repeat domain increases as tumor stage increases. huMNC2-CAR44 targets the truncated extra cellular domain of MUC1* (muk 1 star), also known as MUC1-C, which is the transmembrane cleavage product that remains after MUC1 is cleaved and the tandem repeat domain is shed from the cancer cells. The MNC2 antibody, which is the targeting head of the CAR, cannot bind to full-length MUC1. It binds to an ectopic epitope that is only unmasked by cleavage and release of the MUC1 tandem repeat domain. MUC1* growth factor receptor is activated when onco-embryonic growth factor NME7AB dimerizes its truncated extracellular domain. NME7AB and the huMNC2 antibody both compete for the same binding site, which is masked in full-length MUC1.</p><p id="Par1733"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1734">Monoclonal antibody MNC2 was selected because it recognizes a conformational epitope within MUC1* that is created by cleavage by MMP9, which is overexpressed in breast cancers and is an indicator of poor prognosis.

We use microfluidics-based squeezing to deliver antigen directly to the cytosol of target antigen presenting cells (APCs) – resulting in the enhanced presentation of antigen on MHC-I. In addition to facilitating potent CD8+ T cell priming by professional APCs, this approach can make unfractionated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) effective, unorthodox APCs capable of priming CD8+ T cell responses in mouse and human systems.</p><p id="Par1754"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1755">Protein and peptide antigens were delivered to the cytosol of murine splenocytes or human PBMCs by microfluidic squeezing. The response to in vivo immunization was assessed by flow cytometry in a series of experiments in mice. Tumor experiments were conducted with the TC-1 cell line, which expresses the viral antigens E6 and E7 from human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV16).</p><p id="Par1756">Human PBMCs were loaded with synthetic long peptides (SLPs) containing MHC-I restricted epitopes from cytomegalovirus (CMV) or HPV16.

In vivo immunization using splenocytes squeezed with a HPV16-derived E7 SLP primes E7-specific responses. Prophylactic immunization of mice implanted with TC-1 resulted in complete protection and these responses were durable, as mice were protected upon TC-1 re-challenge. Therapeutic immunization following TC-1 implantation reduced tumor growth and extended survival compared to unimmunized mice (25 days vs 50 days). Following therapeutic immunization, 85% of tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells were found to be E7-specific compared to 3% in unimmunized mice.</p><p id="Par1759">In human cells, we demonstrate that squeezing of primary PBMCs enables delivery to all cell subsets. Delivery of CMV and HPV16 SLPs leads to presentation on MHC-I, as demonstrated by in vitro responses of both CD8+ T cell clones and patient-derived memory populations.

Both the administration and disinhibition of CD8+ T cells, through adoptive immunotherapy and checkpoint inhibition respectively, have yielded unprecedented responses in patients with advanced melanoma [4-8]. However, a majority of patients remain stubbornly unresponsive to T cell-based therapy [9,10]. A better knowledge of cancer-induced T cell suppression is needed improve efficacy. Memory CD8+ T cells (Tmem) are more effective than effector CD8+ T cells (Teff) at controlling melanoma growth after adoptive cell transfer (ACT) in a murine melanoma model [11,12]. Melanoma cancer stem cells (CSC) are primarily responsible for tumor growth and metastasis [13,14]. We hypothesized that Tmem are both more resistant to CSC suppression and more effective at targeting CSC after ACT.</p><p id="Par1766"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1767">The B16F10 melanoma cell line was stably transfected to express low levels of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) peptide antigen GP33 (B16GP33). Ly5.1+/C57BL/6 mice were infected with LCMV to isolate Teff and Tmem on post-infection days 8 or &gt; 30, respectively. Ly5.2+/C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with subcutaneous B16GP33 tumors followed by either no treatment or ACT with Teff or Tmem on days 1 or 7. On day 18-20, tumors were harvested for flow cytometric analysis (FACS) to characterize tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and composition of melanoma CSC versus non-CSC (NCSC) based on expression of the CSC-specific marker aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH).</p><p id="Par1768"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1769">Tumor inhibition was observed after ACT, with greatest treatment effect found after Tmem ACT (Figure 1). FACS analysis of CD8+ TIL showed a predominant exhausted and non-activated phenotype after Teff ACT; in contrast, CD8+ TIL exhibited a highly activated phenotype as well as superior endogenous CD8+ T cell recruitment (Figure 2) after Tmem ACT. FACS analysis of tumor cells after ACT demonstrated that ALDHhigh CSC fractions were markedly expanded after Teff ACT, but diminished after Tmem ACT (Figure 3).</p><p id="Par1770"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1771">Tmem-based ACT resulted in optimal tumor growth suppression, a more activated TIL phenotype with superior CD8+ T cell recruitment, and substantially stronger clearance of CSC compared to Teff ACT and controls.

Current bioinformatics platforms for antigen prediction are unsatisfactory, forcing researchers to screen many peptides per protein target in order to identify the few bona fide antigens. Standard immunogenicity assays also cannot discriminate antigen-Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) binding from T cell receptor (TCR) recognition, leading to unnecessary screening of non-HLA binders in expensive and lengthy T cell reactivity assays that require large numbers of expensive primary cells. Further, the use of donor-derived antigen-presenting cells to assay T cell immunogenicity and expand rare, antigen-specific cells from the endogenous repertoire has inherent variability and a minimal degree of quality control. Berkeley Lights has developed an artificial antigen-presenting bead kit that expands antigen-specific T cells from peripheral blood.</p><p id="Par1794"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1795">Peptide binding to HLA Class I and stability of the peptide-HLA complex is assayed by loading peptides onto beads and staining with antibody. Following validation of peptide-HLA binding, primary CD8+ T cells from peripheral blood are stimulated by antigen-presenting beads twice over the course of two weeks. Frequencies of antigen-specific T cells in the resulting cells is assayed by tetramer staining. Antigen-specific T cells can be loaded onto the Berkeley Lights (BLI) Lightning platform, a novel microfluidic platform that enables thousands of single cell experiments in parallel. On the BLI Optoselect chip, IFNg secretion and CD137 upregulation of antigen-specific T cells is assayed in response to antigenic stimulation. Following analysis, single cells can be exported for further analysis.</p><p id="Par1796"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1797">Berkeley Lights has developed an artificial antigen-presenting bead that expands antigen-specific T cells from peripheral blood 10 times more effectively than autologous dendritic cells. This system allows users to load peptides of choice onto magnetic beads and use them to assay peptide-HLA binding and stability, and to efficiently stimulate and expand antigen-specific T cells. Finally, in conjunction with the Berkeley Lights Lightning platform and the T cell Phenotype and Functional Analytics workflow, multiple functional parameters can be assayed from as few as 1000s of T cells, linking peptide-HLA binding and recognition to antigen-specific effector function.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec612"><title>P155 Prospective translational study evaluating vaccine-enhanced adoptive T cell therapy for treatment of osteosarcoma in companion dogs</title><sec id="Sec613"><title>Tammie Wahaus, BSBA<sup>1</sup>, Noe Reyes, DVM<sup>1</sup>, Jeffrey Bryan, DVM, MS, PhD, DACVIM-Oncology<sup>2</sup>, Jeffrey Bryan, DVM, MS, PhD, DACVIM-Oncology<sup>2</sup>, Gary Wood, PhD<sup>3</sup>, Brian Flesner, DVM, MS, DACVIM-Oncology<sup>2</sup>, Lindsay Donnelly, DVM, MS, DACVIM-Oncology<sup>2</sup>, Debbie Tate, RVT, VTS<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec614"><title><sup>1</sup>ELIAS Animal Health, Olathe, KS, United States; <sup>2</sup>University of Missouri, Columbia, MO, United States; <sup>3</sup>TVAX Biomedical, Olathe, KS, United States</title><sec id="Sec615"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Tammie Wahaus (twahaus@eliasah.com)</title><p id="Par1798"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par1799">Canine osteosarcoma (OSA) is an aggressively metastatic primary bone malignancy with a 90% mortality rate.

Syngeneic rodent studies demonstrated that metastases could be permanently eliminated with vaccine-enhanced adoptive T cell therapy. Canine OSA studies provide an excellent translational bridge between experimental metastatic rodent cancer studies and metastatic human cancer clinical trials. We hypothesized that dogs with OSA could be safely treated at diagnosis with surgery, autologous cancer cell/P. acnes vaccination, adoptive T cell transfer (ACT) of ex vivo-activated T cells, and low dose human interleukin-2 (IL-2) resulting in improved survival compared to carboplatin.

The Slipstream™ process is designed to resolve the manufacturing challenge of generating high yields of early memory phenotype tumor-reactive T cells, which are associated with clinical benefit.

Mechanistically, we discovered that, upon ER insult at suboptimal level, a protective autophagy pathway is induced to promote cell survival and maintain stemness through the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)/ activating transcription factor-4 (ATF4)-dependent manner. Conversely, knockdown of PERK abrogates autophagy activation, hampers mitochondrial biogenesis in response to suboptimal ER stress, which in-turn compromises the antitumor function of melanoma antigen specific T cells.

We investigated which amino acids at each position enable a TCR interaction by sequentially replacing every amino acid position outside of anchor positions 2 and 9 with all 19 possible alternative amino acids, resulting in 134 peptides (133 altered peptides plus epitope peptide). Each peptide was individually evaluated using three different in vitro assays: binding of the NY-ESO C259 TCR to the peptide, peptide-dependent activation of TCR-expressing cells, and killing of peptide-presenting target cells. To represent the TCR recognition kernel, we defined Position Weight Matrices (PWMs) for each assay by assigning normalized measurements to each of the 20 amino acids in each position. To predict potential off-target peptides, we applied a novel algorithm projecting the PWM-defined kernel into the human proteome, scoring NY-ESOc259 TCR recognition of 336,921 predicted human HLA-A*02:01 binding 9-mer peptides.</p><p id="Par1853"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1854">Of the 12 peptides with high predicted score, we confirmed 7 (including NY-ESO-1 antigen SLLMWITQC) strongly activate human primary NY-ESO C259-expressing T cells.

Energy availability is compromised surrounding solid tumors and NK cell metabolic reprogramming can occur to inhibit NK effector functions [1]. Accumulation of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment (TME) from the activity of ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73 on cancer cells is one mechanism that leads to impaired NK cell function. Our previously published data has established that the effects of TME adenosine on NK cells cause specific reorganization of the cells’ metabolism and effector signatures to suppress NK cell function, and the cytokine combination of IL-12/15 was hyperresponsive to adenosine [2]. One way to combat immunosuppression induced by cancer-produced adenosine is to engineer NK cells to overcome this inhibition. To that end, we engineered NK cells to directly target CD73 by imparting NK-specific signaling to enhance anti-tumor activity against CD73+ lung carcinoma.</p><p id="Par1859"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1860">Peripheral blood-derived NK cells were isolated from healthy human donors and expanded using feeder cells. NK cells were electroporated using mRNA or transduced with lentivirus expressing the CD73-targeting construct which bears signaling domains derived from FcγRIIIa. Engineered NK cells expressing the construct were tested for their killing ability against lung carcinoma A549 cells. The engineered NK cells were then adoptively transferred into a CD73+ lung cancer xenograft into NSG mice. Circulating CD73-CAR NK cells were quantified for their expression of activating markers NKG2D, DNAM, and NKp30 and visualized using immunohistochemistry to determine infiltration into tumors, and mice were assessed for tumor growth.</p><p id="Par1861"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1862">We showed NK cells can be efficiently redirected against CD73 to block the generation of immunosuppressive adenosine and rescue impaired NK cell anti-tumor immunity. Specifically, primary human NK cells were successfully engineered to express the synthetic CD73-FCyRIIIa construct. Retargeted NK cells showed enhanced anti-tumor functions in vitro against CD73-expressing A549 cells. Engineered primary NK cells also showed promise in stunting CD73+ lung cancer tumor growth for up to 3 weeks in vivo. Current and future studies include evaluation of off target effects and local injection to further evaluate infiltration of the NK cells in vivo.</p><p id="Par1863"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par1864">The microenvironment of solid tumors is highly immunosuppressive and adenosine has been shown to impair NK cell anti-tumor immunity.

To further define cytokine-induced changes in MDSC/M2 function in a more clinically relevant system, we tested the ability of cytokine-exposed MDSCs/M2s to impair CAR-T cell proliferation and anti-tumor activity in a TME co-culture.

Recently, we developed a novel antibody-T cell receptor (AbTCR) ARTEMIS™ T-cell platform, which combines antibody-based target recognition with gamma/delta TCR-based cellular activation [1]. In contrast to chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), the AbTCR forms a natural multimeric receptor with the endogenous CD3 complex, which feeds into a network of signaling pathways that regulate T-cell activation. In addition, the inclusion of gamma/delta TCR chains within the AbTCR avoids the formation of mispaired receptors with unknown cross-reactivity, which is a potential risk associated with current alpha/beta TCR-based therapies.</p><p id="Par1918">Using the core design of the AbTCR ARTEMIS™ T-cell platform, we developed ET140202 for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). ET140202 features an AbTCR targeting alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)peptide/MHC complexes (specifically AFP158-166/HLA-A2) expressed on HCC cancer cells. To optimize T-cell activation and expansion, the AbTCR is co-expressed with a CD28-based co-stimulatory molecule engineered to target Glypican 3 (GPC3) expressed on HCC cancer cells.</p><p id="Par1919"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1920">To test the specificity and potency of ET140202 T cells in vitro, ET140202 T cells were co-incubated with either target-positive or target-negative cells.

Expression of differentiation and exhaustion markers were determined by flow cytometry. The in vivo anti-tumor activity of ET140202 T cells was tested in an AFP+/HLA-A2+ Hep G2 liver cancer xenograft model. We also engineered the same anti-AFP158-166/HLA-A2 binding moiety onto a CD28-based CAR (AFP-CAR) and compared AFP-CAR-T cells to ET140202 T cells in various assays.</p><p id="Par1921"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par1922">ET140202 T cells specifically lysed AFP-positive tumor cells.

ET140202 T cells also display a less exhausted surface phenotype (e.g. lower PD-1 expression) and a higher percentage of central memory T cells (CCR7+ CD45RA-) after antigen stimulation.

A key contributor to this observed lack of efficacy is the tumor microenvironment (TME) that is erected by solid tumors to impose immunosuppressive physical and chemical barriers to T cell function and survival. To break TME-driven immunosuppression, attempts have been made to arm CAR-T cells with the ability to produce immunomodulatory payloads that target features of the TME. By their nature, these immunomodulators (e.g. Interleukin 12) are frequently toxic when systemically delivered. Due to a limited repertoire of existing programmable gene regulators, constitutive expression and systemic distribution of immunomodulators by armed CAR-T cells is common.</p><p id="Par1931">Chimera Bioengineering has characterized a novel, post-transcriptional gene regulatory node that strictly governs effector outputs in human T cells.

These are possible due to the cells’ ability to recognize self and non-self-entities via the net signal generated from their activating and inhibitory receptors upon engagement. One such receptor is TIM-3, which is expressed on various lymphocytes. In T-cells, TIM-3 is an exhaustion marker [1], but on NK cells, results are conflicting in regards to its function as the receptor exhibits both activating and inhibitory effects depending on disease type and activation status [2-6].</p><p id="Par1944"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par1945">NK cells were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy donors. After expansion, they were co-cultured for 4 hours with glioblastoma (U87) at effector:target (E:T) ratios of 2.5:1 and 10:1, and various receptors were screened by flow cytometry, including PD-1, NKG2A, LAG-3, CD158b, CEAMCAM-1 and TIM-3. Then, expression of TIM-3 was measured when in the presence of patient-derived primary glioblastoma cells (GBM43) and prostate cancer (PC3) for 4 hours. To determine the effect of TIM-3 expression, killing assay are being carried out by blocking TIM-3 on NK cells. Further investigation is being performed by blocking one of TIM-3’s primary ligands, Galectin-9, on cancer cells to determine its impact on NK cell cytotoxicity.

However, it is not known why the downregulation occurs with solid tumors, and whether this change in expression affects NK killing capacity.

Although HPV-positivity confers improved survival relative to HPV(-) OPSCC, outcomes for metastatic HPV-OPSCC remain dismal. High tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are associated with better outcomes in HPV-OPSCC and have the promise of a therapeutic role based upon their intrinsic enhanced tumor specificity. However, not all tumors possess TILs. To date, therapeutic expansions involve surgical excision of the tumor, expansion of TILs with high-dose IL-2 for up to 4 weeks and clinical product success rate between 40-60%. Marrow infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs) represent a novel and distinct T cell population obtained from the bone marrow (BM) of patients that possess significant tumor-specificity over peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Although the early work was done in myeloma, the unique nature of the BM microenvironment makes it a reservoir of antigen-experienced memory T cells in numerous solid tumors.

Additionally, of the 5 highest expanded TCR clones for both compartments HPV-specific MILs possessed an increased average representative clone frequency (p value = 0.0001). To investigate general responsiveness to shared tumor antigens, we incubated autologous BM with lysate from an HPV+ OPSCC and then added ex-vivo activated MILs and PBLs.

Clinical responses with ADP-A2M4 have been reported in patients with advanced MAGE-A4+ synovial sarcoma (SS) tumors. Here, we describe intra-tumoral and peripheral correlates associated with clinical response and resistance in two patients with SS.</p><p id="Par2006"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2007">Transduced T-cell persistence was determined by qPCR in PBMCs. Serum cytokines were measured via a multiplexed electrochemiluminescence-based immunoassay (MSD). Immunohistochemistry for antigen and immune markers was performed on FFPE tumor biopsies collected from patients prior to and following ADP-A2M4 transfer. A digital PCR-based assay was performed on FFPE tumor biopsies to detect the presence of SPEAR T-cells in the tumor. T-cell cytotoxicity assays were performed in vitro using the IncuCyte® platform. Clinical responses were assessed by RECIST v1.1.</p><p id="Par2008"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2009">In the first patient, the best overall response (BOR) following ADP-A2M4 treatment was a partial response. Multiple correlates previously shown to be associated with response were observed. The patient’s pre- and post-infusion tumor biopsies expressed high levels of MAGE-A4 protein. Post-infusion, high levels of persisting transduced cells were observed in peripheral blood. Additionally, the patient had a grade 2 CRS event associated with a high level of serum IFN-g and IL-15 induction. In the post-infusion tumor sample, a notable increase in CD3+ T-cell infiltration, including SPEAR T-cells, was observed along with PD-L1 induction.</p><p id="Par2010">In the second patient, the BOR was stable disease; then the disease progressed. MAGE-A4 protein expression was lower prior to ADP-A2M4 infusion, compared to the 1st patient. Minimal peripheral induction of IFN-g and IL-15 was observed post-infusion along with a lower level of transduced T-cell persistence, compared with the 1st patient. No CRS was reported in this patient. Both patients’ manufactured products contained transduced CD8+ T-cells capable of killing antigen-expressing targets in vitro. In the responding patient, effective target killing was observed in transduced CD8+ T-cells isolated from the tumor site post-infusion. Eight additional SS patients have been treated, and we continue to analyze biomarkers in these patients.</p><p id="Par2011"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2012">Based on these two cases, we have identified some factors that may contribute to the anti-tumor activity of ADP-A2M4. High antigen expression levels, IL-15 and IFN-g cytokine induction, good engraftment, tumor site trafficking, and cytolytic function of SPEAR T-cells may be associated with favorable responses in SS patients treated with ADP-A2M4.</p><p id="Par2013"><bold>Trial Registration</bold></p><p id="Par2014">NCT03132922</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec688"><title>P174 Combinatorial tumor targeting using a novel switchable RevCAR system</title><sec id="Sec689"><title>Anja Feldmann, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Anja Hoffmann<sup>1</sup>, Ralf Bergmann<sup>1</sup>, Liliana Loureiro, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Enrico Kittel-Boselli<sup>2</sup>, Nicola Mitwasi<sup>1</sup>, Stefanie Koristka<sup>1</sup>, Justyna Jureczek<sup>3</sup>, Nicole Berndt<sup>1</sup>, Claudia Arndt<sup>1</sup>, Michael Bachmann<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec690"><title><sup>1</sup>Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, Dresden, Germany; <sup>2</sup>University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany; <sup>3</sup>German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany</title><sec id="Sec691"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Anja Feldmann (a.feldmann@hzdr.de)</title><p id="Par2015"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par2016">Although T-cells genetically modified to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are successfully used to treat hematological malignancies, patients still suffer from several drawbacks of conventional CAR (cCAR) therapy. CAR-T-cells can cause severe to life-threatening adverse reactions like on-target, off-tumor toxicities which cannot be controlled in patients. Moreover, cCAR therapy often fails to successfully affect solid tumors and bears the risk to encourage tumor escape variants upon targeting of only one single tumor-associated antigen (TAA). In order to overcome these problems, we have established a novel on/off-switchable RevCAR system facilitating combinatorial targeting strategies.</p><p id="Par2017"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2018">For combinatorial targeting one T-cell has to be modified with two separate CARs recognizing different TAAs. The first CAR mediates the activation and the second CAR the costimulatory signal. In case of ‘AND’ gate targeting, dual-CAR-T-cells have to recognize both TAAs on the surface of the target cells to get activated. However, such combinatorial targeting strategies are struggling with several challenges including the adjustment of signal strength and affinity of both split CARs as well as the CAR size limiting the number of transduced specificities. In order to overcome these obstacles, our idea was to construct small RevCARs comprising only a small peptide epitope as extracellular domain. By removing the extracellular single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of cCARs, RevCARs avoid tonic signaling induced by scFv dimerization. As RevCARs do not have an extracellular antigen binding moiety, they cannot bind to any antigen per se. Thus, actually they are switched off. Only in the presence of a bispecific target module (RevTM), RevCAR-T-cells can be redirected to tumor cells and switched on. Finally, short-living RevTMs allow a repeatedly on/off-switch and controllability of RevCAR-T-cells and furthermore a flexible redirection of RevCAR-T-cells to any target.</p><p id="Par2019"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2020">For proof of concept two small peptide epitopes were selected to construct the respective RevCARs. Additionally, a series of different RevTMs was generated recognizing one of the two peptide epitopes and simultaneously any potential TAA. RevTMs were able to efficiently redirect RevCAR-T-cells specifically against different tumor targets. Moreover, we show that combinatorial targeting can be achieved using our RevCAR system. Here, dual-RevCAR-T-cells were efficiently activated only after engagement by two RevTMs targeting the activating or costimulatory RevCAR and different TAAs.</p><p id="Par2021"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2022">Taken together, we developed a switchable RevCAR platform showing high effectiveness, increased specificity, improved safety, easy controllability, and small size facilitating combinatorial tumor targeting.</p><p id="Par2023"><bold>Ethics Approval</bold></p><p id="Par2024">The study was approved by local authorities and the Ethics Board.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec692"><title>P175 PD-L1: A side-effect of T cell engagement or a main player in MDS tumor immune evasion?</title><sec id="Sec693"><title>Valentina Ferrari, BA<sup>1</sup>, Alison Tarke<sup>1</sup>, Hannah Fields<sup>1</sup>, Tiffany Tanaka<sup>2</sup>, Rafael Bejar<sup>2</sup>, Thomas Lane, MD<sup>1</sup>, Antonella Vitiello, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Maurizio Zanetti, MD<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec694"><title><sup>1</sup>PersImmune, San Diego, CA, United States; <sup>2</sup>University Of California San Diego, San Diego, CA, United States</title><sec id="Sec695"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Antonella Vitiello (avitiello@persimmune.com)</title><p id="Par2025"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par2026">Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are being tested in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) based on pre-clinical data suggesting that the relevant targets are expressed on tumor and immune cells.

From all somatic variants identified, we generated and tested neopeptides in vitro for their ability to induce tumor-specific T cell responses. A T cell killing assay was performed to assess which neopeptide-specific T cells were capable of mediating tumor cell lysis (Figure 1A). In parallel, tumor PD-L1 expression levels were measured by flow cytometry before and after 24-hour incubation with tumor-specific autologous T cells. As a control for background tumor cell lysis and PD-L1 expression, tumor cells were also incubated with CEF-specific T cells (CEF: CMV, EBV, and flu peptides).</p><p id="Par2029"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2030">Patients’ tumor cells did not express PD-L1 at baseline. Remarkably, after co-culture, PD-L1 expression on the tumor cells ranged from 20% to 70% (Figure 1B). Tumor cells, when incubated with CEF-specific T cells, did not upregulate PD-L1, suggesting that PD-L1 expression may be linked to target recognition by neoantigen-specific T cells (Figure 2). Interestingly, tumor cell lysis was independent of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells (Figure 1C). Additionally, IFNg neutralization did not affect PD-L1 expression nor ability to lyse tumor cells (Figure 3). These data show that when tumor cells are incubated with autologous tumor-specific T cells, the tumor cells upregulate PD-L1 expression yet do not escape lysis by T cells.</p><p id="Par2031">Since lysis of tumor cells may occur prior to their upregulating PD-L1, we pre-incubated tumor cells with soluble IFNg prior to co-culture with T cells. Tumor cells were 96% PD-L1+, and were lysed by tumor-specific T cells at the same level of target cells that had not been treated with IFNg (Figure 4).</p><p id="Par2032"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2033">Collectively, these data lend support to the notion that, in this system, PD-L1 is not a main player in MDS tumor immune evasion, suggesting that tumor immune evasion might function in a PD-L1-independent way. They also suggest that cognate recognition of tumor cells by neoantigen-specific T cells can cause the upregulation PD-L1 on target cells via a yet to be identified mechanism.</p><p id="Par2034"><bold>Ethics Approval</bold></p><p id="Par2035">The study was approved by the University of California, San Diego's Institutional Review Board, HRPP #161345.</p><p id="Par2036"><fig id="Fig59"><label>Fig. 1 (abstract P175).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Ferrari, V SITC 2019 abstract slide 1</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig59_HTML.png" id="MO72"/></fig></p><p id="Par2037"><fig id="Fig60"><label>Fig. 2 (abstract P175).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Ferrari, V SITC 2019 abstract slide 2</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig60_HTML.png" id="MO73"/></fig></p><p id="Par2038"><fig id="Fig61"><label>Fig. 3 (abstract P175).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Ferrari, V SITC 2019 abstract slide 2</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig61_HTML.png" id="MO74"/></fig></p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec696"><title>P176 Adoptive cell therapy using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) for metastatic uveal melanoma: feasibility of treatment using a product generated from the primary tumor</title><sec id="Sec697"><title>Marie-Andree Forget, PhD, Cara Haymaker, PhD, Orenthial Fulbright, BS, Shawne Thorsen, BS, Esteban Flores, BS, Arely Wahl, MSc, Rene Tavera, BS, Benjamin Tintera, BS, Timothy Woody, Michelle Williams, Yun Shin Chun, Patrick Hwu, MD, Dan Gombos, Sapna Patel, MD, Rodabe Amaria, MD, Chantale Bernatchez</title><sec id="Sec698"><title>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States</title><sec id="Sec699"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Chantale Bernatchez (CBernatchez@mdanderson.org)</title><p id="Par2039"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par2040">MD Anderson Cancer Center’s tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) program has expanded TIL from tumor fragments of cutaneous metastatic melanoma using high dose IL-2 from over 900 patients with a growth success averaging 62% [1]. Surprisingly, this growth success plunges to 45% for metastatic uveal melanoma tumor fragments [2] and less than 20% from primary uveal tumors. The reason for this drop is unclear as uveal melanomas have an infiltration of CD8+TIL comparable to cutaneous melanoma [2], which in theory makes it an attractive candidate for immunotherapy. However, limited success observed with checkpoint therapy prompted us to explore ex vivo manipulation of the TIL. A previous report demonstrated the feasibility of TIL adoptive cell therapy for metastatic uveal patients using a TIL product expanded from metastases [3].</p><p id="Par2041">Since the primary and metastatic sites of uveal melanoma display preserved gene mutations, indicating a potential shared antigen landscape, one could propose generating a TIL product from the primary tumor when the patient undergoes enucleation and to utilize this product for treatment at time of recurrence.</p><p id="Par2042"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2043">Given the challenge of propagating TIL from a primary uveal tumor in high dose of IL-2 only, we hypothesized that our new TIL3.0 method to propagate TIL from tumor fragments (1st phase of expansion), based on the 3-signals required for optimal activation of a T-cell (TCR engagement, costimulation and cytokine exposure) would enable TIL growth from a higher percentage of primary uveal tumors given the success obtained with metastatic sites [1].

Macrophages and dendritic cells lacking NF-kB p50 are skewed towards a pro-inflammatory phenotype, with increased cytokine expression and enhanced T cell activation; additionally, murine melanoma, fibrosarcoma, colon carcinoma, and glioblastoma grow slower in p50-/- mice. Given these data, we evaluated efficacy of p50-deficient immature myeloid cells (p50-IMC) adoptively transferred into tumor-bearing hosts. Immature cells were utilized to maximize tumor localization, and pretreatment with 5-fluorouracil (5FU) was examined due to its potential to impair marrow production of myeloid cells, to target tumor myeloid cells, and to potentially release tumor neoantigens.</p><p id="Par2059"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2060">WT-IMC or p50-IMC were generated by culturing lineage-negative marrow cells from WT or p50-/- mice in media containing TPO, SCF, and FL for six days followed by M-CSF for one day on ultra-low attachment plates. Mice inoculated with Hi-Myc prostate cancer (PCa) or K-Ras(G12D) pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDC)-luciferase cells received 5FU followed five days later by three doses of 1E7 IMC every three to four days. Some groups also received four doses of anti-PD-1 antibody twice weekly alone or with p50-IMC.</p><p id="Par2061"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2062">PCa grew slower in p50-/- mice, and absence of host p50 led to prolonged survival of mice inoculated orthotopically with PDC. 5FU followed by p50-IMC slowed PCa and PDC tumor growth ~3-fold in contrast to 5FU followed by WT-IMC, 5FU alone, or p50-IMC alone. Slowed tumor growth was evident for 93% of PCa tumors but only 53% of PDC tumors. In PCa, p50-IMC predominantly generated tumor and draining lymph node F4/80+ macrophages, but also CD11b+F4/80-CD11c+ conventional dendritic cells. A subset of tumor and nodal macrophages co-expressed Ly6C and MHCII and had reduced MR compared to host macrophages, collectively indicating a pro-inflammatory phenotype. p50-IMC also produced a 5-fold increase in activated PCa tumor CD8 T cells, and antibody-mediated CD8 T cell depletion obviated slower tumor growth induced by 5FU followed by p50-IMC. Anti-PD-1 markedly slowed PCa growth but had little efficacy against PDC, whereas anti-PD-1 combined with p50-IMC slowed PDC tumor growth to prolong survival more effectively than either alone in an initial experiment.</p><p id="Par2063"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2064">5FU followed by p50-IMC slows the growth of murine prostate and pancreatic ductal carcinoma and depends upon CD8 T cell activation.

Our work aims to modulate metabolic pathways during ex vivo expansion of T-cells for translation of these findings to clinical adoptive therapies. Class I catalytic PI3K enzymes, such as PI3Kdelta and PI3Kgamma, regulate T-cell differentiation, regulatory T cell formation, and TCR signaling [2]. In this study, we hypothesized that pharmacological inhibition of these pathways during ex vivo culture would increase populations of early memory CAR T with enhanced metabolic and survival potential.</p><p id="Par2069"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2070">Healthy- and CLL- donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and cryopreserved. Thawed cells were sorted for CD3 expression prior to culture (or transduction) and expanded in G-Rex plates using anti-CD3/CD28 beads, 30 U/mL interleukin-2, and investigational drugs: idelalisib, duvelisib and ibrutinib for 9 days.</p><p id="Par2071"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2072">Class I catalytic enzymes in T-cells, PI3Kdelta and PI3Kgamma, exhibit domain homology (Figure-1A). Accordingly, maximum cell yields for both idelalisib (Figure 1B) and duvelisib (Figure 1C) occurred upon inhibition of both isoforms. Comparing doses of duvelisib, idelalisib, and ibrutinib that yielded optimal T-cell expansion, we showed potent PI3Kdelta/gamma dual antagonism maximizes live T-cell yields (Figure 1D) out-performing interleukin-2-inducible kinase inhibition. PI3K antagonists increased frequencies of cells expressing co-stimulatory molecules (Figure 2A-B). A dose-dependent increase in cells expressing FAS/FAS-L (Figure 2C) and an increased expression of pro-survival BCL-2 (Figure 2D) after anti-CD3/28 stimulation suggests the increase in live cells with a TSCM phenotype is likely due to enhanced cell survival.</p><p id="Par2073">Next, we confirmed the positive effect of dual PI3Kdelta/gamma inhibition in expansion of T cells from CLL donors (Figure 3A-B). PI3K antagonists increased frequencies of CD8 cells (Figure 3C) and co-stimulatory molecule expressing cells (Figure 3D-E). Interestingly, addition of idelalisib to T cell cultures resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in immune checkpoint molecules LAG-3, Tim-3, and PD-1 (Figure 3F-J). Given the importance of T cells with the stem cell memory (TSCM) phenotype in adoptive T-cell therapy, T-cell differentiation was studied. PI3K antagonists increase the frequency of early, T-memory, and effector memory cells (Figure 4A). Notably, the frequency of TSCM doubled (Figure 4B). Lastly, PI3K antagonists significantly increased the mitochondrial mass (Figure 4C) within total CD3 (Figure 4D) and CD8 (Figure 4E) subsets.</p><p id="Par2074"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2075">Dual inhibition of PI3Kdelta and PI3Kgamma modulates aspects of T-cell biology relevant to CAR T remissions.

While successful T cell-based treatments of patients with widely metastatic melanoma, synovial sarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma and cancers of the breast, colon, and cervix have been reported in recent years, most patients with common epithelial cancers fail to respond to treatment. While several factors can contribute to the efficacy of ACT, a major inherent limitation is the induction of terminally differentiated phenotype coupled with the loss of proliferative capacity in TIL during current ex vivo expansion protocols. Individual gene knockout approaches for enhancing T cell-based cancer immunotherapies are low-throughput and can improve one desired function (T cell memory) at the expense of another equally important function (expansion). Thus, there is significant interest in identifying T-cell intrinsic negative regulatory circuits that limit their ability to expand robustly ex vivo, while dampening their terminal effector differentiation along with the reduction of oxidative stress and genomic damage.</p><p id="Par2115"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2116">To identify the T cell intrinsic negative regulatory circuits, we developed a multi-phenotype genetic screen to systematically target 29 major kinases screen to concurrently measure the impacts of individual gene knockouts on T cell expansion, differentiation, oxidative stress and genomic stress.

We’ve developed a cutting-edge, simple, and feeder-free method to generate highly activated and expanded human NK cells from peripheral blood (US9404083, PCT/JP2018/018236, PCT/JP2019/012744), and have been conducting further investigation why our new type of NK cells, named as GAIA-102, are so effective to kill malignant cells.</p><p id="Par2125"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2126">[Materials and Methods] Cryopreserved PBMCs purchased from HemaCare Corporation were mixed and processed by using LOVO and CliniMACS® Prodigy (automated/closed systems).

No specific epitope was identified for 12D7 though it bound to the N-fragment (25-358aa). CARTs built from the 3 mAbs underwent expansion in response to HepG2 cell stimulation. However, their effector function was significantly different. 8F8 CARTs possessed the strongest effector function. 6G11 CARTs generated the greatest expansion, but with slightly weaker function. In contrast, 12D7 CART had the weakest effector function. Soluble hGPC3 did not activate CARTs, nor blocked CART activation by tumor cells.

These characteristics are due to intrinsic properties of the bone marrow (BM); known to be a reservoir for long-lived memory T cells. It has also been established that naïve and memory T cells are metabolically quiescent, favoring oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) over glycolysis, while effector T cells favor glycolysis to fuel their rapid proliferation.</p><p id="Par2143"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2144">We examined how activation and expansion of MILs in hypoxia could be used to better understand the inherent properties of the BM, to exploit these properties, and enhance the efficacy of MILs in ACT, especially when compared to that of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). By activating MILs in hypoxia, we can select for and/or alter the cells best suited to mount an effective anti-tumor response.</p><p id="Par2145"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2146">Activation under hypoxic conditions alters MILs in several unique ways. MILs show greater overall expansion, enhanced tumor-specificity, and a unique metabolic profile—upregulating both OXPHOS and glycolytic machinery. This metabolic profile suggests that hypoxia-activated MILs possess properties of both effector and memory cells. PBLs grown under the same conditions fail to expand significantly and show no metabolic differences or specificity. Following activation in hypoxia we have found that MILs have upregulated metabolism-related genes such as CPT1A and GLUT1 and 3, as well as anti-apoptotic factors such as BCL2 and BCL2L1 at an RNA level. The post-expansion MILs product, using intracellular staining and FACs analysis, shows an increase in mitochondrial proteins, including TOMM20, CPT1a, and SDHa, increased mTOR signaling, and increased glycolytic machinery—HK2 and GLUT1. Additionally, while cell-cycle analysis with Ki67 and PI shows that MILs are more resting at baseline and arrested in G0, upon activation in hypoxia they become more proliferative—moving into S and G2/M phase—than normoxic MILs or PBLs and maintain this phenotype over time. This finding is supported by our RNAseq data showing a lack of transcriptional activity at baseline but a significant increase by day 3 of activation. Gene expression analysis has also shown that there is a substantial increase in expression of IL2 and IL15Ra with a significant decrease in the expression of IL10 transcripts.</p><p id="Par2147"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2148">These findings suggest that hypoxia contributes to the unique properties of MILs through modification of their metabolic profile and is being uniquely employed to generate more effective MILs, and not PBLs, for adoptive cell therapy.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec732"><title>P185 T cell antigen presenting cell (tAPC) is a strategy to induce CAR T expansion in vivo in the absence of a tumor for on-target toxicity studies</title><sec id="Sec733"><title>Yen Ho, BS, Jon Jones, BA, Patrick Carlson, BS, Cyr de Imus, Rebekah Turk, Dina Alcorn, Kyle Kolaja, Ruth Salmon, PhD, Thomas Long</title><sec id="Sec734"><title>Celgene Corporation, Seattle, WA, United States</title><sec id="Sec735"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Thomas Long (thomas.long@junotherapeutics.com)</title><p id="Par2149"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par2150">Preclinical safety evaluation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells presents a number of unique challenges. One of those challenges is the development of a Cynomolgus macaque toxicology model as a tool to understand potential on-target CAR T cell toxicity. This is important for CAR T cell programs where the lead binder is cyno cross-reactive and the target has known normal tissue expression conserved across species. Unlike many mouse models, non-human primates lack target-expressing tumors that can drive CAR T cell activation and expansion; it would be advantageous to recapitulate that expansion in the context of a toxicity model.</p><p id="Par2151"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2152">T cell antigen presenting cells (tAPCs) have been reported to drive measurable CAR T cell expansion in Rhesus macaques [1]. The advantages of this strategy include the ease of manufacturing tAPCs in parallel to CAR T cells and co-engraftment of tAPCs with CAR T cells in hematological niches to ensure antigen availability. The optimal tAPC dosing strategy to drive a strong and persistent CAR T cell activity has not been determined. Here, we generated human anti-CD19 CAR T cells expressing firefly luciferase and human T cells expressing a truncated human CD19 (CD19t) lacking the intracellular domain as tAPCs. We then dosed mice either with CAR and tAPC concurrently, or with CAR first then followed by tAPCs three days later.</p><p id="Par2153"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2154">(Figure 1) shows bioluminescent imaging (BLI) measurements that indicate concurrent and delayed tAPC dosing have similar CAR T cell expansion kinetics; however, the delayed tAPC dosing exhibits a greater magnitude of CAR T cell expansion. In both cases, the CAR T cell expansion occurs in a tAPC dose-dependent manner. Imaging shows that concurrent dosing leads to CAR T cell proliferation primary in the lungs, whereas delayed tAPC dosing leads to more systemic CAR T cell expansion. In addition, flow cytometry data show a significant depletion of tAPCs in the peripheral blood between day 7 and day 14.</p><p id="Par2155"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2156">Follow-up studies delivering additional tAPC doses three, six, and nine days after CAR T cells show that repeated tAPC administration can significantly increase the CAR T cell exposure over time compared to a single tAPC dose.

Our lab has shown that shortening ex vivo expansion of Th17 cells licenses a proinflammatory cell product which induces cytokine storm with high levels of systemic IL-6 in tumor-bearing hosts. Despite potential toxicity, briefly expanded Th17 cells eradicate large established tumors in low doses and generate durable memory against tumor rechallenge, suggesting a therapeutic benefit to the inflammatory state. Prior reports show that IL-6 promotes functional CD4+ T cell memory formation. Given that IL-6 is blocked clinically to manage cytokine release syndrome, we addressed the physiologic impact of IL-6 on efficacy and durability of Th17 cell therapy.</p><p id="Par2213"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2214">Th17 cells were expanded ex vivo using the TRP-1 transgenic mouse model in which CD4+ T cells express a TCR that recognizes tyrosinase-related protein 1 on melanoma. Naïve CD4+ T cells were polarized to the Th17 phenotype and infused into mice with B16F10 melanoma after a nonmyeloablative total body irradiation (5 Gy) preparative regimen. Serum cytokine levels were obtained by multiplex array and IL-6 signaling was inhibited with antibodies targeting the IL-6R and neutralizing IL-6 cytokine.</p><p id="Par2215"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2216">Acute IL-6 blockade post Th17 cell transfer did not impact the primary response against melanoma nor the engraftment of Th17 cells. However, blocking IL-6 abrogated long-term responses increasing the frequency of tumor relapse upon secondary challenge and reduced survival. Mechanistically, IL-6 blockade reduced phosphorylation of STAT3 in transferred T cells associating with diminished Bcl-2 expression. The CD4+ compartment was reshaped by IL-6 blockade via promoting a greater frequency of FoxP3+ Treg cells in the peripheral blood, tumor and draining lymph nodes. Given the plasticity of Th17 and Treg cells, we assessed FoxP3 expression within the cell product 10 days post transfer and found that the frequency of FoxP3+ transferred cells was significantly heightened through IL-6 blockade.</p><p id="Par2217"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2218">IL-6 induced by Th17 cell therapy promotes an inflammatory over regulatory phenotype in vivo permitting durable memory against tumors. The expansion of tumor-specific regulatory cells from the transferred product is enhanced in the absence of IL-6 signaling.

Moreover, roughly 50% of human solid tumors lose their HLA expression to avoid detection by the human immune system. [3] HLA-G is therefore an outstanding target for CAR T-cells since, like the placenta, it is up-regulated in HLA-negative tumors to suppress NK destruction.

We have recently developed an in vivo model of ovarian cancer that can be used for testing the efficacy of our CAR-T cells. In this model, NSG mice are injected with 2 million SKOV3-Luc cells intraperitoneally (ip). Seven-10 days after injection, tumors are visible when observed by bioluminescence imaging, at which time the treatment group will receive an ip injection of anti HLA-G CAR-T cells.

In tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), tumors do not acquire additional mutations, and patients are not eligible for therapeutics that rely on neoantigen formation. However, the affected gene is responsible for several predictable phenotypic changes. As mTOR hyperactivity resulting from mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 is associated with overexpression of some melanoma-associated antigens, de novo expression of ganglioside D3 expression may render the resulting, benign tumors eligible for immunotherapy.</p><p id="Par2273"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2274">We probed the expression of GD3 in human TSC lesions of the lungs, kidneys, skin and brain by immunostaining and monitored anti-GD3 titers in serum by ELISA. Infiltration by NK cells and NKT was measured to look for natural responses to the cell surface antigen. We next isolated tumors cells from TSC2 heterozygote mice and confirmed loss of heterozygosity by genotyping before challenging groups of 10 SCID/beige mice in 2 repeat experiments, and subjecting them to adoptive transfer by GD3-CART cells and measured tumor sizes over time. Similarly we treated groups of 8 ageing TSC mice &gt;16 months of age by adoptive GD3 CART-cell transfer, and measured surface tumor growth on internal organs.</p><p id="Par2275"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2276">We found consistent overexpression of GD3 in tissues from TSC patients compared to healthy controls. GD3 overexpression was not accompanied by an influx of NK(T) cells, and anti-GD3 titers were reduced rather than elevated in patients, supporting the concept that slow growing tumors in TSC patients are not immunogenic. However, CART cells responsive to GD3, supplemented by IL-2, mediated prolonged and significant anti-tumor responses in both immunodeficient and immune competent hosts. The majority of TSC2 heterozygote mice treated by CAR T cells displayed no tumors at end point, versus all mice treated with untransduced T cells.</p><p id="Par2277"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2278">These promising results infer that adoptive transfer of transgenic T cells can offer an effective strategy to not only prevent further tumor growth as rapamycin therapy does, but also to treat and even eliminate arising tumors.

Nonetheless, drawbacks associated with CAR T-cell therapies include on-target/off-tumor effects and cytokine release syndrome. Aiming an increased clinical safety while preserving the efficacy of such therapy, we developed a novel modular universal CAR platform termed UniCAR. UniCAR T-cells are exclusively activated in the presence of a target module (TM), which establishes the cross-link between antigen-specific cancer cells and UniCAR T-cells in an individualized time- and target-dependent manner. The carbohydrate antigen sialyl-Tn (STn) is a particularly interesting target due to its expression in several types of cancer and absence in normal healthy tissues. Given the small size of such TMs, they are rapidly eliminated and thus, possible side effects and activation of UniCAR T-cells can be easily controlled by TM dosing. In late phases of treatment, TMs with extended half-life may play an important role by improving the eradication of residual tumor cells.</p><p id="Par2305"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2306">In this work, a novel longer-lasting TM against STn was developed, characterized and compared to the previously developed short-lived anti-STn TM [1]. Short-lived TMs are composed of a tumor-specific binding moiety fused to the La peptide epitope (E5B9) which is recognized by UniCAR T-cells. In extended half-life TMs, these two components are fused via an Fc domain derived from the human IgG4 molecule. Functional and pharmacokinetic properties were assessed using in vitro and in vivo assays.</p><p id="Par2307"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2308">The developed anti-STn IgG4-based TM efficiently activates and redirects UniCAR T-cells to STn-expressing tumors in a highly efficient target-specific and target-dependent manner, promoting the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor cell lysis of breast and bladder cancer cells in vitro and of breast cancer cells in experimental mice. A comparable or increased killing efficiency was obtained at a lower concentration range in comparison to the results obtained for the anti-STn scFv-based TM. Additionally, PET studies demonstrate the specific enrichment of the anti-STn IgG4-based TM at the tumor site presenting a prolonged serum half-life compared to the scFv short-lived TM.</p><p id="Par2309"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2310">Taken together, these data demonstrate the effective and potential application of this CAR T-cell-derived modular system to target STn in different types of cancer using different TM formats.

As an alternative, the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offers a promising approach to overcoming existing challenges faced when engineering NK cell-based immunotherapies. However, approaches for generating NK cells from iPSCs described so far have several shortcomings: they utilize sera or feeder layers to adapt iPSCs or culture hematopoietic progenitors, take months to complete, and rely on individualized, and thus highly variable, iPSC reprogramming protocols, limiting their utility.</p><p id="Par2317"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2318">We have generated NK cells from iPS cells using a novel feeder-free differentiation protocol starting from either centrally-validated and banked iPSC lines or iPSCs reprogrammed from donor fibroblasts. Our protocol utilizes a two-step, entirely feeder-free procedure involving hematopoietic progenitor generation followed by NK differentiation. These differentiated NK cells have been characterized for inhibitory and activating marker expression, IFN-γ production, degranulation, and cytotoxicity against a number of solid tumor targets, including primary patient-derived glioblastoma cells.

Genetically unmodified MILsTM have demonstrated antitumor activity in patients with multiple myeloma [2] and are being developed for several other tumor types. Distinguishing features of T cells from bone marrow compared to T cells from peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) include their memory phenotype, inherent tumor antigen-specificity, higher CD8:CD4 ratio and ability to persist long-term [3]. Based on these differences, we hypothesized that MILsTM would provide a more robust platform for CAR-T therapy compared to PBLs. We have previously shown that CAR-modified MILsTM (CAR-MILsTM) demonstrate superior killing of tumor target cells in vitro compared to CAR-T cells generated from patient-matched PBLs (CAR-PBLs) [4].

When compared to CAR-PBLs, CAR-MILsTM demonstrated increased polyfunctionality and increased PSI in both CD4 and CD8 T cells. The enhanced PSI in CAR-MILsTM was predominated by effector, stimulatory and chemoattractive proteins associated with antitumor activity including Granzyme B, IFNg, IL-8, MIP1a and MIP1b.

NK cells express an array of unique activating and inhibitory receptors whose aggregate signaling determine activation of NK cell effector function. Adoptive transfer of NK cells has demonstrated the potential to induce antitumor responses in the clinic. Celularity has developed a platform for generating cytotoxic NK cells from placental CD34+ cells (PNK cells) for adoptive cancer immunotherapy. Although PNK cells demonstrate cytotoxicity against diverse cancer cell types, their activating mechanisms are little characterized. In this study, we explore the contribution of specific signaling pathways and upstream NK cell receptors involved in PNK cell cytotoxicity against glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell targets.</p><p id="Par2357"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2358">PNK cells were transcriptionally profiled using scRNAseq and qRT-PCR to identify candidate pathways regulating cytolytic function. Expression of major receptors and intracellular signaling molecules were analyzed using flow cytometry and western blot. PNK cell phenotype was compared to circulating NK cells. PNK cytotoxicity was evaluated against GBM cell lines (LN-18 and U251) in xCELLigence platform and a degranulation assay using CD107a staining. The role of key signaling pathways driving PNK effector functions was analyzed in cytolysis assays using small molecule inhibitors of Src kinases, SYK, PLC-γ, PI3K and MAP kinases, including JNK, p38 and ERK.</p><p id="Par2359"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2360">PNK cells highly express genes mediating NK cell effector functions, including NCR1, NCR2, NCR3, KLRK1 and CD226. Flow cytometry demonstrated increased expression of NKp44 (99.7±0.2% vs. 69.3±5.2%), NKG2D (68.7±7.9% vs. 44.6±5.8%) and GITR 99.7±0.2% vs. 15.0±3.2%) on PNK cells when compared to circulating NK cells. PNK cells demonstrated strong cytolytic activity against multiple GBM cell lines. While inhibitors of Src, SYK, PLC-γ, p38 and ERK did not modulate PNK cytotoxicity, inhibitors targeting JNK and PI3K pathways significantly suppressed PNK cell cytotoxicity, specifically, 64.9±4.7% inhibition by SP600125 (JNK) and 25.2±3.3% inhibition by Ly294002 (PI3K) on LN-18 cells; 100% inhibition by SP600125 and 45.5.5±8.9% by Ly294002 on U251. JNK and PI3K inhibitors also reduced degranulation (70.6±3.2% by SP600125 and 58.4±3.6% by Ly294002). Furthermore, PI3K pathway controlled PNK cytokine production upon coculture with U251 cell line, whereas JNK inhibition had minimal effect.</p><p id="Par2361"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2362">Our results demonstrate the importance of PI3K and JNK pathways in mediating PNK cytotoxicity to GBM cell line targets.

PTTs represent one of the most promising cell therapy targets, as they are shared within and between cancer indications.

However, relapses due to the loss of target antigens challenge the success of these therapies [1,3]. Multitargeted immunotherapies, such as cancer vaccinations specific to multiple cancer-associated peptides, are possible approaches. However, clinical studies have shown that they have limited efficacy with respect to the induction of objective responses [4]. The graft-versus-leukemia effect observed after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is another example of strong multitargeted antitumor immunity mediated by donor T-cells that recognize and react to multiple allo-antigens [5]. In the present study, we demonstrated a novel approach for attaining alloreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell-induced multitargeted cancer immunity that does not utilize allo-HSCT.</p><p id="Par2374"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2375">Cluster of differentiation (CD)4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells isolated form the spleen of BALB/c mice were separately activated in cultures by dendritic cells (DCs) generated from the bone marrow of C57BL/6 (B6) mice. The resultant host-reactive donor T-cells were injected into B6 mice bearing pre-established B16 melanoma. Host T-cells activated by syngeneic DCs were used as the control.</p><p id="Par2376"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2377">Whereas the intratumoral injection of host-reactive donor CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells elicited potent antitumor immunity against established B16 melanoma in an alloantigen-dependent manner, intratumoral injection of host-reactive donor CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells or host-type syngeneic T-cells failed to induce antitumor responses. The number of injected donor-type host-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells diminished after tumor regression and did not induce graft-versus-host disease-like complications. Interestingly, early after injection, the alloreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells underwent marked expansion and produced higher levels of interferon-gamma compared to syngeneic CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells. This was accompanied by markedly increased infiltration of host macrophages within the tumors as early as four hours after injection. These tumor-infiltrating macrophages secreted higher levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-12 and IL-23, which are critical for inducing effector T-cell responses. Indeed, 24 hours after injection of alloreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, the infiltration of host effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells into tumors significantly increased, as evidenced by their production of high levels of perforin and granzyme B. Furthermore, the melanoma B6 mice that survived alloreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell therapy developed host memory T-cells specific to the B16 melanoma and acquired complete resistance to the tumor rechallenge.</p><p id="Par2378"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2379">Results showed that immune reactions triggered by ex vivo-generated alloreactive CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells disrupt immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments and establish long-term host antitumor memory T-cell responses.

Despite major advances in these therapies, there are few systems available that are practical for use at both the pre-clinical and clinical stages. To address this need, we have designed a system called BATON which is designed for optimal culture of both adherent and suspension cell types (Fig. 1). Cells are cultured via continual perfusion and the fluid flow loop also enables automated cell loading and harvest. This poster will describe two application areas, namely T cell expansion relevant to autologous CAR-T and TCR therapies and dendritic cell (DC)-T cell co-culture for neo-antigen-based T cell therapies.</p><p id="Par2392"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2393">The T cell expansion capability of the BATON system was evaluated by seeding BATON cartridges each having a surface area of 40 cm2 and volume of 25 mL with 23 million PBMCs along with CD3/28 Dynabeads. Cells were continually perfused with Irvine Scientific Prime XV xeno-free T cell medium with 33 U/mL IL-2 for 9 days. For comparison, a similar culture was performed in a G-Rex 6 well plate. For DC-T cell co-culture experiments enriched monocytes (MOs) were seeded into the BATON system at a seeding density of approximately 600k MOs/cm2 into two cartridges. Monocytes were differentiated into immature DCs by continually perfusing the seeded MOs for 6 days with CellGenix DC Medium supplemented with 350 U/mL IL-4 and GM-CSF (CellGenix). On Day 6, the DCs from one cartridge were harvested for flow cytometry. The other cartridge was drained without removal of the DCs and seeded with approximately 23 million PBMCs. This cartridge was then perfused with Irvine Scientific Prime XV xeno-free T cell medium with 33 U/mL IL-2. Cells were harvested following 7 days of co-culture. In addition to flow cytometry characterization, the cytotoxicity of the T cells was evaluated via co-culture with Jurkat cells.</p><p id="Par2394"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2395">BATON achieved high levels of T cell expansion, comparable to G-Rex (Fig. 2-3) and harvested cells showed strong cytotoxic ability (Fig. 4).

All constructs were detected by western blot. Strong T cell surface expression was seen for CD8L/CD4TM, CD8L/CD4TM, CD8L/TNFRSF19TM, and TNFRSF16L/TNFRSF16TM. Intermediate surface expression was seen for TNFRSF9L/TNFRSF9TM. Constructs with TNFRSF19L/ TNFRSF19TM had very poor surface expression. However, these “undetectable” CARs by flow cytometry had the highest level of cytotoxicity and cytokine release vs Raji lymphoma. Immunofluorescence studies with transduced T cells on their own, or in the presence of Raji target cells, demonstrated that TNFRSF19 sequence may mediate an intracellular residence profile.

The mechanism by which these CARs are functionally active, while in a primarily intracellular state, is under investigation. Intracellular residence of CARs may be a novel mechanism to prevent undesired activation or T cell exhaustion and represents a novel locus of CAR-T activity control.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec820"><title>P207 A patient-driven ex vivo 3D tumor organoid model to assess efficacy of tumor infiltrating T-cell adoptive cell therapy</title><sec id="Sec821"><title>Jenny Kreahling, PhD, Mibel Pabon, PhD, Melba Page, PhD, Vijayendra Agrawal, PhD, Soner Altiok, MD, PhD</title><sec id="Sec822"><title>Nilogen Oncosystems, Tampa, FL, United States</title><sec id="Sec823"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Soner Altiok (soner@nilogen.com)</title><p id="Par2414"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par2415">Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of ex vivo expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) has shown promising therapeutic efficacy in subsets of patients with several solid tumors including NSCLC.

These data demonstrate that CAR19 T cells can be redirected to kill solid tumors in vivo.</p><p id="Par2434"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2435">We cloned a highly stable CD19 extracellular domain (ECD) in frame with an anti-Her2 scFv to create, express and purify CD19-ECD-anti-Her2 bridging proteins. The sequence was also cloned downstream of a CAR19 domain and P2A cleavage site in a lentiviral vector. Transduced primary T cells expressed the CAR19 and secreted the bridging protein. These bridging protein formats were evaluated with in vitro cytotoxicity assays and Her2+ tumors in vivo. Finally, we added an anti-EGFR scFv sequence, creating an extremely potent multi-antigen targeting module.</p><p id="Par2436"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2437">Incorporating a stabilized CD19 ECD in bridging proteins improved protein expression, including from CAR19 T cells. CAR19 T cells secreting stabilized CD19-anti-Her2 bridging proteins were highly potent in vitro and in vivo targeting CD19+ or Her2+ cells. An anti-EGFR scFv was added to the CD19-ECD-anti-Her2 bridging protein. This novel multi-antigen targeting bridging protein supports highly potent cytotoxicity against single and dual antigen-expressing tumor cells while retaining intrinsic anti-CD19 activity, providing these unique CARs with a tumor-independent and self-renewing antigen depot in CD19-positive normal B cells. For specific indications a third binding domain is added.</p><p id="Par2438"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2439">We have created a robust system for targeting multiple tumor antigens simultaneously with a single CAR T cell.

Both cytokines have been explored as cancer immunotherapies, but clinical success has been limited due to severe side effects. To limit systemic toxicities, Torque has developed its Deep-Primed™ T cell therapy technology. Multi-targeted T cells (MTC) specific for multiple tumor antigens are generated from patient apheresis.

Traditional management of advanced stage OvCa includes tumor reductive surgery and adjuvant platinum-taxane chemotherapy, which results in high rates of initial complete response. However, nearly 90% of patients recur and the 5-year survival rate for late-stage disease is only 28. Immunotherapy has become a powerful treatment option for several solid tumor types. The presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) is correlated with better prognosis in ovarian cancer, pointing at the possibility to benefit from harnessing their anti-tumor activity. The effectiveness of adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with TIL has already been shown in metastatic melanoma with objective response rates of 40-50%.

These engineered cells were then mixed with freshly thawed human PBMCs and co-incubated for up to 14 days.

In contrast, PBMCs that were activated and expanded by CD3/CD28 activation beads showed less heterogenous expansion. PBMCs expanded with immunomodulatory cell lines demonstrated potent cytotoxic activity towards both the parental cell line, as well as other melanoma and non-melanoma cancer cell lines (Figure 2).

Autologous EBV-specific T-cells (EBVSTs) directed to T2-Ags have produced complete responses in ~50% lymphoma patients[1]. However, in our ongoing clinical trial, we failed to generate EBVSTs from 24% of the patients procured; manufacturing failures associated with lack of T-cell expansion and T2-Ag-specificity. Further, in lines successfully expanded, many EBVST lines demonstrated low T2-Ag specificity and some contained a high frequency of NK-cells. Our goal is to improve both the manufacturing success rate and clinical efficacy of EBVSTs. In EBV-exposed individuals, EBVSTs reside in CD45RA-CD45RO+ memory compartment, while CD45RA-positive population includes unwanted naïve T-cells, suppressive regulatory-T cells, and NK-cells[2,3]. We hypothesized that removal of CD45RA-positive cells from PBMCs prior to EBV-antigen specific stimulation would improve EBVST generation and specificity by eliminating competing naïve T-cells, while reducing potentially inhibitory cells capable of inhibiting the outgrowth of antigen-specific T-cells. We, therefore investigated the effects of selective depletion of CD45RA-positive cells from PBMCs prior to EBV T2-Ags stimulation.</p><p id="Par2494"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2495">EBVSTs were generated from whole PBMCs and CD45RA depleted (RAD) PBMCs and we measured proliferation by counting, T2-Ag specificity using IFN-gamma ELIspot assays and cell-phenotype by flow cytometric analysis.

T2-Ag specificity increased by 3-5 fold as measured by gamma-IFN release in response to T2-Ags stimulation in both healthy donors and patients. RAD-EBVSTs maintained antigen specificity over multiple rounds of weekly T2-Ags stimulation. Phenotypic analysis demonstrated decreased expression of exhaustion markers in RAD-EBVSTs. Most importantly, this approach restored responsiveness to antigen stimulation in most unresponsive patients enabling the successful reactivation and expansion of EBVSTs from lymphoma patients that failed previously. This advantage extends to VSTs with specificity for HPV, VZV and adenoviral antigens, suggesting that we have identified a general approach for improving the activity of VSTs for immunotherapy. EBVSTs generated from RAD-PBMCs demonstrated more rapid tumor clearance and superior control of metastatic tumors in our xenograft model.</p><p id="Par2498"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2499">This approach to the generation of VSTs is being translated to the clinic for use in multiple clinical trials.

First, adoptive T-cell therapy using TILs seems to be most successful if the TILs include T-cells specific for antigens resulting from individual mutations. Second, the success of checkpoint inhibitors is often correlated with the mutational load of tumors. However, a mutation must fulfill several criteria to be effective as a neoantigen that can be recognized by T-cells. Obviously, the mutation must lead to a novel amino acid sequence (e.g. single amino acid substitution, fusion- or frameshift-sequence), and be located in a gene expressed in tumor cells. Furthermore, a peptide spanning the new sequence needs to be efficiently processed and presented by HLA molecules. Finally, a T-cell response must be triggered that can specifically recognize the mutated epitope.</p><p id="Par2536">Targeting neoantigens as patient-individualized epitopes requires robust processes for rational and rapid selection and validation of neoantigens as T-cell targets. Currently, the most challenging step is predicting specific T-cell responses. Huge efforts have been made to analyze the reactivity of patients’ T-cells against mutations. However, this approach is limited to the T-cell repertoire present in patients at the time of tumor resection or blood draw and might miss potential potent T-cell responses that were lacking or no longer present in the patient. In our opinion, only screening the T-cell repertoire of several healthy donors can answer the question if a specific mutation can trigger T-cell responses.

This inevitably leads to excessive T cell differentiation ex vivo, and decreased T cell functionality and persistence in vivo. Importantly, T cell differentiation is tightly controlled by epigenetic mechanisms that could be targeted therapeutically. The BET protein BRD4 has been reported to regulate expression of the transcription factor BATF that drives CD8+ T cells towards a more effector-like phenotype, while BRD4 inhibition by the drug JQ1 prevented this and thereby enhanced in vivo T cell persistence and function in adoptive immunotherapy models [1]. Ph-29089 is a chemically modified self-delivery RNA inhibitor containing an asymmetric duplex structure (≤ 15 base pair duplex) and a single-strand phosphorothioate tail targeting the BET protein BRD4.

Compared to untreated, NTC-treated and JQ1-treated CD8+ T cells, Ph-29089-treated CD8+ T cells contained higher percentages of central memory and stem cell-like memory T cells, as determined by expression of CD45RA, CCR7, CD62L and CD95.

Currently FDA approved CAR T cell products are autologous-based, requiring individualized blood apheresis and manufacture. Deriving patient-specific CAR T cell products is expensive, laborious, and time consuming, with logistical and regulatory challenges. The success rate of autologous CAR T cell therapy is also limited by the urgency of acute and aggressive cancers, uncertainty over T cell number, and intrinsic differences in T cell functionality. Generating CAR T cells from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) holds encouraging prospect for generating ‘off-the-shelf’ CAR T cell products and overcoming these challenges. iPSCs can proliferate almost infinitely while keeping their pluripotency and lineage differentiation potential. However, the complexity of T cell development and disturbance of T cell differentiation by CAR expression creates a challenge for successful iPSC-derived CAR T cell generation.

These iPSC-derived CD19CAR T cells expanded robustly within two weeks (~100 fold), and showed potent antigen-specific cytotoxicity against CD19+ parental tumor cells such as NALM6 and Raji comparing to their CD19 knockout control cells. It is intriguing that the in vitro cytotoxicity potency of iPSC-derived CD19CAR T cells was superior to conventional PBMC-derived CAR T cells generated from the same donor. These iPSC-derived CD19CAR T cells also demonstrated efficient degranulation activity and a Th1 cytokine profile (e.g. IFNgamma and TNFalpha when challenged with CD19+ target cells.

In a screen of 100+ genes for enhanced T cell function when co-expressed with an anti-glypican-3 (GPC3) CAR, we identified the first candidate of our BOXR platform, BOXR1030, which co-expresses the transgene glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 2 (GOT2), a critical enzyme involved in mitochondrial metabolism.</p><p id="Par2623"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2624">We compared functional and phenotypic readouts of second-generation GPC3 CAR-T cells with BOXR1030.

To overcome this, we have developed an approach that harnesses the natural process of red blood cell (RBC) clearance from the body to activate the immune response in vivo. Using the CellSqueeze® microfluidics platform, we have generated activating antigen carriers (AACs), engineered from RBCs, that are highly loaded with antigen and adjuvant and potently activate APCs in vivo.

In addition, we quantified endogenous immune responses to AAC administration by flow cytometry. To determine the ability of AACs to control subcutaneously implanted tumors, we measured tumor growth rates in mice treated either prophylactically or therapeutically with AACs.

Moreover, we find that murine SQZ AACs processed with CellSqueeze® stimulate model antigen CD4+ and CD8+ responses and cancer-associated antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses in vivo. We observe that prophylactic and therapeutic AAC administration to mice strongly impedes tumor growth and extends survival. Following therapeutic immunization, the anti-tumor responses correlate with an over 10x increase in antigen-specific CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes compared to untreated mice.

They can be activated via their invariant T cell receptor recognizing lipid antigens (e.g. alpha-Galactosylceramide) presented on CD1d molecules, through NKG2D - NKG2D ligand interactions, and by cytokines. Upon activation, large amounts of IFN-gamma production leads to recruitment and activation of T cells and NK cells. iNKT cells also exert potent direct cytolytic activity. While they are found in very low numbers in human blood (~ 0.01% of T lymphocytes), some of their unique properties make them valuable for cell therapy platforms. Due to their invariant antigen receptor, their ability to cause GvHD is minimal, and in fact, they have been demonstrated to suppress GvHD in BMT settings. This facilitates the use of iNKT cells in an allogeneic cell therapy setting. In addition, iNKT cells are very efficient in infiltrating solid tumors to exert their cytotoxic function and activate other anti-tumor immune cells.</p><p id="Par2665"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2666">Due to low frequency of circulating iNKT cells, we have developed and optimized a method to isolate and generate large numbers of these cells in vitro for use in ‘off-the-shelf’ and allogeneic setting.</p><p id="Par2667"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2668">We can achieve over 40,000-fold expansion of iNKT cells through stimulation of the invariant TCR in less than 30 days.

In expanded CAR-T cells, over 28% of cells showed phosphorylated CD3z and increased PD-1 and LAG3 expression indicative of T-cell exhaustion which was not detected in mock T-cells. Since Lym-1 recognizes a conformational epitope on HLA-Dr which may be weakly expressed by activated T-cells, we speculated that the huLym-1-BCAR may stimulate the transduced T-cells to cause tonic signaling and expansion failure. This was confirmed by flow cytometry that detected huLym-1-B but not huLym-1-Bmut, a huLym-1-B mutant that lost its binding ability, binding on T cells. Meanwhile, neither huLym-1-Bmut based CAR or huLym-1-BCAR with inactive CD3z domains showed decreased expansion or increased CD3z phosphorylation.</p><p id="Par2693"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2694">Although the proliferation issue did not compromise CAR-T cells’ effector function, this would impose a potential challenge for large-scale manufacture.

In addition, the expanded huLym-1-B DAPCAR-T cells enabled a lower dose of injected CAR T-cells to induce durable control of metastatic lymphoma in mice with large tumor burdens.

However, the mechanism underpinning rash development and its link to disease outcome or toxicities is not known. Thus, we examined the makeup of immunotherapy-associated skin rash infiltrates with the goal of uncovering mechanistic insights behind rash development.</p><p id="Par2705"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2706">Immunohistochemistry was used to describe the immune infiltrate in skin biopsies from healthy subjects and from a lesional site of patients who developed rash secondary to immunotherapy. Rash samples were obtained from 7 patients receiving α-PD1, α-CTLA4/α-PD1 combination or α-PDL1/α-NKG2A combination. Acetone-fixed sections from frozen biopsies were stained for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68, CD11c, CD1a, CD207, or Ki67.

More moderate enrichment of macrophages (CD68) was observed in rash versus control samples while the abundance of dermal Langerhans cells (CD1a or CD207) was comparable among groups. We observed more proliferating cells in the dermis of rash vs control samples (Ki67 p=0.024), associated with areas of dense immune infiltration. Ki67 expression was highly correlated with both CD68 (r=0.89; p=0.012) and CD11c (r=0.786; p=0.048), suggesting myeloid cell proliferation.

Nivolumab, as an immune checkpoint inhibitor, acts via blockade of the PD-1 receptor, and limits immune responses against tumors. As reported for nivolumab, the anti-PD-1 antibodies can induce immune-related adverse events [1, 2]. Nivolumab related adverse effects compose of general, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, neurologic, skin, and infusion reactions. These adverse effects may be life threatening, so following of patients receiving nivolumab is essential for early diagnosis and management.

Despite the potential for excellent responses, an increased rate of autoimmune neurological toxicity and paraneoplastic conditions has been observed [2]. We present the case of a patient with metastatic HPV-positive HNSCC treated with ipilimumab/nivolumab who experienced severe cerebellar ataxia, with a positive screen for the anti-Zic4 antibody, which has been associated with cerebellar degeneration in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and has not been reported in HNSCC [3].</p><p id="Par2728"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2729">A 40-year-old man diagnosed with HPV-positive HNSCC with metastatic recurrence after radiation treatment of the initial tumor was started on a clinical trial of a DNA-PK inhibitor. His disease progressed, and given his PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 70% he was initiated on ipilimumab/nivolumab. After his second cycle, he presented with sudden blurred vision and mild ataxia, which rapidly progressed to severe ataxia and dysarthria. Autoimmune toxicity was suspected; initial brain imaging and serum testing were unremarkable. While awaiting the results of complex autoimmune and paraneoplastic CSF testing, he was treated with multiple modalities in an escalating fashion with minimal improvement, including pulse-dose corticosteroids, IVIG, and plasmapheresis. The paraneoplastic panel returned negative for common autoimmune culprits in cerebellar encephalopathy including anti-Hu and anti-Yo; however, anti-Zic4 was detected at borderline levels. Repeat MRI showed an enhancing lesion in the cerebellum. Finally, rituximab was initiated, and the patient is slowly improving.

Anti-Zic4 has been historically associated with cerebellar-predominant paraneoplastic neurological disorders in SCLC [3], and to our knowledge, has not been described in HNSCC. Although the patient experienced an impressive partial response, he suffered grade 4 cerebellar neurotoxicity. Cases have demonstrated excellent clinical responses utilizing dual PD-L1/CTLA4 inhibition in HNSCC [4], however high-grade adverse events have also been reported in this regimen’s more established use in metastatic melanoma [2]. Despite the exciting advances in cancer immunotherapy, clinicians must be aware of the rare, debilitating, and possibly previously undescribed paraneoplastic and autoimmune toxicities that may occur.</p><p id="Par2732"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par2733">1.

Immunotherapies designed to block co-inhibitory receptors (e.g. PD-1, CTLA-4) are showing unprecedented efficacy in the treatment of cancer. However, not all patients and tumor types respond to this approach. This has resulted in broadening of immunotherapy research programs to target additional co-inhibitory (e.g. LAG-3, TIM-3) and co-stimulatory (e.g. 4-1BB, GITR, OX40, ICOS) receptors individually and in combination.</p><p id="Par2760"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2761">A major challenge in the development of biologics is access to quantitative and reproducible functional bioassays. Existing methods rely on primary cells and measurement of complex functional endpoints. These assays are cumbersome, highly variable and fail to yield data quality required for drug development in a quality-controlled environment. To address this need, we have developed a suite of cell-based functional bioassays to interrogate modulation of immune checkpoint receptors individually (e.g. PD-1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, TIM-3, GITR, 4-1BB) and in combination (e.g. PD-1+CTLA-4, PD-1+LAG-3). These assays consist of stable cell lines that express luciferase reporters driven by response elements under the precise control of mechanistically relevant intracellular signals.</p><p id="Par2762"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2763">The bioassays reflect mechanisms of action for the drug candidates designed for each immune checkpoint receptor and demonstrate high specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility. For example, using the PD-1 blockade bioassay, TCR-mediated luciferase activity is recovered with anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 blocking Abs but not with unrelated control antibodies. Similarly, TCR and CD28-mediated luciferase activity is recovered in the CTLA-4 blockade bioassay with an anti-CTLA-4 blocking antibody (ipilimumab), but not with unrelated control antibodies. In a PD-1+CTLA-4 combination bioassay, anti-PD-1 (nivolumab) and anti-CTLA-4 (ipilimumab) blocking antibodies individually induced luciferase activity (3.0- and 5.6-fold, respectively), the combination of both antibodies resulted in a synergistic 18-fold increase in luciferase activity. Similar antibody-induced luciferase activity is observed in a panel of bioassays specific for agonist antibodies, including GITR, 4-1BB, OX40 and CD40. This response can be enhanced following Fc receptor cross-linking, reflecting in vivo activity.</p><p id="Par2764"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2765">Cell-based reporter bioassays overcome the limitations of primary cell-based assays for functional characterization of antibody and other biologics drugs targeting individual or combination immune checkpoint receptors. Here we show a portfolio of mechanism of action-based bioassays for co-inhibitory and co-stimulatory immune checkpoint receptors that can be used for antibody screening, characterization, potency and stability studies.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec953"><title>P241 Single-cell deconvolution identifies T-cell correlates of response to PD-1 blockade treatment in AML</title><sec id="Sec954"><title>Xingyue An, BS<sup>1</sup>, Jay R Adolacion<sup>1</sup>, Mansour Alfayez<sup>2</sup>, Jairo Matthews<sup>2</sup>, Wilmer Flores<sup>2</sup>, Steven Kornblau, MD<sup>2</sup>, Arash Saeedi<sup>1</sup>, Sreyashi Basu<sup>2</sup>, Naval Daver, MD<sup>2</sup>, Navin Varadarajan, PhD<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec955"><title><sup>1</sup>University of Houston, Houston, TX, United States; <sup>2</sup>Univ. of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States</title><sec id="Sec956"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Navin Varadarajan (nvaradarajan@uh.edu)</title><p id="Par2766"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par2767">The combination of the αPD-1 (nivolumab) and hypomethylating agent azacytidine demonstrated encouraging response in R/R acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, but the percentage of patients who achieved IWG 2016 responses was limited[1].

We also found treatment-induced gene expression changes in the AML circulating CD8 T cells, characterized by increased cell metabolism and cell proliferation. Deconvolution identified that pre-therapy relative abundance of exhausted (CD3+CD8+PD-1+CD45RO+) and effector (CD3+CD8+CD45RA+Tbet+PD-1lo) CD8 T cells (plasticity) could serve as subpopulations relevant for patient stratification (Figure 2).

Across multiple syngeneic mouse models, tumor growth was significantly inhibited 81%−98% by lucitanib combined with anti-PD-1 and 57%−88% by lucitanib alone. The combination significantly extended survival by 90% to &gt;186% and 15% to &gt;35% compared with vehicle or the best monotherapy, respectively. Lucitanib combined with anti-PD-1 increased gene expression associated with T-cells, cytotoxic cells, and T-cell signaling in BR5FVB1-Akt ovarian tumors, relative to each monotherapy. However, lucitanib alone appeared sufficient to modulate innate and adaptive immunity-related gene expression in MC38 tumors.

In addition, these drugs modify chemokine expression including increased expression of CXCL10. Significantly improved immune responses can be generated to decitabine and entinostat pre-treated KP sarc tumor cells as assessed by slowed tumor growth, increased T cell infiltrates, and increased cytokine production. Furthermore, immune checkpoint blockade therapy potentiates the tumor regression mediated by the combination of decitabine and entinostat more effectively than the regression mediated by either drugs alone. This suggests that combination therapy induced antigenicity generates better anti-tumor immune responses. Rechallenging the mice which rejected epigenetically modified KP Sarc tumor formation with similarly treated KP Sarc cells did not result in tumor formation, whereas untreated KP Sarc cells grew uninhibited, suggesting that epigenetic therapy induced tumor associated antigens are capable of generating a sustained memory immune response. By depleting CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes, we show that epigenetic targeted therapy induced anti-tumor responses are mediated by both CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes. Difficulty with in vivo treatment includes the myelosuppressive side effects of decitabine and entinostat which can inhibit T cell responses immediately after treatment. Proper sequencing of the drugs when given in vivo will be crucial to generate successful adaptive T cell responses to newly expressed antigens.</p><p id="Par2805"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2806">Epigenetic targeted therapy induced tumor associated antigens are capable of generating sustained anti-tumor immune responses.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec965"><title>P244 The genomic architecture of serous carcinomas shapes the tumor microenvironment and modulates responses to targeted and immunotherapies</title><sec id="Sec966"><title>Sonia Iyer, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Shuang Zhang<sup>2</sup>, Anniina Farkkila<sup>3</sup>, Sean Smith<sup>4</sup>, David Pepin<sup>5</sup>, Raghav Mohan<sup>5</sup>, Tian Xia<sup>1</sup>, Ferenc Reinhardt<sup>1</sup>, Tony Chavarria<sup>1</sup>, Esmee Hoefsmit<sup>1</sup>, Shailja Pathania<sup>6</sup>, Yunlan Zhou<sup>3</sup>, Kevin Elias<sup>7</sup>, Benjamin Neel<sup>8</sup>, Robert Weinberg, PhD<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec967"><title><sup>1</sup>Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, United States; <sup>2</sup>NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, United States; <sup>3</sup>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States; <sup>4</sup>Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; <sup>5</sup>Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States; <sup>6</sup>University of Massachusetts, Boston, MA, United States; <sup>7</sup>Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, United States; <sup>8</sup>NYU-Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, United States</title><sec id="Sec968"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Sonia Iyer (iyers@wi.mit.edu); Robert Weinberg (weinberg@wi.mit.edu)</title><p id="Par2807"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par2808">High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most frequent and most aggressive histologic subtype of ovarian cancer. The cornerstone of the existing treatment of HGSOC is DNA-damaging chemotherapy; however, practically all patients eventually develop the progressive disease and the 5-year survival is only 40%. Immunotherapy would seem to be an attractive alternative treatment to chemotherapy, yet existing immunotherapies perform poorly in ovarian cancer, with only ~10% of patients responding to checkpoint blockade. Why this is the case remains poorly understood and there is a pressing need to understand the underlying biology of immune evasion in ovarian cancer. One critical area of interest is the role of homology dependent DNA repair (HR) in immune evasion. Unfortunately, the preclinical tools required to explore the relationship between the types of DNA damage repair deficiencies and immune evasion have been lacking. Hence, we have modeled the biology of ovarian cancer using patient-relevant mutational landscapes in an immune-proficient, syngeneic mouse model in order to help us identify the contribution of common driver mutations to the immune repertoire in the tumor microenvironment, and thus to responses of HGSOC tumors to immunotherapy.</p><p id="Par2809"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2810">We hypothesize that the immune composition and gene expression signatures of the resulting tumors will vary based on the combination of genetic alterations and the DNA repair proficiency of the transformed cells. To this end, we have engineered novel syngeneic mouse models from murine-fallopian-tube epithelium using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. These tumors capture the most common combinations of co-occurring mutations observed in HR-deficient and -proficient patient samples.</p><p id="Par2811"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2812">To validate the DNA repair proficiency of the transformed cells, we measured Rad51 nuclear focus formation after ionizing radiation (IR) and PARP inhibitor and DNA-damaging agent sensitivity. The HR-deficient cell lines had significantly fewer Rad51 nuclear foci and were more sensitive to PARP inhibition in comparison to HR-proficient cells. Initial immune /stromal analysis using flow cytometry, scRNA seq transcriptomic and immunofluorescence analysis revealed substantial differences in the myeloid and T-cell regulatory compartments between HR-proficient and -deficient primary and metastatic tumors and within the ascitic fluid. Preliminary results also suggest that inhibition of the DNA damage response (DDR), checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, potentiates antitumor effects and augments cytotoxic T-cell infiltration.</p><p id="Par2813"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2814">Understanding the genetic basis of these complex cellular interactions will be critical to better tailor combinations of existing targeted treatments and immunotherapies in ovarian cancer to fight this devastating disease.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec969"><title>P245 Durvalumab after concurrent chemoradiotherapy in inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) – a German radiation oncology survey</title><sec id="Sec970"><title>Lukas Kaesmann, MD, Chukwuka Eze, Julian Taugner, Olarn Roengvoraphoj, Claus Belka, Farkhad Manapov</title><sec id="Sec971"><title>University Hospital, Munich, Germany</title><sec id="Sec972"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Lukas Kaesmann (lkaesmann@gmail.com)</title><p id="Par2815"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par2816">Consolidation PD-L1 inhibition with durvalumab after platin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CRT) has become the standard of care in inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) based on the excellent PACIFIC trial results.

ICI therapies are effective against “hot” tumors infiltrated with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) but inefficient against “cold” tumors lacking CTLs. The importance of CTLs, availability of CTL targets and local expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 (induced by CTL-produced IFNγ) in the overall effectiveness of ICI remain controversial. We have observed that chemokine-modulatory (CKM) regimens combining TLR3 ligands with type-1 IFNs are up to 100-fold more effectiveness in inducing CTL attractants (CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL5) compared to either factor alone. Moreover, CKM suppresses local Treg attractants, and targets tumor microenvironment (TME) rather than healthy tissues [1-3]. Thus, we tested whether local or systemic CKM treatments enhance CTL infiltration in “cold” tumors and determined the feasibility of short-term CKM to sensitize poorly immunogenic, αPD-1 resistant, tumors to PD-1 blockade.</p><p id="Par2841"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2842">C57BL/6 mice inoculated with MC38 (colorectal) or ID8 (ovarian) cancer cells were treated starting on day three (low-stage disease) or eight (late-stage disease). A two dose course of CKM (IFNα and rintatolimod [2]) followed by three doses of αPD-1 in two distinct regimens: 1) Sequentially (following CKM) or 2) Concurrent with CKM. Mice were monitored for intratumoral CTL, tumor growth and survival.</p><p id="Par2843"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2844">We observed strong effectiveness of CKM in promoting intratumoral increases in CTL and PD-L1 expression in the TME. CKM aids in the sensitization of the largely αPD1-resistant tumors to PD1 blockade. Both sequential and concurrent CKM allowed antitumor effectiveness of αPD-1, resulting in overall prolongation of survival and 30-100% cures, depending on treatment initiation. Sensitizing tumors to αPD-1 did not require intratumoral CKM administration and was observed with systemic application at distant sites, consistent with the preferential activation of tumor tissues by CKM observed in tumor explant model [3]. Although strong antitumor effects were seen in the absence of any vaccination component, a stronger effect could be observed by vaccination with tumor-loaded dendritic cells.</p><p id="Par2845"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2846">We demonstrate that local or systemic CKM sensitizes mice with poorly immunogenic tumors for subsequent effectiveness of PD-1 blockade. Thus, promoting intratumoral CTL accumulation may be sufficient for therapeutic effectiveness of ICI against “cold” tumors with low mutational load. Our data provides rationale for clinical testing of sequential regimens where short-term CKM is followed by routine ICI, limiting the inconvenience for patients and facilitating the inclusion of CKM into routine immunotherapy plans.</p><p id="Par2847"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par2848">Funded by 1P01CA132714, Rustum Family Foundation and Institutional Support.</p><p id="Par2849"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par2850">1.

After the mice developed tumors, they were treated with single agents or various drug combinations. Anti-PD-L1 and LDG demonstrated minimal effect on tumor growth as single agents</p><p id="Par2889">and only a modest effect as a combination. Moderate to strong anti-tumor activity was however observed with SRA737 monotherapy which directly correlated with dosing intensity. The most profound and synergistic anti-tumor activity was observed when anti-PD-L1 was combined with the SRA737+LDG regimen, with all animals showing durable regressions. Analysis of tumor infiltrating immune cells at the end of this treatment regimen showed a dramatic induction of cytotoxic T-cells and a reduction of exhausted and regulatory T cells. Similarly, pro-inflammatory M1 type macrophages and dendritic cells were increased while immunosuppressive M2 type macrophages and MDSC cells were dramatically decreased. As monotherapy, the more dose intensive SRA737 schedule resulted in similar effects on lymphocytes when combined with anti-PD-L1. These effects are consistent with our previous data showing that SRA737 treatment leads to an induction of STING and type I interferon signaling in tumors, which is associated with the establishment of an anti-tumor immune microenvironment.</p><p id="Par2890"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2891">Our findings suggest that the combination of anti-PD-L1 with the SRA737+LDG regimen may represent the optimal implementation of these agents, leading to a dramatic anti-tumor activity accompanied by the establishment of a strong anti-tumor immune microenvironment. Given that anti-PD-(L)1 drugs are approved but show limited efficacy in SCLC, our preclinical data provide a strong rationale for combining these agents with the SRA737+LDG regimen</p><p id="Par2892">to enhance clinical response rates.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec992"><title>P251 CTX-8371, a novel bispecific targeting both PD-1 and PD-L1, is more potent than combination anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 therapy and provides enhanced protection from tumors in vivo</title><sec id="Sec993"><title>Diana Albu, PhD, Pearl Bakhru, Wilson Guzman, BS, Michael Ophir, Rachel McCrory, BS, William Carson, Jason Kong, Beata Bobrowicz, Pia Muyot, Amanda Oliphant, Dalton Markrush, Rachel Rennard, Cheuk Lun Leung, Sara Haserlat, Michael Schmidt, Jose Gonzalo, Bing Gong, Robert Tighe, BS, Diana Albu, PhD, Benjamin Wolf</title><sec id="Sec994"><title>Compass Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA, United States</title><sec id="Sec995"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Benjamin Wolf (benjamin.wolf@compasstherapeutics.com)</title><p id="Par2893"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par2894">Monoclonal antibody immunotherapies targeting immune checkpoint receptors have shown great promise for a subset of cancer patients. However, novel combination therapies are still needed to increase the benefit of cancer immunotherapy and bring it to broader patient populations. Here we describe the preclinical evaluation of CTX-8371, which combines PD-1 and PD-L1 targeting in one bispecific, tetravalent molecule.</p><p id="Par2895"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2896">Our proprietary Stitchmabs®™ bispecific screening platform was used to conduct an unbiased screen of bispecifics comprised of various checkpoint blocking antibodies. This screen yielded the surprising discovery that a bispecific containing both PD-1 and PD-L1 binding arms was more potent than the combination of parent monoclonal antibodies. We then generated common light chain bispecifics containing compatible anti-PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies and used multiple in vitro assays to identify our lead, CTX-8371. Additional in vitro and in vivo experiments confirmed CTX-8371’s reactivity across species, in vivo anti-tumor effects, and the underlining mechanisms driving its distinctive activity.</p><p id="Par2897"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2898">We found that CTX-8371 binds to human and cynomolgus monkey PD-1 and PD-L1 targets with sub-nanomolar affinities and is cross-reactive to mouse PD-1 and PD-L1. Compared to Keytruda®, CTX-8371 increased T cell activation and tumor cell killing in vitro, significantly delayed tumor growth, and prolonged survival in human cell transfer tumor models. Additionally, CTX-8371 demonstrated efficacy in transplantable mouse syngeneic models. Investigation into the mechanisms responsible for the enhanced efficacy of CTX-8371 unexpectedly found that the bispecific causes a massive loss of PD-1 from the T cell surface, which was not observed in response to monoclonal antibodies alone or combined. This robust PD-1 downregulation, potentially mediated through bridging together the T cell and tumor cell, may explain the ability of CTX-8371 to reverse PD-1 suppression more potently than standard blocking antibodies.</p><p id="Par2899"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2900">Taken together, the results demonstrate that the bispecific, tetravalent antibody CTX-8371 has increased potency in vitro and in vivo as compared to clinical checkpoint blockade agents. Some of its effects are likely attributable to its unique mechanism of action, driving robust downregulation of cell-surface PD-1. Thus, CTX-8371 has the potential to increase the number of patients that benefit from PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec996"><title>P252 A retrospective study to evaluate real-world clinical outcomes in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) treated with Ipilimumab and Nivolumab</title><sec id="Sec997"><title>Landon Brown, MD, Emily Kinsey, MD, Chester Kao, MD, Patrick Healy, Andrew Armstrong, MD, Megan McNamara, MD, Sundhar Ramalingam, MD, Michael Harrision, MD, Daniel George, MD, Tian Zhang, MD</title><sec id="Sec998"><title>Duke University, Durham, NC, United States</title><sec id="Sec999"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Landon Brown (landon.brown@duke.edu)</title><p id="Par2901"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par2902">The combination of nivolumab at 3mg/kg plus ipilimumab at 1mg/kg (I+N) followed by maintenance nivolumab has greatly improved outcomes in patients with intermediate or poor-risk untreated mRCC [1].

It is known that CEACAM1-CEACAM1 homophilic interaction induces downregulation of ZAP70 phosphorylation in response to T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. CEACAM1 is also highly expressed on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and its expression is correlated with cancer progression and poor prognosis.

Especially CEACAM1-CEACAM1 homophilic interaction induced downregulation of ZAP70 phosphorylation in response to TCR stimulation in a CEACAM1 overexpressing Jurkat stable cell line, which was rescued by MG1124 resulting in augmentation of NFAT activity and IL-2 expression. NK cell-mediated tumor lysis was increased by MG1124 in a CEACAM1 expression-dependent manner. In an NSCLC PDX-huNSG mouse model, MG1124 suppressed tumor progression as a monotherapy and combination with pembrolizumab in a CEACAM1 high expressing model.

We explored a second generation of PD-1 antibody by fusing IL-7 cytokine to the Fc portion. IL-7 is an optimal target for immunotherapy to preferentially stimulate effector T-cell (Teff) functions over regulatory T-cells (Treg), due to the differential expression of IL-7R. Moreover, It has been published that PD-1 blockades increase IL-7R expression and improve IL-7 signaling in exhausted T-cells rationalizing our combinatorial approach.</p><p id="Par2954"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2955">Proliferation (H3 thymidine), IFN-γ, IL-7R signaling (pSTAT5) and NFAT (PD-1 bioassay, Promega) assays were tested to determine anti PD-1/IL-7 efficacy on naïve and/or exhausted-like T-cells. For the suppressive assay, CD4 Treg and autologous CD8 Teff were co-cultured (1:1) and proliferation was assessed on Day 5. Tumor infiltrating T cells (TILs) were isolated from orthotopic tumor-bearing mice (Hepa1.6, LLC-1,AK7) and subjected to IL-7 ex vivo, IL-7R signaling pSTAT5 was determined by flow cytometry.</p><p id="Par2956"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2957">Our anti PD-1/IL-7 bispecific antibody efficiently blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 and PD-L2 interactions and the PD-1-mediated inhibitory signal (pSHP1). Importantly, we observed that the IL-7 portion synergizes with the anti-PD-1 to enhance TCR mediated signaling (NFAT). Although IL-7R expression on T cells decrease over repeated antigen stimulation, we demonstrated that IL-7 still efficiently activate partially and fully-exhausted human T-cells (pSTAT5) and maintain their proliferation capacity. We next characterized sensitivity of TILs to IL-7 in multiple orthotopic mouse models. In PD-1 sensitive tumor (Mesothelioma), only 10% of TILs express IL-7R whereas in PD-1 resistant model (Hepatocarcinoma and Lung carcinoma), 40-60% of TILs (CD4 and CD8) express IL-7R and respond to IL-7 stimulation ex vivo as measured by pSTAT5 signaling. These data suggest that the anti PD-1/IL-7 bispecific can reactivate TILs that are resistant to PD-1 therapy. Knowing that Tregs have a key suppressive function, we also explored the possibility that the anti-PD-1/IL-7 fusion protein affect Treg functions.

Recent studies have observed that obesity is associated with heightened frequencies of PD-1+ CD8 T cells [1] and favorable outcomes and responses to immunotherapy in melanoma [1, 2]. However, the effects of obesity on anti-tumor immunity and immunotherapeutic efficacy in renal cancer remain unknown.</p><p id="Par2962"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2963">PD-1 expression on tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells from treatment-naive RCC subjects with (BMI &gt;30 kg/m2) or without (BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2) obesity (n = 18) was determined via flow cytometry. In a separate retrospective study, outcome data were queried for RCC patients with (BMI &gt;30 kg/m2) or without (BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2) obesity that were treated with anti-PD-1 as standard of care and had at least 6 months of follow-up (n=58). Overall survival (OS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards regression after controlling for patients’ age, sex, and number of prior treatments. For murine studies, BALB/c mice were randomized to and maintained on either standard chow or high-fat diet for 20 weeks to generate age-matched lean or diet-induced obese (DIO) mice.

Lean and DIO responders exhibited favorable ratios of activated CD8+ T cells to myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), reduced PD-1 expression on CD8+ T cells, and elevated concentrations of CCL5 in renal tumors. Neutralization of CCL5 in lean immunotherapy-treated mice yielded a reduced response rate (43%), unfavorable ratios of activated CD8+ T cells to MDSCs, and diminished IFNg secretion from intratumoral CD8+ T cells. The translational relevance of our murine findings was reflected in metastatic RCC patients, as patients with obesity had a trending reduction in OS following standard of care nivolumab (p= 0.06) and a 10.2 month reduction in OS.</p><p id="Par2966"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2967">Our data suggest that obesity is associated with reduced responses to anti-PD-1 based immunotherapies in the context of renal cancer.

Most of PD-L1 inhibitors were modified in FcR binding site to prevent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against PD-L1 expressing non-tumor cells. IMC-001, developed by ImmuneOncia, is a fully human PD-L1 recombinant monoclonal antibody that did not modify FcR binding and preserved ADCC. Therefore, IMC-001 would be synergistic with NK compared to other PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).

Various cancer cell lines were used as target cells, including head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSCC), lung cancer, stomach cancer, ovarian cancer, bladder cancer and lymphoma cell lines. 51Cr-release assay was performed using NK-92-CD16 as an effector cell with effector to target ratio (E:T) of 30:1. CD107a degranulation assay was performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors with E:T ratio of 1:1.

Besides, in CD107a degranulation assay, activated PBMC cytotoxicity was increased when target cells are opsonized by anti-PD-L1 Abs with ADCC.

ADO impairs the activation and proliferation of effector T cells while expanding regulatory T cell (Treg) population, which is inversely related to the overall survival of cancer patients, including those with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We propose to develop an injectable system by which ADO are degraded in the TME in order to enhance the efficacy of anti-PD1 treatment. To this end, we have developed a hydrogel to co-deliver anti-PD-1 antibody with adenosine deaminase (ADA), which catabolizes ADO. The hydrogel contains a bioaffinity module (named “Z15_EAK”) to retain the anti-PD-1 antibody in tumors while limit the diffusion of ADA in TME for extended durations. We have previously shown that Z15_EAK hydrogel can retain IgG at subcutaneous injection site for at least two weeks [1]. The expectation is that persistent co-localization of anti-PD-1 and ADA in the TME will expand Th1 T cells and reduce Treg in draining lymph nodes (DLN) and systemic lymphoid tissues. This postulation was tested in an immunocompetent mouse model of RCC.</p><p id="Par2986"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par2987">A mouse RCC cell line (RENCA) was cultivated for in vitro assays and in vivo inoculation into BALB/c mice.

DLN, spleen, and tumors were collected for flow cytometric analysis and ELISA measurements.</p><p id="Par2988"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par2989">After three doses, DLN in mice received the hydrogel loaded with anti-PD-1 antibody and ADA were five times larger than those in mice received saline control (Figure 1). In addition, the lymph nodes in treated mice contained fewer CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells compared to controls (Figure 2). After ex vivo re-stimulation with RENCA for expansion, lymphocytes in treated mice exhibited higher interferon-gamma levels than controls, indicating elevated Th1 phenotype in the DLN.</p><p id="Par2990"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par2991">The preliminary data indicate that the local delivery of anti-PD-1 and ADA with the hydrogel shifted the local T cell population toward an effector phenotype (Th1) while limiting the Treg expansion. An extended co-localization of anti-PD-1 and ADA in the TME not only modulates immune events in the local lymphoid tissues but can also enhance the anti-tumor response systemically. Furthermore, the localized delivery reduces off-target toxicities of anti-PD-1 antibody.</p><p id="Par2992"><bold>Reference</bold></p><p id="Par2993">1. Pham, N.B., et al.

CD226 is an activating receptor found on NK cells, monocytes and a subset of T cells. TIGIT and CD226 are paired receptors that compete for shared ligands CD155 and CD112, which are expressed by cancer and antigen-presenting cells. Binding of CD155 to TIGIT results in immune suppression, whereas binding of the same ligand to CD226 promotes immune activation. AB154, designed to lack FcɣR binding, blocks human TIGIT with minimal risk of depleting intra-tumoral antigen-experienced CD8+ T cells.</p><p id="Par3000"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3001">Translational studies quantifying TIGIT, CD226 and CD155 expression in various tumor types and normal tissues were performed using flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and by mining publicly available RNASeq datasets.

Downstream transcriptional effects of TIGIT/CD155 interaction in CD8+ T cells and Treg were assessed using Nanostring®.

In particular, antigen-experienced T cells isolated from late stage head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumors express higher levels of TIGIT and PD-1 than of CD226. Levels of TIGIT expression in this subset was equivalent, if not higher, than intra-tumoral Treg.

Unfortunately, certain tumor characteristics, such as the lack of immune cell infiltration, often correlate with poor responses to CPI therapy. Studies have identified C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 4 (CCL4) as a key molecule necessary for the recruitment of cross-presenting, CD103+ dendritic cells (DCs) to the tumor; tumors lacking CCL4 expression exhibit a “cold tumor” phenotype and respond poorly to immunotherapy [1]. Based on these results, we hypothesized that tumor-targeted CCL4 could enhance immune cell infiltration into the tumor and synergize with CPI therapy.</p><p id="Par3010"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3011">We generated a fusion protein comprised of CCL4 and a collagen binding domain (CBD) derived from von Willebrand factor, a tumor-stroma targeting strategy developed in our lab [2]. Anti-tumor efficacy studies were performed in mouse syngeneic models, including B16F10 melanoma, EMT6 breast cancer, and PyMT breast cancer. Flow cytometry was employed to evaluate the tumor immune infiltrate.</p><p id="Par3012"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3013">Utilizing exposure of collagen in leaky tumor vasculature due to its disordered structure, we observed that intravenous (i.v.) infusion of CBD-CCL4 fusion proteins, but not native CCL4, can enhance infiltration of CD103+ DCs, CD8+ T cells, and natural killer cells and slow B16F10 tumor growth when combined with CPI therapy consisting of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody (CTLA4) + anti-programmed death-ligand 1 antibody (PD-L1) (Figure 1, A-B) Further analysis showed strong correlations between the presence of CD103+ DCs and CD8+ T cells and tumor regression. Similarly, in the EMT6 breast cancer model, tumor-targeted CCL4 in combination with CPI, but not native form CCL4, enhanced recruitment of CD103+ DCs, CD8+ T cells, and led to a reduction in tumor growth. To confirm the importance of CD103+ DCs in mediating anti-tumor responses, we utilized Batf3 knockout mice bearing B16F10 tumors; in this instance, anti-tumor efficacy of CPI + CBD-CCL4 was completely lost. Efficacy studies in PyMT breast cancer models highlighted the therapeutic benefit of CBD-CCL4 delivery (Figure 1C); CPI therapy alone led to complete tumor remission in only 10% of mice, whereas combination therapy of CPI + CBD-CCL4 cured 50% of the treated mice (Figure 1D).</p><p id="Par3014"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3015">These results highlight the utility of recruiting CD103+ DCs to the tumor to improve the efficacy of CPI therapy.

CD137 agonism has the potential to reinvigorate potent antitumor immunity either alone or in combination with other immune checkpoint therapies. We hypothesized that an antibody with a unique binding mode could activate T cells in an Fc effector-less format. Hence, we developed 7A5, a CD137 agonist monoclonal antibody which potentially has a ligand-like structural binding mode and demonstrated that it effectively engages the CD137 receptor in preclinical studies.</p><p id="Par3046"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3047">7A5 was identified from a human Fab phage display library screen and engineered to an IgG1 Fc effector null antibody. Solid phase binding assays with recombinant CD137 protein and cell-based assays in CD137 expressing cells were used to evaluate binding and functional activity in vitro. To assess agonist activity, 7A5 was tested in NF-kB luciferase reporter, PBMC co-stimulation and Treg suppression assays. To determine antitumor activity in vivo, human tumor xenograft mouse models (NSG mice harboring human NCI-H292 or HCC827 NSCLC tumors) reconstituted with human PBMCs or T cells, were used. Treatments included 7A5 monotherapy and the combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody in these models.</p><p id="Par3048"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3049">In this study, we characterized 7A5, a fully human IgG1 Fc effector null monoclonal antibody. We showed 7A5 binds CD137 and the binding epitope overlaps with the CD137 ligand binding site. 7A5 engages the CD137 receptor and activates signaling independent of cross-linking or Fc effector function. It binds to activated primary T cells and leads to T cell stimulation in cell-based assays. Monotherapy with 7A5 inhibits tumor growth in humanized mouse models and this activity is enhanced when combined with a PD-L1 antagonist antibody. Furthermore, changes to the intra-tumoral immune gene expression signature in response to 7A5 is highly suggestive for a mechanism of enhanced T cell infiltration and activation.</p><p id="Par3050"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3051">In summary, CD137 antibody 7A5 represents a differentiated agonist with preclinical biological properties that support its further development as an anti-cancer immunotherapy.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1048"><title>P265 Immune checkpoint inhibitors induce response in a dose-dependent manner while their immune related adverse events are dose-independent, a meta-analysis</title><sec id="Sec1049"><title>Osama Rahma, MD<sup>1</sup>, Joshua Reuss, MD<sup>2</sup>, Anita Giobbie-Hurder, MS<sup>1</sup>, Ghazaleh Razavi, MD<sup>3</sup>, Pooja Mehra, MD<sup>4</sup>, Seema Gupta<sup>5</sup>, Rawad Elias, MD<sup>6</sup>, Samir Khleif, MD<sup>5</sup></title><sec id="Sec1050"><title><sup>1</sup>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States; <sup>2</sup>John Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, United States; <sup>3</sup>Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta, GA, United States; <sup>4</sup>University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, United States; <sup>5</sup>Georgetown University, Washington, DC, United States; <sup>6</sup>Hartford Healthcare, Hartford, CT, United States</title><sec id="Sec1051"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Samir Khleif (snk48@georgetown.edu)</title><p id="Par3052"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par3053">Despite the expansion of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor (ICI) indications, the relationship between ICI dose-escalation and toxicity or response has not been established.

The reported rates of treatment-related grade 3-5 adverse events (G3-5AEs), immune-related adverse events (irAEs), and response were collected. For each ICI, comparisons of incidence rates between doses or diseases were based on marginal, exact generalized linear models.</p><p id="Par3056"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3057">A total of 74T (7469 patients (pts)) published between 1/2010 – 1/2017 were included (15T-ipilimumab (1058 pts), 30T-nivolumab (2281 pts), 29T-pembrolizumab (4130 pts)) (Figure 1). For ipilimumab, the overall incidence of G3-5AEs was 34%. A significant 27% reduced risk of G3-5AEs was seen with 3 mg/kg compared to 10 mg/kg (p=0.002) (Figure 2). However, there was no relationship observed between dose of ipilimumab and incidence of irAEs or response to therapy (Figure 3). With nivolumab, the overall incidence of G3-5AEs was 20.1%. Incidence of G3-5AEs was significantly lower in NSCLC, with risk reductions of 24-38% when compared to RCC or melanoma (p≤0.05). No dose-toxicity relationship was seen for G3-5AEs or irAEs (Figure 4). In both melanoma (6T) and NSCLC (7T), a dose-response association was observed, with significantly decreased odds of response of 17% and 64% for 1mg/kg compared to 3mg/kg in melanoma and NSCLC, respectively (Figure 5,6) with no further increase in response for doses above 3 mg/kg. This association was not observed in RCC (Figure 7). For pembrolizumab, the overall incidence of G3-5 AEs was 13.3%. Risk of G3-5AEs was 17% lower in melanoma than in NSCLC (p=0.03). No dose-toxicity relationship was seen for G3-5AEs or irAEs (Figure 8). In melanoma (7T), 2mg/kg every 3 weeks (q3w) had 22% decreased odds of response compared to 10mg/kg (q2w) (p=0.01) (Figure 9). For NSCLC (5T), no dose-response relationship was noted (Figure 10).</p><p id="Par3058"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3059">We found no correlation between dose of ipilimumab and odds of G3-5iAEs or response. For pembrolizumab and nivolumab, no dose-toxicity correlation was seen but a dose-response correlation was observed suggesting that, for the PD-1 inhibitors, efficacy appears to be dose-dependent while toxicity does not. Accordingly, future clinical trial design of ICIs should use a dose escalation method with a primary objective of identifying an effective dose rather than a maximum tolerated dose.</p><p id="Par3060"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par3061">Merck and BMS for providing input</p><p id="Par3062"><fig id="Fig89"><label>Fig. 1 (abstract P265).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Consort Diagram of Literature Search</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig89_HTML.png" id="MO105"/></fig></p><p id="Par3063"><fig id="Fig90"><label>Fig. 2 (abstract P265).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Bootstrap analysis for G3-4 AEs of ipilimumab</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig90_HTML.png" id="MO106"/></fig></p><p id="Par3064"><fig id="Fig91"><label>Fig. 3 (abstract P265).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Bootstrap analysis for ORR for ipilimumab</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig91_HTML.png" id="MO107"/></fig></p><p id="Par3065"><fig id="Fig92"><label>Fig. 4 (abstract P265).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Bootstrap analysis for G3-4 AEs for nivolumab</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig92_HTML.png" id="MO108"/></fig></p><p id="Par3066"><fig id="Fig93"><label>Fig. 5 (abstract P265).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Bootstrap analysis for ORR for nivo in melanoma</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig93_HTML.png" id="MO109"/></fig></p><p id="Par3067"><fig id="Fig94"><label>Fig. 6 (abstract P265).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Bootstrap analysis for ORR for nivolumab in NSCLC</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig94_HTML.png" id="MO110"/></fig></p><p id="Par3068"><fig id="Fig95"><label>Fig. 7 (abstract P265).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Bootstrap analysis for ORR for nivolumab in RCC</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig95_HTML.png" id="MO111"/></fig></p><p id="Par3069"><fig id="Fig96"><label>Fig. 8 (abstract P265).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Bootstrap for incidence of G3-4 AE in pembrolizumab</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig96_HTML.png" id="MO112"/></fig></p><p id="Par3070"><fig id="Fig97"><label>Fig. 9 (abstract P265).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Bootstrap for ORR for pembrolizumab in melanoma</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig97_HTML.png" id="MO113"/></fig></p><p id="Par3071"><fig id="Fig98"><label>Fig. 10 (abstract P265).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Bootstrap for ORR for pembrolizumab in NSCLC</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig98_HTML.png" id="MO114"/></fig></p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1052"><title>P266 Evaluation of immunomodulatory receptor/ligand expression on matched human biospecimens</title><sec id="Sec1053"><title>Shawn Fahl (shawn.fahl@dls.com)</title><sec id="Sec1054"><title>Discovery Life Sciences, Huntsville, AL, United States</title><p id="Par3072"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par3073">The integration of immunomodulatory receptor signaling is crucial for the activation status of responding T cells, and modulation of these receptors, and their ligands, may be of therapeutic benefit.

Predominantly expressed on CD4+ Tregs, CD8+ T and NK cells in healthy individuals, TIGIT is further upregulated in these cells in cancer patients. In patients, it is frequently co-expressed with exhaustion markers such as PD-1. DNAM-1/CD226, a co-stimulatory receptor, is expressed on NK and T cells and competes with TIGIT for PVR/CD155 binding, but with a lower affinity. Since cancer cells express high level of CD155 and because TIGIT expression is increased on TILs, the TIGIT pathway represents a major mechanism for immunosuppression within the tumor. We developed EOS884448, an antagonist anti-TIGIT antibody, to prevent TIGIT-mediated immunosuppression in cancer patients.</p><p id="Par3078"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3079">To support selection of indications for clinical application of EOS884448, we used flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to characterize peripheral and tumoral expression of TIGIT, CD155 and CD226 in healthy or cancer donors.</p><p id="Par3080"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3081">TIGIT is expressed on multiple immune subsets in healthy donors. Similar analysis on matched PBMCs and TILs from 15 cancer donors highlighted the overexpression of TIGIT on cells from those samples. Interestingly, ex vivo polyfunctional analysis of cytokine production demonstrated immunosuppression of TIGIT+ TILs versus their TIGIT- counterparts. Among PBMCs and TILs assessed by flow cytometry, tumor-infiltrating Tregs exhibit the highest TIGIT expression (frequency of positive cells and receptor density). This finding was confirmed by IHC on tumor samples, supporting the potential value of an ADCC-competent antibody targeting preferentially tumor-infiltrating Tregs. Finally, intrinsic expression of TIGIT on tumor cells was detected on several haematological malignancies, opening the potential for EOS8844488 to directly kill tumor cells in addition to its activities to reinvigorate immunity. The expression of the TIGIT ligands CD155 and CD226 co-receptor were also analysed by IHC in tissues (n=284-307) from 9 cancer indications. CD155 is mostly expressed by tumor cells, ranging from a median of 2% of CD155high tumor cells for cervix to 50% for pancreatic cancer. CD155 expression is highest in pancreatic, prostate, kidney, gastric and colon cancers. CD226 is detected on immune cells infiltrating tumors. The median percentage of tissue area positive for CD226 ranged from 0.07% in head and neck to 0.98% in gastric cancer, with gastric, lung and renal cancer showing the highest CD226 expression.</p><p id="Par3082"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3083">Together, these findings strongly support the relevance of targeting TIGIT with an ADCC-competent antibody and provide a method to select cancer types that may benefit from treatment with EOS884448.</p><p id="Par3084"><bold>Ethics Approval</bold></p><p id="Par3085">The study was approved by UCL‘s Ethics Board, approval number Biobank2019/09MAI/005</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1059"><title>P268 IPH5401 anti-human C5aR antibody targets suppressive myeloid cells in the TME</title><sec id="Sec1060"><title>Joanna Fares, Léa Simon, Caroline Soulas, Marion Loivet, Elodie Bonnet, Luciana Batista, Romain Remark, PhD, Cécile Bonnafous, Robert Zerbib, MSc, Mathieu Bléry</title><sec id="Sec1061"><title>Innate Pharma, Marseille, France</title><sec id="Sec1062"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Robert Zerbib (robert.zerbib@innate-pharma.fr)</title><p id="Par3086"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par3087">A hallmark mechanism of synergy in immunotherapy is the elimination of immunosuppressive cells, such as myeloid cells and neutrophils, to allow for the reactivation of effector cells.

C5a is the most potent chemoattractant and induces recruitment and activation of different immune cells to inflamed tissue, among which are neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, basophils, and mast cells. C5a binds to the seven transmembrane-spanning receptors C5aR1 (CD88) and C5aR2 (C5L2). Blocking C5aR1 thus appears as a potent mean to control the myeloid suppressive cells in the TME.

Ligation of CD47 to SIRPα delivers a “don’t eat me” signal to suppress phagocytosis. Tumor cells frequently overexpress CD47 to evade macrophage-mediated destruction. Currently, agents targeting CD47 have proceeded to clinical trials and demonstrated promising anti-tumor results. However, these agents have been associated with hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. In addition, universal expression of CD47 causes antigen sink, which leads to reduced efficacy. We therefore consider targeting SIRPα to achieve an improved efficacy with a better safety profile. We have developed 2 classes of anti-SIRPα antibodies: CD47-SIRPα interaction “blocker” and “non-blocker”. Both groups of antibody functionally stimulate phagocytosis of multiple cancer cell types by macrophages.</p><p id="Par3113"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3114">Using SIRPα extracellular domain (ECD), SIRPα overexpression stable cell line and plasmid encoding SIRPα as immunogens, anti-SIRPα antibodies were generated by traditional hybridoma technology.

It recognized pan-allele human SIRPα with high affinity (KD hSIRPα V1/V2, 0.86nM/1.43nM). ES004-B4 was shown to stimulate phagocytosis of multiple cancer cell types. Another lead antibody (N4) was selected from the CD47/SIRPα interaction “non-blocker” group. ES004-N4 also induced strong phagocytosis of multiple cancer cell types by macrophages, albeit it did not disrupt CD47/SIRPα interaction, suggesting an unique mode of action. ES004-B4 and ES004-N4 didn’t trigger hemagglutination and had no negative impact on T cell proliferation in vitro. No severe hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia were observed in hCD47/hSIRPα double knock-in mice treated with 10mg/kg of each antibody, suggesting a low safety risk in vivo.</p><p id="Par3117"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3118">In summary, we have developed 2 anti-SIRPα antibodies with “Best-in-Class” potential: 1) CD47/SIRPα interaction “Blocker” ES004-B4, 2) CD47/SIRPα interaction “Non-Blocker” ES004-N4. Both antibodies greatly enhance macrophage-mediated tumor cell destruction, possibly through different mechanisms of action. We are currently advancing the development of ES004-B4 and ES004-N4 into clinical candidates.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1075"><title>P272 SRF231, a fully human high-affinity anti-CD47 antibody, exerts potent preclinical antitumor activity through engagement of the Fc receptor (FcR), CD32a</title><sec id="Sec1076"><title>Marisa Peluso, MS, Kshama Doshi, PhD, Caroline Armet, BS, Li Zhang, Rachel O'Connor, BS, Matthew Rausch, PhD, Jonathan Hill, PhD, Benjamin Lee, MD PhD, Pamela Holland, PhD, Vito Palombella, PhD, Alison Paterson, PhD</title><sec id="Sec1077"><title>Surface Oncology, Inc., Cambridge, MA, United States</title><sec id="Sec1078"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Marisa Peluso (mpeluso@surfaceoncology.com)</title><p id="Par3119"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par3120">CD47 is a transmembrane protein that acts as a “Don’t Eat Me” signal to evade immune recognition. It is overexpressed in multiple cancer subtypes and is associated with poor prognosis. Several anti-CD47 molecules designed to antagonize the CD47 axis are being tested in the clinic.

Directly labeled SRF231 was used to profile tumor vs normal cell binding. SRF231-mediated antitumor activity was assessed in tumor using macrophage coculture systems designed to evaluate the impact of SRF231 on tumor cell phagocytosis, cell death, and cell depletion. Receptor occupancy (RO)/activity relationships and dependency on FcR were also assessed.

Increased binding to several tumor vs normal cells is observed with SRF231. Analyses probing the relationship between FcR and SRF231 activity revealed that SRF231 leads to antitumor activity through both phagocytosis and cell death mechanisms in a manner largely dependent on the activating receptor FcγRIIa (CD32a), predominantly expressed by myeloid cells. Additionally, SRF231-mediated antitumor activity is retained in longer-term assay conditions and in washout conditions. Moreover, submaximal SRF231 RO is sufficient for maximal phagocytosis induction in vitro. In a B-cell lymphoma xenograft model, a single dose of SRF231/mouse yields tumor stasis out to 21 days with submaximal tumor exposure. Antitumor activity is associated with an increase of host macrophage infiltration and cytokine induction suggestive of an innate immune response.</p><p id="Par3125"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3126">SRF231 is a high affinity, CD47-targeting antibody that delivers an activating signal to myeloid cells via CD32a and displays favorable preclinical characteristics regarding its RO/tumor exposure/efficacy relationship.

However, the clinical responses are variable and highly influenced by immune regulatory compartments in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This is especially true for pancreatic cancer (PC) where clinical trials aiming to recover T cell anti-tumor activity have been disappointing. Thus, in PC and other cancers there is a clinical need for alternative treatments We have previously shown that antibodies targeting the scavenger receptor MARCO expressed on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), reduces tumor growth and impair metastasis in murine cancer models. Here we investigated targeting of the scavenger receptor MARCO on human TAMs in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and hypothesized that targeting this receptor will remodel the suppressive environment and relive the anti-tumor responses to increase the efficacy of immunotherapy.</p><p id="Par3139"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3140">To test our hypothesis, analysis of MARCO gene expression data from the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) project was performed investigating pancreatic tumors (n=176), as these consist of up to 80% stroma, compared with healthy pancreatic tissues (n=171). In vitro, cytokine differentiated macrophages alternatively cultured with PC cell lines under hypoxia and normoxia conditions were co-cultured with cytotoxic cells to mimic their interaction in the TME. Later, macrophages were treated with anti-MARCO Abs and their phenotype and function were examined prior and following interaction with immune effector cells. Subsequently, anti-MARCO ab anti-tumor efficacy was tested in vitro and in vivo in PC and melanoma models.</p><p id="Par3141"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3142">We found a 30-fold increase in MARCO expression in pancreatic tumors compared to healthy tissues. Also, a significant (p=0.03) correlation between high expression and decreased survival was noted in pancreatic cancer patients. Furthermore, pancreatic cancer cell lines induced MARCO expression on macrophages and dedifferentiated them towards myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). This effect was amplified by hypoxic condition. Notably, MARCO+ MDSC in contrast to control monocytes and macrophages suppressed T- and Natural Killer (NK) cell anti-tumor activities, which was reversed by treatment with anti-human MARCO Abs. In addition, targeting TAMs with anti-MARCO Abs, abolished their anti-inflammatory phenotype in vitro and in vivo and normalized their metabolism towards pro-inflammatory. Moreover, in B16 melanoma tumor model the anti-MARCO Ab mediated an anti-tumor effect that was dependent on NK cells and their TRAIL-mediated killing mechanism.</p><p id="Par3143"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3144">Thus, our study reveals a novel interaction between TAMs and cytotoxic cells as a result of TAM targeting with monoclonal Ab demonstrating a promising approach as immunotherapy that remodel the immune TME.</p><p id="Par3145"><bold>Ethics Approval</bold></p><p id="Par3146">The study was approved by Institutional Ethics Board, approval number Dnr 2013.977-31.1.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1086"><title>P275 Pan-tumor pathologic scoring of response to PD-(L)1 blockade</title><sec id="Sec1087"><title>Julie Stein, Evan Lipson, MD, Tricia Cottrell, MD, PhD, Patrick Forde, MD, Robert Anders, MD, PhD, Ashley Cimino-Mathews, Elizabeth Thompson, MD PhD, Mohamad Allaf, MD, Mark Yarchoan, Josephine Feliciano, MD, Elizabeth Jaffee, MD, Drew Pardoll, MD, PhD, Suzanne Topalian, MD, Janis Taube, MD, MSC</title><sec id="Sec1088"><title>Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States</title><sec id="Sec1089"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Janis Taube (jtaube1@jhmi.edu)</title><p id="Par3147"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par3148">Pathologic response assessment of tumor specimens from patients receiving systemic treatment provide an early indication of therapeutic efficacy and predict long-term survival.

The magnitude of immune activation promoted by PD-1/PD-L1 axis blockade can be further enhanced through concomitant T-cell co-stimulation such as that achieved through CD137 agonism; however, clinical applications of such an approach may be limited by toxicity associated with the systemic effects of CD137 agonists. Here we characterize PD-L1 and CD137 tumor expression supporting the development of a PD-L1xCD137 bispecific molecule that provides PD-1 axis blockade coupled with tumor-targeted CD137 co-stimulation.</p><p id="Par3221"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3222">In situ hybridization (ISH) and multicolor flow cytometry was performed to characterize PD-L1 and CD137 expression in tumor biopsies. A PD-L1xCD137 bispecific molecule (PD-L1xCD137) was constructed based on PD-L1 blocking mAbs and CD137-engaging mAbs and was evaluated for binding to respective antigens. Its functional activity was evaluated in CD3 or SEB-driven T-cell activation systems, MLR assays and tumor microenvironment models. Anti-tumor activity in vivo was evaluated in combination with tumor targeted anti-CD3 based bispecific DART® molecules.</p><p id="Par3223"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3224">ISH revealed expression of PD-L1 in significant proportion of surgically resected carcinomas; noteworthy, many such tumors contained CD137+ immune infiltrate adjacent to PD-L1+ cells. Moreover, ex vivo co-incubation of tumor and immune cells in the presence of CD3-based bispecifics or Fc-enhanced antibodies further induces PD-L1 and CD137 expression. PD-L1xCD137 binds and blocks PD-L1, reversing PD-1-mediated T-cell inhibition equipotently to the effect of approved PD-L1 benchmark mAbs; it also binds CD137, but absent clustering supported by PD-L1+ cells, fails to induce CD137 signaling. In the presence of PD-L1-expressing cells, however, PD-L1xCD137 drives CD137 activation and immune cell co-stimulation. Robust T-cell activation and cytokine secretion was induced by PD-L1xCD137, with significantly greater activity than that observed with the combination of PD-L1 blocking and CD137 agonistic mAbs. Notably, when combined with tumor targeted immunotherapies, PD-L1xCD137 supports enhanced activation of effector cells and anti-tumor activity.</p><p id="Par3225"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3226">These data show that an investigational PD-L1xCD137 bispecific can switch on CD137 co-stimulation in a PD-L1-dependent fashion. While tumor adaptive resistance via PD-L1 induction promotes tumor immune escape, PD-L1xCD137 can exploit the checkpoint ligand up-regulation by contributing a co-stimulatory signal in addition to checkpoint blockade. PD-L1xCD137 provides a potential therapeutic approach to overcome limitations of existing PD-1/PD-L1-targeting strategies either as monotherapy or in combination with complementary immune based therapeutic modalities, such as CD3 based bispecifics or Fc-enhanced mAbs.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1118"><title>P283 Generation and characterization of a PD-1 resistant mouse tumor model</title><sec id="Sec1119"><title>Marie Bernardo, PhD, Tatiana Tolstykh, Yu-An Zhang, Dinesh Bangari, Hui Cao, PhD, Joon Sang Lee, PhD, Natalia Malkova, Jack Pollard, PhD, Fangxian Sun, Dmitri Wiederschain, Timothy Wagenaar</title><sec id="Sec1120"><title>Sanofi Oncology Research, Cambridge, MA, United States</title><sec id="Sec1121"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Timothy Wagenaar (timothy.wagenaar@sanofi.com)</title><p id="Par3227"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par3228">Immune checkpoint blockade elicits durable anti-cancer responses in the clinic, however a large proportion of patients do not benefit from treatment.

Unbiased gene expression analysis was used to further characterize potential resistance mechanisms. RNA-sequencing revealed substantial differences in global gene expression with PD-1 resistant tumors displaying a marked reduction in expression of immune-related genes relative to parental MC38 tumors. Transcriptomic data revealed that PD-1 resistant tumors exhibit reduced immune infiltration across multiple cell types, including T and NK cells, while pathway analysis identified activation of two major tumor promoting signaling pathways in PD-1 resistant tumors.

The neutralizing antibodies mimicked the KO phenotype and markedly improved the response to anti-PD1 therapy in preclinical mouse models. The mechanism of action is being investigated.

However, despite this advancement in cancer immunotherapy, only ~20-30% of the patients derive durable benefit from such a treatment. One of the suggested reasons for this limited success is the expression/activation of compensatory inhibitory pathways such as LAG-3 on tumor-reactive T cells. These pathways compensate for the loss of function of PD-1 upon its blockade. Therefore, it is envisioned that simultaneous antagonism of PD-1 and LAG-3 receptors would overcome this adaptive resistance mechanism and allow a more profound reinvigoration of dysfunctional tumor-reactive T cells. Conversely, a recent report has highlighted that blockade of LAG-3 on regulatory T cells (Tregs) increases their suppressive function and, therefore may off-set its benefit on the reinvigoration of dysfunctional tumor-reactive T cells.</p><p id="Par3273"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3274">We therefore developed a 1+1 PD1-LAG3 bispecific antibody (BsAb) with a 10-20 fold higher affinity for PD-1 than for LAG-3, allowing an avidity driven selectivity gain to PD-1 and LAG-3 double positive T cells.</p><p id="Par3275"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3276">Hence, PD1-LAG3 BsAb is assumed to have the following advantages over monospecific and other bispecific aPD/L1 and aLAG-3 antibodies: 1) improved targeting to dysfunctional T cells rather than Tregs due to the selectivity gain and different expression patterns of PD-1 and LAG-3 on these two T cell types, 2) reduced internalization, 3) Fc silent-mediated resistance to drug-shaving by macrophages.</p><p id="Par3277"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3278">These characteristics translated in a significant increase in 1) in vitro T cell effector functions even in the presence of Tregs, and 2) in vivo tumor control/eradication in mouse models compared to combination of monospecific anti-PD1 and anti-LAG3 antibodies.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1138"><title>P288 CCR5+CTLA4+ Treg cell subset characterizes renal tumors (RCC) immunosuppressed by PD1 blockade</title><sec id="Sec1139"><title>Agathe Dubuisson<sup>1</sup>, Agathe Dubuisson<sup>1</sup>, Charles Bayard<sup>1</sup>, Sebastien Lofek<sup>1</sup>, Nicolas Voisin<sup>1</sup>, Séverine Mouraud<sup>1</sup>, Delphine Bredel<sup>1</sup>, Sandrine Susini<sup>1</sup>, Mathieu Rouanne, MD<sup>1</sup>, Hervé Beaumert<sup>1</sup>, Bastien Parier<sup>2</sup>, Aurélien Marabelle, MD PhD<sup>1</sup>, Laurence Zitvogel, MD, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Mélodie Bonvalet<sup>1</sup>, Mélodie Bonvalet<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1140"><title><sup>1</sup>Gustave Rousy, Villejuif, France; <sup>2</sup>APHP, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France</title><sec id="Sec1141"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Mélodie Bonvalet (bonvaletmelodie@gmail.com)</title><p id="Par3279"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par3280">A small subset of patients undergoing PD1 blockade therapy develop a hyper-progressive disease (HPD), corresponding to an acceleration of tumor growth rate [1].

Various stroma-resident and tumour-infiltrating immune cells are associated with pro-tumour activity. Whilst immunotherapies may trigger anti-tumour immune responses, anti-inflammatory M2-like tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) within the TME present an obstacle for effective treatment [1]. Pre-clinical research has predominantly used mouse models to represent the in vivo TME. Unfortunately, such models do not faithfully replicate the human immune system therefore, providing an inadequate measure of immunotherapy response. Human tumour-derived explants maintain the original 3D tumour architecture and combination of multiple cell types. Therefore, we established an ex vivo tumour explant model of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) incorporating TAMs, to determine their role in immunotherapeutic response.</p><p id="Par3297"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3298">Tumour explants (ca. 1mm³) were generated from fresh tumour tissue. Autologous CD14<sup>+</sup> peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were added to explants for 48h followed by flow cytometry phenotyping using a 7-marker macrophage panel (CD14; CD64; PDL-1; CD163; CD206; CD23; CD200R). The functional contribution of macrophages to explant-mediated immunosuppression was assessed through measuring IFNγ/TNFα production from CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by flow cytometry. T cells, in the presence of explants, were stimulated with a viral peptide pool and incubated for 6 days ±250μg/mL Atezolizumab, prior to intracellular cytokine staining. Culture supernatants were collected and the Th1/Th2 cytokine profile determined using a LEGENDplex bead-based immunoassay (BioLegend). Transcriptomic analysis was performed on patient tumour tissue and peripheral blood using the NanoString PanCancer IO360 gene expression panel.</p><p id="Par3299"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3300">Tumour explants significantly promoted M2-like macrophage differentiation and suppressed T cell activity ex vivo. The PDL-1 inhibitor, Atezolizumab significantly improved T cell function in some patients and reduced explant-mediated immunosuppression, particularly in the presence of macrophages. This suggests that response or resistance to anti-PDL-1 therapies may be partially TAM dependent. The differential effect of Atezolizumab observed in the presence of patient-derived tumour explants indicates the potential of this model in predicting immunotherapy responses. Ongoing transcriptomic analysis of lung cancer tissue aims to reveal associations between the TME and T cell function. Variations in the cytokine secretion profile of tumour explant co-cultures are also being studied under different experimental conditions.</p><p id="Par3301"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3302">Using the tumour explant model, we found that alleviation of explant-mediated immunosuppression by Atezolizumab may be macrophage dependent. This model could be used to predict patient response to anti-PDL-1 immunotherapy, and explore combination therapies. Ongoing research aims to improve immunotherapy responses through reprogramming TAMs using immune-modifying drugs.</p><p id="Par3303"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par3304">Study supported by research funds from Cardiff University, School of Medicine.

However, the role of this cellular source of IFNγ in the tumor microenvironment (TME) and how Treg derived IFNγ dictates response to other cancer immunotherapies has yet to be studied. In addition, it has been shown that IL-12-induced production of IFNγ is necessary for response to anti-PD1 therapy [2]. However, it has yet to be determined whether Tregs are a key responder to IL-12 during cancer immunotherapy. Thus, elucidating the interplay of IL12, IFNγ and Tregs in the TME is essential for maximizing efficacy and minimizing the clinical resistance to current cancer immunotherapies.</p><p id="Par3311"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3312">Our lab has generated two novel murine models that allow for Treg-restricted deletion of Ifng (IfngL/LFoxp3Cre-YFP) or Il12rb2 (Il12rb2L/LFoxp3Cre-YFP).

T cell cytotoxicity is maintained over several antigen exposures before sharply decreasing whereas cytokine secretion begins to decrease with only one prior antigen exposure. The expression of known T cell regulators and novel factors is altered over the time course, with known factors reflecting previous observations in vivo. Anti-PD1 prolongs cytotoxic capacity but T cells eventually fail to respond. Single cell mapping in the presence of anti-PD1 reveals an expanded population of T cells that co-express PD1, TIGIT and activation markers. Consistent with this, the combination of PD1 and TIGIT blockade enhances cytotoxicity relative to monotherapies.</p><p id="Par3326"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3327">These findings demonstrate the utility of our system to deeply interrogate therapeutic response and resistance.

Mice were also tested for their ability to generate systemic and protective immunity against a second tumor challenge.</p><p id="Par3332"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3333">Comparing lung and subcutaneous tumors, we observed striking differences within the TIL compartment. Lung tumors contained more TIL with higher expression of PD-1. Despite this, lung tumors did not respond to anti-CTLA-4 + anti-PD-L1, while subcutaneous tumors did. TIL expanded in subcutaneous tumors after immunotherapy, while lung tumors had no change in the number of TIL. We further tested for concomitant immunity and found that subcutaneous KP tumors generated an immune response that could protect against a second tumor. However, KP lung tumors failed to generate a protective systemic immune response. These results were reproduced using a pancreatic cancer cell line, indicating that tumors growing in the lung generated weaker systemic immune responses than subcutaneous tumors. Protective concomitant immunity required CD8+ T cells, and to a lesser extent CD4+ T cells, but not NK cells. Therefore, we investigated differences in the generation of systemic, antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses between subcutaneous and lung KP tumors. Using KP.SIY tumors, elispot assays found that lung tumors generated fewer antigen-specific T cells in the spleen. Transferred 2C T cells proliferated less in the spleens of lung tumor-bearing hosts than in hosts with subcutaneous tumors, even though proliferation in draining lymph nodes was similar. Consistently, KP.SIY lung tumors generated weaker concomitant immunity than subcutaneous KP.SIY tumors.</p><p id="Par3334"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3335">The tissue site of tumor growth determines the number and phenotype of TIL, the generation of systemic immunity, and the response to checkpoint blockade.

Primary tumors were cutaneous in 283 (66%) patients, unknown in 55 (13%), acral in 22 (5%), mucosal in 38 (9%) and uveal in 30 (7%)(Table 1). Mucosal patients had a slight female preponderance. The proportion staged M1c was higher in mucosal and uveal patients. Patients with cutaneous primary tumors had median OS after CPI of 45 months, compared with 17 months for acral (P = 0.047), 18 months for mucosal (P = 0.003) and 12 months for uveal (P &lt; 0.001)(Figure 1). Five-year survival for cutaneous, acral, mucosal and uveal patients was 46%, 34%, 21% and 22% respectively.</p><p id="Par3358">Next we combined the patients with acral, mucosal and uveal melanoma (n = 90) and performed survival analysis stratified by the first type of CPI treatment. Median OS after anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 was 9 months, compared with 18 months after anti-CTLA-4 (P = 0.010) and 20 months after combination therapy with anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 (P = 0.003)(Figure 2). While 21 of 31 (68%) patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 later were treated with anti-PD-1, only 5 of 18 (28%) patients treated with anti-PD-1 later received anti-CTLA-4 (P = 0.02). There were 21 patients who survived at least three years after CPI, all of whom were treated with anti-CTLA-4 with or without anti-PD-1. Of the 10 patients with actual five-year survival, 3 had complete responses while the other 7 all required local and/or regional therapies to control progressive disease (Table 2).</p><p id="Par3359"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3360">Long survival in patients with metastatic melanoma from acral, mucosal and uveal primary tumors was uniformly associated with receipt of anti-CTLA-4. Our experience shows that while acral, mucosal and uveal melanomas have worse outcomes than cutaneous melanoma, with an aggressive multidiscliplinary approach five-year survival is still possible for 25-32% of these patients.</p><p id="Par3361"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3362">1.

The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th Edition Staging system is derived from the pre-checkpoint inhibitor era and divides patients into locally advanced or soft tissue disease (M0/M1a), lung metastases (M1b), other visceral metastases (M1c), and brain metastases (M1d). It is unclear whether this prognostic classification remains valid in the modern therapeutic era. The number of metastatic sites influences outcomes with BRAF-MEK therapy [1], but its prognostic importance with PD-1-based therapy is unknown.</p><p id="Par3377"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3378">All patients with melanoma who had prospective tumor molecular profiling at a single center (MSK-IMPACT) and subsequently received frontline PD-1 blockade as single agent (Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab) or combination therapy with Ipilimumab (combo) were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected, including metastatic sites present at time of PD-1 therapy. Overall survival (OS) and time to treatment failure (TTF) were calculated from the onset of PD-1 therapy using Kaplan-Meier methodology. The impact of specific metastatic sites on TTF and OS was determined using Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Models. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) was calculated as previously described [2].</p><p id="Par3379"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3380">309 patients received frontline PD-1 monotherapy (n=179) or PD-1 combo (n=130). Overall survival varied by AJCC stage (p&lt;0.0001, Figure 1); M1b and M0/M1a groups had similar OS (median=NR, p = 0.27) followed by M1c (median=39 mo) and M1d (median=28 mo). Patients with 3+ metastatic sites had worse median OS than those with 0-2 metastatic sites (45 vs 39 mo, p&lt;0.0001, Figure 2).</p><p id="Par3381">Among patients with M1c disease, those with bone or liver metastases had worse median OS than those without them (39 vs NR mo, Liver HR=2.4, p=0.036, Bone HR=2.6, p=0.021, Figure 3). Among patients with M1d disease, those with liver metastases had shorter TTF than those without when treated with PD-1 combination therapy (HR=2.4, p=0.044).

The presence of liver or bone metastases at time of PD-1 therapy portends worse OS and TTF even within M1c and M1d disease. Patients with 0-2 metastatic sites live longer than those with 3+ sites. These clinical observations are not explained by differences in TMB. Future trials of PD-1 blockade in advanced melanoma should account for these differences.</p><p id="Par3384"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par3385">Research reported in this abstract was supported by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R25CA020449 and by National Cancer Institute Cancer Center Core Grant P30CA008748, Kravis Center for Molecular Oncology.

The model describes individual animal responses with regard to drug exposure, key intra-tumoral cell kinetics and tumor volume changes and provides biologically plausible explanations for the observed differences between good and poor responders to treatment with anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4.</p><p id="Par3407"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3408">We used the model to predict the antibody dose-response relationships for individual animals and to identify dose thresholds above which complete tumor elimination can be achieved in good responders. In contrast, our models predict that poor responders would not achieve complete response even with much higher drug doses. The parameters in our model that impact the response in poor responders are not drug-related. This finding suggests that immune-cell related barriers have to be crossed in order to achieve a therapeutic response in these animals - possibly via combination therapy.</p><p id="Par3409">In addition, we identified the net tumor cell doubling rate, one potential parameter that contributes to individual variability in response to treatment, as the most sensitive biological parameter determining tumor volume changes upon treatment with anti-PD1 or anti-CTLA4. Measuring individual animal tumor cell growth characteristics may help with the experimental design and qualification of animals for studies (in addition to absolute tumor volume), and thereby reduce inter-animal variability and enhance the interpretability of study results, especially in combination with a model such as the one presented here.</p><p id="Par3410"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3411">This model platform can be adapted to capture and compare checkpoint drug effects in different syngeneic tumor models.

Data thus far on the effect of PBRM1 loss on immune responsiveness are inconsistent. The impact of PBRM1 mutation on response to immunotherapy in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has become a topic of intense debate. RCC-specific mechanistic and large-scale clinical data are needed to precisely further characterize the influence of PBRM1 loss on response to immunotherapy.</p><p id="Par3414"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3415">An immunocompetent murine RCC model was applied to investigate the response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Multiple human RCC datasets (TCGA, IMmotion150 and ICGC), a murine pre-malignant dataset and a Renca tumor dataset were used to perform gene signature enrichment analysis (GSEA). Immunohistochemistry and Multiplex Opal Immunofluorescence were performed to assess immune cell infiltration.

PBRM1/Pbrm1 deficiency impaired IFN gamma-induced phosphorylation of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and STAT1, and the subsequent expression of downstream target genes involved in tumor microenvironment (TME) modulation, such as Cxcl9, Icam1, Irf1, and Stat1 itself. In both human and murine RCC tumors, PBRM1/Pbrm1 loss was associated with lower expression of immune-related profiles and reduced T cell infiltration. PBRM1/Pbrm1 loss tumors also demonstrated higher expression of angiogenesis-related profiles and increased CD31 expression. Furthermore, Pbrm1 deficient Renca subcutaneous tumors in mice demonstrated longer latency but more resistance to programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade. Analysis of the IMmotion150 cohort revealed that ccRCC patients with PBRM1 mutations were associated with decreased immune infiltrates and a reduced response rate to atezolizumab monotherapy or combination therapy with bevacizumab.</p><p id="Par3418"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3419">Pbrm1 and PBRM1 loss reduced IFN gamma-STAT1 signaling.

The synergy between CD8-specific Nrp1 deficiency and anti-PD1 blockade was investigated with the MC38 tumor model. In a competitive setting, the Nrp1–/– and Nrp1+/+ pMel-T cells [2] were co-transferred into the same host (CD45.1) followed by gp100-B16 tumor inoculation, where the in vivo long-term persistence of the donor cells was assessed. The transcriptomic modulation by Nrp1 deficiency was studied using bulk population RNA sequencing (bpRNAseq) on the pMel-T cells (Nrp1–/– vs. Nrp1+/+) recovered from various phase of in vivo activation (effector, memory and recall).

We previously showed these proteases cleave Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) from tumors in soluble form (sPD-L1) [7]. sPD-L1 engages immune cell Programmed death 1 (PD-1) to inhibit tumor immunity. It is unknown how broadly this mechanism occurs in solid malignancies. We hypothesized (1) ADAM10 and/or ADAM17 may be elevated in tumors with low PD-L1 protein despite high PD-L1 (CD274) mRNA and (2) this low tumor PD-L1 protein-to-mRNA ratio may predict lower overall survival.</p><p id="Par3458"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3459">We queried the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for all solid tumors with Level 3 reverse phase protein array (RPPA) PD-L1 protein levels and RNA-seq sequence per million mapped fragments (FPKM) PD-L1 (CD274), ADAM10, and ADAM17 mRNA levels. We calculated a PD-L1 protein-to-mRNA ratio for each sample.

We previously showed in multiple cell lines that ADAM10 and ADAM17 cleave PD-L1 from the surface of tumor cells [7]. Our results suggest that ADAM10 and/or ADAM17 may cleave PD-L1 to cause a low PD-L1 protein-to-mRNA ratio in these tumors. This process may explain poorer survival of patients with low PD-L1 protein-to-mRNA ratios in some cancers.</p><p id="Par3464">Our findings may explain why some tumors that do not have detectable PD-L1 expression on immunohistochemistry respond to PD-(L)1 inhibitor therapy given the solubilization of PD-L1 and its subsequent systemic negative regulatory effects on T cells. Further, ADAM10/ADAM17 inhibition may prevent PD-L1 shedding and sensitize tumors to therapy. While this work is correlative in nature, studies exploring this mechanism of tumor immune system evasion are ongoing.</p><p id="Par3465"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par3466">The results shown here are in whole or part based upon data generated by the TCGA Research Network: https://www.cancer.gov/tcga.</p><p id="Par3467"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3468">1.

Many factors have been attributed to this including multiple co-inhibitory receptor surface expression, altered transcription factor expression, epigenetic rewiring and dysregulated metabolism. Antigen persistence is necessary for driving TEX maintenance in both the chronic viral infection setting and cancer. In addition to persistent antigen exposure, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) encounter numerous tumor-mediated immunosuppressive metabolic byproducts, suppressive cytokines, hypoxia and cellular debris which converge to suppress T cell function and uniquely alter is transcription factor profile. These suppressed or dysfunctional T cells are incapable of mounting an optimal anti-tumor response in part due to lack of fitness in competing for glucose and oxygen.

In this assay, healthy human PBMCs are stimulated with peptide(s) derived from either viruses or tumor proteins and grown in culture for one week.

Further, this assay has the potential to screen for donors who are in vitro “responders” and “non-responders” to ICI drugs and is also being used to screen co-stimulatory agonists, peptide biologics and other drug classes.</p><p id="Par3486"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3487">Taken together, our data indicate that the recall antigen potency assay we established is highly potential to screen the drug candidates for immune checkpoint inhibitor and enhancer drug candidates.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1198"><title>P303 PD-1 checkpoint blockade in advanced melanoma patients: Neutrophils, NK cells, monocytic subsets and host PD-L1 expression as predictive biomarker candidates</title><sec id="Sec1199"><title>Yago Pico de Coaña, Maria Wolodarski, MD, Irene van der Haar Àvila, Takahiro Nakajima, Stamatina Rentouli, Andreas Lundqvist, PhD, Giuseppe Masucci, MD, PhD, Johan Hansson, Rolf Kiessling, MD, PhD</title><sec id="Sec1200"><title>Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden</title><sec id="Sec1201"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Yago Pico de Coaña (yago.pico.de.coana@ki.se)</title><p id="Par3488"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par3489">Blockade of the PD-1 receptor has revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma, with significant increases in overall survival and a dramatic improvement in patient quality of life.

Responses, however, remain unpredictable and low in most cases. One of the aspects thought to be limiting immunotherapies is the tumor microenvironment which favors tumor growth and immunosuppression. It has been hypothesized that dysregulated tumor metabolism creates a hypoxic tumor microenvironment which acts as a barrier to antitumor immunity. Metformin has been shown to reduce oxygen consumption and subsequently reduce the microenvironment hypoxia, leading to improved response rates of checkpoint inhibitors in murine in vitro and in vivo models [1]. We performed a retrospective review to evaluate response rates in our patients who were treated with CPI+M.</p><p id="Par3536"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3537">We reviewed all adult cancer patients who were treated with a CPIs. Patients treated with M and CPIs were compared to those who were treated with CPIs only. All tumor types and all CPI drugs were included. The primary endpoint was overall response rate, which included stable disease, partial response, and complete response. Additional data was captured for subgroup analysis. Patients were excluded if they had never received the treatment, or if they were never assessed for response.</p><p id="Par3538"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3539">As of this date, 144 patients had been included in the study data-set. Of those, 24 patients were treated with M and CPIs and 120 patients received CPIs only. Both groups were comparable with respect to sex. However, the M+CPI group was slightly older. Lung cancer constituted the majority of cases in both groups. The overall response rates of the CPI+M group were significantly higher than those treated with CPI only (75% vs 53.3%, p = 0.05).</p><p id="Par3540"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3541">The data from this chart review shows an apparent benefit with respect to overall response rates in patients treated with M and CPIs. The cohorts remain small in this study, but the data is significant. These results align well with data from mouse studies and two small retrospective human studies in melanoma [2] and lung cancer [3], hence, demonstrating an increased immune response and higher response rates. Currently, we are expanding our cohort number and data-set as we gained access to a bigger data warehouse. More prospective data are awaited from an ongoing phase Ib (UMIN000028405), and phase II (NCT03800602, NCT03048500) trials that should shed more light on the effects of metformin on immuno-oncologic therapies.</p><p id="Par3542"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3543">1.

Obesity is a known risk factor for several cancer types. It is associated with increased progression and cancer-related death. This is thought to be the result of inflammaging and PD-1 mediated immune suppression. Recently, two large retrospective studies found that obesity conferred a survival advantage for cancer patients treated with CPIs which may be independent of sex [1,2]. However, the mechanistic explanation of this observed obesity paradox, assuming it is real, has been the subject of many scientific conjectures. These studies focused on the impact of obesity on CPI overall survival which can be affected by many confounding variables. Instead, we explored the effect of obesity on CPI response rates.</p><p id="Par3550"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3551">We retrospectively reviewed every cancer patient that received CPIs at Overton Brooks VA Medical Center (OBVAMC) between 2015 and 2019.

Based on the WHO definition, the patients were grouped according to their BMIs into overweight and obese (Group A) versus normal and underweight (Group B). Our primary outcome of interest was defined as the presence or absence of CPI response. Patients who attained stable disease, partial response, and complete response were categorized as responders.

Recently it was reported that older age correlated with better outcome in stage IV melanoma patients treated with ICB. We examined the association of age with response to ICB and anti-tumor immunity in melanoma patients treated neoadjuvantly (NCT02519322) and interrogated underlying mechanisms in a murine model.</p><p id="Par3563"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3564">Tumor samples were obtained from neoadjuvant ICB trial patients pre-treatment, on-treatment and on-surgery. Transcriptome profiling was performed using Illumina NextSeq platform and whole exome sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed using logistic regression modeling. Immune profiling was performed by Immunohistochemistry (IHC). The effects of age on anti-tumor immunity were examined by implanting 2x105 Yumm1.7 cells subdermally in young (8wks) and aged (&gt;12months) male mice.

Tumor mutational load was positively correlated with age (r=0.4) but did not reach statistical significance (P=0.1). Differential gene expression analysis revealed genes associated with MHC class II antigen expression (HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRB1) as significantly overexpressed in younger patients upon treatment with ICB. Furthermore, MHC class II regulator interferon-gamma signaling was also observed upregulated in younger patients (P=0.03). PD-1 expression (by IHC) was lower in older patients upon treatment with ICB (r=-0.47, P=0.035).

However, we recently found that the suboptimally-primed CD8 cells have a pre-disposition to develop a dysfunctional phenotype that is marked by expression of CD38 on PD1+CD8+T-cells. Interestingly, the number of these dysfunctional cells were significantly increased upon PD-1 blockade in these suboptimally-primed CD8 cells that served as a reason for resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. On the other hand, anti-PD-1 blockade of optimally-primed CD8 cells did not generate these dysfunctional cells and led to cell activation and generation of effector functions [1]. Hence, here we investigated the effect of optimal-priming on reversing the resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy.</p><p id="Par3577"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3578">Mice were inoculated with TC-1 cells (a mouse lung epithelial cell-line, expressing human papillomavirus-specific E7-peptide) in the presence or absence of concomitant priming with gp100 peptide, a non-cognate tumor vaccine. Seven days later mice were treated with anti-PD-1 either alone or followed by combination of tumor-specific E7-peptide vaccine+anti-PD-1. Tumor growth rates, mice survival, and immune responses in the TME were estimated.</p><p id="Par3579"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3580">We found that in suboptimally-primed TC-1 tumor-bearing mice, anti-PD-1 treatment did not show any anti-tumor effects. Therefore, to check if the optimal priming of CD8 T-cells could reverse this resistance, we vaccinated mice with gp100 at the time of tumor implantation with TC-1 cells. We found that compared to suboptimally-primed mice, anti-PD-1 treatment of primed-mice resulted in significant retardation of tumor growth and a prolonged mice survival. Interestingly, tumor-specific vaccination (E7-peptide) of these primed-mice at the time of anti-PD-1 treatment further enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of PD-1 blockade. Moreover, in gp100-primed-mice we found a significant reduction in the number of PD-1+CD38hi dysfunctional cells compared to suboptimally-primed mice. The number of these dysfunctional cells was further reduced upon anti-PD-1 treatment of primed-mice. In addition, the priming state also affected the functionality of CD8 T-cells. Although gp100 alone prevented the induction of these dysfunctional cells, the functionality of CD8 T-cells was only increased when anti-PD-1 was given subsequent to priming with gp100 peptide.</p><p id="Par3581"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3582">Here we demonstrate that optimal priming of CD8 cells reverses resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. The suboptimal-priming of the CD8+ T-cells induces higher numbers of dysfunctional PD-1+CD38hi CD8+ T-cells and their frequency further increases upon anti-PD-1 therapy, leading to therapeutic failure. Since in most tumors, T-cells are suboptimally-primed [2,3], our mouse data demonstrate the importance of appropriately primed T-cells in responding to anti-PD-1 treatment.</p><p id="Par3583"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3584">1 Verma, V. et al.

High PGE2 levels results from dysregulation of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the enzyme that produces this lipid. PGE2 stimulates tumor cell proliferation, survival, evasion and metastasis along with host angiogenesis. PGE2 suppresses anti-tumor immunity through inhibiting the function of critical immune effectors such as NK and T cells, and M1 macrophages, while promoting the activity of suppressive immune cells including myeloid derived suppressor cells, M2 macrophages, and regulatory T cells. PGE2 signals through a family of four homologous E-prostanoid (EP) G-coupled receptors, known as EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4; which,are activated via distinct signal transduction pathways. Published literature and experimental results presented here demonstrate that selective antagonism of both EP2 and EP4 receptor signaling, but not EP1 and EP3, effectively overcomes PGE2-mediated immune suppression and results in anti-tumor efficacy. TPST-1495 is a first-in-class, orally available, small molecule, selective dual antagonist of the human PGE2 receptors EP2 and EP4, currently under development by Tempest.</p><p id="Par3589"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3590">The effects of TPST-1495 as monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD1 were evaluated in the syngeneic mouse colon models CT26 and Apcmin/+.

Significantly, combination with EP1 and/or EP3 antagonists reversed the effect of dual EP2 and EP4 blockade on PGE2 immune suppression, suggesting that COX-2 inhibition is not optimal for blocking the effects of PGE2. TPST-1495 induced potent anti-tumor immune responses and significant tumor regression as a monotherapy in two different murine tumor treatment models of colon cancer, CT26 and Apcmin/+. CT26 tumors analyzed from mice treated with TPST-1495 alone revealed a significant increase of infiltrating effector T cells.

In the nivo-ipi cohort, 260 baseline and 662 post-nivo immunophenotypes were significantly associated with response and survival (outcomes). In the ipi-nivo cohort, 432 baseline and 668 post-ipi immunophenotypes were associated with outcomes. Two highly similar immunophenotypes associated with outcomes overlapped between the cohorts, CD14+CD11C+CD33+CD15-CD19-PDL1-PDL2+CD163+GAL9-CD80-CD86-41BBL+CD40+OX40L+ cells.

Of these 100, 97% were altered in a manner positively associated with response (e.g. upregulated by nivolumab and higher in responders). For example, nivo upregulated CD4+CD45RO-CCR7+ frequencies, which were associated with response and longer survival in ipi-nivo treated patients. Of the 7,133 immunophenotypes altered post-ipi, 110 were also associated with nivo-ipi response. Of these, 95% were altered in a manner negatively associated with response.

Delta values (post-treatment minus baseline values) were used for 15 parameters. A receiver operating characteristic with an area under the curve of 0.898 was achieved. The most important features in these models were the percentage of CD4+ T-cells expressing IL-6, MIP1a and soluble CD137 along with the percentage of CD8+ T-cells expressing IL-13.</p><p id="Par3611"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3612">These results demonstrate the ability of single-cell, high-dimension technologies coupled with machine learning to reveal complex associations between immune cell function and clinical outcomes. Specifically, these data show that changes in secretome production potential of T-cells after treatment with the PD1 blocking antibody nivolumab are associated with metastatic melanoma patient outcomes. We identified a signature of secreted molecules that were associated with patient outcomes, providing rationale for targeting these molecules to increase the efficacy of nivolumab.

Innate immune responses, such as Natural killer (NK) cell-mediated killing, are dependent on the DDR essential kinases Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) or ATM- and RAD3-related (ATR) [1]. However, DNA damage inducing agents activate the NF-kappaB-regulated interferon immune response pathway [2]. Moreover, DDR inhibition resulting from DNA repair deficiency or cell cycle checkpoint inhibition can potentiate efficacy of antibody-based immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint blockade and ADCC [3-5]. However, the mechanistic role of DNA damage response signaling in the development of immunotherapy resistance remains unclear. A NK cell-mediated cetuximab-dependent killing in vitro ADCC model was used to study this involvement. Our previous studies have suggested a loss of cell surface adhesion molecules in ADCC resistant cells [6]. Here we study the alterations of DNA damage response signaling in the process of ADCC resistance development.</p><p id="Par3617"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3618">A431, a human epidermoid carcinoma cell line, develops resistance to cetuximab and NK92-CD16v cell-mediated killing after 35 challenges of continuous exposure. Surviving cells following each ADCC challenge were collected and studied for protein expression by western blot, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Neutral comet assay was used to measure the level of DNA double strand breaks. Fluorescence-based cytotoxicity methods were used to determine the activity of ADCC. Apoptosis was measured by Annexin-V-PI staining. Small interference RNA (siRNA) were used to knockdown gene expression.</p><p id="Par3619"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3620">Levels of gammaH2AX, a marker of DNA damage signaling, were significantly increased with exposure to ADCC, but no increased DNA breaks were detected in ADCC resistant cells. p53, phosphorylated-p53 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) were also enhanced during the process of ADCC resistance development. Interestingly, phosphorylated-STAT1 reached a peak prior to the emergence of ADCC resistance and then decreased until cells became entirely resistant. There was less apoptosis induction, no caspase activation, less induction of gammaH2AX and no activation of p53 in response to ADCC in resistant cells. Inhibition of p53 or STAT1 by siRNA, and ATM/ATR inhibitors enhanced ADCC activity in A431 cells but not in ADCC resistant cells. TP53 knockdown activated STAT1 in A431 cells, but reduced activation of STAT1 in ADCC resistant cells.</p><p id="Par3621"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3622">DNA damage response signaling was altered during the development of ADCC resistance, which is involved in ADCC activity regulation and might become be a signature of cell sensitivity in response to immunotherapy.

PD-L1 expression has been shown to be a key predictive biomarker of response to PD1/PD-L1 therapies. PD-L2 expression is observed in multiple tumor types, and animal studies suggest PD-L2 may be involved in T-cell suppression. However, the role of PD-L2 expression in the TME and the role as a predictive biomarker in immunotherapy is not as well understood as PD-L1.

TIGIT binds two ligands PVR (CD155) and PVRL2 (CD112) and these ligands are expressed by T cells, APCs, and tumor cells. As malignancies progress, PVR over-expressed in tumor cells interacts with TIGIT expressed on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and suppresses TIL activity by sending an inhibitory signal to immune cells, which is an immune escape mechanism in cancer. In cancer, TIGIT blockade results in improved effector CD8+ T cell and NK cell function as well as decreased Treg-cell-mediated suppression. Therefore, we developed MG1131, a novel anti-TIGIT antibody, to modulate the tumor microenvironment towards a more effective anti-cancer response.</p><p id="Par3645"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3646">TIGIT-targeting antibody candidates were screened out of a phage display library. The TIGIT antigen binding affinity and PVR blocking of anti-TIGIT antibodies were evaluated through both protein-based and cell-based assays. Functional consequences of MG1131 were determined using a cell-based reporter assay for T cell activation, a Treg cell functional assay and an NK-mediated tumor killing assay. Treg cells and NK cells were isolated from healthy donor PBMC.</p><p id="Par3647"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3648">We screened out a few of the clones which stood out showing high affinity binding to TIGIT and significant blocking of the TIGIT-PVR interaction. Among the tested antibodies, MG1131 was identified to have the strongest affinity for human TIGIT and significant blocking activity, resulting in competition with PVR in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, MG1131 was cross-reactive with cynomolgus monkey TIGIT, but not with mouse TIGIT. Our in vitro efficacy data demonstrated that MG1131 significantly enhances T cell activation and NK-mediated tumor killing activities in a PVR-dependent manner and MG1131 induces IFN-γ secretion and proliferation of CD8+ T cells by inhibiting Treg suppressive function.</p><p id="Par3649"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3650">We developed an anti-TIGIT antibody, MG1131, with pronounced inhibitory activity on the TIGIT-PVR signaling axis.

Although comprehensive targeted genomic panels are available to measure TMB and HRD-LOH, including FoundationOne® CDx (F1CDx), implementation of WES as a diagnostic approach in clinical practice can be challenging. To assess the feasibility of translating findings using WES as an exploratory tool into a practical diagnostic device such as F1CDx, we evaluated the concordance of genomic scores (TMB and HRD-LOH) and single-gene alterations between WES and F1CDx in a large pan-tumor data set.</p><p id="Par3666"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3667">This analysis used solid tumor samples from patients with advanced disease who received pembrolizumab monotherapy in the second line or later during single-arm clinical trials. WES and F1CDx (Dx1 baitset) were used to analyze samples from 436 patients across 22 tumor types. Spearman rank-order correlation and linear regression were used to determine concordance and cutoff equivalence for TMB and HRD-LOH, each calculated by both WES [1] and F1CDx (Foundation Medicine proprietary pipeline QSR_F1Dx_v1.0.3).</p><p id="Par3668"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3669">Using WES and F1CDx, high concordance was observed in the pan-tumor assessment of TMB (Spearman correlation, 0.7; n=413) and HRD-LOH (Spearman correlation, 0.5; n=364). When individual indications were considered, the concordance was further improved for indications with higher distribution medians. TMB concordance was higher when restricted to non–small cell lung cancer (Spearman correlation, 0.8; n=38). HRD-LOH concordance was higher when restricted to ovarian cancer (Spearman correlation, 0.7; n=54) and breast cancer (Spearman correlation, 0.6; n=80). Regression analysis of TMB using both platforms identified F1CDx (Foundation Medicine proprietary pipeline QSR_F1Dx_v1.0.3) TMB cutoffs of 10 and 13 mutations/megabase to correspond to WES TMB of ~150 and ~175 mutations/exome, respectively. Assessment of BRCA1/2 deleterious mutations also demonstrated agreement between WES and F1CDx, with 305 of 309 (98.7%) samples showing agreement; 282 samples showed wild-type status by both methods and 23 samples showed mutant status by both methods.</p><p id="Par3670"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3671">The high level of concordance between WES and F1CDx suggests that molecular biomarker discoveries, including clinically relevant cutoffs and molecular epidemiology findings evaluated on the translational WES platform, may be translated successfully in the diagnostic setting.

However, nivolumab is frequently associated with fatigue, increased risk of skin toxicity and autoimmune-related adverse events. Thus, patients may experience important changes in daily living activities, health related QoL, and skin integrity during nivolumab treatment. In view of this issue, studies are needed evaluating these important changes related to nivolumab, concurrently.

During tumor progression, immune cells can become unresponsive and evade immune surveillance upon chronic activation and expression of the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) the ligand PD-L1 on tumor cells or expression of the T lymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) in T-cells cells resulting in tumor immune-tolerance. We have previously demonstrated that murine anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 and CTLA-4 blockade can effectively enhance immune normalization and re-activate the antitumor response against multiple syngeneic tumor models. While these models proved instrumental for evaluating murine immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), there is a clear need for additional mouse models to evaluate the efficacy of ICI specific for human targets.</p><p id="Par3693"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3694">To address this need, we describe the development of humanized PD-1 and CTLA-4 knock-in (KI) mouse models. The main advantage of these models is that human PD-1 or CTLA-4 proteins are expressed in the context of a fully functional immune system. To validate these models we evaluated the response to pembrolizumab or ipilimumab in a colorectal carcinoma and a glioblastoma preclinical tumor models.</p><p id="Par3695"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3696">We observed significant tumor growth inhibition and growth delay in the MC38 tumor model with either monotherapy, but not when treated with the murine counterparts: anti-PD-1 (clone RPM1-14) or CTLA-4 (clone 9H10). To extend our validation studies to other tumor models, we implanted GL261 glioblastoma orthotopically in the brain of PD-1 KI mice and achieved a significant increased life span in the group treated with pembrolizumab compared to both the control group and the group treated with murine anti-PD-1 antibody. Furthermore, we found that pembrolizumab and ipilimumab therapy results in enhanced effector functions of CD4+and CD8+ T cells associated with increased expression of Granzyme B.</p><p id="Par3697"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3698">In summary, the results shown here underscore the value of resourcing to humanized knock-in (KI) mouse models as tools to evaluate human specific immune-checkpoint based therapeutics alone and in combination with other agents.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1270"><title>P321 Real-world clinical outcomes among patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who initiated first-line regimens</title><sec id="Sec1271"><title>Eric Nadler, MD<sup>1</sup>, Bhakti Arondekar, PhD<sup>2</sup>, Kathleen Aguilar<sup>3</sup>, Jie Zhou<sup>3</sup>, Jane Chang<sup>2</sup>, Xinke Zhang<sup>4</sup>, Vivek Pawar<sup>4</sup></title><sec id="Sec1272"><title><sup>1</sup>Texas Oncology, Medical Oncology, Dallas, TX, United States; <sup>3</sup>Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, United States; <sup>4</sup>McKesson Life Sciences, The Woodlands, TX, United States; <sup>4</sup>EMD Serono, Inc., Billerica, MA, United States</title><sec id="Sec1273"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Eric Nadler (eric.nadler@USONCOLOGY.COM)</title><p id="Par3699"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par3700">While clinical trials have demonstrated the clinical benefit of immuno-oncology (IO) regimens for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (aNSCLC), either in combination or as monotherapies, limited research has evaluated clinical outcomes with these therapies in a real-world setting. This retrospective observational study evaluated time to treatment discontinuation (TTD) and overall survival (OS) in patients with aNSCLC receiving care in US community oncology clinics. Previous research suggests that TTD is a pragmatic real-world efficacy endpoint, as TTD and progression-free survival (PFS) are associated across different types of therapy in NSCLC clinical trials [1], therefore TTD was explored in this study.</p><p id="Par3701"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3702">Patients with aNSCLC who initiated first-line (1L) treatment with systemic chemotherapies, targeted therapies, or IO regimens in the US Oncology Network between 3/1/15 and 8/1/18 were included in the study population. Electronic health record data for these patients was captured through 2/1/19.

Of these, 51.8%, 50.3%, 21.7%, and 17.6%, respectively, proceeded to a subsequent treatment following 1L discontinuation. Median TTD ranged from 2.0 months (95% CI 1.9-2.1) in patients who received systemic chemotherapies to 3.5 months (95%CI: 2.8-4.2) in patients who received IO monotherapies (Figure 1). Similarly, median OS was longest in patients who received IO monotherapies (19.9 months [95%CI: 16.6-24.1]; Figure 2).</p><p id="Par3705"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3706">While heterogeneous patient characteristics may have influenced the results of this study, the trends observed suggest favorable outcomes in patients with aNSCLC treated with IO monotherapy in the 1L setting. Further research should explore whether this is related to a predominance of patients with high PD-L1 expression among those who received IO monotherapies. TTD for IO-based therapies in this real-world setting appears to be shorter than PFS reported in previous trials, indicating an unmet need may remain and needs to be explored. However, these results could be influenced by effects of informative censoring or other underlying clinical factors. Additionally, future studies should investigate differences in the tolerability profiles of 1L regimens, as well as how treatment sequences contribute to outcomes.</p><p id="Par3707"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par3708">This study was funded by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, as part of an alliance between Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany and Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA.</p><p id="Par3709"><bold>Reference</bold></p><p id="Par3710">1.

Engagement of TIGIT with its cognate ligand PVR directly suppresses lymphocyte activation. TIGIT and PVR are broadly expressed in different types of solid tumors, suggesting that TIGIT-PVR signaling may be a dominant immune escape mechanism for cancer. Utilizing COM902, a therapeutic antibody targeting TIGIT, we demonstrate that co-blockade of TIGIT and a new checkpoint inhibitor, PVRIG, augments T cell responses in vitro and in vivo.</p><p id="Par3718"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3719">Multi-color flow cytometry analysis of dissociated tumors was used to quantify TIGIT and PVRIG expression on TILs. Membranous PVR and PVRL2 expression was characterized by immunohistochemistry. The ability of COM902 to promote T cell responses in vitro, alone and in combination with an anti-PVRIG antibody, COM701, was evaluated in a primary TIL assay. To examine the in vivo effects of TIGIT blockade with COM902 a chimeric antibody with the constant region of mouse IgG1 was generated.

In dissociated tumor samples, TIGIT expression was highest on TILs in endometrial, head and neck, kidney and lung tumors, and directly correlated with PVRIG expression. Except for breast tumors, PVR was moderately to highly expressed in all tumor types examined, while PVRL2 expression was highest in prostate, ovarian, liver and endometrial tumors. Combination of COM902 and COM701 resulted in enhanced CD3+ TIL activity in vitro. Furthermore, the combination of chimeric COM902 and anti-PVRIG resulted in significant CT26 tumor growth inhibition and enhanced overall survival, which was comparable to the combination of chimeric COM902 and anti-PD-L1.</p><p id="Par3722"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3723">We describe the development of a very high affinity antagonistic TIGIT antibody, COM902, that is currently in preclinical development.

By inducing tumor cell death, conventional anti-cancer therapies induce extracellular release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is degraded by CD39 into adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and then by CD73 into adenosine, an inhibitor of immune response. Blockade of CD73-mediated degradation of AMP may therefore stimulate anti-tumor immunity across a wide range of tumors through preventing the production of adenosine. IPH5301 is a humanized effector-silent IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and inhibits the activity of both membrane-bound and soluble human CD73. IPH5301 is designed to enhance anti-tumor immune responses by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of CD73 in the tumor microenvironment, thus releasing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from adenosine-mediated suppression. Here, we described the expression of CD73 in several human solid tumors, characterized IPH5301 antibody properties and its efficacy in vitro.</p><p id="Par3726"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3727">CD73 expression was assessed by immunochemistry on cohorts of solid tumors i.e breast, ovarian, lung, melanoma, pancreatic and head and neck cancer. In vitro efficacy of IPH5301 was evaluated (1) in human T cell proliferation assays; and (2) in enzymatic assays with lymphocytes and serum from healthy donors and human CD73-knock-in (huCD73KI) mice. To get more insight into the mechanism of action of IPH5301, CD73-IPH5301 complex was analyzed using electron microscopy and the crystal structure of IPH5301 Fab in complex with CD73 ectodomain was determined.</p><p id="Par3728"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3729">Whereas inter-patient variability was observed in all tested indications, CD73 expression was always detected mainly on tumor cells and did not correlate with the expression of CD39 or PD-L1. In vitro IPH5301 efficiently restored T cell proliferation and blocked adenosine-mediated suppression of T cell proliferation in a mixed lymphocyte reaction in a dose-dependent manner. IPH5301 did not induce CD73 down-modulation and did not directly activate B cells. Furthermore, IPH5301 efficiently blocked CD73 enzymatic activity in human serum and whole blood as well as in serum and splenocytes from huCD73KI mice. Finally, we showed that IPH5301 contrains CD73 in an intermediate inactive form.</p><p id="Par3730"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3731">These results indicate that IPH5301 blocks CD73 with a differentiated mechanism of action compared to benchmarked anti-CD73 clinical candidates and support the clinical development of IPH5301 for cancer immunotherapy, potentially in combination with chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibitors.</p><p id="Par3732"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par3733">The research leading to CD73 results were obtained within the TumAdoR collaborative consortium that received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Program (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement n°602200.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1282"><title>Clinical Trial Completed</title><sec id="Sec1283"><title>P324 Pan-tumor analysis of the association of cancer and immune biology-related gene expression signatures with response to pembrolizumab monotherapy</title><sec id="Sec1284"><title>Razvan Cristescu, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Michael Nebozhyn, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Chunsheng Zhang, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Andrew Albright, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Julie Kobie, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Lingkang Huang<sup>1</sup>, Qing Zhao, MD PhD<sup>1</sup>, Anran Wang<sup>1</sup>, Hua Ma<sup>1</sup>, Andrea Webber<sup>1</sup>, Petar Jelinic<sup>1</sup>, Mohini Rajasagi<sup>1</sup>, Sandra Souza<sup>1</sup>, Raluca Predoiu<sup>1</sup>, Z.

These signatures (Angiogenesis, Hypoxia, Glycolysis, Proliferation, MYC, RAS, gMDSC, mMDSC, Stroma/EMT/TGFβ, WNT) were evaluated in the trial dataset blinded to clinical outcome, to test the association with ORR (RECIST 1.1; where response=PR or CR). Studies with available RNASeq data (N=1188) included: KN001/KN006-Melanoma (N=476; pembrolizumab-treated and ipilimumab-naïve), KN052-urothelial (N=186), KN012/KN055-HNSCC (N=147; HPV-negative by whole exome sequencing), KN086-TNBC (N=132), KN059-Gastric (N=92), and KN427-RCC (N=78), KN100-Ovarian (N=77). Pan-cancer logistic regression analysis of ORR for consensus signatures included terms adjusting for cancer type, ECOG performance status, and the T-cell inflamed GEP, an approach equivalent to evaluating association between ORR and the residuals of consensus signatures after detrending them for their relationship with the T-cell inflamed GEP and cancer type.

Beyond the positive association seen with T-cell inflamed GEP, three other RNA signatures, Angiogenesis, mMDSC and Stroma/EMT/TGFβ, exhibited negative associations at the 0.05 level after adjusting for multiple testing (Table 1).</p><p id="Par3740"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3741">Pan-cancer testing of exploratory gene expression signatures using the RNASeq platform in 1188 patients from single-arm pembrolizumab trials suggests that features beyond interferon gamma-related T-cell inflammation may be relevant to response to anti-PD1 monotherapy and may define other axes of tumor biology as rational candidates for pembrolizumab combinations. These features (Angiogenesis, mMDSC and Stroma/EMT/TGFβ) have been previously hypothesized to represent immune-suppressive axes with potential negative impact on immunotherapy efficacy. Future evaluation of the association of these signatures with response and survival outcomes in other cancer types and in randomized settings will provide additional insight into their prognostic or predictive character.</p><p id="Par3742"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par3743">Joanne E Tomassini for writing support and Sheila Erespe for editorial support, both employees of Merck &amp; Co., Inc.</p><p id="Par3744"><bold>Trial Registration</bold></p><p id="Par3745">NCT01295827, NCT01866319, NCT02335411; NCT02335424; NCT01848834; NCT02255097; NCT02447003; NCT02674061; NCT02853344</p><p id="Par3746"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3747">1.

Pembrolizumab 200 mg was given intravenously every 3 weeks. The primary objective was ORR. Patients were required to provide a tumor sample for retrospective analysis of biomarkers, which may predict response to pembrolizumab. PD-L1 expression was measured using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 PharmDx assay and evaluated using a combined positive score (CPS). CPS is the ratio of PD-L1–expressing cells (tumor cells, lymphocytes, macrophages) to viable tumor cells. Testing for a relationship between CPS and ORR (per RECIST v1.1 by central review) was conducted using logistic regression. Cutoff selection proceeded by joint evaluation of the ORR enrichment profile, the sensitivity and specificity profile (receiver operating characteristic analysis), the prevalence of patients with late-line esophageal cancer selected by the cutoff, and trends in overall survival (OS) by Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves.</p><p id="Par3792"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3793">There were 8 responders among 105 patients with available PD-L1 results at the time of interim analysis (March 1, 2017). CPS was statistically significantly associated (P=0.03) with probability of response. A cutoff of CPS 1 did not show enrichment of ORR, whereas higher cutoffs did (Table). CPS 10 showed &gt;3-fold enrichment in ORR above versus below the cutoff. Although higher cutoffs indicated further enrichment for ORR, attendant drops in sensitivity and prevalence occurred. Separation between KM OS curves for CPS ≥10 versus CPS</p><p id="Par3794"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3795">CPS was useful for identifying patients who responded to pembrolizumab monotherapy. Through the evaluation of several clinical utility dimensions, CPS 10 was chosen for further validation in the randomized setting based on its ability to enrich for ORR and simultaneously to preserve sensitivity. The preservation of sensitivity, along with prevalence, was considered particularly important because of the safety profile of pembrolizumab and the paucity of treatment options in this patient population.</p><p id="Par3796"><bold>Trial Registration</bold></p><p id="Par3797">ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02559687</p><p id="Par3798"><bold>Ethics Approval</bold></p><p id="Par3799">The study and the protocol were approved by the Institutional Review Board or ethics committee at each site.</p><p id="Par3800"><bold>Consent</bold></p><p id="Par3801">All patients provided written informed consent to participate in the clinical trial.</p><p id="Par3802"><table-wrap id="Tab26"><label>Table 1 (abstract P327).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>See text for description</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Tab26_HTML.png" id="MO143"/></table-wrap></p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1299"><title>P328 A phase IIB study of Pembrolizumab plus BL-8040 in metastatic pancreatic cancer: Clinical outcomes and biological correlates</title><sec id="Sec1300"><title>David Fogelman, MD<sup>1</sup>, Michael Overman, MD<sup>1</sup>, Robert Wolff<sup>1</sup>, Milind Javle, MD<sup>1</sup>, Shubham Pant, MBBS<sup>1</sup>, Gauri Varadhachary<sup>1</sup>, Rachna Shroff<sup>2</sup>, Ignacio Wistuba, MD<sup>1</sup>, Carmelia Barreto, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Renganayaki Pandurengan, MS<sup>1</sup>, Sandesh Subramanya, PhD<sup>3</sup>, Debora Ledesma, PhD<sup>3</sup>, Abi Vainstein-Haras, MD<sup>4</sup>, Ella Sorani, PhD<sup>4</sup>, Tzipora Lustig<sup>4</sup>, Osnat Kashtan<sup>4</sup>, Yosi Gozlan<sup>4</sup>, Steven Townson, PhD<sup>5</sup>, Jeanne Fahey, PhD<sup>6</sup>, James Yao, MD<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1301"><title><sup>1</sup>M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States; <sup>2</sup>University of Arizona, Tuscon, AZ, United States; <sup>3</sup>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States; <sup>4</sup>Bioline Rx, Modi'in, Israel; <sup>5</sup>Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Shoreline, WA, United States; <sup>6</sup>Merck &amp; Co., Inc, Boston, MA, United States</title><sec id="Sec1302"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> David Fogelman (dfogelman@mdanderson.org)</title><p id="Par3803"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par3804">BL-8040 (BL), a CXCR4 antagonist, increases T cell entry into the bloodstream and thereafter into tumor in humans.

Baseline characteristics: median age 66, 10M/10F, median 2 prior lines of therapy (range 1-3). Best overall response includes 1 PR, 2 SD, 12 PD yielding 21.4% disease control (1PR+2SD). Median TTP was 2 months overall and 7 months for the PR/SD pts. Median OS was 7 months overall and 12 months in PR/SD pts. The combination was well tolerated with most AEs being injection site discomfort. Five patients experienced grade 3/4 toxicities. Grade 3 toxicities included HTN (n = 1), Alk Phos (n = 1), N/V (n = 2), ascites (n = 1), dyspnea (n = 1), and abd pain (n = 2). One pt had grade 4 dyspnea. Paired biopsies have been analyzed for six patients (1 PR 2 SD 3 PD). Patients with PR/SD had, at baseline, trends towards greater T cell, especially cytotoxic CD8+ T cell counts within the tumor niche than patients with PD (T cells: 188-627 cells/mm2 vs 7-41 cells/mm2, Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells: 18-137 cells/mm2 vs 0-2 cells/mm2).

Multiple analysis of vaccine-induced immune responses in blood and tumor were performed. Both immune response and clinical benefit were predicted using the autologous HLA-genotype determined from patient’s saliva sample.</p><p id="Par3819"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3820">The vaccine was well tolerated; most common side effects were transient skin reactions and flu-like syndrome. No vaccine-related SAE occurred. 90% of patients had vaccine-specific CD8+ T-cell responses of memory-effector type against at least 2 of the 7 vaccine antigens, 5 on average. Vaccine specific CD4+ T-cell responses were detected in all patients. Ex vivo CD8+ T cell responses of effector type were detected in 71% of patients, as well as increased fractions of CRC-reactive, polyfunctional, circulating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in patient’s PBMC after vaccination. Among the 11 patients 3 patients had objective tumor response according to RECIST v1.1, one of them received a single dose and 2 of them received 3 doses. For the Part B of the study, the Objective Response Rate (ORR) was 33% (2/6) and the Disease Control Rate (DCR) was 67% (4/6). Notably, one patient experienced complete tumor shrinkage on 2 of 3 target lesions and partial response on 1 lesion after 25 weeks of treatment, qualifying for curative surgery. Median duration of disease control was 9 months (95%CI 6.3-11.5) (mPFS not reached during the study). The 10 month PFS was 50% (3/6). Predicted vaccine antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses were confirmed in vitro with a PPV of 79% (p=0.01).

A numerical increase in pCR rate was observed with ED (46.1% v 40.9%), but the difference was not statistically significant. B-52 provided the opportunity to explore potential predictive markers of pCR to possibly guide new treatment strategies. We examined the tumor immune microenvironment (TME) of B-52 baseline biopsy tumors to determine its association with pCR.</p><p id="Par3895"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3896">Pretreatment (N=238) biopsies were assessed for CD8, FOXP3, CD68, PD-L1, and PD-1, with multiplex fluorescent immunohistochemistry (mf-IHC) utilizing the Vectra® Quantitative Pathology Imaging System and inForm® Advanced Image Analysis software. Tumor and stromal regions were defined with a panCK antibody (included in the same multiplex) and annotated by a pathologist. Digital quantitation of all markers was assessed in the tumor and stromal regions (defined by panCK). In our pre-specified, CTEP-approved analysis, we tested the association of PD-L1 in tumor+stroma with a cut-point optimized by ROC curves (Table1). In exploratory analyses, we also tested a clinically meaningful PD-L1 cut-point of &gt;1%; other markers were tested for associations with pCR using chi-square tests and a median cut-off (Table 1).</p><p id="Par3897"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3898">Based on our pre-specified analysis, total PD-L1 (assessed in both stroma+tumor) was positively associated with pCR across trial arms (45% v 30%, p=0.038). PD-L1 was not significantly associated with pCR with a clinically utilized cut-off of &gt;1% within the stromal-immune cell compartment (CD8+FOXP3+CD68). Surprisingly, in both stromal and tumor cell compartments, CD68 was positively associated with pCR when the two arms are evaluated together. When the treatment arms are examined separately, CD68 in the stromal compartment correlates positively with pCR. FOXP3 was also positively correlated with pCR in the stromal cell compartment across arms and in the TCHP+ED arm. PD-1 and CD8 were not significantly associated with pCR.</p><p id="Par3899"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3900">B-52 showed a positive association of PD-L1 expression with pCR based on our pre-specified analysis but the extremely low cut-off (0.05%) makes the clinical utility of this observation doubtful.

Implementation of more frequent echocardiogram monitoring and incorporation of BNP and troponin into daily laboratory panel may help to identify those at highest risk of severe cardiac dysfunction at an earlier time point, allowing for earlier intervention in CRS to potentially limit acute cardiac toxicity.</p><p id="Par3916"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par3917">This research was supported by the Intramural Research Programs of the Center of Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH and the Clinical Center.</p><p id="Par3918"><bold>Trial Registration</bold></p><p id="Par3919">The clinical trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov NCT01593696</p><p id="Par3920"><bold>Ethics Approval</bold></p><p id="Par3921">This study was approved by the National Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board.</p><p id="Par3922"><fig id="Fig118"><label>Fig. 1 (abstract P336).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Change in Ejection Fraction Post CRS Onset</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig118_HTML.png" id="MO145"/></fig></p><p id="Par3923"><fig id="Fig119"><label>Fig. 2 (abstract P336).</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Changes in BNP pre and post-CAR infusion</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40425_2019_763_Fig119_HTML.png" id="MO146"/></fig></p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1335"><title>P337 Survival prolongation by dendritic cell vaccination in combination with OK-432, gemcitabine and/or S-1 in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer</title><sec id="Sec1336"><title>Masahiro Ogasawara, MD, PhD, Shuichi Ota, MD PhD</title><sec id="Sec1337"><title>Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Sapporo, Japan</title><sec id="Sec1338"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Masahiro Ogasawara (ogasawara@hokuyu-aoth.org)</title><p id="Par3924"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par3925">Pancreatic cancer is the most fatal human cancer, with a 5-year overall survival rate of less than 5%.

Tedopi is composed by 2 wild type and 7 chemically modified peptides to increase HLA-A2 or T cell receptor (TCR) affinity. A pan-DR epitope (PADRE) of helper T-lymphocyte (HTL) has been added to increase the Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte (CTL) responses. In previously treated advanced NSCLC patients, Tedopi showed a strong CTL immune response, which correlated with overall survival (OS) [1]. The aim of the current translational study was to explore the predictive effect of the epitope type and number of epitopes on OS.</p><p id="Par3951"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3952">Out of 64 previously treated HLA2+ advanced NSCLC patients enrolled in a phase II trial testing the efficacy of Tedopi (1mL subcutaneously Q3W for 6 cycles, then Q8W for the reminder year 1 and Q12W up to year 2), 33 patients were assessed for epitope-specific cytotoxic response and HTL responses using an interferon gamma enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Leukapheresis was performed at baseline, at week 9, 18 and 30 for immunogenicity assays. Predictive analyses of OS were performed using Cox regression.</p><p id="Par3953"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3954">Patients were stage IV (64%), or locally advanced stage IIIb (36%). Eleven patients were assessed for all 10 epitopes, and 33 for 6 selected epitopes (2 CEA, 1 HER-2, MAGE2, MAGE3, PADRE). Median survival was 30 months.</p><p id="Par3955">There was at least one CTL response to one vaccine epitope in &gt;90% of patients. Eight epitopes were highly immunogenic (from 55% to 91%), while HER-2 wild type and one p53 analogue shown a lower response (respectively 36% and 9%).</p><p id="Par3956">In patients evaluated for 6 selected epitopes, the best cut-off of number of CTL responses to discriminate OS were 1-6 versus 0, 2-6 vs 0-1 or 3-6 vs 0-2. All of three were statistically significant. As an example, patients with CTL responses to 3-6 epitopes (n=23) had a median OS of 38 months compared to 15 months in patients (n=10) with CTL responses to 0-2 epitopes (HR=0.39; p=0.04) (Figure 1).

Deep learning approaches have recently enabled the computer-based replication of this visual TC score [2,3] and of its ability to predict overall survival (OS) [4]. Because these methods try to reproduce as close as possible the visual scoring methodology, they are built on extensive prior hypotheses (e.g. definition of cell positivity, score and cut-off) and do not enable the data-driven discovery of novel stratification rules. We present here a novel region-focused end-to-end deep-learning approach that enables the data-driven generation of survival risk heatmaps and the stratification of patients into two risk groups.</p><p id="Par3970"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3971">On a subset (N=151) of core needle biopsies and tissue resections from the NCT01693562 clinical trial (NSCLC), epithelium regions are automatically segmented within the manually delineated tumor area [3]. A patch-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on selected patches in a two-fold pre-validation procedure to maximize a log partial likelihood derived from the Cox proportional hazards model [5,6]. To avoid a disproportionately large number of patches from tissue resections, a random subset of up to 10K patches is selected for each patient within the segmented regions. The overall survival risk is predicted and aggregated by mean on the detected epithelium regions only. Patients are finally stratified based on the cohort median of the resulting aggregated risk scores. For baseline comparison, the same steps are repeated considering the complete delineated tumor area instead of the sole segmented epithelium regions.</p><p id="Par3972"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par3973">The proposed epithelium-focused and data-driven survival CNN yields similar patient stratification (HR=0.525, p=0.003) as obtained with 25% cut-off on visual (HR=0.574, p=0.01) or automated (HR =0.539, p=0.004) TC score (Figure 1), while releasing prior hypotheses on PD-L1 region positivity, score methodology, and cut-off value. As expected on durvalumab-treated patients, high and low risks are associated with low and high PD-L1 staining respectively. No relevant risk groups are identified if the analysis is performed on the full tumor area instead.</p><p id="Par3974"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3975">Our results suggest, for the first time on core needle biopsies and tissue resections, (i) the ability of end-to-end deep survival learning to directly learn relevant patient stratification as well as (ii) the necessity, in case of small patient cohorts, to restrict the analysis to automatically detected meaningful regions.</p><p id="Par3976"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par3977">1.

Persistent immune suppression prevents the development of a robust T cell response to tumor specific antigens that is required for effective downstream immune checkpoint blockade. An underappreciated but significant contributor to immune suppression in tumors is the exposure of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of tumor cells and tumor-derived microvesicles. PS is recognized by receptors on immune cells where it triggers the secretion of immune suppressive cytokines, prevents the differentiation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and inhibits dendritic cell (DC) maturation; events that prevent a productive anti-tumor T cell response. Bavituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets PS and inhibits PS-mediated immunosuppressive signaling, drives immune activation by reducing the levels of MDSCs, by polarizing tumor-associated macrophages towards an immune stimulatory phenotype and by promoting the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs). Bavituximab and other PS-targeting mAbs (2aG4 and 1N11) bind to PS via beta-2 glycoprotein 1 (β2GP1). β2GP1, an abundant serum glycoprotein, was recently identified as a novel component of innate immunity via activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs).</p><p id="Par3988"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par3989">Human β2GP1.

However, interaction of β2GP1 with LPS can induce an open conformation of the protein that allows interaction of β2GP1 with PS and cell surface receptors, including the TLRs. We found through circular dichroism and transmission electron microscopy that the PS-targeting antibodies also induce conformational changes in β2GP1, shifting it to an open conformation. In addition, we demonstrate that PS-targeting mAb-mediated dimerization of β2GP1 stimulated pro-inflammatory polarization of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and induced TLR2 signaling. Finally, we investigated the expression of a newly characterized TLR-induced transcription factor, Spi-C in bone marrow progenitor cells after stimulation with TLR specific agonists or PS-targeting mAbs +/- β2GP1.</p><p id="Par3992"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par3993">These studies demonstrate that the PS-targeting mAbs stimulate Spi-C expression in a β2GP1-dependent manner. Overall these data support that one mechanism of innate immune activation induced by PS-targeting mAbs is through TLR2 stimulation on myeloid cells. Future studies are focused on validating these results in vivo using Tlr-deficient and β2gp1-deficient mice.</p><p id="Par3994"><bold>Trial Registration</bold></p><p id="Par3995">NCT01999673, NCT03139916, NCT03519997</p><p id="Par3996"><bold>Ethics Approval</bold></p><p id="Par3997">All animal experiments were done according to the Animal Research Center (ARC) at UT Southwestern Medical Center.

The primary endpoint was objective response per RECIST v1.1 excluding irradiated lesions with planned interim analysis. Correlative analyses were performed on tissue obtained following progression on prior PD-(L)1 inhibitors using PD-L1 immunohistochemistry and multiplex immunofluorescence (IF) evaluating CD8, CD4, PD1, Ki67, and cytokeratin in tandem.</p><p id="Par4031"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4032">We randomized 78 patients (26 per each of 3 arms) who received &gt;=1 cycle of study therapy between August 2017 and March 2019 across 18 sites. Patients received PD-(L)1 inhibitors for a median of 1 cycles (range 1-5) prior to enrollment; 68% had prior radiation. Treatment related adverse events (TRAE) of any grade were observed in 53 subjects (68%), and grade ≥3 events in 18 subjects (23%), including 1 grade 5 respiratory failure. Response rate across all cohorts were 10% (n=8, 95% exact CI: 5%-19%), and disease control 19% (n=15, 95% exact CI: 11-30%). Median duration of response was 10.3 months (95% CI: 1.4 months – not reached). Response and disease control weren’t significantly different between arms (Table 1, p=0.99/0.52, respectively), nor was time to progression (p=0.88, overall mTTP 3.3mos), or overall survival (p=0.40, overall mOS 11.4 mos); therefore, the study closed to enrollment at interim analysis. PD-L1 expression was not associated with response (p=0.52).

Multiplex IF suggests tumor infiltration by Ki-67+/PD-1+ CD4 T cells is associated with response and worthy of further investigation.

Preliminary efficacy from a cohort of NSCLC patients who received prior immune checkpoint therapy was previously presented (SITC-2017); baseline tumor samples were collected to assess mechanisms of resistance to prior therapy.

Preclinical models indicated that Toca 511 and 5-FC treatment kills dividing cancer and nearby immunosuppressive cells, leading to T-cell priming and antitumor immune activity [1]. A Phase 3 trial of Toca 511 &amp; Toca FC (extended-release 5-FC) for treatment of recurrent high grade glioma is ongoing, following Phase 1 observations of prolonged survival and durable complete responses in some patients [2].</p><p id="Par4069"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4070">This Phase 1b, single-arm, multicenter study (Toca 6) was designed to investigate immunological changes following Toca 511 &amp; Toca FC treatment in patients with advanced solid tumors.

Following treatment with Toca FC, some patients showed marked changes in tumor infiltrating immune populations assessed by IHC, including decreases in CD11b+ myeloid cells, Tregs, and exhausted T-cells, and increases in CD8+ T-cells. In addition, IV Toca 511 led to viral expression in tumor, which was decreased post-Toca FC. Treatment has been generally well tolerated, with no related Grade 4 adverse events.

In phase 1 and 1b expansion studies in patients with advanced solid tumors, bintrafusp alfa showed early evidence of clinical activity. Bintrafusp alfa is a particularly rational combination partner for radiation therapy (RT) because RT induces expression of TGF-β, which can promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), fibrosis, and metastasis, and the expression of PD-L1. Furthermore, the induction of abscopal effects requires the combination of RT with immunotherapy in mouse models, and abscopal responses have been reported in patients receiving RT in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor.</p><p id="Par4102"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4103">The combination of bintrafusp alfa and RT was compared with bintrafusp alfa monotherapy or RT alone in MC38 colorectal carcinoma, GL261-luc2 glioma, and 4T1 breast cancer murine models. Antitumor activity was evaluated via tumor growth, survival, and lung metastases. Enzyme-linked immune absorbent spot (ELISpot) and immunohistochemistry were used to measure the function and infiltration of CD8+ T cells and the quantity of α-SMA, a marker of cancer-associated fibroblasts. Gene expression signature scores of different pathways were calculated from targeted RNAseq analysis.</p><p id="Par4104"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4105">The combination therapy enhanced antitumor activity in all three murine models, increased tumor-specific and tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the MC38 and 4T1 models, respectively, and potentiated an abscopal effect in secondary MC38 tumors. In the 4T1 model, combination therapy decreased lung metastases vs either monotherapy and decreased the expression of EMT and VEGF pathway gene signatures vs RT. Expression of α-SMA significantly decreased with bintrafusp alfa monotherapy in this model, whereas it significantly increased with RT monotherapy. However, the combination with bintrafusp alfa was able to reduce α-SMA expression vs RT, suggesting that bintrafusp alfa can reduce RT-induced fibrosis, presumably via TGF-β blockade.</p><p id="Par4106"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4107">Collectively, these preclinical findings support the clinical development of bintrafusp alfa and RT combination therapy and support the rationale for a clinical trial investigating bintrafusp alfa in combination with chemoradiation (CRT) in stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; NCT03840902).

The most evident difference in responders before therapy was an enhanced frequency of CD14+ CD16+HLA-DRhi classical monocytes. We validated our results using conventional flow and found a clear correlation of enhanced monocyte frequencies before therapy initiation with clinical response such as lower hazard and extended progression-free and overall survival. In a second study, we used CyTOF to monitor immune response in 21 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients that initially responded and then progressed under anti-PD-1 to a novel combination immunotherapy of anti-PD-1 plus an IL-15 super-agonist (ALT-803).

Ongoing phase 1 and 2 trials are evaluating GSK3377794 in solid tumors and multiple myeloma. Study NCT01343043 (208466) is a phase 1 clinical trial assessing GSK3377794 in patients with previously treated, advanced metastatic synovial sarcoma (SS), stratified into 4 cohorts (Table 1). Of 12 patients receiving GSK3377794 infusion in Cohort 1, responses were observed in 6 patients (1 complete response [CR]/5 partial responses [PR]), with an overall response rate (ORR) of 50% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21–0.79). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 15.2 weeks (95% CI: 7.6–37.9); median duration of response (DoR) was 30.9 weeks (95% CI: 14–72). As of October 15, 2018, median overall survival (OS) was 105 weeks (95% CI: 37–NA).

Treatment response (RECIST v1.1), safety (CTCAE v4.0), and GSK3377794 persistence in transduced PBMCs (transgene vector copies measured by qPCR) were assessed. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the interval between first infusion and first documented disease progression or death. Safety was monitored throughout.

Median peak (range) persistence of ~64,712 DNA copies/μg (13,364–197,546) occurred in Cohort 2 first week post-infusion versus ~16,468 DNA copies/μg (163–131,175) in Cohort 4. No significant correlation was observed between peak persistence and best overall response in either cohort (p&gt;0.05).

All patients were treated with durvalumab/tremelimumab every 4 weeks for four cycles and then continued durvalumab every 4 weeks for up to 1 year. Biopsies were collected prior to-and- during treatment (Wk6). Malignant cells (MCs) PD-L1+ was studied by immunohistochemistry. Tumor-infiltrating-lymphocytes (TILs), and macrophages were interrogated by multiplex immunofluorescence, Figure-1. The combination of three T-cell phenotypes (CD3+,CD3+CD8+ and CD3+CD8+GZB+) greater than the median density as higher TILs (TILs+) was used to define “inflamed” tumors and ≤ than the median of 1 or 2 of these as lowest TILs (TILs–) to define “non-inflamed” tumors, through baseline to Wk6.

We categorized as inflamed tumor 1 LPS, 1 AS, 1 LMS, 1 OS, and 5 ASPS at baseline. Interestingly 1 AS, 1 OS, 1 CS, 1ASPS, 1 SS and 2 OT defined as non-inflamed tumors at baseline changed to inflamed tumors at Wk6 (Figure-2) and from those, OS and ASPS showed SD and PR, respectively. Finally, 4/17 inflamed tumors showed SD and 3/17 PR. Furthermore, CD3+CD8+CD45Ro+ increase in the inflamed tumors at Wk6 than non-inflamed tumors (P=0.005). The most frequent TME pattern detected at baseline and Wk6 was the immunological ignorance (TILs-PD-L1-, 61% and 47%, respectively).

Patients who received checkpoint blockade treatment prior to DC vaccination had higher baseline MAA-specific CD8+ T cell responses, yet they did not respond more strongly to the vaccine. Two patients who received checkpoint blockade post-DC vaccine showed very strong amplification of their MAA-specific T cells. Molecular profiling in circulating lymphocytes and tumor biopsies showed that elevated PD-1 and CTLA-4 protein levels and gene expression signatures representing checkpoint signaling, interferon response and T-cell exhaustion were associated with unfavorable clinical outcome. Gene signatures showing positive correlation with PD-1 protein expression included CD28-dependent PI3K-AKT signaling, the IL12/STAT4 pathway and pan-semaphorin receptor interactions. CTLA-4 protein levels correlated with type I interferon response and NOTCH signaling genes. Interestingly, B cell receptor pathways negatively correlated with PD-1 expression, while gene signatures downstream of T cell receptor activation and IL-2 signaling were negatively correlated with CTLA-4 expression. Serum levels of PD-1 and PD-L2 were inversely correlated and post-vaccine serum levels PD-L2 correlated with decreased circulating Treg and favorable outcome in patients, suggesting that it may serve as a biomarker of clinical response.</p><p id="Par4259"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4260">Collectively, our study shows that specific checkpoint molecular pathways are critical for vaccine outcomes and for the activation of anti-tumor responses in melanoma patients.

However, there is no consensus on optimal vaccine adjuvants to support T cell responses to peptide vaccines. We hypothesized that toll-like receptor (TLR)3 agonist polyICLC and/or low-dose metronomic cyclophosphamide (mCy) would be safe and would support strong and durable CD4+ T cell responses in combination with an incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA).</p><p id="Par4313"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4314">An adaptive design based upon toxicity and durable immune response (dRsp) was used to assign participants with resected stage IIA-IV melanoma to one of four study regimens, including a vaccine comprising 6 melanoma peptides restricted by Class II MHC (6MHP), administered in an emulsion with IFA (Montanide ISA-51), with or without the TLR3 agonist polyICLC and with or without systemic mCy. Toxicities were recorded (CTCAE v4). T cell responses were measured in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and in vaccine-site draining lymph node (sentinel immunized node, SIN) with IFNγ ELIspot assay ex vivo. Serum antibody responses to 6MHP were measured by ELISA, and changes in circulating regulatory T cells were assessed by flow cytometry.</p><p id="Par4315"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4316">Forty-eight eligible patients were enrolled and treated. Following an adaptive design, early safety data and T cell response data favored enrollment on arm D. At study conclusion, total enrollment was 3, 7, 6, and 32 individuals for arms A-D, respectively. Treatment-related dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed in 1/7 (14%) patients on arm B and 2/32 (6%) on arm D, with no treatment arm exceeding the DLT 25% threshold for early stopping. Strong and durable T cell responses to 6MHP were detected ex vivo in 0%, 29%, 50%, and 50% of patients enrolled on arms A-D, respectively (Table 1). IgG antibody responses were also induced and were greatest for arms C and D (Figure 1). Circulating regulatory T cell frequencies were not altered by use of mCy.</p><p id="Par4317"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4318">Combination vaccine adjuvants with IFA, polyICLC, and mCy were well-tolerated. The dRsp rate for arm D (IFA + polyICLC + mCy) of 50% (90% CI: [34,66]) exceeded the 18% dRsp rate (90% CI: [11,26]) from prior experience with 6MHP in IFA alone. The regimen with IFA + pICLC alone also showed promise for enhancing T cell and antibody responses. Addition of mCy does not alter circulating T reg frequencies but shows some promise as a systemic vaccine adjuvant.</p><p id="Par4319"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par4320">We thank the Cancer Research Institute/ Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research for providing the polyICLC used in the vaccines.

It can enhance immunity to cancer-testis antigen NY-ESO-1. Vaccines with NY-ESO-1 protein or NY-ESO-1 overlapping long peptides (OLP4) have enhanced immunity when administered with Montanide ISA-51 (Montanide) and/or Poly-ICLC (pICLC) adjuvants. This trial assessed safety, immunogenicity, clinical responses (irRC), and effects of IPI + NY-ESO-1 vaccines on the tumor microenvironment (TME).</p><p id="Par4329"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4330">This Phase 1, open-label study enrolled patients among 3 arms: IPI (3 mg/kg i.v. q3 wks x 4) + NY-ESO-1 protein + pICLC + Montanide (Arm A); IPI + NY-ESO-1 OLP4 + pICLC + Montanide (Arm B); and IPI + NY-ESO-1 OLP4 + pICLC (Arm C). Patients had measurable NY-ESO-1+ tumors. Treatments were administered days 1, 22, 43, 64. Circulating T cell responses were assessed by ex vivo IFN-gamma ELIspot assay. Circulating antibody (Ab) responses to overlapping NY-ESO-1 peptides were detected by ELISA. Tumor biopsies obtained pre-treatment and day 85 were evaluated for immune infiltrates by multispectral immunofluorescence histology.</p><p id="Par4331"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4332">Target enrollment was 27; study closed early for slow enrollment. Eight patients enrolled and were treated (Table 1). All had ≥ 1 treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE); most common (≥50%): rash, fatigue, injection site reaction, pruritus, and diarrhea. Two patients had Gr3 TEAEs related to IPI but not to vaccine. There were no DLTs. Best responses: SD (n=4); PD (n=4). T cell responses to NY-ESO-1 were detected in 6 of 8 (75%) patients.[1] Both patients without T cell response had PD as best response. Ab responses were detected in 7/8 (88%) patients (Table 1). The patient without Ab response had PD as best response. The breadth of Ab responses to NY-ESO-1 was greater for patients with SD than those with PD (p = 0.02). Evaluation of TME of 5 patients revealed increases in proliferating (Ki67+) CD8 T cells, decreases in RORγt+ CD4+ T cells (Figure 1). Interestingly, there were increases in density of CD8+ and CD4+ cells for those with SD (n=3), but decreases for those with PD (n=2, not shown).</p><p id="Par4333"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4334">T cell responses and Ab responses to NY-ESO-1 were induced in most patients and were evident ex vivo, suggesting that IPI may have enhanced the T cell responses to NY-ESO-1 protein and OLP4. Integrated T cell and antibody responses were associated with tumor control. Preliminary data of the TME suggests increased activating and proliferating T cells after vaccination plus IPI, especially in patients with tumor control.</p><p id="Par4335"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par4336">The trial was supported by the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, the Cancer Research Institute, and by the National Institutes of Health, including support from the University of Virginia Cancer Center Support Grant (NIH/NCI P30 CA44579:, Clinical Trials Office, Biorepository and Tissue Procurement Facility, Flow Cytometry Core, and Biomolecular Core Facility).</p><p id="Par4337">Earlier presentation of results of this clinical trial [1] has been expanded in the present abstract with additional biologic correlates.</p><p id="Par4338"><bold>Trial Registration</bold></p><p id="Par4339">This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01810016).</p><p id="Par4340"><bold>Reference</bold></p><p id="Par4341">1.

Part B1 of MAVIS (Melanoma Antigen Vaccine Immunotherapy Study, a three part, Phase III clinical program), was a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of seviprotimut-L, with the primary endpoint of relapse-free survival (RFS) in patients at high risk of recurrence after definitive surgical resection.</p><p id="Par4348"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4349">For MAVIS Part B1, patients with AJCC v7 stage IIB-III cutaneous melanoma, after surgical resection, age 18-75, ECOG PS 0-1, were randomized 2:1 to seviprotimut-L 40 mcg or placebo, administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks x 5, then monthly x 4, then every 3 months to month 24. Patients were stratified by stage (IIB/C, IIIA, IIIB/C). Target enrollment was 325.

A few T-cell Receptor T-cells (TCR-T) have been investigated in solid tumors. To our knowledge, there is only one published study and one case report using MHC Class II restricted TCRs targeting MAGE-A3 and NY-ESO-1, respectively [1,2].</p><p id="Par4367"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4368">ZI-H04 represents a novel approach of TCR based therapies. Autologous T-cells from patients are genetically modified by lentiviral transduction to express the TCR targeting hTERT in the context of the MHC Class II allele, HLA-DPB1*04:01. The TCR was isolated from a pancreatic cancer patient who experienced clinical benefit following a peptide-based cancer vaccination against hTERT [3]. The TCR clone responded to autologous tumor and preclinical data demonstrate that ZI-H04 exhibits high sensitivity to hTERT peptide as well as recognition of processed antigen. Furthermore, specificity analysis supports the safety of the TCR-T. The restricted combined expression of hTERT plus HLA class II on normal cells limits the potential for on-target off tumor toxicity. A first-in-human study is designed to treat patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors lacking an option of further treatments. Patients must be tested positive for HLA-DPB1*04:01 and the tumors must express hTERT. Adequate organ function and lab parameters are required. CNS involvement, autoimmune diseases, infections and immunosuppressive medication are main exclusion criteria. Primary objectives are safety and tolerability. Part 1 of the study, starting in 2020, will be a dose finding part, Part 2 a dose extension part with 5 cohorts. Prior to adoptive cell infusion patients will receive a low dose conditioning regimen consisting of 2 x 600 mg/m² cyclophosphamide followed by 3 x 25 mg/m² fludarabine. Patients will be observed for safety, efficacy and exploratory biomarkers.</p><p id="Par4369"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4370">ZI-H04 is a novel TCR-T with potentially favourable characteristics. The TCR was isolated from an hTERT vaccinated pancreatic cancer patient that experienced clinical benefit. A lower probability of off-target activity is expected since no engineering was done to the TCR. The MHC Class II restriction provides the possibility to induce a multi-pronged immune response including antigen spreading as demonstrated in a case report using an MHC Class II TCR-T in melanoma [2]. More than 50% of patients are HLA-DPB1*04:01 positive and the expression rate of hTERT is &gt;80% in many tumors. Therefore, a substantial population may benefit from ZI-H04 treatment.</p><p id="Par4371"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par4372">1. Lu Y-C, Parker LL, Lu T, et al.

To date, 9 patients have received treatment (median age, 38 yrs; range, 25-58 yrs; 2 men and 7 women; breast cancer, 3; sarcoma, 3; ovarian cancer, 1; nasopharyngeal, 1; anal carcinoma, 1; median time from diagnosis 4 years, range, 2-18 years; median number of prior therapies 6, range 3-12). Very high ACTolog cell doses could be administered. Patients received a median of 2 target-specific ACTolog products (range 1-3). Treatment was overall well tolerated. The most common adverse events were cytopenias and cytokine release syndrome. All patients are alive to date. At 6 weeks, restaging imaging studies demonstrated stable disease in all patients. One patient with squamous cell carcinoma of the anus treated with T cells directed to COL6A3, exon 6, and PRAME had 26% decrease in tumor measurements at week 6 associated with high T-cell frequencies at 2 weeks but her disease subsequently progressed. Another patient with nasopharyngeal cancer treated with COL6A3 tumor stroma-specific T cells had resolution of tumor associated pain and has not required further treatment for 11 months. A recent tumor biopsy demonstrated necrotic cells and no tumor cells could be identified.</p><p id="Par4381"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4382">ACTolog IMA101 is well-tolerated and no safety issues have been noted to date.

Immunomodulation via checkpoint inhibition has provided encouraging results in non-CNS malignancies, but prediction of responders has proven to be challenging in glioblastoma patients. OBJECTIVES: To determine the proportion of patients who have a measurable increase of interferon gamma levels in brain tumor tissue after their first dose of nivolumab; to evaluate the safety of using brain tumor microdialysis to monitor for immune response; to evaluate the safety of the combination of anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) and anti-lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG-3) checkpoint inhibition in recurrent glioblastoma patients.</p><p id="Par4407"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4408">The study design is a single-center, nonrandomized phase 1 clinical trial. Up to 20 adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma will be enrolled with the goal of 10 patients completing the trial over an anticipated 18 months. Patients will undergo biopsy; placement of microdialysis catheters and lumbar drains; treatment with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibition; comprehensive immune biomarker collection; tumor resection; and then treatment with anti-PD-1 and anti-LAG-3 checkpoint inhibition until progression (Figure 1). Three patients have undergone all study procedures (Figures 2 and 3). There have been no serious adverse events related to the research surgical procedure, nor during the microdialysis portion of the trial. Enrollment is ongoing.</p><p id="Par4409">EXPECTED OUTCOMES: We expect interferon gamma levels to increase in the brain as measured via microdialysis in treated patients. Based on published reports, microdialysis in this patient population is expected to be safe, and anti-LAG-3 and anti-PD-1 combined will likely have a similar side effect profile to other checkpoint inhibitor combinations.</p><p id="Par4410">The failure of recent trials of immune therapies in glioblastoma underscores the need to appropriately measure response in the treated tissue.

Clinical studies have demonstrated that IV delivered pelareorep can replicate in tumor tissue and promote an inflamed tumor phenotype characterized the recruitment of CD8+ T cells and upregulation of PD-L1 [1]. Consistent with pelareorep’s role in promoting adaptive anti-tumor immunity, a randomized phase 2 study in metastatic breast cancer demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in overall survival when pelareorep was combined with paclitaxel [2]. We hypothesize that pelareorep mediated anti-tumor immune responses, such as those mediated by T cells, represent a novel strategy for the control or elimination of tumor cells in breast cancer. Specifically, in the preoperative setting for early breast cancer, we examined if pelareorep in combination with anti-PD-L1 therapy, atezolizumab, and other breast cancer therapies offers clinical benefit in terms of CeLTIL score, a metric for quantifying tumor cellularity (Cel) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) [3].</p><p id="Par4437"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4438">This exploratory, non-randomized, window of opportunity study, will evaluate the safety and effect of pelareorep ± atezolizumab on the tumor microenvironment in 38 women with early breast cancer. Patients will receive study treatment for ~21 days prior to definitive surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Five cohorts will be examined (Figure 1): Cohort 1: HR+/HER2-neg (10 patients), pelareorep + letrozole. Cohort 2: HR+/HER2-neg (10 patients): pelareorep + letrozole + atezolizumab. Cohort 3: TNBC (6 patients): pelareorep + atezolizumab. Cohort 4: HER2+/HR+ (6 patients): pelareorep + trastuzumab + atezolizumab. Cohort 5: HER2+/HR- (6 patients): pelareorep + trastuzumab + atezolizumab. CelTIL, viral replication, and other immune-based biomarkers will be used to examine treatment-related changes within the tumor microenvironment. Blood and tumor tissue biopsies will be collected at screening, Day 3 (after pelareorep but before atezolizumab), and at surgery (Day ~21).</p><p id="Par4439"><bold>Trial Registration</bold></p><p id="Par4440">Spanish clinical studies registry: 2018-003345-42</p><p id="Par4441"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par4442">1.

Recently, TECENTRIQ and Abraxane were approved for the treatment of PD-L1+ unresectable locally advanced or mTNBC suggesting a role for immunotherapy in the treatment of this disease. Growing evidence suggests that chemotherapeutic agents and immunotherapies synergize in patients. Cancer vaccines are also a promising option for TNBC due to the discovery of neo-antigens and tumor associated antigens that mobilize anti-tumor T cells.</p><p id="Par4450"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4451">Here, we characterize T cell receptor repertoires in patients enrolled in a Phase Ib/2 clinical trial (NCT03387085) following treatment by a regimen intended to induce a synchronized, multi-compartment, anti-tumor immune response by mitigating the immune-suppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment and activating immunogenic tumor cell death. The trial combined metronomic low-dose chemotherapy, SBRT, an allogeneic NK cell line expressing high affinity CD16, yeast and adenoviral tumor-associated antigen vaccines, an IL15RαFc super-agonist, checkpoint inhibition, and an anti-angiogenic agent in a manner predicted to maximize cytotoxic T-cell mediated immunological recognition of tumor cells. Tumor associated antigens included adenoviral vector-based CEA, MUC1, brachyury, and yeast-based brachyury and CEA vaccines. Blood was collected pre- and post-treatment and target lesion analysis was performed using irRC and Recist1.1. Total RNA from PBMCs was used to generate sequencing libraries from each longitudinal sample. Using NGS, TCR-α and -β CDR3s were clonotyped and tracked over serial blood draws.

This was further reflected in acute surges in SWDI. Furthermore, a high SWDI at baseline and post-treatment indicated clinical benefit suggesting an inverse correlation between disease severity and peripheral repertoire diversity. A TNBC super responder showed dramatic increases in mean SWDI index from 74 prior treatment to 1177 at first biopsy post treatment (34% decrease by irRC and 26% by Recist1.1 analysis) and achieved an index as high as 3516 in a subsequent biopsy (83% and 64% decrease by irRC and Recist 1.1 respectively).</p><p id="Par4454"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4455">Our findings strongly suggest that peripheral blood TCR repertoires are prognostic indicators/biomarker for TNBC cancer vaccine immunotherapy and for T cell-based immunotherapy in general.

Margetuximab (M) is an Fc-engineered anti-HER2 mAb targeting the same HER2 epitope, but with higher affinity for both 158V (high binding) and 158F (low binding) alleles of the activating Fc receptor CD16A. Even more, M coordinately enhanced both innate and adaptive immunity, including antigen-specific T-cell responses to HER2 [1,2]. Programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) are both T-cell checkpoint molecules that suppress T-cell function. MGA012 (INCMGA00012) is a humanized, hinge-stabilized, IgG4κanti-PD-1 mAb blocking binding of PD-L1 or PD-L2 to PD-1. MGD013 is a humanized Fc-bearing bispecific tetravalent protein that concomitantly binds to PD-1 and LAG-3, inhibiting their respective ligand-binding. We previously reported that a chemotherapy (CTX)-free regimen consisting of M+PD-1 blockade was well tolerated in GEJ/GC patients, and induced a 30% objective response rate (ORR) [3]. This was 2- to 3-fold greater than in historical controls with checkpoint inhibitors alone [4,5].

After 40 patients are evaluated for response/safety, 60 more patients will be enrolled if the threshold for study continuation is met. In the randomized cohort B, HER2+ (IHC 3+ or IHC 2+/fluorescent in situ hybridization+) patients, are enrolled irrespective of PD-L1 status. Part 1 randomizes patients to 1 of 4 arms (50 patients each): control arm (T+CTX) or 1 experimental arm (M+CTX; M+CTX+MGA012; M+CTX+MGD013). CTX is investigator’s choice of XELOX or mFOLFOX-6. Part 2 (pick-the-winner) consists of the control (T+CTX) versus 1 experimental arm (M+CTX) + either MGA012 or MGD013, depending on the interim analysis from part 1; with 250 patients each. The primary efficacy endpoint for cohort A (both parts) is ORR per RECIST 1.1; for cohort B part 2 it is overall survival.</p><p id="Par4460"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par4461">The authors thank all the patients, their families, and the entire staff who are participating in this trial.

FSPs are considered safe and potent neoantigens because they are not expressed in the normal human proteome. We selected shared FSPs among patients with MSI cancers with the aim of developing an off-the-shelf vaccine for the cure of MSI tumors. 209 FSPs were assembled into 4 artificial genes and cloned into 4 Great Apes Adenoviral (GAd) and 4 Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vectors to generate a viral vectored vaccine called Nous-209.

Recent studies have revealed that inhibition of TGF-β signaling reverses immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and poor responses to cancer immunotherapy. To date, antitumor efficacy by immune check point inhibitors in colorectal or gastric/gastroesophageal cancer as monotherapy is known to be limited. A combination of TGF-β and PD-1 inhibition may induce immune restoration and improve antitumor responses.

Preclinical data shows that anti-EGFR mAbs require functional innate and adaptive immunity to mediate efficacy. Anti-EGFR therapy causes a tumor-specific adaptive immune response and immunogenic apoptosis [1,2], and anti-EGFR antibodies require functional T cells for in vivo efficacy [3]. However, resistance to anti-EGFR therapy inevitably develops and is associated with increased regulatory T cells expressing CTLA-4 [4] and activated immunosuppressive macrophages with upregulation of PD-L1 [5]. Thus, resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapy is associated with increased expression of both CTLA-4 and PD-L1. We hypothesized that treatment with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1) synergizes with panitumumab to significantly improve the response rate in patients with KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF WT MSS mCRC.</p><p id="Par4492"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4493">LCCC1632 is a multicenter, single-arm, phase II clinical trial with a pre-specified safety run-in of panitumumab, ipilimumab, and nivolumab in KRAS/NRAS/BRAF WT, MSS mCRC (NCT03442569). Eligible patients must have received 1-2 prior lines of therapy and no prior anti-EGFR or immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. A 6-subject safety run-in was treated with ipilimumab 1 mg/kg IV q6wk, nivolumab 240 mg IV q2wk, and panitumumab 6 mg/kg IV q2wk and observed for 12 weeks for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), followed by expansion into a Simon’s two stage phase II trial, with 26 more subjects enrolled in the first phase and 56 total subjects planned. The primary endpoint is response rate defined by RECIST 1.1. Secondary endpoints include response rate by irRECIST, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and duration of response.

The enzymes ecto-5’-nucleotidase (CD73) and tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) catalyze extracellular conversion of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) into adenosine. Inhibition of CD73 eliminates a major pathway of adenosine production in the TME and can reverse adenosine‐mediated immune suppression. Here we present the first results from a Phase 1 healthy volunteer (HV) study of AB680, a potent, reversible and selective small-molecule CD73 inhibitor. This placebo-controlled HV study assessed the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of AB680.</p><p id="Par4510"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4511">Male or female healthy volunteers aged 18-55 with a body mass index of 18-30 kg/m2 were eligible for enrollment in the AB680CSP0001 study (NCT03677973). Escalating doses of AB680 were evaluated in a single ascending dose (SAD) and repeat dosing study. Post dosing, participants were admitted for evaluation and serially assessed for adverse events. Blood samples were collected at various timepoints to elucidate the PK and PD profiles of AB680. AB680 plasma concentrations were determined using LC-MS/MS and PD effects were evaluated by monitoring AMP-ase activity in serum. Linear models were used to predict tumor up-regulation of CD73 in multiple tumor types with the assumption that tumors expressing higher CD73 levels will derive greater benefit from CD73 inhibition. Immunohistochemistry analyses were performed on serial sections of tumor tissue to correlate protein and gene expression.</p><p id="Par4512"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4513">The HV study enrolled more than 50 participants, randomized 3:1 (active: placebo). AB680 exhibited a good safety profile and displayed a long half-life following a 30-60 minute intravenous (IV) infusion, consistent with the intended Q2W dosing schedule in cancer patients. Doses were identified that provided maximal inhibition of peripheral AMP-ase activity.

BXCL701 (talabostat, previously PT100) is an orally administered, small molecule inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidases (DPP) specifically DPP4, DPP8 and DPP9. Inhibition of DPP8 and DPP9 triggers a process in macrophages called pyroptosis leading to innate immune proinflammatory stimulation of the tumor microenvironment[1,2,3]. BXCL701 also inhibits fibroblast activation protein (FAP) releasing the FAP-mediated block of T-cell migration into the tumor[4]. In syngeneic animal models, significant tumor responses were observed when BXCL701 was used with checkpoint inhibition[2]. Bempegaldesleukin (bempeg, NKTR-214) is a CD122-preferential interleukin-2 (IL-2) pathway agonist being investigated for its potential to leverage the clinically validated IL-2 pathway and selectively stimulate an immune response, without overacting the immune system. Bempeg has demonstrated robust anti-cancer activity when used with checkpoint inhibition in multiple murine tumor models and recently in multiple human cancers[5,6]. Avelumab is a checkpoint inhibitor that binds PD-L1 resulting in the release of immune inhibitory effects of this pathway thereby restoring immune responses, including anti-cancer immune responses. In a syngeneic mouse model of pancreatic cancer (Pan02), the triple combination demonstrated potent anti-cancer activity, including long-lasting anti-cancer immunity[7]. These results provide therapeutic rationale for testing of this combination in patients with pancreatic cancer.</p><p id="Par4522"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4523">This is an open-label, multicenter study to determine the safety and efficacy of the triple combination therapy of BXCL701, bempeg and avelumab.

Patients must agree to biopsy of metastatic disease. Part 1 (Phase 1b), is the 3+3 dose escalation phase designed to evaluate the safety of escalating doses of BXCL701 with bempeg and avelumab. Part 2 (Phase 2) will begin once the recommended combination dose is determined. A Simon two-stage design will be used in Phase 2, initially enrolling 13 patients. If 2 or more responses are observed, the cohort will expand to 34 patients. The primary efficacy parameter is objective response by RECIST 1.1.

BXCL701 also inhibits fibroblast activation protein (FAP) releasing the FAP-mediated block of T-cell migration into the tumor[5]. FAP, DPP8 and DPP9 are expressed and activated in neuroendocrine CRPC[6]. Correlation is robust between the expression of PD-L1 and the targets of BXCL701, particularly FAP, DPP8 and DPP9[2]. In syngeneic animal models, significant tumor responses were observed when BXCL701 was used in combination with checkpoint inhibition[2].

In early-phase trials, pembrolizumab, an anti–PD-1 antibody, showed some activity as monotherapy in heavily pretreated patients with mCRPC. Cohort D of the nonrandomized, multicohort, open-label, phase 1b/2 KEYNOTE-365 (NCT02861573) study has been designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pembrolizumab combined with abiraterone acetate and prednisone in patients with mCRPC who have not received chemotherapy for mCRPC.</p><p id="Par4554"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4555">Adults (≥18 years) with histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate cancer, without small cell histology, and who experience progression ≤6 months before screening and have an ECOG PS score of 0 or 1 are eligible. Patients must be chemotherapy naïve for mCRPC and must not have received second-generation hormonal therapy for mCRPC or must not have experienced failed treatment with enzalutamide or become intolerant to enzalutamide for mCRPC. Patients will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks, abiraterone acetate 1000 mg once daily, and prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Responses will be radiographically assessed every 9 weeks during year 1 and every 12 weeks thereafter. Pembrolizumab treatment will continue for up to 35 cycles (approximately 2 years) or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient/physician decision to withdraw. Patients who discontinue 1 of the 2 drugs in the combination because of drug-related adverse events can continue with the other combination partner. All patients who discontinue treatment will be monitored until trial completion. Primary end points are prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, defined as a PSA decrease of ≥50% from baseline measured on 2 occasions at least 3 weeks apart for confirmation, objective response rate (ORR) per RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR), and safety. Secondary end points include time to PSA progression, ORR based on Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3)–modified RECIST v1.1 assessed by BICR, duration of response based on RECIST 1.1 and PCWG3-modified RECIST 1.1 assessed by BICR, radiographic progression-free survival based on PCWG3-modified RECIST 1.1 assessed by BICR, and overall survival.

PSMA is a well-validated antigen specific to prostate epithelial cells upregulated upon malignant prostate cancer with limited expression in normal tissues. HPN424 is a recombinant polypeptide of ~50kDa containing three humanized antibody-derived binding domains, targeting PSMA (for tumor binding), albumin (for half-life extension) and CD3 (for T cell engagement). It has been engineered to be a small, globular protein to enable efficient exposure in solid tumor tissue with prolonged half-life and excellent stability under physiological conditions. HPN424 binds monomerically to CD3 and PSMA, minimizing non-specific T-cell activation. These features are designed to increase the therapeutic index compared to earlier generations of T cell engagers by minimizing off-target toxicities. HPN424 mediates potent target tumor cell killing in a PSMA-specific manner in vitro and in xenograft models in the presence of T cells, demonstrated at very low antigen densities. Consistent with its mechanism of action (MOA), tumor cell killing is accompanied by T cell activation, cytokine induction, and T cell expansion.</p><p id="Par4572"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4573">This is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and dose expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, clinical activity, and pharmacokinetics of HPN424 in adult patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have progressed on the prior regimen (per PCWG3 criteria) and received at least 2 prior systemic therapies approved for mCRPC. HPN424 is administered once weekly as one-hour IV infusion by single-patient cohorts until either a Grade ≥2 adverse event (AE) that is possibly related to HPN424 is observed or an estimated therapeutic dose level has been reached. Then a conventional 3+3 design is implemented. Dose escalation will continue until a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined. In dose expansion, up to 18 patients receive HPN424 at the established RP2D. Additional expansion cohorts may be added. Patients may continue weekly HPN424 treatment as long as they are receiving clinical benefit. Primary endpoints are number and severity of DLTs following treatment with escalating doses of HPN424 during escalation, and overall response rate (per PCWG3 criteria) in dose expansion. Secondary endpoints include AEs, preliminary anti-tumor activity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters based on the proposed MOA of HPN424.</p><p id="Par4574"><bold>Trial Registration</bold></p><p id="Par4575">NCT03577028</p><p id="Par4576"><bold>Ethics Approval</bold></p><p id="Par4577">This study was approved by each participating institution's Institutional Review Board.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1523"><title>P385 Pembrolizumab plus enzalutamide versus placebo plus enzalutamide for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: phase 3 KEYNOTE-641 study</title><sec id="Sec1524"><title>Julie Nicole Graff<sup>1</sup>, Joseph Burgents<sup>2</sup>, Li Wen Liang<sup>3</sup>, Arnulf Stenzl<sup>4</sup></title><sec id="Sec1525"><title><sup>1</sup>Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health &amp; Science University, Portland, OR, United States; <sup>2</sup>Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA, Kenilworth, NJ, United States; <sup>3</sup>MSD, China, Beijing, China, Beijing, China; <sup>4</sup>University of Tuebingen Medical School, Tuebingen, Germany, Tübingen, Germany</title><sec id="Sec1526"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Julie Nicole Graff (graffj@ohsu.edu)</title><p id="Par4578"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par4579">Treatment options for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) are noncurative, and life expectancy is only about 3 years. Enzalutamide is an androgen receptor inhibitor used for the treatment of patients with mCRPC. Pembrolizumab is a programmed death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor with antitumor activity as monotherapy in mCRPC. Results of clinical studies have shown that the mechanisms of action of pembrolizumab and enzalutamide may be synergistic. In the phase 1b/2 KEYNOTE-365 (NCT02861573) study, antitumor activity of pembrolizumab plus enzalutamide was observed in mCRPC patients pretreated with abiraterone acetate. Also, in a single-arm, phase 2 study (NCT02312557) of patients who progressed on enzalutamide, some patients had profound anticancer response when pembrolizumab was added to enzalutamide that lasted years. KEYNOTE-641 (NCT03834493) is a randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab plus enzalutamide versus placebo plus enzalutamide for patients with mCRPC.</p><p id="Par4580"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4581">Approximately 1200 patients will be randomly assigned 1:1 to receive enzalutamide 160 mg/day plus pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W or enzalutamide 160 mg/day plus placebo. Treatment will be stratified per prior abiraterone acetate treatment (yes/no), metastases (bone only/liver/other), and prior docetaxel treatment for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (yes/no). Adults (≥18 years) with histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate cancer and mCRPC who experienced biochemical or radiographic progression are eligible. Patients who received chemotherapy for mCRPC, checkpoint inhibition, or any treatment with a second-generation androgen receptor inhibitor (eg, enzalutamide, apalutamide, or darolutamide) are excluded. Patients intolerant of or experiencing progression with prior abiraterone acetate therapy are included. Patients must have ECOG PS 0/1, adequate organ function, and tissue for biomarker analysis. Responses will be assessed by CT/MRI and radionuclide bone imaging per PCWG-modified RECIST v1.1 every 9 weeks during the first year and every 12 weeks thereafter. Treatment will continue with enzalutamide plus pembrolizumab/placebo until radiographic disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal, with a maximum of 2 years of treatment for the pembrolizumab/placebo component of the combination. Dual primary end points are overall survival and radiographic progression-free survival by blinded independent central review. The key secondary efficacy end point is time to subsequent anticancer therapy or death. Additional secondary end points include objective response rate, duration of response, prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate, PSA-undetectable rate, time to PSA progression, time to pain progression, and time to radiographic soft tissue progression.

To further assess the economic impact of NIVO+IPI associated with TFS, this study compared healthcare costs among untreated intermediate/poor-risk aRCC patients with different lengths of TFS.</p><p id="Par4590"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4591">This study used individual patient data from the NIVO+IPI arm in CheckMate 214 (database lock, August 6, 2018; minimum follow-up, 30 months). TFS is defined as the time from last dose of NIVO+IPI to the start of subsequent systemic therapy or death, whichever occurs first. All intermediate/poor-risk aRCC patients who received NIVO+IPI and provided consent were classified into 3 cohorts based on the length of TFS: cohort 1 remained on NIVO monotherapy maintenance; cohort 2 had TFS ≤6 months; and cohort 3 had TFS &gt;6 months. Patient characteristics and overall survival from randomization were described for the 3 cohorts. Monthly costs from randomization to last known date alive, including study treatment costs, all-cause grade 3/4 adverse event costs, terminal care costs, and subsequent treatment costs were compared between cohort 3 versus cohort 1 and cohort 3 versus cohort 2 using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. All costs were adjusted to 2019 United States dollars.</p><p id="Par4592"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4593">Of the 420 eligible patients, 16.4% (N=69) remained on NIVO monotherapy maintenance, 60.2% (N=253) had TFS ≤6 months, and 23.3% (N=98) had TFS &gt;6 months by the end of patient follow-up. Patient characteristics were mostly similar between cohort 3 versus cohort 1 or 2. By definition, all patients (100%) in cohort 1 were alive at the end of follow-up. The survival probabilities were 94% for cohort 3 and 60% for cohort 2 by 18 months and 83% for cohort 3 and 39% for cohort 2 by 30 months. Patients with TFS &gt;6 months had significantly lower monthly costs ($8,318) compared with those who never discontinued NIVO+IPI ($16,374) and those with TFS ≤6 months ($22,811) (Figure 1).</p><p id="Par4594"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4595">This retrospective healthcare cost assessment of 3 patterns of patient outcomes during and after treatment with NIVO+IPI suggests an economic value of achieving prolonged TFS (&gt;6 months).

Treatment will be stratified per previous treatment with a next-generation hormonal agent (abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide) and metastases (bone only, liver, other). Adult (≥18 years) patients with chemotherapy-naïve histologically or cytologically confirmed mCRPC who experienced progression while receiving androgen deprivation therapy (or postbilateral orchiectomy) within 6 months before screening were eligible. Patients must have experienced progression after ≥8 weeks (≥14 weeks for those with bone progression) or become intolerant after ≥4 weeks of abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide treatment (but not both) with androgen-deprivation therapy in the chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC state. Patients must have ECOG PS 0 or 1, adequate organ function, and tissue for biomarker analysis. Responses will be assessed by CT or MRI and radionuclide bone imaging per Prostate Cancer Working Group–modified RECIST v1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR) Q9W during the first year and Q12W thereafter.

IL-2 (aldesleukin) is a potent growth and differentiation factor for T and NK cells with anti-tumor activity for advanced RCC across a broad dose range. A high dose (HD) IL-2 regimen has demonstrated superior overall response rate (ORR), depth and durability of response versus lower dose alternatives. Resistance mechanisms exploited by tumors may play a dominant role in limiting the effectiveness of T-cell mediated cancer therapies. The PD-1/PD-L1 interaction is a major pathway hijacked by RCC tumors to suppress immune control. Antibody-mediated PD1 blockade with pembro results in spontaneous and durable regressions for a subset of RCC tumors (SS Tykodi et al., ASCO 2019, abstract #4570). PD1 blockade has entered clinical practice for advanced RCC as both a front-line and salvage therapy option. A favorable safety profile for PD1 blockade has encouraged exploration of novel immuno-oncology combinations.</p><p id="Par4644"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4645">Methods: This is an investigator-initiated, phase I trial of IL-2 plus pembro in patients with advanced, clear cell RCC. The study will use a 3 + 3 trial design to test three IL-2 dose levels in combination with pembro given every 3-weeks at 200 mg flat dosing. Cohorts will receive subcutaneous IL-2 given once daily, 5 days per week for 6 weeks (250,000 U/kg week 1, 125,000 U/kg weeks 2-6); or IV bolus dosing at 72,000 U/kg or 600,000 U/kg (HD IL-2) every 8 hours to a maximum of 14 doses on week 1 and 4 of a 12-week treatment course. Patients with stable or responding disease and without treatment-limiting toxicity can receive up to 3 courses of therapy. The HD IL-2 cohort will enroll an additional 9 patients to gain further insight into anti-tumor efficacy. The primary objective is to evaluate safety and tolerability for IL-2 plus pembro. The secondary objective is to assess antitumor activity by RECIST 1.1 for ORR, disease control rate, and progression free survival. Exploratory endpoints will include pretreatment tumor analysis for PD-L1 expression, and quantitation of regulatory T cell frequency in peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment.</p><p id="Par4646"><bold>Trial Registration</bold></p><p id="Par4647">Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03260504</p><p id="Par4648"><bold>Ethics Approval</bold></p><p id="Par4649">Ethics Approval: This study was approved by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center Institutional Review Board, approval number 9611.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1543"><title>P390 Pembrolizumab plus olaparib vs enzalutamide or abiraterone in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who experienced progression on chemotherapy: phase 3 KEYLYNK-010 study</title><sec id="Sec1544"><title>Evan Yu<sup>1</sup>, Se Hoon Park<sup>2</sup>, Yi-Hsiu Huang<sup>3</sup>, Mostefa Bennamoun<sup>4</sup>, Lu Xu<sup>5</sup>, Jeri Kim<sup>5</sup>, Emmanuel Antonarakis, MD<sup>6</sup></title><sec id="Sec1545"><title><sup>1</sup>University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United STates; <sup>2</sup>Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea, Seoul, Korea, Republic of; <sup>3</sup>Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, Taipei, Taiwan, Province of China; <sup>4</sup>Institut Mutualiste Montsouris, Paris, France, Paris, France; <sup>5</sup>Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA, Kenilworth, United States; <sup>6</sup>Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States</title><sec id="Sec1546"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Evan Yu (evanyu@u.washington.edu)</title><p id="Par4650"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par4651">The docetaxel-pretreated, metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) disease state remains an unmet need for new therapeutics.

Standard therapy includes surgical debulking and neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant combination chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, with or without intraperitoneal therapy in certain stage III patients, and increasingly the use of PARP inhibitors. So far advanced ovarian cancer has been relatively refractory to anti-checkpoint therapy, presumably because of limited host anti-tumor immune responses. Adjunctive treatment with an effective vaccine could increase immune responses and improve survival.</p><p id="Par4662"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4663">This randomized phase II trial was approved by Western IRB. AV-OVA-1, patient-specific dendritic cell vaccines loaded with autologous tumor antigens from self-renewing cancer cells, is administered as an adjunctive therapy after completion of standard optimal therapy. Key eligibility criteria are a diagnosis of stage III or IV primary epithelial ovarian cancer, successful establishment of a short-term cancer cell line, a successful leukapheresis collection of monocytes, and a Karnofsky Performance Status of 70 or greater at the time of randomization, which takes place shortly after completion of primary therapy. Tumor is collected at the time of surgery from which a short-term cell line is derived. Dendritic cells are produced by incubating peripheral blood monocytes in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4. The antigen source is a lysate of irradiated tumor cells from the cell culture. Six to seven months after tumor collection, after completion of concurrent surgery and primary systemic therapy, patients are stratified by whether they have detectable residual disease, and then randomized 2:1 to receive the dendritic cell vaccine or autologous monocytes. Both are admixed with GM-CSF and injected subcutaneously at weeks 1, 2, 3, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 for up to eight doses.

Patients with recurrent/metastatic (R/M) SCCHN have a poor prognosis with median overall survival (OS) of Enoblituzumab is an investigational Fc-modified monoclonal antibody that binds B7-H3, which is over-expressed in a wide range of cancers including SCCHN [4], but not in most normal tissues. It has increased affinity for the activating FcγR IIIA (CD16A) and decreased affinity for the inhibitory FcγRIIB (CD32B). The engineered Fc domain confers enoblituzumab with target-specific antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in vitro and anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies, and in vivo and clinical data suggest that Fc-optimized antibodies such as enoblituzumab can engage both innate and adaptive immunity as mediators of anti-tumor activity [6]. Enoblituzumab was well tolerated in a Phase 1 monotherapy trial with no maximum tolerated dose defined up to 15 mg/kg.</p><p id="Par4714">A recent study of enoblituzumab combined with pembrolizumab showed this combination is feasible and well tolerated with minimal additive toxicity [5]. While studies of monotherapy pembrolizumab in this population report responses below 17% [6], the overall response rate of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-naïve patients (post platinum) receiving enoblituzumab plus pembrolizumab was 33% (6/18) including 1 confirmed CR and 5 confirmed PRs [5]. This suggests a cooperative mechanism and provides a rationale for further development of this combination in patients with recurrent/metastatic SCCHN.</p><p id="Par4715">MGA012 (also known as INCMGA00012) is an investigational anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody with a tolerable safety profile and efficacy signal consistent with other agents in its class [7] demonstrated in early studies.</p><p id="Par4716"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4717">This is a Phase 2/3, randomized, open label study in first-line treatment of patients with R/M SCCHN not curable by local therapy (Figure 1).

However, the significant percentage of patients who are nonresponsive to these immunotherapies (primary resistance) or experience disease relapse following an acquired immune resistance mechanism (secondary resistance) [1] highlights the need for new therapies. As tumor responsiveness to immunotherapy may depend, in part, on the immunophenotype of the tumor microenvironment (TME) [2-5], one exploratory approach to establish, re-establish, or enhance active immune surveillance conditions within the TME is to inject innate immune modulators directly into the tumor to promote an adaptive tumor-specific immune response. ADU-S100 (MIW815) is a novel synthetic cyclic dinucleotide that activates the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway within the TME leading to activation of tumor-resident APCs and priming of tumor antigen specific CD8+ T cells. Direct activation of STING via intratumoral injection of ADU-S100 (MIW815) has been shown to overcome active tolerance mechanisms through stimulation of resident leukocyte populations. Preclinical models indicate that survival and local tumor shrinkage were significantly enhanced when ADU-S100 (MIW815) was administered with an anti-PD-1 antibody, suggesting the PD-1 blockade may act synergistically with concomitant STING activation. In phase 1 trials, tumor shrinkage and durable responses have been observed after treatment with S100 alone or in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of intratumoral ADU-S100 (MIW815) when administered in combination with pembrolizumab.</p><p id="Par4734"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4735">This open-label, multicenter phase 2 clinical trial (NCT03937141) aims to enroll 33 adults with PD-L1 positive, recurrent or metastatic HNSCC for which pembrolizumab is indicated as SOC in the first-line setting. Patients with at least one lesion that is accessible for repeat intratumoral injection and can provide tumor tissue for eligibility determination and biomarker analyses will receive intravenous infusions of pembrolizumab (200 mg) at Day 1 and intratumoral injections of ADU-S100 (MIW815) (800 mcg/lesion) at Day 1 and 8 in 21-day dosing cycles up to 35 cycles, or until criteria for treatment discontinuation are met. The primary endpoint is the objective response per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.1. Key secondary endpoints include occurrence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events and changes from baseline in safety assessments.

Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 check-point receptor pathway increases the cytotoxic response of NK cells in mice.[2] Therefore, it was hypothesized that cetuximab and PD-1/PD-L1 blockade would be synergistic. Here we report our findings on the combination of cetuximab with a PD-L1 inhibitor, durvalumab on T cells, NK cells and cytokines from a phase II open-label single site clinical trial in HNSCC patients with recurrent or metastatic disease.

Increasing evidence indicates that dysregulation of miRNA(miR)s contributes to the pathogenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).

After transfection with scrambled miRNA-A, B, C (Scr), miRNAs-A, B, C for 48 h, PD-L1 mRNA and PD-L1 protein levels were assessed by RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. To perform EGFP reporter assay, cells were transfected with miRNA-C and reporter constructs, containing the putative PD-L1 3’-UTR target sites, along with a control vector, EGFP levels were assessed by western blotting. Cell viability was assessed after treatment with 5-FU for 72 h using by MTT solution.

EGFP reporter assay of only miR-C out of three miRs showed a decrease in the relative PD-L1 expression. This would indicate that only miR-C can recognize target sites in the 3’-UTR of PD-L1 mRNA in OSCC cells. Overexpression of miR-C induced the decrease of PD-L1 mRNA and protein (Figure 1A,1B). The sensitivity of CAL27 and YD8 cells to 5-FU was increased when miR-C was overexpressed (Figure 2).

However, poor quality of patient T cells, failed persistence, reduced effectiveness within an immunosuppressive microenvironment and target antigen loss, represent some of the challenges to improving CART19 efficacy. Furthermore, correlative biomarkers that predict CART-19 response remain elusive.</p><p id="Par4832">Pet dogs spontaneously develop B-NHL and B cell leukemias that share oncogenic pathways and similar immunosuppressive features to human B cell malignancies. Therefore, they provide an immunologically intact, parallel patient population in which to evaluate next generation CAR T cell strategies and combination approaches that address current CART19 challenges. Previously, we have demonstrated the ability to generate functional CD20-targeting canine CAR T cells. Their use in client owned animals with B-NHL can lead to the development of canine anti-mouse antibody (CAMA) formation and target antigen escape. To address these issues and provide a parallel reagent that can inform human CAR T cell strategies, we have developed a fully canine CD19 targeting CAR and confirmed its function in vitro against CD19 expressing targets.</p><p id="Par4833"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4834">We employed a canine scFv phage display library to isolate canine CD19-specific scFvs following 3-4 rounds of panning against the soluble extracellular domain of canine CD19. Twelve unique scFvs were isolated and their binding to soluble canine CD19 and cell surface expressed CD19 was confirmed by ELISA and flow cytometry respectively. One of the highest binding candidates was cloned into a fully canine CD28ζ CAR in a pMX retroviral plasmid. Retroviruses pseudotyped with both RD114 and VSV-G envelope proteins were generated using standard protocols and used to transduce primary canine T cells activated using anti-canine CD3/CD28 beads in the presence of RetroNectin®. Successful transductions of canine T cells were obtained with 45% of T cells expressing CAR on their cell surface by flow cytometry. Canine CART-19 cells demonstrated antigen-specific proliferation and cytokine production in vitro. We now aim to perform a pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this approach in canine patients with relapsed, refractory B-NHL. This work will serve the dual purpose of enabling pet dogs with spontaneous B cell malignancies to accelerate application of next generation CART cell therapies into the human clinics as well as provide much needed immunotherapeutics for canine patients with B cell malignancies for which there are no effective therapies that induce durable remissions.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1603"><title>P405 CASSIOPEIA: A phase 2 study evaluating efficacy and safety of tisagenlecleucel in first-line therapy for high-risk pediatric and young adult patients with B-ALL who are MRD positive at the EOC</title><sec id="Sec1604"><title>Shannon Maude, MD, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Hunger Stephen, MD<sup>1</sup>, Jochen Buechner, MD<sup>2</sup>, Stephen Grupp, MD<sup>1</sup>, Susana Rives<sup>3</sup>, Andre Baruchel<sup>4</sup>, John Levine<sup>5</sup>, Joerg Krueger<sup>6</sup>, Theodore Laetsch<sup>7</sup>, Marianne Ifversen<sup>8</sup>, Aiesha Zia<sup>9</sup>, Jaclyn Davis<sup>10</sup>, Eric Bleickardt<sup>10</sup>, Mignon Loh<sup>11</sup></title><sec id="Sec1605"><title><sup>1</sup>University of Pennsylvania; Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United States; <sup>2</sup>Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway; <sup>3</sup>Sant Joan de Deu Hospital, Barcelona, Spain; <sup>4</sup>Hôpital Robert Debré&amp;Université de Paris, Paris, France; <sup>5</sup>Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States; <sup>6</sup>The Hospital for Sick Children, Toranto, Canada; <sup>7</sup>UT Southwestern Medical Center and Child, Dallas, TX, United States; <sup>8</sup>Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospi, Copenhagen, Denmark; <sup>9</sup>Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland; <sup>10</sup>Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, United States; <sup>11</sup>University of California, San Francisco, CA, United States</title><sec id="Sec1606"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Shannon Maude (maude@email.chop.edu)</title><p id="Par4835"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par4836">Survival is compromised for patients with high-risk (HR) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) who have a poor response to first-line chemotherapy.

Prior to screening, patients will complete a standard of care first-line 4-drug induction, MRD assessment at EOI, a Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster phase-1b consolidation, and MRD assessment at EOC. Eligible patients undergo leukapheresis either at the EOI or EOC. Prior to tisagenlecleucel infusion, patients will receive interim maintenance including high-dose methotrexate.

However, severe grade 3 neurotoxicity (immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome, or ICANS) is seen in up to one-third of patients. Recently, preclinical animal studies of human CD19 CAR T-cell therapies have shown that while IL-6 and IL-1 receptor antagonists could prevent cytokine release syndrome (without impairing anti-tumor efficacy), only IL-1 blockade could prevent neurotoxicity [1,2]. The recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist Anakinra was used successfully to avert lethal neurotoxicity in mice. Anakinra crosses the blood brain barrier and has been shown to be safe and efficacious in rheumatologic conditions driven by high levels of monocyte lineage-associated IL-1 including rheumatoid arthritis and neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease, for which it is FDA approved. We are conducting the first human trial of Anakinra to treat ICANS in B-cell lymphoma patients treated with anti-CD19 CAR T-cells. The trial has been approved by the U.S. FDA under an investigator-sponsored IND, and Anakinra is supplied by the agent’s manufacturer (Sobi Pharmaceuticals).</p><p id="Par4847"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4848">Patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma receiving standard of care CAR T-cells are eligible for enrollment. The primary objectives are to: 1) Evaluate the effectiveness of IL-1 blockade in reducing the incidence and duration of severe ICANS in participants receiving anti-CD19 CAR T-cells, 2) Assess the safety of Anakinra in CAR T-cell patients, 3) Measure cytokines (including IL-1, IL-6, IL-15, TNF-alpha, interferon-gamma) and nitric oxide in the serum and CSF of treated patients prior to and during CAR T-cell therapy for correlation with ICANS events, and 4) Determine the tumor response rate in comparison to historical controls. Upon development of grade 1 ICANS, or grade 3 CRS (which is often followed by ICANS), participants will receive Anakinra 100 mg subcutaneously every 6 hours for at least 12 doses, or until ICANS returns to grade 1 in participants who develop grade 2 neurotoxicity. Patients will be continuously evaluated for toxicity, and assessed for overall tumor response by day 120 with PET/CT scanning. Thirty-six participants will be treated in this multicenter trial, at four centers within the University of California Hematologic Malignancies Consortium (UC Los Angeles, UC San Francisco, UC San Diego, and UC Davis). The trial is powered to detect a 50% reduction in the rate of severe ICANS compared to historical rates.</p><p id="Par4849"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par4850">1.

Arisen from tumor somatic mutations, neoantigens provide tumor specific targets for developing personalized cancer vaccines, further eliciting strong T cell-mediated immune response. A single-arm, open-labelled, investigator-initiated clinical study was carried out to examine the safety and efficacy of personalized peptide vaccine (iNeo-Vac-P01). Total of 22 patients with solid tumors had been enrolled in the trial from Feb 7th, 2018 to May 31st, 2019. A biliary tract cancer patient achieved unique neoplastic changes.</p><p id="Par4876"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4877">The 63-year-old male, initially diagnosed with intrahepatic biliary tract cancer in 2013, was treated with surgical excision in Jun. 2013 and postoperative chemotherapy in Apr. 2014 respectively. Both tumor recurrence and metastases were confirmed with CT scan in Nov. 2017. And then, he was treated with 6 cycles of PD-1 antibody in a clinical trial and dropped out due to disease progression. Under his consent, his biopsy and blood samples were obtained for whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and neoantigen identification [1-4]. Finally the total of 7 peptides were synthesized and pooled into 2 groups.</p><p id="Par4878">On Mar 22th, 2018, he started to receive iNeo-Vac-P01 subcutaneously (s.c.). The injection sites were the two upper arms. He was scheduled to receive vaccinations with GM-CSF as adjuvant on day 1, 4, 8, 15 and 22 (i.e. priming phase), as well as 6 subsequent boosters [5-8].</p><p id="Par4879"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4880">After the last booster vaccination, a grade 3~4 allergic reaction (under NCI-CTCAE 4.03) happened, while clinical manifestations were nausea, vomiting and rash. The treatment-relating allergic reaction maybe result from peptide-specific antibody accumulation, however, this hypothesis needs experimental validation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The CT scans indicated an evident increase of tumor size at 5th month, and a surprisingly decrease of tumor size at 8th month, implying a pseudo-progression. The duration of stable disease was 14.5+ months, and he had been keeping progression-free since then. The results of IFN-γ ELISPOT assay shows that the neoantigen peptides stimulated highest number of IFN-γ spots and induced significant peptide-specific T-cell response. TCR sequencing demonstrated the evident increase of peripheral T cells with three TCRs (data unshown).</p><p id="Par4881"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4882">The preliminary results demonstrated that iNeo-Vac-P01 treatment was feasible and safe, and can prolong progression-free survival and overall survival.</p><p id="Par4883"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par4884">The authors would like to gratitude all the patients who participated in the trial and their families, as well as the Sir Run Shaw clinical site.

Combined inhibition of immune checkpoint and TGF-β signal is anticipated as a promising therapeutic strategy because these two key pathways have independent and complementary immunosuppressive functions. We are reporting the Dose Finding part of a Phase 1b/2a study evaluating the combination of vactosertib, a highly selective and potent TGF-β inhibitor, with durvalumab in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who progressed following platinum-based chemotherapy.</p><p id="Par4902"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4903">Eligible patients (pts) are ≥19 years old, have ECOG status ≤1, and have no prior exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitors, or TGFβ R1 kinase inhibitors. The primary objective is to assess the safety and the recommended dose of vactosertib given 5 days on/2 days off in combination with durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks. Two dose levels of vactosertib (100 mg BID and 200 mg BID) were tested in the dose finding part.

At 100 mg BID cohort, no dose limiting toxicity was observed. The most frequently reported adverse events (AE) were skin rash (30.8%), nausea (23.1%), and pruritis (23.1%). There were 3 serious adverse events (SAE) reported; pleural effusion (1), skin eruption (1), and empyema (1), and no patients with reported cardiotoxicity.

DURGA is a multi-cohort study evaluating the combination of HS-110 and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies in patients with advanced NSCLC. We report on Cohort B, which enrolled patients with progressive disease (PD) after receiving a minimum of 4 months of treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) at any time prior to study entry.</p><p id="Par4914"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4915">Patients with previously treated NSCLC received weekly HS-110 (1 X 107 cells) intradermally for 18 consecutive weeks and nivolumab IV 240 mg every 2 weeks, followed by nivolumab maintenance until tumor progression or intolerable toxicity. Tissue was tested at baseline for PD-L1 expression (≥ 1% or &lt; 1%) and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). TIL high was defined as &gt;10% CD8+ lymphocytes in the tumor stroma. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) by RECIST 1.1.

Median PFS and median OS were 3.2 months and 11.8 months, respectively. Immune ORR and clinical benefit rate by iRECIST were 14% and 61%, respectively. Patients experiencing injection site reactions (ISR) had improved PFS (3.7 vs 1.8 months; HR 0.21, p =0.0021) and improved OS (12 vs 5 months; HR 0.16, p=0.0005) compared to those without ISR. 96% of patients experienced at least one adverse event, and 92% of all AEs were grade 1 or 2. The most common AEs were fatigue (34%), hypocalcemia (18%), cough (16%) and diarrhea and dyspnea (14% each).

Pepinemab is an IgG4 humanized monoclonal antibody targeting semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D, CD100). In vivo preclinical studies demonstrated antibody blockade of SEMA4D promoted immune infiltration and reduced function and recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid cells within the tumor [1,2].

Key inclusion criteria are disease progression, ECOG 0-2, no electronic medical devices in the upper torso, and absence of brain metastasis. TTFields (150 kHz) are applied to the upper torso for at &gt;18 hours/day until progression in the thorax and/or liver. The primary endpoint is superiority in OS between patients treated with TTFields in combination with the standard of care treatments versus standard of care treatments alone. Key secondary endpoints compare the OS in patients treated with TTFields and docetaxel versus docetaxel alone, and patients treated with TTFields and immune checkpoint inhibitors vs those treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors alone. An exploratory analysis will test non-inferiority of TTFields with docetaxel compared to checkpoint inhibitors alone. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, radiological response rate, quality of life based on the EORTC QLQ C30 questionnaire. The sample size is powered to detect a HR of 0.75 in TTFields-treated patients versus control group. In January 2019, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) performed a review of the LUNAR trial data collected to that point. The DMC concluded that no unexpected safety issues could be found in patients treated with the combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors and TTFields, and recommended to continue the LUNAR study as planned.</p><p id="Par4977"><bold>Trial Registration</bold></p><p id="Par4978">NCT02973789</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1647"><title>P416 A phase 1 dose escalation with expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of AMV564 in subjects with advanced solid tumors</title><sec id="Sec1648"><title>Raghad Abdul Kairm, MD<sup>1</sup>, Anthony Tolcher<sup>1</sup>, Victoria Smith<sup>2</sup>, Sterling Eckard, PhD<sup>2</sup>, Jeanmarie Guenot<sup>2</sup>, Patrick Chun<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec1649"><title><sup>1</sup>NEXT Oncology and Texas Oncology, San Antonio, TX, United States; <sup>2</sup>Amphivena Therapeutics, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, United States</title><sec id="Sec1650"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Patrick Chun (pchun@amphivena.com)</title><p id="Par4979"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par4980">Overcoming the suppressive tumor microenvironment is a major challenge in immune therapy. The critical cellular effectors of the suppressive tumor microenvironment are the myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). MDSC are elevated in both the tumor microenvironment and periphery in cancer patients and are associated with immune dysfunction, repression of anti-tumor immunity and poor response to immunotherapy. MDSC secrete a variety of immunosuppressive factors that directly inhibit both the cytolytic activity and proliferative capacity of anti-tumor T cells. AMV564 is a bivalent, bispecific antibody that engages both CD3 and CD33. Preferential binding of AMV564 to regions of high CD33 density enables the selective targeting of MDSC. Data from both <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies [1] and an ongoing clinical trial in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) support the ability of AMV564 to selectively deplete monocytic and granulocytic MDSC while sparing monocytes and neutrophils.</p><p id="Par4981"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4982">AMV564-301 is an open label, phase 1, multicenter, dose-escalation with expansion trial of AMV564 in patients with advanced solid tumors for which no recognized standard curative therapy options are available.

In the dose expansion stage of the study, the safety and tolerability of AMV564 will be further characterized in addition to evaluating the preliminary efficacy of AMV564.

However, the success of vaccination is dependent on the ability to identify the right neoantigens for vaccine inclusion, which remains a critical challenge. Computationally-identified neoantigens do not necessarily generate immunogenic responses. Recently, we reported interim immunogenicity results from the ongoing GEN-009 personalized immunotherapy Phase 1/2a clinical trial (NCT03633110). For GEN-009, ATLAS, an ex vivo, cell-based assay selects neoantigens for vaccine inclusion based on a patient’s own pre-existing T cell responses. The interim results revealed that vaccination elicited T cell responses to over 98% of administered peptides. Here, we explore the relationship between ATLAS readouts and immunogenicity outcomes in the same subjects.</p><p id="Par4992"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par4993">Antigens were profiled by expressing each mutation, identified by whole exome sequencing, as individual clones in E. coli which are subsequently processed by each subject’s own antigen presenting cells and presented to autologous CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. Antigen-specific responses were determined based on cytokine secretion in the supernatant after overnight incubation. GEN-009, composed of 4 pools of 1-5 unique ATLAS-identified neoantigen-specific peptides combined with Hiltonol® was administered to each subject. Both ex vivo and ten day in vitro stimulated FluoroSpot assays were performed on unsorted PBMC and CD4- and CD8-sorted T cells at baseline and 50 days post vaccination to identify peptides to which T cells from the vaccinated patients responded.</p><p id="Par4994"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par4995">In the first cohort of six patients, ATLAS identified neoantigens by recalling both stimulatory and inhibitory neoantigen-specific T cell responses. One subject, who had a greater proportion of inhibitory to stimulatory responses detected, progressed prior to vaccination while no vaccinated patients have experienced progressive disease. Compared to NetMHCPan results, more than half of the ATLAS-identified neoantigens were not predicted. Moreover, the predicted epitopes did not result in better immunogenicity outcomes post-vaccination than the non-predicted ATLAS-identified neoantigens. Comprehensively profiling T cell responses over time shows consistency of results in patients with no evidence of disease.</p><p id="Par4996"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par4997">Neoantigens selected by immune response data from ATLAS and included in the GEN-009 vaccine were immunogenic and many were not algorithm-predicted, confirming that ATLAS identifies relevant neoantigens. ATLAS will be useful for profiling epitope spread in tumor-bearing subjects post-vaccination. The proportion of inhibitory to stimulatory neoantigen-specific responses may be a biomarker of immunotherapy success.

Previously, we demonstrated that enhanced intratumoral IL-12 expression via injection of plasmid IL-12 (tavokinogene telseplasmid; TAVO) followed by electroporation (IT-tavo-EP) can increase TIL infiltration, ratios of CD8+ T cell:suppressive immune subsets, and IFN-gamma gene signatures, converting weakly immunogenic tumors into highly inflamed, immunologically active lesions that regress with anti-PD-1 antibody therapy. Here, we present further support for our hypothesis that local IT-tavo-EP induces local and systemic immune modulation with minimal systemic toxicity.</p><p id="Par5004"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5005">Melanoma (KEYNOTE-695) and mTNBC (KEYNOTE-890) patients were treated every three weeks with IT-tavo-EP on days 1, 5, and 8 of every odd numbered cycle. Clinical toxicity was assessed at 3-week intervals and graded by CTCAE v4. In addition, pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsies and peripheral blood samples were interrogated for treatment-related changes in the frequency of CD8+ TIL and other key IL-12-driven peripheral immune cell populations. In particular, we examined circulating short-lived effector T cells (SLECs, KLRG1+/CD127-), which are induced by IL-12 exposure, and granulocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (gMDSCs or PMN-MDSCs), which serve a regulatory function, inhibiting effective anti-tumor immune responses.</p><p id="Par5006"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5007">62 patients were assessed including 46 patients with anti-PD-1 antibody-refractory melanoma, and 16 patients with chemotherapy-refractory mTNBC. TAVO in combination with pembrolizumab was well tolerated with only 2 of 46 (4.3%) patients from KEYNOTE-695 (cellulitis and presyncope) and 1 of 16 (6.3%) from KEYNOTE-890 (acute renal failure) experiencing grade 3 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs). Paired biopsies were available from both advanced melanoma patients and mTNBC patients. Flow cytometry on fresh biopsies from the KEYNOTE-695 revealed significant increases in CD8+ T cells after 1 cycle of treatment. Despite previous data demonstrating non-detectable circulating IL-12 levels after treatment with TAVO, paired peripheral blood analysis revealed a treatment-related increase of KLRG1+/CD127- SLECs as well as a treatment-related reduction of MDSCs in the periphery predominantly in responding patients.</p><p id="Par5008"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5009">TAVO + pembrolizumab continues to be well tolerated in patients with advanced solid tumors and peripheral blood analyses demonstrates both local and most importantly, systemic signals of IL-12 mediated anti-tumor immunity in the absence of clinical signs of systemic IL-12 exposure.

GB1275 is a novel, first-in-class, CD11b modulator that in vivo led to reduced MDSCs and TAMs at the tumor site, repolarized M2 immuno-suppressive TAMs towards an M1 phenotype, and subsequently increased tumor infiltration of activated CD8+ T cells [4]. In combination settings with an anti-PD-1 antibody or chemotherapy, these immunomodulatory effects translated into potent anti-tumor effects and prolonged survival in orthotopic PDAC models [4].

Preliminary data suggest that the inhibitory peptide profile may predict tumor response to immunotherapy.</p><p id="Par5030"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5031">GEN-009-101 is a phase 1/2a study testing safety, immunogenicity and clinical activity in immune responsive tumors (NCT03633110). After next-generation tumor sequencing and ATLAS testing of autologous leukocytes, each personalized vaccine is created using up to 20 stimulatory synthetic long peptides adjuvanted with poly-ICLC. The immunogenicity pilot includes 8 patients in remission (NED), who received a course of GEN-009 monotherapy.</p><p id="Par5032"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5033">Eight patients have participated and reached the primary immunogenicity readout at day 50 (some data pending). The 24 doses given across all patients have induced only grade 1/2 adverse events consistent with those expected from the poly-ICLC adjuvant alone, and no DLTs. ATLAS results show high interpatient variability as described previously. In an interim analysis of patients, vaccination has generated both CD8 and CD4 T cell responses measured by ex vivo fluorospot (Table 1). Ten-day in vitro stimulation (IVS) fluorospot assays confirm even broader immune responses. Overall, T cell responses were measured to 98% of administered peptides.</p><p id="Par5034"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5035">GEN-009 is a neoantigen vaccine that targets tumor specific immune antigens recognized by the individual patient’s lymphocytes and likely expressed by tumor cells.

ADP-A2M4CD8 are autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells that express a high affinity MAGE-A4-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) and an additional CD8α co-receptor. The ADP-A2M4 TCR is being explored in a pilot study (NCT03132922), where clinical responses have been observed and the TCR has been well tolerated in doses up to 10 × 10^9 transduced cells. Because CD4+ T-cells have a weak effector function in response to class I antigens, a CD8α co-receptor was genetically engineered alongside the TCR in ADP-A2M4CD8, to increase TCR binding avidity and enhance the polyfunctional response of engineered CD4+ T-cells against MAGE-A4+ tumors. This approach is intended to widen the immune response to the tumor and improve depth and durability of clinical responses.</p><p id="Par5075"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5076">This phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial (SURPASS Trial) will characterize safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity across multiple tumor types.

Up to 30 patients will be enrolled.</p><p id="Par5077">Following apheresis, T-cells are isolated, transduced with CD8α_MAGE-A4c1032TCR, and expanded. Prior to ADP-A2M4CD8 infusion, patients will receive lymphodepletion consisting of fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day x 4 days) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2/day x 3 days). During dose escalation, patients will be treated in one of three ADP-A2M4CD8 dose groups. The initial dose of ADP-A2M4CD8 will be 0.8 × 10^9 - 1.2 × 10^9 to be escalated to 1.2 × 10^9 - 3 × 10^9 and then to 3.0 × 10^9 - 6.0 × 10^9 transduced cells in a modified 3 + 3 dose escalation scheme. Patients will be monitored for dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). Once the tolerability and safety of the lymphodepletion regimen and cell dose has been demonstrated, the dose range will increase to a maximum of 10 × 10^9 transduced cells in the expansion phase. Disease will be assessed per RECIST v1.1 by CT/MRI at weeks 4, 8, 16, and 24, and every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months up to 15 years or until progression.

Interleukin-7(IL-7), a homeostatic cytokine of T lymphocytes, plays a critical and non-redundant role in T cell development and homeostasis of mature T lymphocytes. IL-7 is a potent amplifier of naïve and memory T cells, thereby correcting T cell deficiency and contributing to immune reconstitution. This may result in significant clinical benefit when combined with lymphopenia-inducing radiation/chemotherapy or immunotherapy where anti-tumor effects are mediated by T cells.</p><p id="Par5097"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5098">A phase 1b study was conducted to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single-agent GX-I7(human IL-7 fused to the half-life extension hyFcTM) administered intramuscularly q3w to advanced solid cancer patients who have no available effective treatments (n=21). The dose escalation phase followed the 3+3 design of GX-I7 doses ranged from 60 to 1,200 μg/kg. Adverse events, PK, and subset analysis of peripheral blood monocytes(PBMCs) were evaluated.</p><p id="Par5099"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5100">GX-I7 was well tolerated without DLT and cytokine release syndrome. Injection site reactions were the most common treatment-emergent adverse events, which were Grade1 or 2 and resolved. GX-I7 was slowly but steadily absorbed with a Tmax range of 12-48 hours with delay in higher doses. Following GX-I7 administration, up to 4-fold increase in absolute lymphocyte count(ALC) were demonstrated. Importantly, the number of various subsets(naïve, TEM, TCM and TEMRA) of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was in a greater magnitude than that of ALC, coupled with enhanced expression of Ki-67 peaked at day 7. Among T cell subsets, increase in naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was most prominent. IL-7 receptor alpha(CD127) expression was reduced during the first week, and recovered to baseline after 2~3 weeks post GX-I7 administration. CCR5 expression in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased transiently in a dose dependent manner, suggesting GX-I7 promotes migration of T cell to tumor environment. No apparent increases in the number of other immune cells (NK cell, monocytes, B cells) were observed.</p><p id="Par5101"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5102">A 3-week interval repeated IM administration of GX-I7 appears to be well tolerated in dose range of 60 – 1,200 μg/kg in advanced solid cancer patients. Following GX-I7 administration, dose-dependent increase of ALC and T cell subsets(not Treg) were observed. These findings suggest that GX-I7 can be an excellent combination partner for chemo-radiation, cancer vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies, by increasing T lymphocytes and thereby contributing to enhanced anti-tumor effects.</p><p id="Par5103"><bold>Trial Registration</bold></p><p id="Par5104">ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03478995</p><p id="Par5105"><bold>Ethics Approval</bold></p><p id="Par5106">The study was approved by the Severance Hospital, Asan Medical center, and Catholic Medical Center Institutional Review Board, protocol number GX-I7-CA-003.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1687"><title>P426 A first-in-human phase 1, multicenter trial of toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 agonist DSP-0509 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in adult patients with advanced solid tumors</title><sec id="Sec1688"><title>Jared Weiss, MD<sup>2</sup>, Anthony Olszanski, MD, RPh<sup>3</sup>, Jordan Berlin, MD<sup>4</sup>, Makoto Origuchi<sup>5</sup>, Zhonggai Li<sup>5</sup>, Bella Ertik<sup>5</sup>, Hongliang Cai<sup>5</sup>, Daniel Clancy<sup>5</sup>, Jose Iglesias<sup>6</sup>, Vivek Subbiah, MD<sup>7</sup>, Shadia Jalal, MD<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1689"><title><sup>1</sup>Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, United States; <sup>2</sup>UNC School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, United States; <sup>3</sup>Fox Chase Cancer Center, Phildelphia, PA, United States; <sup>4</sup>Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States; <sup>5</sup>Boston Biomedical Inc, Cambridge, MA, United States; <sup>6</sup>Former employee, Boston Biomedical Inc, Cambridge, MA, United States; <sup>7</sup>University of Texas, Houston, TX, United States</title><sec id="Sec1690"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Shadia Jalal (sjalal@iu.edu)</title><p id="Par5107"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par5108">DSP-0509 is a TLR7 agonist designed to have high water solubility allowing for intravenous (IV) administration and has rapid elimination, partially due to excretion via organic anion transporting peptide transporters.

Mesothelin (MSLN) is a tumor antigen overexpressed in malignant mesothelioma, ovarian carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, lung cancer, and triple negative breast cancer with limited expression in normal tissues. HPN536 is a recombinant polypeptide of ~50kDa containing three humanized antibody-derived binding domains, targeting mesothelin (for tumor binding), albumin (for half-life extension) and CD3 (for T cell engagement). It has been engineered to be a small, globular protein to enable efficient exposure in solid tumor tissue with prolonged half-life and excellent stability under physiological conditions. HPN536 binds monomerically to CD3 and MSLN, minimizing non-specific T-cell activation. These features are designed to widen the therapeutic index compared to earlier generations of T cell engagers by minimizing off target toxicities. HPN536 mediates potent target tumor cell killing in a MSLN-specific manner in vitro and in xenograft models in the presence of T cells. Consistent with its mechanism of action (MOA), tumor cell killing is accompanied by T cell activation, cytokine induction, and T cell expansion.</p><p id="Par5143"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5144">This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, clinical activity, and pharmacokinetics of HPN536 in adult patients with advanced cancers expressing mesothelin who have failed standard available therapy. This study will be divided into 2 parts: Dose Escalation (Part 1) and Expansion (Part 2). Eligible patients with ovarian cancer will be enrolled in Dose Escalation. Dose expansion will include patients with ovarian cancer, pancreatic carcinoma and mesothelioma. HPN536 is administered once weekly as one-hour IV infusion by single-patient cohorts until either a Grade ≥2 adverse event (AE) that is possibly related to HPN536 is observed or an estimated therapeutic dose level has been reached. Then a conventional 3+3 design will be implemented. Dose escalation will continue until a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined. In dose expansion, up to 20 patients per group receive HPN536 at the established RP2D based on a Simon 2-stage design. Patients may continue weekly HPN536 treatment cycles until disease progression. Primary endpoints are number and severity of DLTs following treatment with escalating doses of HPN536 during escalation, and overall response rate (by RECIST v1.1 for ovarian and pancreatic, mRECIST v1.1 for mesothelioma) in dose expansion. Secondary endpoints include AEs, preliminary anti-tumor activity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters based on the proposed MOA of HPN536.</p><p id="Par5145"><bold>Trial Registration</bold></p><p id="Par5146">NCT03872206</p><p id="Par5147"><bold>Ethics Approval</bold></p><p id="Par5148">This study was approved by each participating institution's Institutional Review Board.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1703"><title>P430 Open-label, multicenter phase 1/2 dose escalation and expansion study of THOR-707 as a single agent and in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor in adult subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors</title><sec id="Sec1704"><title>David Luo<sup>1</sup>, Raghad Abdul-Karim, MD<sup>2</sup>, Arun Azad, MD<sup>3</sup>, Joanna Bendell, MD<sup>4</sup>, Hui Gan, MBBS PhD<sup>5</sup>, Filip Janku, MD, PhD<sup>6</sup>, Shiraj Sen, MD, PhD<sup>7</sup>, Tira Tan, MBBS<sup>8</sup>, Judy Wang, MD<sup>9</sup>, Lisa Schechet<sup>1</sup>, Lauren Baker, PhD<sup>1</sup> , Joseph Leveque, MD<sup>1</sup>, Tarek Meniawy, MBBS FRACP<sup>10</sup></title><sec id="Sec1705"><title><sup>1</sup>Synthorx Inc, La Jolla, CA, United States; <sup>2</sup>NEXT Oncology, Texas Oncology, San Antonio, TX, United States; <sup>3</sup>Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Austrailia; <sup>4</sup>Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Nashville, TN, United States; <sup>5</sup>Austin Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; <sup>6</sup>University of TX, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States; <sup>7</sup>Sarah Cannon Research Institute at HealthONE, Houston, TX, United States; <sup>8</sup>National Cancer Centre Singapore, Toronto, Canada; <sup>9</sup>Florida Cancer Specialists, Sarasota, FL, United States; <sup>10</sup>Linear Clinical Research, Nedlands, WA, Australia</title><sec id="Sec1706"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Lauren Baker (lbaker@synthorx.com)</title><p id="Par5149"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par5150">Recombinant interleukin-2 (aldesleukin), an approved immunotherapy in metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma, can induce complete durable responses in some patients. The anti-neoplastic properties of IL-2 are mediated by activation of effector memory T cells and newly recruited naïve CD8+ T cells against the tumor. The widespread use of IL-2 has been limited due to its high affinity bias for the IL-2 receptor alpha chain (IL-2R⍺) on regulatory CD4+ T cells, leading to immunosuppression and, eosinophilic recruitment and activation on innate lymphoid cells in the vascular endothelium causing vascular leak syndrome (VLS). THOR-707 is a recombinant human IL-2 variant that is site-specifically pegylated, providing a “not alpha” pharmacologic profile designed to prevent engagement of IL-2R⍺, thereby providing an improved safety profile while still promoting newly recruited and effector memory T cell anti-tumor activity In preclinical studies, eosinophilia was not observed at a doses 10-fold higher than the dose responsible for eliciting maximal expansion of peripheral CD8+ T cells. Based on these findings, a first-in-human study of THOR-707 was started in June 2019.</p><p id="Par5151"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5152">This open-label, multicenter, dose escalation and expansion study in adult subjects with advanced or metastatic solid tumors will evaluate THOR-707 as a single agent and in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor.

CD73 knockout mice exhibit reduced tumor growth and resistance to experimental metastasis. Inhibition of CD73 activity with an anti-CD73 antibody blocks adenosine production, shown to inhibit tumor growth in syngeneic models. Dual inhibition of CD73 and A2aR improves anti-tumor immune responses in mouse tumor models[1]. CPI-006 is a humanized IgG1 Fc gamma receptor binding-deficient anti-CD73 antibody that has a dual mechanism of action. It blocks CD73 catalytic activity and adenosine production. In addition, it has immunomodulatory activity on CD73 positive immune cells including B cells, T cells and antigen presenting cells. CPI-006 relieves adenosine-mediated immunosuppression in vitro as a single agent and in combination with ciforadenant[2]. CPI-006 is now being investigated in this Phase 1/1b multicenter, open label trial as single agent (SA), in combination with ciforadenant, an oral, small molecule, selective A2aR antagonist and in combination with pembrolizumab, an anti-PD1 indicated for the treatment of patients across a number of malignancies (NCT03454451).</p><p id="Par5188"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5189">Up to 462 subjects will be enrolled at approximately 35 sites in the US, Canada and Australia.

Study details is presented in Figure 1.</p><p id="Par5190">The primary objective of the dose escalation is to assess safety/ tolerability, MTD or MDL of CPI-006 SA, in combination with ciforadenant and with pembrolizumab in ascending dose levels. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the PK of CPI-006 as SA or in combinations and analyze potential predictive biomarkers. In dose escalation, the primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of CPI-006 SA and in combinations in patients with selected advanced cancers. Secondary endpoints include efficacy; PK of CPI-006 as SA and in combinations and to evaluate the relationship between biomarkers and clinical activity.</p><p id="Par5191"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par5192">1.

However, systemic administration of immunotherapy may have limited activity in some tumors partly due to failure of activated T cells to migrate to tumor[1]. Intratumoral injections (ITI) may allow high concentration of immunostimulatory products locally while using small amounts of drugs. This may also facilitate multiple combination therapies and avoid systemic off-target toxicities. By capitalizing on existing data and experience, repurposing approved drugs for cancer represents an opportunity to rapidly advance promising therapies.</p><p id="Par5199">Glatiramer acetate is an agent commonly used for multiple sclerosis[2]. It acts as an immunomodulator and has essentially no systemic bioavailability but exhibits a high prevalence of injection site reactions[2]. It upregulates the activity of natural killer cells in leukemia cell lines [3], suggesting potential for immunostimulatory effect for ITI. For percutaneously accessible tumors for which the standard of care is surgical resection without any neoadjuvant therapy, there exists a window of opportunity where ITI of glatiramer can be performed before surgery.</p><p id="Par5200"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5201">This is a proof-of-concept, investigator-initiated, window of opportunity trial in subjects with percutaneously accessible head and neck or cutaneous squamous cell cancer who are to undergo surgery. Subjects will receive glatiramer 40 mg by ITI 3 times a week prior to surgery. Subjects will receive at least one dose and up to 3 doses of glatiramer. About 10 eligible patients will be included in this trial. Safety data will be collected. Tumor tissue at the time of diagnosis and at the time of surgery will be collected and compared for biomarkers. Primary endpoint is safety. Secondary endpoint is effect of ITI of glatiramer on biomarker levels. Pre- and post-treatment tumor samples will be tested using an immunology panel that profiles immunology genes and proteins including major classes of cytokines, interferons, KIR family, and TNF-receptor. Tumors samples will also be evaluated for the Ki-67 proliferative index and for caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 immunoexpression. Paired T-test or the Wilcoxon signed rank test will be used to assess the changes in the variables. We hypothesize that this approach will break the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment as evidenced by an increase in inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and immune cell infiltration. Decline in Ki-67 and increase in caspase-3 may be a signal of anti-tumor activity.</p><p id="Par5202"><bold>Trial Registration</bold></p><p id="Par5203">NCT03982212</p><p id="Par5204"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par5205">1.

Patients must have progressed on or since last treatment; have measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow ≤5 target lesions/organ [10 total]) or the RANO criteria (GBM only), assessed locally and confirmed by blinded independent central review (BICR); ECOG performance score 0–1, adequately controlled blood pressure, and must have provided a tumor sample evaluable for PD-L1; and must not have immunodeficiency, active central nervous system metastases (except in GBM cohort), or be on steroid therapy (patients with GBM may be on dexamethasone ≤2 mg/day orally or equivalent and stable for 5 days at the time of enrollment).

Patients with confirmed complete response may discontinue after ≥24 weeks combination therapy and ≥2 pembrolizumab doses after initial complete response date. Tumor imaging will occur at baseline, Q9W (or for GBM patients: Q6W until 18 weeks, then Q9W) for the first 54 weeks, Q12W until week 102 (~2 years), and Q24W thereafter using RECIST v1.1/RANO by investigator assessment in the initial cohorts and by BICR after cohort expansion.

Vopratelimab (JTX-2011) is an IgG1 ICOS agonist monoclonal antibody known to activate and proliferate primed CD4 T effector cells in vitro, with established preclinical efficacy in multiple tumor models. In the Phase 1/2 ICONIC trial (NCT02904226), vopratelimab in patients with advanced solid tumors (Yap 2019) has shown to be safe and well tolerated as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab. The ICONIC study showed no correlation between tumor reductions and ICOS and PD-L1 levels in pre-treatment tumor samples by IHC. However, emergence of peripheral blood ICOS High (hi) CD4 T effector cells following treatment with vopratelimab +/- nivolumab was associated with tumor reductions and improved PFS and OS. In addition, ex vivo antigen recall studies (Hanson 2018) showed that soluble vopratelimab stimulated a polyfunctional cytokine response only in CD4 T cells that were ICOS hi, further supporting the hypothesis that vopratelimab induces activation and proliferation of CD4 T effector cells only after an initial priming event induces an ICOS hi CD4 T cell phenotype. Furthermore, in melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, a sustained increase in the frequency of ICOS-positive CD4 T cells correlated with clinical benefit and survival (Carthon 2010). In contrast, emergence of these ICOS hi cells has not been noted with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (Hanson 2018). We hypothesized that the combination of vopratelimab with ipilimumab will enhance the presence and functionality of ICOS hi CD4 T effector cells, thereby potentially increasing the likelihood of clinical benefit.</p><p id="Par5237"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5238">This open label, multi-center, phase 2 study will evaluate efficacy, safety, PK, and exploratory pharmacodynamics of vopratelimab in combination with ipilimumab in adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer or urothelial cancer who have been previously treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.

However, as tumor cells proliferate and metastasize in an increasingly hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME), tumors increasingly utilize fatty acid oxidation (FAO) as glucose stores are depleted. FAO supports both tumor growth and suppressive immune cells in the TME, facilitating tumor progression. PPARα is a ligand-activated nuclear transcription factor which regulates lipid metabolism, FAO and inflammation. TPST-1120 is a first in class, oral, selective PPARα antagonist that blocks transcription of PPARα target genes leading to a metabolic shift from FAO to glycolysis. Antagonism of FAO in the TME leads to direct killing of tumor cells dependent on FAO and facilitates the cytotoxicity of effector cells. Preclinical studies with various tumor models demonstrate efficacy of TPST-1120 as monotherapy and in combination with anti-PD1 antibodies and chemotherapy. TPST-1120 has an IC50 of 0.04 nM with a &gt;35 fold selectivity over other PPAR isoforms.</p><p id="Par5257"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5258">We have initiated a phase 1/1b multicenter, open label trial to evaluate TPST-1120 as a SA and in combination (combo) with other systemic therapies including nivolumab, an anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody; docetaxel, a cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent and cetuximab, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody. The objectives are to 1) evaluate safety and tolerability of continuous dosing of TPST-1120 2) identify a recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) 3) evaluate efficacy, and 4) evaluate PK/PD parameters. Eligibility criteria: 1) patients with advanced non-small cell lung, hepatocellular, renal cell, triple-negative breast, urothelial, pancreatic, gastro-esophageal, castration-resistant prostate, head and neck, or MSS colorectal cancer, or cholangiocarcinoma, or sarcoma; and 2) 1-5 prior therapies for metastatic disease. This phase 1/1b adaptive design is composed of Dose Escalation (DEs) and Dose Expansion (DEx) cohorts. DEs consist of 4 arms, 1 SA arm and 3 combination arms in which TPST-1120 is combined with nivolumab, docetaxel or cetuximab. The RP2D of TPST-1120 to proceed to DEx will be determined by safety and biomarkers including analysis of FAO/PPARα gene expression in the peripheral blood and in tumor biopsies. The DEx arms will follow a 2-stage expansion design. This trial began accrual in May 2018 at U.S sites and is currently enrolling into the Monotherapy/Dose Escalation cohort. Expansion cohorts are projected to open in early 2019. The total sample size is up to 338 pts.</p><p id="Par5259"><bold>Trial Registration</bold></p><p id="Par5260">NCT03829436</p><p id="Par5261"><bold>Ethics Approval</bold></p><p id="Par5262">This study is being conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the Helsinki Declaration and has been approved by the Western IRB/Copernicus Group, tracking # 20190182.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1747"><title>P441 ARTISTRY-2: a phase 1/2 study of subcutaneously administrated ALKS 4230 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors</title><sec id="Sec1748"><title>John Powderly, MD, CPI<sup>1</sup>, Bradley Carthon, MD, PhD<sup>2</sup>, Marc Ernstoff, MD<sup>3</sup>, Anthony Olszanski, MD, RPh<sup>4</sup>, Stephen Liu, MD<sup>5</sup>, Kelly Curtis, MD<sup>6</sup>, Yangchun Du, PhD<sup>7</sup>, Lei Sun, PhD<sup>7</sup>, Emily Putiri, PhD<sup>7</sup>, Yan Wang, PhD<sup>7</sup>, Heather Losey, PhD<sup>7</sup>, Bruce Dezube, MD<sup>7</sup>, Ulka Vaishampayan, MD<sup>8</sup></title><sec id="Sec1749"><title><sup>1</sup>Carolina BioOncology, Huntersville, NC, United States; <sup>2</sup>Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States; <sup>3</sup>Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY, United States; <sup>4</sup>Fox Chase Cancer Center, Phildelphia, PA, United States; <sup>5</sup>Georgetown University, Washington, DC, United States; <sup>6</sup>Syneos Health, Phoenix, AZ, United States; <sup>7</sup>Alkermes, Inc., Waltham, MA, United States; <sup>8</sup>Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit, MI, United States</title><sec id="Sec1750"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Bruce Dezube (bruce.dezube@alkermes.com)</title><p id="Par5263"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par5264">ALKS 4230 is an engineered fusion protein of circularly permuted interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2 receptor α (IL-2Rα) designed to selectively bind the intermediate-affinity IL-2R for selective expansion of natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells (Figures 1 and 2). Compared with recombinant human IL-2, ALKS 4230 exhibited enhanced pharmacokinetic and selective pharmacodynamic properties in mice, resulting in improved antitumor efficacy [1]. Intravenous dosing of ALKS 4230 is being studied in the ARTISTRY-1 trial of patients with advanced solid tumors (NCT02799095), which has more than 50 patients enrolled to date [2]. Here, we present a study investigating ALKS 4230 administered subcutaneously. Potential advantages of subcutaneous dosing over intravenous include: (i) lower peak serum drug concentrations with a prolonged exposure profile, which may result in a milder safety profile and improved tolerability; (ii) lymphatic absorption, which may facilitate direct immunologic effects; and (iii) a more convenient dosing schedule than daily inpatient intravenous dosing.</p><p id="Par5265"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5266">ARTISTRY-2 (NCT03861793) is a phase 1/2 study of ALKS 4230 administered subcutaneously as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced solid tumors. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In the first part (dose escalation; phase 1), multiple ascending doses of ALKS 4230 will be administered subcutaneously every 7 days (q7d) or every 21 days (q21d) during a 6-week lead-in period. Injection site locations will include the back of the arm, the thigh, or the abdomen. If the patient has tolerated ALKS 4230 monotherapy treatment, combination therapy with pembrolizumab (200 mg) administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes q21d will be added to the ongoing ALKS 4230 regimen. In the second part (dose expansion; phase 2), ALKS 4230 will be administered subcutaneously at the selected recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and dosing schedule from phase 1 in combination with pembrolizumab in 5 tumor-specific cohorts of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, small-cell lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and squamous cell carcinoma of any tissue origin. Additional eligibility criteria for the study include Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1 and adequate bone marrow, liver, and kidney function. Outcomes include RP2D, safety, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics, immunogenicity, and antitumor activity. Efficacy endpoints include overall response rate, disease control rate, duration of response, time to response, and progression-free survival and overall survival at 6- and 12-month milestones.</p><p id="Par5267"><bold>Acknowledgements</bold></p><p id="Par5268">The study is sponsored by Alkermes, Inc.

CD80 provides a well-characterized costimulatory signal by binding to CD28 on the surface of T cells. Following activation, T cells upregulate CTLA4 on the cell surface which binds to CD80 with higher affinity than CD28, disrupts effective CD80-CD28 signaling, and inhibits T-cell activation. FPT155 is a novel CD80 extracellular domain-Fc fusion protein that directly induces T-cell activation and cytokine production by binding to CD28 and de-represses endogenous CD80-CD28 activity in the tumor microenvironment by binding to CTLA4. FPT155 has potent efficacy in syngeneic preclinical tumor models, including some that are not responsive to agents targeting PD-1. FPT155 is not a superagonist as it requires separate, concurrent TCR engagement.</p><p id="Par5280"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5281">FPT155 is being investigated in a multi-center, open-label, first-in-human phase 1 trial. The dose escalation portion of the trial is currently enrolling patients with advanced solid tumors that have progressed after treatment with available therapies. A minimum anticipated biological effect level (MABEL) based approach was used to select the initial dose in humans. Patients receive a fixed dose of FPT155 every three weeks with single-patient accelerated titration cohorts through the first four dose levels of 0.07, 0.21, 0.7 and 2.1 mg and a standard 3+3 dose-escalation design for the subsequent 7, 21, 42, and 70mg dose levels. The primary objective of the phase 1a portion of the trial is to determine the recommended dose and evaluate the safety and tolerability of FPT155.</p><p id="Par5282"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5283">As of June 17, 2019, 7 patients have been treated on study with FPT155 doses ranging from 0.07-7mg; median age was 58 years, 57% had ECOG PS 1 and median number of prior therapies was 4 (range: 2-8). To date, no dose-limiting toxicities or ≥Grade 3 treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) from causes other than disease progression have been reported.

While many HPV-associated cancers can be eradicated by multimodal therapies, recurrent diseases have dismal prognosis [2,3]. HPV-positive tumors express viral antigens (E6 and E7) that are recognized by HPV-specific T cells (HPVST). We are evaluating the adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded autologous HPVSTs for the treatment of HPV-positive cancers in a phase I clinical trial (HESTIA). To date, 12 patients have been treated and promising outcomes have been attained- 1 complete response and 1 partial response, with minimal toxicities at the dose levels studied (1×108 HPVSTs/m2) so far. However, most patients remained with disease after infusion. A great challenge for HPVST therapy is to generate more specific and potent HPVSTs as ~30% of our HPVST products failed the potency criterion, evaluated by γ-IFN ELISpot assay. The aim of this work was to increase the potency and success rate of HPVST manufacturing.</p><p id="Par5305"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5306">The current manufacturing strategy uses peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as starting material for the enrichment and expansion of HPVSTs, in the presence of dendritic cells and cytokines. Either low frequency or anergy of HPVSTs, even in HPV-exposed donors, impede growth, and manufacturing failure is largely attributed to non-specific T cell outgrowth. To overcome this problem, we evaluated CD45RA depletion of PBMCs to remove the bulk of non-specific cells (naïve T cells and natural killer (NK) cells). The CD45RA fraction also contains B-cells and T regulatory cells that may inhibit specific outgrowth. We also evaluated the use of an HLA-negative universal lymphoblastoid cell line (uLCL), developed in our center, as a co-stimulatory cell line to rapidly expand the cells while maintaining HPV specificity.</p><p id="Par5307"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5308">HPVSTs manufactured using CD45RA negative PBMC populations as starting material consistently displayed overarchingly higher specificity than HPVSTs manufactured from PBMCs. Interestingly, uLCLs not only supported exponential growth of HPVSTs, but increased their HPV specificity, opening the possibility of producing sufficient HPVSTs for higher dose levels. We reported successful production using PBMC from HPV-exposed healthy donors and cancer patients, and greatly improved HPVST specificity in all.</p><p id="Par5309"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5310">These changes will be incorporated in our HPVST manufacturing protocol with the goal of improving the anti-tumor activity of our product.</p><p id="Par5311"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par5312">1.

Yet, the clinical efficacy is limited due to the complexed immune suppressive mechanisms in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Regulatory T (Treg) cells, an immune suppressive subset of CD4+ T cells, are abundant in tumor tissues and play a key role as an immune suppressive mechanism in the TME via inhibiting effective antitumor immunity. While various Treg cell-targeted reagents is under development, none of them have not been translated into the clinic due to the difficulty of specific Treg cell depletion in the TME. The major obstacle to develop effective Treg cell-targeted reagents was the lack of molecules specifically expressed by Treg cells in the TME. We therefore focused on the specific signal(s) used in Treg cells in the TME.</p><p id="Par5331"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5332">We focused on HSP90 inhibitor, TAS-116 as a Treg cell regulator, especially terminally-differentiated effector Treg cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were treated with TAS-116, and the changes in T cell populations including Treg cells were analyzed. In addition, we explored the mechanism(s) of Treg cell reduction using PBMCs and FoxP3+ T cell lines. The effect of TAS-116 on tumor antigen (NY-ESO-1)-specific CD8+ T cells was also examined.

TAS-116 augmented tumor antigen-specific CD8+　T cells in animal models with reduction of Treg cells in the TME.

In preclinical studies, ALKS 4230 exhibited enhanced pharmacokinetic and selective pharmacodynamic properties with improved antitumor efficacy relative to IL-2 [1].</p><p id="Par5343"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5344">ARTISTRY-1 (NCT02799095) is a phase 1/2 study investigating ALKS 4230 as monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab in adults with advanced solid tumors [2]. For monotherapy dose escalation, ALKS 4230 is administered intravenously over 30 minutes once daily for 5 days every 14 or 21 days. For combination therapy, the same regimen of ALKS 4230 is administered with pembrolizumab every 21 days in cohorts based on tumor type, prior anti-PD-1 therapy, and rollover from monotherapy. Outcomes include the monotherapy recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), safety, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity (RECIST 1.1). Results of the completely enrolled cohorts of dose-escalation phase and of combination therapy in anti-PD-1-unapproved tumors as of June 21, 2019, are presented.</p><p id="Par5345"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5346">For dose escalation, 36 patients received ALKS 4230 monotherapy ≤6 μg/kg/d. Maximum tolerated dose has not been reached. Most frequent adverse events (AEs), regardless of relationship, were pyrexia (75%) and chills (72%); the majority were grades 1 or 2. Grade ≥3 AEs related to ALKS 4230 occurred in 11 patients (31%) and were mainly transient leukopenia. One death from aspiration pneumonia was considered unrelated to ALKS 4230 by the investigator. ALKS 4230 induced dose-dependent increases in circulating NK and CD8+ T cells with minimal, non-dose-dependent effects on regulatory T cells (Tregs). At 3 and 6 μg/kg/d, 8 of 14 patients with evaluable scans had stable disease. One patient with heavily pretreated pancreatic adenocarcinoma had prolonged stable disease with 6+ months of monotherapy; CA19-9 decreased from 2571 U/mL (pretherapy) to 673 U/mL (nadir). Data from 20 patients enrolled in the combination therapy cohort of PD-1-unapproved tumors indicate no new toxicities; 7 of 11 patients with evaluable scans had stable disease or better. One patient (ovarian cancer) had confirmed partial response; CA-125 normalized from a peak of 282 to 24.5 U/mL after 2 months of therapy.</p><p id="Par5347"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5348">ALKS 4230 is a promising agent with acceptable tolerability and preliminary clinical benefit.

IL-7 is a critical homeostatic factor for T cells, acting on T cells to increase their number, diversity and functionality. TJ107 could play a pivotal role in reconstitution and reinvigoration of T cell immunity in cancer patients, providing unique opportunities for immuno-oncology combination strategies. The aim of this study (NCT04001075) is to determine the safety, tolerability and PKPD profile of TJ107 in Chinese cancer patients.</p><p id="Par5393"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5394">This ongoing study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK profile, and anti-tumor activity of TJ107 in patients with advanced solid tumors who failed standard therapy. Patients receive TJ107 every 4 weeks by intramuscular (IM) injection. Dose escalation is aided by a 3+3 scheme from 240μg/kg to 1200μg/kg. A dose expansion cohort is being planned after the RP2D is determined. Safety is assessed by monitoring AEs and the associated grades per NCI CTCAE v5.0.

The preliminary PK results shows that TJ107 was rapidly absorbed and reached serum peak concentration around 24 hours post-dose. TJ107 was slowly cleared from the body and remained detectable in serum until Day 14 post-dose. A substantial increase in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) from baseline was observed and peaked around 3 to 4 weeks post first dose. FACS analysis revealed increases in CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

In a phase I clinical study of tebentafusp in cutaneous and 19 UM patients, serum IFNg-induced chemokines, particularly CXCL10, were induced by tebentafusp and high induced levels correlated with OS and tumor reduction.

In the pilot study of 1st generation TARP peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccination (TARP DC vaccine, NCT00972309, N= 41) utilizing TARP WT 27-35 and epitope enhanced EE29-37-9V in HLA-A*0201 positive men with stage D0 prostate cancer (PSA biochemical recurrence) published by Wood et al, the vaccine was found to be immunogenic and safe [2]. TARP vaccination was also associated with a decreased slope log PSA in more than 70 % of the patients at 24 and 48 weeks and a decrease in calculated tumor growth rate constant. Standard of care in D0 prostate cancer ranges from watchful waiting, salvage radiation and anti-androgen therapy without strong evidence to support one or the other. In the current study of multi-epitope (ME)-TARP DC vaccines, 5 overlapping 18-20-mer peptides encompassing the full sequence of TARP are added to 1st generation TARP peptides to pulse the autologous DCs.

Paclitaxel is a chemotherapy drug which stabilises microtubules and it is widely used in combination with platinum-based chemotherapies against multiple indications. Building on the recent evidence that chemotherapy positively combines with immunotherapy [1], this study was designed to evaluate the potential of combining Paclitaxel with ImmTAC-mediated T cell activation.</p><p id="Par5564"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5565">In vitro assays to assess T cell-mediated lysis, T cell expansion, and cytokine release in response to ImmTAC-mediated T cell redirection were performed with a range of ImmTAC concentrations and/or Paclitaxel. T cell-mediated lysis of antigen positive cells was monitored in real time while Granzyme A and B, IL-2, IL-8, IL-10, IFN-γ, TNF-α, MIP-1α, IP-10, and MIG were measured in cell culture supernatants. T cell expansion was measured by flow cytometry.</p><p id="Par5566"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5567">ImmTAC molecules were highly effective at redirecting T cells to proliferate, produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and granzymes, and to lyse antigen positive targets. ImmTAC-Paclitaxel combination showed substantially enhanced lysis of target cells compared to either agent alone (in both magnitude and kinetics). With 100 pM ImmTAC and 25 nM Paclitaxel, the median cytolysis area under the curve using the compounds in combination was 6269 compared to 3782 for Paclitaxel alone or 3196 for ImmTAC alone. Additionally, the time it took to lyse 80% of target cells decreased from 84 hours for ImmTAC alone to 51 hours when in combination with Paclitaxel. Despite enhanced killing, some reduction of cytokine release and T cell proliferation were observed when ImmTAC and Paclitaxel were combined. Notably, cytokine secretion and T cell proliferation were restored, and improved killing maintained by pre-treating target cells with Paclitaxel. Similarly, pre-treatment of effector T cells with Paclitaxel did not impact their ability to kill and proliferate in response to ImmTAC.</p><p id="Par5568"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5569">These in vitro studies show enhanced ImmTAC-mediated tumour cell lysis with Paclitaxel when administered either in combination with ImmTAC or sequentially.

Additional studies have suggested that sequencing of therapies impacts outcomes. Several small case series have described clinical outcomes in patients treated with chemotherapy after immunotherapy, but these have often included patients treated with a variety of cytotoxic regimens such that comparison to historical controls is difficult.

However, objective response rates remain low, suggesting that novel therapeutics and/or combination treatments are needed. At the same time, non-immuno-oncology therapeutic approaches such as chemotherapy remain standard of care for many malignancies. ALPN-202 is a variant CD80 vIgD™-Fc fusion that mediates PD-L1-dependent CD28 costimulation and inhibits the PD-L1 and CTLA-4 checkpoints. This novel mechanism of action provides potent single agent immunomodulatory activity in mouse tumor models, and thus has the potential to complement other therapeutic modalities, such as checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapies.</p><p id="Par5614"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5615">Mice were implanted subcutaneously with human (hu) PD-L1-transduced MC38 colon carcinoma and B16-F10 melanoma cell lines.

When the checkpoint inhibitors or chemotherapy were administered in combination with ALPN-202, significantly greater reductions in tumor growth over time were observed than with any of these agents alone (Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively). Furthermore, ALPN-202 was extremely effective (92% tumor growth inhibition) in improving the anti-tumor activity of anti-PD-1 mAb in mice bearing huPD-L1+ B16-F10 tumors, a tumor that is known to be poorly immunogenic and treatment-recalcitrant (Figure 3). RNA-Seq analysis of tumors from the MC38 studies was performed to explore in-depth the mechanisms, including enhancement of T cell effector transcript expression, that play a role in the ability of ALPN-202 to provide anti-tumor immunity and to enhance the activity of checkpoint inhibitors and the chemotherapeutic oxaliplatin.</p><p id="Par5618"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5619">ALPN-202 demonstrates potent anti-tumor efficacy as monotherapy and significantly improves the anti-tumor activity of other only modestly effective treatment modalities, such as checkpoint-only blockade mAbs and chemotherapy.

Immunotherapy (IT) trials with immune check-point inhibitors did not achieve significant gain of survival yet [1]. However, some CT agents, such as gemcitabine (GEM), have several immune modulating effects [2] and starting from the hypothesis that more immunogenic antigens can be induced by CT treatment, its ability to increase the susceptibility of PDA to IT was evaluated.</p><p id="Par5635"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5636">Sera from 28 PDA patients before and after CT (BCT and ACT respectively) were profiled by serological proteome analysis (SERPA) [3]; the recognized TAAs were identified by mass spectrometry and confirmed by ELISA. The proliferation, phenotype and cytokine production of T cells were evaluated on patients’ PBMCs from the same cohort after <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with four selected TAAs (ENO1, G3P, K2C8 and FUBP1). Mice that spontaneously develop PDA (KC) were treated with GEM prior of DNA vaccination against ENO1 [4]. Tumor lesions, immune infiltration and the titer of TAAs-specific antibody were evaluated. TAAs-specific IFNγ production from splenocytes was analyzed.</p><p id="Par5637"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5638">The number of TAAs recognized by IgG in PDA patients’ sera, as well as their ability to induce a complement dependent cytotoxicity against PDA cells, was increased in ACT sera. Some identified TAAs showed a positive correlation between the increase of ACT antibody titer and longer patients’ survival. An increased T cell TAAs-specific proliferative response after CT and the evaluation of IFNγ/IL10 ratio was detected, revealing that ATC T cells shifted TAAs-specific responses from regulatory to effector one. After stimulation with TAAs, in mostly patients the ratio between CD8 and CD4 Treg cells was increased in ATC T cells. The role of CT to enhance the TAAs-specific adaptive response prompt us to exploit its effect in combination with the DNA vaccination. Of clinical relevance, KC mice treated with GEM prior of ENO1 DNA vaccination displayed smaller tumor lesions together with an increase of tumor-infiltrating CD4 and CD8, in comparison to mice vaccinated or GEM-treated only. Furthermore, CT increased specific antibodies and IFNγ-producing T cells in vaccinated mice not only against ENO1, the target TAA of vaccination, but also against G3P, suggesting an antigen spreading effect of the combinatory treatment.</p><p id="Par5639"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5640">Overall these data indicated that in pancreatic cancer CT effectively ameliorates T cell responses against TAA and it might be reconsidered to render them suitable targets for IT.</p><p id="Par5641"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par5642">1.

The class I HDAC inhibitor entinostat (Syndax) has been shown to promote significant tumor control in combination with immunotherapies through immune-mediated mechanisms. In addition, we observed that entinostat induces tumor necrosis in murine solid tumors. We hypothesize that entinostat-induced necrosis could be targeted by NHS-IL12 (M9241, Merck KGaA), an IL-12 NHS76 conjugate designed to bind free DNA in regions of tumor death/necrosis, therefore promoting a synergistic anti-tumor effect.

Of note, in the entinostat-treated tumors there were areas of tumor death/necrosis with increased immune cell infiltration identified by H&amp;E staining. Furthermore, initial immunofluorescence studies indicate that NHS-IL12 binds to these areas in the entinostat-treated tumors in vitro.

Converting checkpoint-refractory tumors into checkpoint-responsive tumors is a major challenge for cancer immunotherapy. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a potent cytokine that holds potential to reshape the immune environment in solid tumors. Its clinical utility, however, has been limited by severe toxicities both from systemic administration and from expression by adoptively transferred gene engineered T cells. We report here that adoptive cell therapy (ACT) with T cells carrying surface-tethered DeepTM IL-12 overcomes these challenges, enhances T cell therapeutic efficacy, activates immune cells in the tumor and overcomes resistance to checkpoint blockade.</p><p id="Par5691"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5692">Activity of Deep IL-12 Primed T cells were evaluated in B16-F10 melanoma tumors, a cell line resistant to checkpoint inhibition.

In the tumor, Deep IL-12 repolarized immunosuppressive monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSC) into an immune-activating antigen-presenting cell (APC) phenotype. Consistent with an anti-tumor role for the repolarized M-MDSC, administration of an antibody to deplete these cells reduced the efficacy of Deep IL-12 Primed T cells. Further evaluation revealed high expression of the checkpoint ligand PD-L1 on the repolarized M-MDSC. To test the hypothesis that this limits efficacy of Deep IL-12 Primed T cell ACT, Deep IL-12 Primed T cells were co-administered with PD-L1 blockade.

SIRPa, one of the binding partners of CD47, is a member of the signal-regulatory-protein (SIRP) family which is expressed on many myeloid cells including phagocytic cells. Engagement of SIRPa by CD47 elicits the “do not eat me” signal to prevent phagocytosis of “self” cells by macrophages. Anti-CD47 and anti-SIRPa antibodies that interfere with the CD47-SIRPa interaction have demonstrated promise in clinical trials as new class of therapeutics. Despite such exciting potential, side effects associated with CD47/SIRPa blockade such as anemia may represent a significant toxicity concern. Therefore, evaluation of both efficacy and toxicity of human CD47/SIRPa antibody candidates emerges as one of most actively investigated areas in immuno-oncology in recent years. However, lack of animal models that enable expedient testing of anti-human CD47 or anti-human SIRPa antibodies in vivo has been a limiting factor for CD47/SIRPa antibody development.</p><p id="Par5699"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5700">To accelerate direct efficacy and toxicity testing of anti-human CD47 and SIRPa antibodies, Biocytogen has generated the double humanized mice, B-hSIRPa/hCD47, where the human extracellular domains of SIRPa and CD47 replace their respective murine counterparts.

Further, we also created two triple humanized mouse strains, B-hPD1/hSIRPa/hCD47 and B-hPD-L1/hSIRPa/hCD47, where humanized PD1 and PD-L1 extracellular domains replace their mouse counterparts, respectively, in the B-hSIRPa/hCD47 background.</p><p id="Par5701"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5702">We present here that B-hSIRPa/hCD47 mice were successfully used for screening anti-human CD47 and anti-human SIRPa antibodies for efficacy and toxicity in tumor models of the engineered MC38-hCD47 cell line that expresses human CD47 in MC38 cells. Anti-human CD47 and anti-human SIRPa antibodies were efficacious in controlling MC38-hCD47 tumor growth in B-hSIRPa/hCD47 mice. Varied toxicity profiles were observed in terms of body weight loss, blood cell counts, and blood liver enzyme levels in anti-human CD47 antibody treatments.

Thus, overcoming inhibitory receptor (IR)-mediated tolerance is essential to improve immunotherapeutic responses. Co-expression of PD1 and LAG3 on CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) is associated with an exhausted phenotype, exemplified by a severe defect in cytokine production, cytolytic activity and inability to proliferate. In a number of murine tumor models, dual PD1/LAG3 blockade synergistically limits tumor growth greater than targeting PD1 alone, yet the relative and synergistic contributions of PD1 and LAG3 on CD8+ T cells in preventing effective anti-tumor immunity is unknown.</p><p id="Par5707"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5708">To understand the cellular and mechanistic basis for PD1/LAG3 synergy, conditional knockin mice “surgically dissect” Pdcd1 and/or Lag3 floxed alleles restricted to CD8+ T cells expressing E8ICre.GFP. To allow for intrinsic analysis of PD1 and/or LAG3 on antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, these mice have been generated as a pmel-1 transgenic background, with each mutant strain uniquely congenically marked for use in a co-adoptive transfer system allowing analysis of PD1 and/or LAG3-deficient CD8+ T cells, and controls, in the same host.</p><p id="Par5709"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5710">Mice with CD8+ T cells deficient in PD1 or PD1 and LAG3 (Pdcd1L/L E8ICre.GFP and Pdcd1L/L Lag3L/L-yfp E8ICre.GFP, respectively) show attenuation of B16-F10 tumor growth with improved survival, compared to LAG3-deficient mice (Lag3L/L-yfp E8ICre.GFP) and controls (E8ICre.GFP). CD8+ TIL frequency is increased with loss of PD1, and further increased with loss of both PD1 and LAG3, as a result of enhanced proliferation (Ki67/BrdU) – a phenotype demonstrated to be intrinsically regulated in the co-adoptive transfer system. Although expression of TIM3, TIGIT and 2B4 IRs that normally co-express with PD1 are maintained, CD8+ TIL isolated from Pdcd1L/L E8ICre.GFP and Pdcd1L/L Lag3L/L-yfp E8ICre.GFP show increased functionality (IFNg, TNFa and GzmB release) by flow cytometry.

Moreover, preclinical subcutaneous models appear to be more responsive to therapies than preclinical carcinogen or genetically engineered mouse (GEM) autochthonous models of cancer, or human tumors. To extend immunotherapy to a broader range of tumor types, our strategy is to rationally design combination immunotherapies with the potential to boost innate and adaptive immune responses and overcome immunosuppressive environments characteristic of human tumors. Our regimen includes a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist, cytokines and checkpoint inhibitors.</p><p id="Par5715"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5716">Autochthonous tumors induced by a carcinogen or in GEM models, as well as subcutaneous models derived from the GEM models, were treated with combination immunotherapies.

Targeting TGFb has recently emerged as an exciting new approach to overcome TGFb-mediated resistance to checkpoint cancer immunotherapy [1]. In humans, three isoforms of TGFb (TGFb1, -2 and -3) have been shown to individually drive context-dependent physiological and phenotypic responses [2]. Most current therapeutic TGFb reagents do not adequately distinguish among the three TGFb isoforms and could give rise to on-target off-tumor toxicity, undesirable inflammatory adverse events or lack of activity. To address this unmet need for more selective therapeutic reagents, we generated a panel of murine antibodies with mono-isoform specificity for TGFb1 (13A1) or TGFb3 (1901) and successfully humanized these antibodies, carefully maintaining their selective specificity and neutralization potency [3]. The murine TGFb isoform-specific antibodies enhanced anti-tumor efficacy in-vivo in B16 melanoma and 4T1 breast cancer models [4]. We now expanded our in-vivo studies into the immune-exclusion-type tumor model EMT6, in which a pan-specific TGFb antibody was shown to overcome TGFb mediated resistance to PD-L1 checkpoint therapy [5].</p><p id="Par5726"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5727">Efficacy of the murine TGFb1 antibody 13A1 and a pan-TGFb antibody (1D11) in combination with anti-mPD-L1 were evaluated in established orthotopic EMT6 murine breast carcinomas. Antibody humanization was performed using molecular engineering, combining framework grafting, competitive screening and selective back mutations guided by assaying for TGFb neutralization potency in TMLEC reporter cells. Further humanized 13A1 variants with distinct kinetic properties were generated by error-prone mutagenesis and selective library screening.</p><p id="Par5728"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5729">We found that isoform-specific neutralization of active TGFb1 with mAb 13A1 was highly efficacious in overcoming the low efficacy of PD-L1 checkpoint mono-therapy, enhancing control of tumor growth and increasing survival of mice with established EMT6 tumors. Further, 13A1 appeared at least as potent as the pan-TGFb antibody when combined with anti-PD-L1, highlighting the dominant role played by TGFb1 in this model. Based on these promising data, we have generated novel humanized 13A1 variants with in-vitro characteristics similar to the parental antibody.</p><p id="Par5730"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5731">Isoform-specific blockade of active TGFb1 with antibody 13A1 is as efficacious or better than pan-TGFb blockade in enhancing the anti-tumor efficacy of PD-L1 checkpoint therapy in mice with established EMT6 tumors.

Anti-TNFR2 therapy was distinct from anti-PD1 therapy in showing pronounced regulatory Treg depletion and enhanced Teff infiltration in the tumor microenvironment, demonstrating in vivo specificity for disease-causing cells only in the tumor.</p><p id="Par5762"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5763">Anti-TNFR2 immunotherapy provides benefits in two colon cancer models, both as a single agent and when administered in combination with anti-PD1. Anti-PD1 before anti-TNFR2 was associated with poor outcomes for survival, histology and lack of long-term cure, suggesting that non-specific unleashing of the immune system with anti-PD1 destroys the tumor microenvironment specificity of anti-TNFR2. These results highlight the value of anti-TNFR2 antagonism in vivo in mouse tumor models as solo therapy or as a combination therapy, administered first or concurrently with anti-PD1. This study of new immunotherapy combinations highlights the need to test both single agent therapy as well as the sequencing of combination therapy as new agents are brought forward to the clinic.</p><p id="Par5764"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par5765">1.

Recently, an adenovirus-based vaccine against GUCY2C was tested in a phase I clinical trial where it was found to safely induce GUCY2C-specific immune responses [1]. However, GUCY2C immune responses following immunization wane over time and optimal GUCY2C immunity may require multiple GUCY2C vaccinations. Moreover, repeated vaccination utilizing adenovirus-based vectors is hindered by the production of adenovirus-specific antibodies following first vaccination. For this reason, we have generated a recombinant strain of Listeria monocytogenes secreting GUCY2C (Lm-GUCY2C) to boost GUCY2C immune responses.

Recent reports further indicate that obesity negatively impacts response to targeted anti-VEGF therapy [1] and efficacy of chemotherapeutics [2,3]. However, no studies have yet investigated the impact of obesity on response to immunotherapy in the context of breast cancer. Although paradoxically, obesity has been found to improve response to immunotherapy in a subgroup of patients with melanoma [4,5].</p><p id="Par5784"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5785">Wildtype C57BL/6 female mice were randomized to a high-fat (60%) or low-fat standard chow (14%) diet for 16 weeks to generate diet-induced obese (DIO) or age-matched lean controls, respectively. Animals were then challenged with the syngeneic E0771 mammary carcinoma cell line. Tumor outgrowth was quantified by caliper measurements, bioluminescent imaging (BLI) via firefly luciferase-expressing E0771 (E0771-fLUC) cells, and endpoint tumor weights. Once tumors were palpable, animals were randomized to receive no therapy or immunotherapy consisting of intratumoral CpG co-administered with non-replicative adenovirus (Ad) encoding murine TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL; AdT). Whole tumor immunogenetic gene expression profiles were evaluated using nanoString and immune populations were assessed via multi-parameter flow cytometry.

Notable alterations include significant reductions in the frequency of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and CD19+ B cells; with a simultaneous increase in the frequency of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Following immunotherapy administration, lean animals controlled tumor growth whereas DIO animals experienced progressive tumor growth. Despite these differential tumor outcomes, both lean and DIO animals displayed robust intratumoral effector CD8+ T cell accumulation and ex vivo function. In contrast, immunotherapy reduced the intratumoral accumulation of monocytic and granulocytic MDSCs only in lean animals. Both MDSC populations persisted in the tumors of animals with DIO, resulting in less favorable effector CD8+ T cell to MDSC ratios.</p><p id="Par5788"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5789">Our data implicate obesity as a causal factor in impairing immunotherapeutic efficacy in a pre-clinical model of breast cancer, potentially via accumulation of MDSCs.

These include innate targets such as STING and TLR agonists, co-stimulatory receptor agonists, and type I/II cytokine receptor combinations. To address these limitations, we have engineered a highly attenuated, microbial-based immunotherapy platform called STACT (S. Typhimurium Attenuated Cancer Therapy). Upon IV administration, the microbe traffics to and enriches in the tumor microenvironment. There, it is specifically phagocytosed and lysed by tumor-resident myeloid cells, enabling efficient delivery of plasmids encoding immunomodulatory payloads. Using our proprietary platform, we have generated multiple systemically-administered therapies that target several well-characterized, yet intractable immune pathways. Characterization of STACT microbes encoding constitutively active STING variants (STACT-STING) and IL-2 (STACT-IL2) are provided as examples.</p><p id="Par5800"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5801">The STACT platform strain has been engineered using precision genome modifications for enhanced tolerability, reduced immunosuppressive inflammation, and tumor specificity.

STACT is rapidly phagocytosed and then destroyed by these cells, delivering its plasmid DNA contents encoding immunomodulatory protein expression cassettes. We have measured highly efficient heterologous gene transfer and protein expression within primary mouse and human M2 macrophages treated with STACT, at levels comparable to DNA transfection. Therapeutically relevant levels of IL-2 were measured in the tumor microenvironment of STACT-IL2 treated mice several weeks after dosing. For STACT-STING, significant tumor growth inhibition, including complete tumor regressions were observed, and the therapy was well tolerated.

In mouse models GVAX has little therapeutic benefit as a monotherapy, but when combined with a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 adjuvant, TLR Enhanced GVAX (TEGVAX) significantly reduces tumor burden. Paradoxically, the increased therapeutic benefit of TEGVAX corresponds with a decrease in delivery of tumor antigen to the draining lymph node. In order to improve the efficacy of the TEGVAX platform, it is critical to understand the mechanism by which it induces anti-tumor immune responses. Since TEGVAX requires T cells to work, yet significantly reduces antigen delivery to the draining lymph node, we hypothesize that TEGVAX functions independent of lymph node priming.</p><p id="Par5810"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5811">B16-mOVA cells injected s.c. into B6 mice.

We then determined if TEGVAX required myeloid or NK cells to reduce tumor burden. We found that TEGVAX reduced tumor burden in NK depleted, but not myeloid cell depleted mice. These results raised the question if priming in the draining lymph node was required for therapeutic efficacy of TEGVAX. To determine this, we performed tumor growth studies with mice administered FTY720, which sequesters circulating T cells in lymph nodes. We demonstrated that TEGVAX significantly reduced B16-mOVA tumor growth even in the presence of FTY720 treatment, suggesting T cell priming was not required.

NK cells release increased levels of IFN-gamma and IL-6 at the co-cultured ratios of 1:0.5 and 1:1, and CXCL1 at the 1:1 ratio, as compared to the NK with IL-15/IL-15Ralpha controls. The NK:AgN2a 4P ratios of 1:0.5 and 1:1 induce significantly increased apoptosis of Neuro2a neuroblastoma cells than NK cells with IL-15/IL-15Ralpha alone. In vivo, injection of 2 doses of AgN2a 4P vaccine leads to 100% lethality by 60 days, but 3 doses of AgN2a 4P leads to 100% survival at 50 days after both allogeneic and syngeneic BMT.</p><p id="Par5855"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5856">Co-culture of NK cells with an engineered costimulatory vaccine is an effective strategy to induce apoptosis of neuroblastoma tumor cells by increasing NK-mediated cytokine production and cytotoxicity, and enhances anti-tumor effects after BMT.

CD39 contributes to the production of adenosine, an inhibitor of immune response, via sequential hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate into adenosine monophosphate, which then is degraded into adenosine by CD73 enzyme. In contrast, ATP has immune-stimulatory activity through promoting dendritic cell (DC) maturation. Blockade of CD39-mediated degradation of ATP may therefore stimulate anti-tumor immunity across a wide range of tumors by preventing production of immunosuppressive adenosine and by promoting accumulation of immunostimulatory ATP in the tumor microenvironment. IPH5201 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and inhibits the activity of both membrane-bound and soluble human CD39. Here, we explored the efficacy of IPH5201 in vitro and in vivo in immunocompetent human CD39 knockin (huCD39KI) mouse model in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor.</p><p id="Par5863"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5864">In vitro, efficacy of IPH5201 was evaluated (1) on the phenotypic changes and stimulatory potential of monocyte-derived DC, (2) on the inflammasome pathway by assessing interleukin-1b secretion from in vitro-derived M1 macrophages, and (3) on T cell proliferation. HuCD39KI mice were characterized for the expression and function of human CD39. To assess CD39 blockade in vivo, a mouse IgG1 version of IPH5201 was produced (moIPH5201), which contained key point mutations in the Fc region to abrogate Fc receptor interactions. Antitumor efficacy of CD39 blockade was assessed in huCD39KI mice grafted with mouse tumor cells not expressing mouse CD39. HuCD39KI mice were treated with blocking anti-human CD39 Ab, either alone or in combination with a blocking anti-mouse PD-L1 Ab.</p><p id="Par5865"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5866">As hypothesized, in vitro IPH5201 enhanced the phenotypic maturation and the activation of DCs and macrophages by inhibiting ATP hydrolysis. IPH5201 also efficiently restored T cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner to the levels observed in the absence of ATP addition. Thus, IPH5201 preserved extracellular ATP, thereby promoting the activation of DCs and macrophages and limiting adenosine accumulation and its immunosuppressive effect on T cells. Furthermore, moIPH5201 mice treatment efficiently inhibits membrane and soluble human CD39, from huCD39KI mice ex vivo without mediating CD39-expressing cell depletion in vivo. Finally, blockade of CD39 potentiates the anti-tumor efficacy of anti-PD-L1 Ab monotherapy.</p><p id="Par5867"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5868">Together these data indicate that blocking CD39 in conjunction with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors provides increased anti-tumor efficacy and support the rational for assessing this combination in clinical trials.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1939"><title>P489 Identification and characterization of MCLA-145 (CD137 x PD-L1): a bispecific antibody that requires PD-L1 binding to activate CD137</title><sec id="Sec1940"><title>Simon Plyte<sup>1</sup>, Cecile Geuijen<sup>1</sup>, John de Kruif<sup>1</sup>, Pieter Fokko van Loo, PhD<sup>1</sup>, Paul Tacken<sup>1</sup>, vanessa Zondag-vander Zande<sup>1</sup>, Rinse klooster<sup>1</sup>, hans van Maaden<sup>1</sup>, Erik Rovers<sup>1</sup>, steef engels<sup>1</sup>, floris franzen<sup>1</sup>, abdul basmeleh<sup>1</sup>, willem bartelink<sup>1</sup>, Mark Throsby<sup>1</sup>, Patrick Mayes<sup>2</sup>, Horacio Nastri<sup>2</sup>, shaun stewart<sup>2</sup>, jing zhou<sup>2</sup>, steve wang<sup>2</sup>, Chen-yen Huang<sup>2</sup>, thomas codamine<sup>2</sup>, ashwini kularni<sup>2</sup>, yao bin lui<sup>2</sup>, arpita mondal<sup>2</sup>, leslie hall<sup>2</sup>, soeon kim<sup>2</sup>, marina martinez<sup>2</sup>, shaun o'brien<sup>2</sup>, edmund moon<sup>2</sup>, steven albelda<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec1941"><title><sup>1</sup>Merus, Utrecht, Netherlands; <sup>2</sup>Incyte Research Institute, Wilmington, DE, United States</title><sec id="Sec1942"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Simon Plyte (simon.plyte@merus.nl)</title><p id="Par5869"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par5870">CD137 (4-1BB) is costimulatory receptor on T and NK cells that requires clustering to elicit its effects on target cells and enhance adaptive immune responses against tumors.

CD137 signaling was induced by MCLA-145 in multiple primary human immune cell assays and reversed T cell suppression mediated by M2 macrophages or Tregs, in vitro. In one humanized mouse tumor model, human T cells expressing NY-ESO specific TCR were adoptively transferred to mice bearing A549 tumors, which expressed NY-ESO antigen and human PD-L1. MCLA-145 treatment at 5 mg/kg resulted in 54% tumor growth inhibition (TGI) as compared to T cell only–treated mice. In the tumors of MCLA-145–treated mice, the percentage of NY-ESO specific CD8+ T cells were significantly increased compared with controls. In a second model, mice engrafted with human CD34+ cells were implanted with the breast tumor cell line MDA-MB-231.

High infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid cells generally predicts unfavorable prognosis.

OR2805 treatment reduces expression of cell-surface markers associated with tumor-promoting M2c-like macrophages. In co-culture assays, OR2805 relieves the suppressive effect of M2 macrophages and resulted in increased T cell activation and proliferation, upregulation of T cell activation markers, and enhanced T cell-mediated tumor cell killing. Administration of OR2805 in humanized NSG-SGM3 mouse tumor models resulted in approximately 50% reduction in A549 tumor growth and a 60% reduction in H1975 tumor growth. In this model, OR2805 treatment significantly increased the proportions of human CD8+ T cells and human CD11b+ myeloid cells in the spleen as well as significantly enhanced expression of activation markers (ICOS, OX-40) by human CD8+ T cells.</p><p id="Par5883">OR2805 reduces TAM-mediated immunosuppression and enhances anti-tumor immune responses. OR2805 treatment induces robust anti-tumor activity in lung cancer xenograft models in humanized mice.

Tumors, spleens and lymph nodes were analyzed by mass- and flow-cytometry. Mice were treated with antibodies to PD-1, PD-L1, OX-40, 4-1BB, NKG2A and TGFβ. Cell-sorted tumor cells were RNA sequenced. Immune parameters were assessed in 5-10 mice, survival analyses were performed on at least 10 mice per group. All experiments were performed 2-3 times.</p><p id="Par5940"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5941">Optimal vaccination resulted in about 7% circulating tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and complete cure of all mice, whereas suboptimal vaccination led on average to 1.7% tumor-specific T cells and tumor regression followed by recurrence in all mice. Neither booster vaccinations, which increased the numbers of circulating tumor-specific type 1 cytokine-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (p&lt;0.01), nor the co-administration of (combinations of) antibodies against PD-1, PD-L1, 4-1BB, or OX-40 prevented tumor recurrence or improved survival after vaccination. Immune escape was intrinsic to the tumor cells as the direct reinjection of ex-vivo cell-sorted recurrent tumor cells into groups of 10 naïve hosts did not result in any response to vaccination while in all cases the reinjected ex-vivo cell-sorted nontreated tumor cells displayed vaccine-induced tumor regression followed by relapse (p&lt;0.01). Ex-vivo analyses of escaped tumor cells showed no alterations in the expression of MHC-I or the E7 tumor-antigen or their sensitivity to tumor-specific CTL mediated killing. RNA sequencing on bulk sorted (CD45-) tumor cells from non-treated (n=4) and escaped (n=4) tumors, revealed a specific vaccine-induced downregulation of the TNF- and P53-signaling pathways and upregulation of TGFβ signaling. Indeed, more TGFβ positive fibroblasts surrounded the escaped tumors (p&lt;0.05). Recurrent tumors displayed strongly reduced numbers of infiltrated CD8+ T cells (p&lt;0.001), whereas this was not the case for escaped tumor cells-reinjected tumors. However, both types of escaped tumors displayed lower numbers of tumor-infiltrating Ly6C+MHCI-II+ inflammatory macrophages (p&lt;0.01). TGFβ-blockade delayed but did not prevent relapses to recur (p=0.07). The use of inflammation inducing chemotherapy reinstalled the infiltration of tumors with inflammatory myeloid cells after vaccination, prevented relapse and reinstalled sensitivity of escaped tumors to therapeutic vaccination (p=0.01).</p><p id="Par5942"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5943">The sequential clinical phases during non-curative immunotherapy may involve several distinct secondary escape mechanisms.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1967"><title>P496 Inhibition of autophagy enhances multifunctional genetically-engineered NK cell-based immunotherapy of glioblastoma</title><sec id="Sec1968"><title>Jiao Wang, PhD, Sandro Matosevic, PhD</title><sec id="Sec1969"><title>Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, United States</title><sec id="Sec1970"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Sandro Matosevic (sandro@purdue.edu)</title><p id="Par5944"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par5945">Despite aggressive treatments, the median life expectancy for GBM patients is only around 15 months, highlighting the need for new therapeutic approaches. NK cells are showing potential for immunotherapy of GBM. However, NK cells struggle to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) and infiltrate into GBM [1]. Moreover, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) impairs NK cell activity, for instance due to adenosine-mediated downregulation of NKG2D expression [2].</p><p id="Par5946"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5947">We developed an innovative NK cell-based immunotherapy for GBM that targets multiple “checkpoints” simultaneously, by combining 1) multifunctional NK cells which consist of a cleavable scFv targeting CD73 alongside dual chimeric antigen receptors directed against GD2 and NKG2D ligands and 2) inhibition of autophagy in GBM cells to sensitize them to NK cell lysis and promote NK cell infiltration into GBM via the secretion of GBM-specific chemoattractants.</p><p id="Par5948"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5949">We have designed and synthesized a multifunctional CAR construct that expresses an anti-CD73 scFv which is cleavable by GBM-associated proteases, and a dual CAR that enables NK cells to avoid antigen escape common to GBM (Figure 1A). We have generated engineered NK-92 or primary human NK cells that efficiently express the construct, from which the anti-CD73 scFv could be functionally released via uPA treatment (Figure 1B and C). Engineered NK cells showed a significantly higher in vitro ability to kill patient-derived GBM43 targets (Figure 1D and E). To target autophagy, BECN1- GBM43 cells were generated, and their in vivo subcutaneous growth in RAG-1-/- mice validated the critical role of autophagy in GBM onset and progression (Figure 1F). We further showed that targeting autophagy inhibited the in vitro proliferation of GBM43 itself (Figure 1G), sensitized GBM to NK cell lysis (Fig. 1H), and induced elevated chemokine secretion (CCL5), which in turn increased NK cell migration across the BBB using an in vitro BBB model (Figure 1I).</p><p id="Par5950"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5951">We have generated multifunctional NK cells that can target multiple “checkpoints” at once showing improved cytotoxicity against GBM through increased resistance to the immunosuppressive TME via adenosinergic CD73 blockade and the ability to avoid antigen escape by GBM via dual CARs. We have also found that blocking the autophagy pathway in GBM displayed potent synergy with NK cell-mediated immunotherapy. Based on these results, to achieve combined therapeutic effects in vivo, we are currently evaluating this immunotherapy in an orthotopic GBM mouse model. Taken together, this approach provides a promising platform for the combination treatment of GBM with engineered NK cells.</p><p id="Par5952"><bold>References</bold></p><p id="Par5953">1.

DRP-104 was designed as a novel prodrug of the broad acting glutamine antagonist 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON). DRP-104 is inert in its prodrug form, affords high levels of plasma and gastro-intestinal (GI) tissue stability; has high tumor cell permeability and preferential tumor versus plasma/GI tissue distribution for DON. Here we sought to (1) compare immunological modulation of DRP-104 to anti-PD-1Ab, and (2) evaluate the combination effect of DRP-104 with PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors.</p><p id="Par5958"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5959">Immunomodulatory effects of DRP-104 as a single agent and combination with anti-PD-1Ab was evaluated in the CT26 mouse colon carcinoma model by flow cytometry and Luminex assay.

Cytokine modulation in tumor and plasma revealed that DRP-104 decreased pro-tumorigenic cytokines such as VEGF and KC(IL-8) while anti-PD-1Ab showed either no change or slight increase in these cytokines. CT26 bearing mice treated with anti-PD-1Ab alone, DRP-104, and the combination showed tumor growth inhibition at day 12 of 48%, 90%, and 94%, respectively. Median survival days were 31.5, 36, and 56 days, respectively (vehicle; 17.5 days). Notably 9 mice treated with combination of anti-PD-1 with DRP-104 were tumor free at end of the experiment (day 77) and 100% of these mice rejected a CT26 tumor re-challenge. In the H22 model, mice were treated with either anti-PD-L1 Ab, DRP-104, or combination. While anti-PD-L1Ab did not show tumor growth inhibition in this model, DRP-104 significantly inhibited tumor growth and the combination further enhanced efficacy, illustrated by extended survival for both DRP-104 alone (50 days) and combination (96 days) treatment groups compared to vehicle (33days) and anti-PD-L1 alone (33days). Combination treatment also resulted in long term durable cures in 50% of the mice.</p><p id="Par5962"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5963">DRP-104 treatment results in dramatic remodeling of the tumor micro environment, leading to enhanced function of multiple immune cells distinct from activities obtained by anti-PD-1 Ab. Combination therapy of DRP-104 with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 achieved significantly enhanced anti-tumor efficacy including long-term durable cures even in checkpoint inhibitor resistant models. This unique and non-overlapping mechanism of action supports clinical development of DRP-104 alone and in combination with PD-1/PD-L-1 checkpoint inhibitors.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1975"><title>P498 Blockade of PD-1 and LAG-3 on CD8+ T cells, induced by vaccination, elicits superior anti-tumor efficacy</title><sec id="Sec1976"><title>Christopher Zahm, PhD, Douglas McNeel, MD, PhD, Laurne Delmastro</title><sec id="Sec1977"><title>UW Carbone Cancer Center, Madison, WI, United States</title><sec id="Sec1978"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Douglas McNeel (dm3@medicine.wisc.edu)</title><p id="Par5964"><bold>Background</bold></p><p id="Par5965">T cell immune checkpoint receptors (ICR) and their ligands have emerged as a major mechanism by which tumors avoid immune detection. ICR blockade targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and/or CTLA-4 have revolutionized the treatment of many cancer types. However, not all cancers respond to ICR blockade, in large part mediated by the presence or absence of tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells. We have focused on tumor vaccines as a means to increase the number of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells. We have previously demonstrated that activation of CD8+ T cells by vaccination leads to increased expression of specific ICR, and that blockade of these ICR with vaccination leads to better anti-tumor response than either alone. Differences in expression of specific ICR, notably PD-1 and LAG-3, appeared dependent on presentation of antigen by professional versus non-professional APC, hence we hypothesized that blockade of both of these ICR with vaccination should be superior to either alone.</p><p id="Par5966"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5967">In these studies we directly assessed the expression of PD-1, LAG-3, CTLA-4, and TIM-3 on CD8+ T cells following activation in the presence or absence of professional APC. Next, we transferred these cells into tumor bearing mice, alone or in combination ICR blocking antibodies, to directly evaluate their anti-tumor efficacy. Finally, we immunized tumor-bearing HLA-A2-transgenic mice with different anti-tumor DNA vaccines that have previously been shown to elicit CD8+ T cells preferentially expressing either PD-1 or LAG-3, and used each vaccine alone or in combination with ICR blockade.</p><p id="Par5968"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5969">We found that PD-1, LAG-3, CTLA-4 and TIM-3 are all increased on CD8+ T cells after activation by professional APC, however LAG-3 alone was increased on CD8+ T cells activated in the absence of professional APC (Figure 1). When these cells were adoptively transferred into tumor bearing mice, LAG-3 blockade improved the anti-tumor efficacy of CD8+ T cells activated without APC, and PD-1 blockade improved the anti-tumor efficacy of CD8+ T cells activated by APC (Figure 2). Immunization with different DNA constructs [1-3] in combination with ICR blockade led to improved anti-tumor responses, however combining LAG-3 blockade with PD-1 blockade showed no benefit over PD-1 blockade alone (Figure 3).</p><p id="Par5970"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5971">These data support our previous finding that PD-1 blockade improves the efficacy of CD8+ T cells activated by vaccination.

Previous work has shown that NPS induces release of tumor antigen and stimulates an in situ anti-tumor immune response [1, 2, 3]. The TLR 7/8 agonist resiquimod (RES) has been used as an immune adjuvant in previous cancer vaccine treatments in murine models to aid in antigen processing and presentation [4]. We have evaluated the combination of NPS and RES treatment to inhibit tumor growth and induce innate and adaptive immune responses.</p><p id="Par5981"><bold>Methods</bold></p><p id="Par5982">The B16-F10 melanoma in C57BL/6j mice was used to investigate the potential combined effects of NPS and RES. B16-F10 tumor cells (2x10e5) were injected intradermally on the left flank and treated with NPS 5 days after inoculation. RES (50 μg) was then dosed in multiple combinations and timing to assess optimal tumor cell elimination and immune stimulation from the combination treatment. Tumor efficacy (volume) was measured twice per week. Immune biomarkers included flow cytometry and IHC of T cell and myeloid immune cells from tumors, draining lymph nodes and spleens.</p><p id="Par5983"><bold>Results</bold></p><p id="Par5984">Low energy NPS and up to 3 doses of RES as monotherapies partially inhibit tumor growth. However, combination of NPS with 24-hour, post treatment of RES resulted in complete regression in a large fraction of treated animals. This efficacy is concomitant with increased antigen-specific and memory CD8 populations in the spleen and lymph node, as well as an increase in certain innate immune cell populations. Tumor regressions showed no sign of regrowth 90 days after treatment.</p><p id="Par5985"><bold>Conclusions</bold></p><p id="Par5986">Compared to monotherapy treatments, the combination of NPS and RES treatments induce stronger tumor growth inhibition which persists as long-term tumor regression. Persistent tumor regression by combination treatment is associated with increases in B16F10 antigen-specific and memory CD8 populations, as well as increases in innate immune populations with potential for antigen presentation.

Several mutant mice were used in these models including PARP-1-/-, PARP-1-/+ APCMin/+, APCMin/+PARP-1-/-+/−, APCMin/+PARP-1-/+ as well as WT mice. Mice were randomized and assigned to the different experimental groups. Some groups of mice were administered olaparib, anti-mouse PD-1 antibodies, or a combination of the two agents. Mice were scarified according to the requirements of each model and tumor and tissues were collected for the analysis.

A sub-IC50 metronomic dose of olaparib or PARP-1 heterozygosity was also sufficient to block tumorigenesis in syngeneic colon cancer models by modulating the suppressive function, but not differentiation or intratumoral migration, of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). These effects occurred through a reduction of arginase-1, iNOS, and COX-2 expression but independently of PARP-1-trapping on chromatin. Interestingly, the metronomic olaparib dose increased the intratumoral numbers, but not percentages, of CD8+ T cells. Adoptive transfer of WT bone marrow-derived MDSCs abrogated the protective effects of PARP-1 heterozygosity against the tumor burden.
