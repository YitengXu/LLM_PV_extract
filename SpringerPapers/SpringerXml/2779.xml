This configuration however has several challenges that stem from a complex coupled-device architecture and multiple interfaces through which charge transfer has to occur. As such presented here is a scheme whereby solar energy capture and storage have been coupled using a single bi-functional material. Two electroactive semiconductors BiVO<sub>4</sub> (n-type) and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (p-type) have been separately evaluated for their energy storage capability in the presence and absence of visible radiation. Each of these have the capability to function as a light harvester and also they have faradaic capability. An unprecedented aspect has been observed in that upon photo-illumination of either of these semiconductors, <italic>in situ</italic> charge carriers being generated play a pivotal role in perturbing the electroactivity of the redox species such that the majority charge carriers, <italic>viz</italic>. electrons in BiVO<sub>4</sub> and holes in Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, influence the redox response in a disproportionate manner. More importantly, there is an enhancement of <italic>ca</italic>. 30% in the discharge capacity of BiVO<sub>4</sub> in the presence of light and this directly provides a unique route to augment charge storage during illumination.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2018_Article_30728.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Devising energy schemes that merge energy capture with energy storage have gained momentum over the last few years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The impetus stems from utilizing solar radiation efficiently in terms of not only capturing it but also viably storing it in the form of either solar fuels or as electrical storage. The latter technology involving electrical storage is still emerging especially in terms of evolving the conceptual idea of <italic>directly</italic> storing solar radiation as opposed to forming devices that consist of independent batteries/supercapacitors that are separately coupled with solar cells. For viable energy storage to occur, effective high energy electrons are used either to charge a capacitive layer or they assist in effecting a faradaic (redox) process. Generating these high energy carriers using a photo-assisted process is now being exploited using technologies involving DSSC (dye sensitized solar cells), photoelectrochemical or photochemical assisted production of high energy electrons and these are subsequently being interfaced with energy storage electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Hence, it can be considered that the storage systems are composed of two kinds of materials: light harvesting and a storage component. Light harvesting component consists of materials that are capable of absorbing light and generating extractable charge carriers, while, energy storage component consists of materials that can trap the charges and store them during periods of illumination, and subsequently release them under discharge conditions.</p><p id="Par3">Over the last few years, semiconductors such as WO<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, MoO<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> have been extensively studied as the active electrode materials for energy storage. Moreover, there are a number of reports where the aforementioned energy storage components have been interfaced with light absorbers to form a coupled device. WO<sub>3</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> and Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> are two of the most widely studied hybrid energy storage systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, where in the former case, photo generated electrons are usually stored in the form of tungsten bronze (Na<sub>x</sub>WO<sub>3</sub>), while in the latter case photo generated holes are stored in the form of chemical reaction where conversion of Ni<sup>2+</sup> to Ni<sup>3+</sup> takes place. TiO<sub>2</sub> (band gap 3.2 eV) is the most frequently used light harvesting material and therefore in most of the hybrid photoelectrodes UV light is used for photocharging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, to exploit the solar spectrum more efficiently, various approaches such as coupling TiO<sub>2</sub> with dyes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> or transition metal (Pt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, Au, Ag<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>) nanoparticles or incorporating dopants have been adopted to design visible light responsive components but unfortunately the devices show poor efficiencies mainly owing to multiple interfaces being involved. Recently Gimenez <italic>et al</italic>. have shown solar energy storage in a photocapacitive device coupled with BiVO<sub>4</sub> where this moiety serves the purpose of a light absorber and it has been done in unison with PbO<sub>x</sub> as the capacitive layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. From already existing work, what is being learnt is that configuring the two components in a single device to harness and store solar energy is a complex process owing to stringent requirements of a variety of parameters such as semiconductor band gap, its alignment with the electrode/electrolyte, charge transport kinetics, energy conversion efficiency, and material stability.</p><p id="Par4">We have presented an alternate approach for coupling energy capture and storage in which the focus has been to create a strategy that minimizes interfaces and so in principle can lead to better performance and charge transport efficiency. This we believe is a seminal report that studies the impact of visible light on the semiconductor material which is <italic>also</italic> an electroactive material that stores energy electrochemically. This work allows the removal of multiple interfaces by using bi-functional materials and the results show that <italic>in situ</italic> charge generation and storage can be made viable. Towards this aim, two semi-conductors have been evaluated exclusively for storage properties in the direct presence and absence of visible light irradiation. Specifically, one dimensional structures of BiVO<sub>4</sub> (n-type semi-conductor) and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (p-type semi-conductor) have been synthesized, structurally characterized, and their individual electrochemical behavior has been evaluated. Subsequently, their redox behavior in the presence and absence of light has been compared in order to show that it is feasible for an electroactive component to be also photoactive in a single energy storage device.</p><p id="Par5">BiVO<sub>4</sub> is an n-type semiconductor with a monoclinic scheelite structure, and is widely being studied as a photoanode for solar water oxidation owing to its small band gap (<italic>ca</italic>. 2.3 eV), it utilizes a significant portion of solar spectrum and its valence band edge position is appropriate for water oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The second semiconductor that has been evaluated is Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>. This is a p-type semiconductor, crystalizes in three dimensional normal spinel structure and has gained considerable attention as water oxidation/oxygen evolution catalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. It should be highlighted, that individually each of these semiconductors have been evaluated in pure and hybrid based supercapacitor applications as well. Both the semiconductors <italic>viz</italic>. BiVO<sub>4</sub> and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> have a 3-D crystal structure unlike most of the conventional layered materials employed for energy storage. In the last few years, BiVO<sub>4</sub> has shown to be a good electroactive material especially in conjunction with CNTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and with nanostructured MoS<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. BiVO<sub>4</sub> undergoes reversible faradaic change (Bi<sup>3+</sup> ↔ Bi<sup>0</sup>) on ramping the voltage and stores energy electrochemically. Also, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> has been employed as an attractive energy storage material owing to its low cost, impressive redox activity, and most importantly, high theoretical specific capacitance (890 mA hg<sup>−1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, it should be noted that in none of these reports were the behavior of these compositions evaluated while being impinged with visible irradiation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="Par6">A highly modified synthesis protocol yielded monodispersed rod-like structures of monoclinic phase of BiVO<sub>4</sub> using a solvothermal synthesis route.

The redox peaks were reproducible at higher scan rates, however the oxidation peaks shift towards positive potentials and reduction peak shifts towards negative potential which is mainly ascribed to the internal resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>. Augmentation in the current response was observed at higher scan rates which indicates faster interfacial redox kinetics. As mentioned above, the bonding between Bi and O is relatively weaker when compared to the interaction between V and O, as a consequence the faradaic behavior of solely Bi ion is observed in the cyclic voltammogram. It is anticipated that BiVO<sub>4</sub> structure lends itself to a feasible diffusion of Bi ion in and out of the lattice when the material is subjected to charging and discharging, respectively and the vanadate units are potentially only contributing to the pseudocapacitive aspects of the CV curve. As previously reported by Khan <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and Arora <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> BiVO<sub>4</sub> has shown decent cycling stability considering it bears a 3-D crystal structure unlike conventional layered battery materials. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3a,b</xref> show the SEM images of the working electrode before and after cyclic voltammetry, in the former image BiVO<sub>4</sub> rods with a flake like morphology which correspond to the additives <italic>viz</italic>. polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF, binder) and activated carbon are visible. However, in the SEM image after 20 CV cycles, BiVO<sub>4</sub> rods are visible and the ill-defined morphology is now a combination of Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, NaVO<sub>3</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, and the additives. The peaks in the diffraction pattern of the working electrode after 20 CV cycles can be indexed to Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, NaVO<sub>3</sub> and V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> which reveal their formation during electrochemical measurements, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3c</xref>. Bi ions diffuse out of the lattice while charging, perhaps it is the Na<sup>+</sup> ions (of the electrolyte) that diffuse into the lattice to charge balance the system and this results in the formation of NaVO<sub>3</sub>. Ideally, if the electrolyte could be replaced with a Bi<sup>3+</sup> ion based ionic liquid these issues could be circumvented. However even in the current scenario of using NaOH as the electrolyte, it should be noted that despite this irreversible damage, under the experimental setup enough BiVO<sub>4</sub> is deposited such that cycling is still feasible for up to 70 cycles. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> shows the representative diagram highlighting how the working electrode gets modified with each CV cycle. The electrochemically active surface area (EASA) of the working electrodes was estimated to assess surface characteristic of the electrodes and its interaction with the electrolyte. EASA was estimated from the electric double layer capacitance of the electrode surface which was done by measuring the non-faradaic capacitive current under the potential window of −0.10 V to −0.14 V with scan rates ranging from 20 to 400 mVs<sup>−1</sup> and as such we obtained EASA of the working electrodes as <italic>ca</italic>. 30 cm<sup>2</sup>.

This entire assembly was then encased such that the CV could be recorded under ‘light’ conditions within the potential range 0.0 V to −1.2 V at 20 mVs<sup>−1</sup>. The light conditions involved irradiating the working electrode with a 100 W Tungsten lamp fitted with a 400 nm long pass filter. This was located at a working distance of 10 cm from the working electrode.

As the working electrode was impinged with the visible light, the CV profile of BiVO<sub>4</sub> was found to be intriguingly perturbed, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>. Two aspects were clearly altered under ‘light’ conditions: an augmentation in the area under the cyclic voltammogram was observed and an even more intriguing observation was the shift in the reduction peak potential towards positive potential, however, no such deflection was observed in the oxidation peak potentials. In order to monitor this closely, the first 20 CV cycles were carried out in dark for stabilization and to avoid any influence due to the initial ‘activation process’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Subsequently, <italic>light-on</italic> condition was activated on the 21<sup>st</sup> cycle. The working electrode was illuminated for 5 cycles (shown with white circles) and the current was simultaneously measured, then the light was turned off for next 5 cycles (shown with dark circles), and then again the light was turned on for 5 cycles, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>. This way BiVO<sub>4</sub> (n-type semiconductor) was impinged with visible light in a pulsating mode and its redox behavior was carefully monitored.

In both these figures, it should be noted that a baseline has been provided which is the change (if any) in the area or peak potential when the measurement (entire 50 cycles) have been done completely in the dark. Ideally, it should be anticipated that the area under the reduction/oxidation peaks should not vary as a function of the cycle number and hence this baseline should have a slope of zero, centered at 0 mA·V. However, it can be seen that this black curve in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> (baseline in dark) appears to gradually increase and then decrease upon increasing the number of cycles. Currently, it has not been completely elucidated as to why the conductivity of the working electrode improves (an unusual observation compared to what has been reported in current literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>), however it can be stated that upon each cycle, the working electrode gets physically and chemically altered such that in the first few cycles the electrode-electrolyte interaction improves (positive slope of the baseline) and subsequently as mentioned above BiVO<sub>4</sub> undergoes a slow degradation because of harsh electrolytic environment and therefore this obviously leads to decreased conductivity as noted by the downward slope of the baseline.

In principle, this observation can insinuate that a larger amount of BiVO<sub>4</sub> is being probed electrochemically just by irradiating with light.</p><p id="Par14">An even more interesting aspect of this study was an asymmetric behavior observed with respect to the shift in redox potentials.

It is clearly observed that the reduction peak shifts towards positive potentials indicating that Bi<sup>3+</sup> → Bi<sup>0</sup> is now a more feasible reaction in the presence of light. The data has been normalized with respect to cycle number 18, reduction and oxidation peak potential values at cycle number 18 were −0.75 V and −0.53 V, respectively, which have been set to 0 V in order to get the absolute peak deflection values. On averaging the three sets of cycles in light and dark, a deflection of <italic>ca</italic>. 50 mV is seen for the reduction peak potential and a small shift of <italic>ca</italic>. 4 mV for the oxidation peak potential is recorded. From this, it can be inferred that the load on the external device to perform the reduction step can simply be reduced by illuminating the material with light. However, oxidation peak does not show any such significant deflection which implies that, in principle, the material gets charged at the same potential however, now it discharges at a higher potential. Also, on increasing the lamp power the extent of deflection in the reduction peak potential got increased, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>.</p><p id="Par15">Analogously, electrochemical behavior of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which is a p-type semiconductor, was evaluated.

Hence, two anodic and two cathodic peaks are so close that they cannot be distinguished. It should be noted that similar behavior has also been observed in previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The increase in oxidation current at higher potentials is always attributed to the water oxidation process, inset Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>.</p><p id="Par17">On impinging Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> with the visible light, its CV profile was also altered. On carefully analyzing the perturbation, it was observed that the area under the cyclic voltammogram was augmented just as in the aforementioned case of BiVO<sub>4</sub>, however a surprising observation was the shift in the oxidation peak potential towards less positive potential, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> (red curve). No such deflection was observed in the reduction peak, except that the current value got increased. This was symmetrically opposite to what was observed for BiVO<sub>4</sub>. In case of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, first 15 cycles were carried out in dark to avoid the influence of activation process, and then light was turned on and off from cycle number 16 onwards for 5 cycles each. Again the variation of peak area under the oxidation/ reduction peak (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>) and potential for the oxidation/reduction peak (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) has been showcased. The data is normalized with respect to cycle number 10, where the oxidation and reduction peak potential values were 0.49 V and 0.40 V, respectively, which have been set to 0 V to obtain the absolute shifts in the peak potentials. Likewise change in area under the oxidation and reduction peak is with respect to cycle number 10 and the potential window used to measure the area under the oxidation and reduction peak is 0.4 V to 0.65 V and 0.38 V to 0.43 V, respectively. It can be observed that the peak area is augmented for both the faradaic reactions (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>), however the absolute values for the enhancement in area under oxidation and reduction peaks averaged over four sets of cycles are <italic>ca</italic>. 40 mA.mV and <italic>ca</italic>. 13 mA.mV, respectively. The values are not comparable because as mentioned above the potential windows fixed to measure the areas are different.

Moreover, now in this scenario of utilizing a p-type semiconductor, the oxidation peak was deflected towards a lower positive potentials indicating Co<sup>3+</sup> → Co<sup>4+</sup> oxidation was now a more feasible reaction while the change in the reduction potential was minimal. Overall, it should be mentioned that alteration in the CV in the presence of light for Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> was not large but the changes highlighted are thoroughly reproducible. It can therefore be surmised that upon irradiation with visible light Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, in principle, gets charged at lower potentials but discharges at the same potential.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Variation in the oxidation peak potential at 0.494 V of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a function of cycle number, black curve corresponds to the baseline acquired in dark, red curve shows the shift in the oxidation peak potential towards negative potential upon pulsating with visible light, an average shift of 11 mV has been recorded; (<bold>b</bold>) variation in the reduction peak potential at 0.40 V of Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as a function of cycle number, black curve is again the baseline acquired in dark, where as the red curve shows a negligible reduction peak shift on photoirradiation.

Moreover, as the variation in the CV curves was asymmetric (<italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. only the reduction peak voltage predominantly deflected for BiVO<sub>4</sub> and the oxidation peak voltage for Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), it seemed that perhaps the electrons and holes were each influencing the system in a disproportionate manner. From the data, it can be inferred that in an n-type semiconductor, the presence of extra excited electrons (upon impinging with light) appear to contribute significantly to enhance the reduction component of the faradaic process while for a p-type semiconductor the reverse occurs, which is now there is higher preponderance of excited holes and these appear to enhance the oxidation process. In BiVO<sub>4</sub> (n-type semiconductor) excited electrons formed on photoirradiation are more mobile and can reach the surface faster than the holes and hence, we observe its effect in the form of facile reduction <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. deflection in the reduction peak is significant compared to the deflection in the oxidation peak. On the other hand, Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> being a p-type semiconductor has a higher preponderance of holes on its surface which makes the oxidation peak shift by a significant value towards the lower potentials and reduction peak is unaffected.</p><p id="Par19">To gain further insight into this, scavengers (electron or hole) were added to the electrolyte and the same experiment was repeated <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>. BiVO<sub>4</sub> working electrode, NaOH as the electrolyte and the system irradiated with light in pulsed mode (on for 5 CV cycles and off for 5 CV cycles). The aim of adding these scavengers was that they would nullify the extra concentration of the excited carriers and in principle it could be gauged if the asymmetric shifts in the CV curve could be reversed even during light irradiation. For the hole scavenger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> was introduced into the system and analogously in a separate experiment, an electron scavenger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, O<sub>2</sub> was introduced into the system by purging the cell. Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows the variation in the potential when the working electrode is BiVO<sub>4</sub> and only the reduction potential has been plotted as there was no deflection observed for the oxidation peak. Upon insertion of these two scavengers, Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref> shows the data when the hole scavenger has been introduced and Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7b</xref> is for the electron scavenger. It can be observed that the removal of the light-induced holes does change the reduction potential however not substantially, there is still a viable shift in the reduction potential when light is impinged. This therefore suggests that the excited holes that are created in our BiVO<sub>4</sub> do not contribute substantially to the experiment. This is analogous to the concept that holes in a n-type semi-conductor are not relevant to the electrical properties of that semiconductor. As such, it is hypothesized that in our experiment perhaps these holes are buried or not mobile enough so that they are not contributing to the redox behavior of BiVO<sub>4</sub>. Whether they are present (as expected upon light irradiation) or quenched in the presence of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> they are not playing a vital role. However, it is important to note that in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>, a complete suppression of the voltage shift upon irradiation is observed (whether light is impinged or not). This observation indicates that the charge carriers that are being generated in the presence of light are directly contributing to the faradaic process apart from augmenting the capacitive storage. BiVO<sub>4</sub> being an n-type semiconductor, it appears as the excited electrons are predominant contributors to charge storage and if they are quenched, then the effect of light irradiation is suppressed. Holes, however, perhaps as they are not as mobile in an n-type semiconductor and are not being quenched as rapidly (by not reaching the electrolyte/semi-conductor interface) their effect is not as substantial.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Variation in the reduction potential (at −0.75 V) of BiVO<sub>4</sub> in the presence of hole scavenger (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>) as a function of cycle number, a viable shift in the reduction peak potential is still observed on photoirradiation, (<bold>b</bold>) variation in the reduction potential of BiVO<sub>4</sub> in the presence of electron scavenger (O<sub>2</sub>) as a function of cycle number, a complete suppression in the reduction peak shift upon irradiation is observed.

There is a lack of any change in the oxidation peak potential and in the peak area as well. Unlike other routes for integration where separate materials are combined into a heterogeneous electrode, this is a first ever report on bi-functional material where our work adapts electroactive semiconductors (BiVO<sub>4</sub> or Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) to play both the roles of light absorber and storage material.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par22">In summary, we have demonstrated that two different semiconductors <italic>viz</italic>. BiVO<sub>4</sub> (n-type) and Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (p-type) having 3-D crystal structures (unlike conventional layered battery materials) can absorb and store solar energy in a single device. On impinging these electroactive materials with visible light, an augmentation in the area under the cyclic voltammogram was observed and simultaneously depending on the majority charge carriers, either of the faradaic processes (reduction in BiVO<sub>4</sub> or oxidation in Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) was facilitated. In case of BiVO<sub>4</sub> on photo-illumination, reduction peak shifted towards positive potentials making the system thermodynamically more favorable, however, charging happened at the same potential. On the other hand, on impinging Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> with visible light the charging potential was lowered (shift in the oxidation peak towards negative potentials) and the reduction peak potential remained unaffected. On introducing scavengers into the system, these perturbations in the CV could be suppressed indicating the direct influence of excited charge carriers on the faradaic behavior. In galvanostatic charge discharge measurements an enhancement was observed in the discharge plateau in presence of light. This is an alternate approach for coupling energy capture and storage where the main focus has been to minimize interfaces which could subsequently lead to better performance and charge transport efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par23">Bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (≥99.99%), ammonium metavanadate (≥99.99%) and ammonium fluoride (≥99.99%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich.
