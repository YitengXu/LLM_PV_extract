However, the weak biocompatibility, low breathability, and narrow sensing range greatly hinder the development of healthcare sensors. Herein, a porous, flexible and conductive MXene/Polydimethylsiloxane/Polydopamine/Polyurethane Sponge (MXene/PDMS/PDA/PU) nanocomposite is developed as a promising motion-detecting device with good flexibility, breathability, sensing performance, photothermal therapy and antibacterial activity. Benefiting from the porous structure and biocompatible surface, this multifunctional sensor is further fabricated into a diagnostic and therapeutic system for monitoring human body motion and performing hot therapy/antibacterial treatment in the application of sports injury site. Moreover, both the wireless smart insole and cushion are constructed to gait monitoring and sit position detecting. This multifunctional hybrid sponge not only demonstrates great potential for motion monitoring sensors but also exhibits wide potential in wearable medical assistive and therapeutic systems.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Anhui’s Key R&amp;D Program of China(202104a05020009) Fundamental Research Funds for the Central

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">During the past decade, the rapid development of wearable electronic devices largely changed human lives. Among various electronic devices, the one endowed with portability, convenience, and close interaction with human activities is urgently required. In daily life, many people often suffer sports injuries, including macro-traumatic injuries causing by strong force and micro-traumatic injuries because of overuse of muscle, joint, ligament, or tendon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. These injuries generally require long-term medical treatment to ensure them return to a normal life<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Typically, correct injury assessment (joint mobility assessment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, etc.), reasonable physical therapy (heat treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, electrotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, etc.), rehabilitation training methods (gait correction training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, etc.) and effective means of prevention (injury risk early warning system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, etc.) are generally needed. With the development of intelligent wearable devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, healthcare electronics with motion detecting, gesture measuring and injury prevention have been promoted to the direction of normal and personalized. It is reported that the multi-angle fiber arrayed fabric sensor can be applied to precisely measure human joint motion in various degrees of freedom (flexion and rotation) at the shoulders, knees, and wrists in real time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, smart strain sensing insoles also have been developed for gait detection in normal training<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Wearable electronic sensors with high sensitivity, wide range, quickly response and recovery time have been intensively developed and widely used in monitoring physiological signals such as heart rate, respiratory activity, and muscle tone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. With the unremitting efforts of researchers, electronic sensors that can accurately and real-timely detect body motion signal have been mushroomed. Typically, an electronic skin based on a Kirigami-structured Liquid Metal paper has been developed and it showed both excellent electromyography and electrocardiogram monitoring capabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Moreover, a MXene/ cellulose foam which can real-timely monitor pulse was reported and its sensitivity could reach to as high as 649.3 kPa<sup>−1</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Besides the sensitive performance, the highly wearing comfort of wearable electronics is essential since long-term and continuous data collecting is required in many practical scenarios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, most of the wearable monitoring devices still relied on traditional stretchable flexible substrates, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, Ecoflex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, Polyester (PET)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and so on. They were usually bulky and sealed, which reduced the heat and wet comfort of the skin thus further hindered their long-term availability. To improve the wearability of these high-performance sensors, breathable and comfortable nanocomposites have been developed based on nanofiber film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> or textiles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Obviously, as a critical research topic of next-generation healthcare electronics, developing a facile method for breathable, comfortable, and washable strain-sensors is urgently required.</p><p id="Par4">Except for the diagnostic information, an effective management of prevention and immediate treatment during personalized healthcare is also very important for wearable electronic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Heat treatment is a rapid, economical and common treatment for pain relief<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. It was found that hot pack is of great use for easing muscle tension and treating arthritis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Therefore, various wearable healthcare electronics have been demonstrated to play a key role in controlled therapy, including electric wristbands for hyperthermia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) for photothermal therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, etc. Moreover, as a kind of skin attachable nanocomposites, the healthcare electronics should also possess good biocompatibility and antibacterial activities. Besides muscle and skeletal damage, the local epidermal damage occurred during exercise is very susceptible to bacterial infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.

The conductive MXene and biocompatible PDA synergistically endow the nanocomposite with a high photothermal conversion ability, thus the final healthcare electronics show both a thermal therapy behavior and a photothermal antibacterial effect.

The sponge film changes from white to black, which must be resulting from the loading of the black MXene and the dark brown PDA. In comparison to the pristine PU, the final PMPP is a little stiffer due to the introduction of inorganic MXene and elastic PDMS. However, owing to the porous structure and lightweight nature, the PMPP is still very soft which endow the product with conformal skin sensing patches (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>). The conductive MXene nanosheets are assembled on the skeleton of PU sponge, thus the product possesses a good conductivity.
