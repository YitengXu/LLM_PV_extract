However, either process requires high-energy lasers at discrete wavelengths for excitation. Here we demonstrate that co-sensitization can break this limitation with ultrawide excitation bands. We achieve co-sensitization by employing Nd<sup>3+</sup> and Ho<sup>3+</sup> as the co-sensitizers with complementary absorptions from the ultraviolet to infrared region. Symmetric penta-layer core-shell nanostructure enables tunable fluorescence in the visible and the second near-infrared window when incorporating different activators (Er<sup>3+</sup>, Ho<sup>3+</sup>, Pr<sup>3+</sup>, and Tm<sup>3+</sup>). Transient spectra confirm the directional energy transfer from sensitizers to activators through the bridge of Yb<sup>3+</sup>. We validate the features of the nanocrystals for low-powered white light-emitting diode-mediated whole-body angiography of mice with a signal-to-noise ratio of 12.3 and excitation-regulated encryption.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Smart control of photon conversion in lanthanide nanocrystals (LnNCs) is an important topic owing to its valuable scientific and technological implications on bioimaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, cancer treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr"

rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and so on. The abundant electronic energy levels of trivalent lanthanide ions (Ln<sup>3+</sup>) offer the possibility for controllable regulation of photon conversion in an ultrawide range spanning from the ultraviolet (UV) to infrared<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, the intrinsic parity-forbidden 4f-4f electronic transition of Ln<sup>3+</sup> leads to ultralow molar extinction coefficients &lt;10 cm<sup>−1</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> with linear absorption behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Hence costly high-energy lasers at specific wavelengths, instead of cost-effective and readily available light sources, are required for the excitation of LnNCs.</p><p id="Par4">Sensitization has been demonstrated to be highly efficient in tuning the absorption and photon conversion behaviors of LnNCs, and currently reported strategies including Ln<sup>3+</sup>-Ln<sup>3+</sup> sensitization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, transition metal sensitization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, semiconductor-matrix sensitization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, dye sensitization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and multicomponent nanostructure sensitization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Among these, the Ln<sup>3+</sup>-Ln<sup>3+</sup> sensitization plays a pivotal role due to its capability of imparting particular absorption and emission on a considerable wavelength scale (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). The scope of this Ln<sup>3+</sup>-Ln<sup>3+</sup> sensitization has recently been extended by Wang and Zhou et al. by introducing a Gd<sup>3+</sup> or Yb<sup>3+</sup> energy-migratory mediator in the sensitizer-activator pair (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>), which allows multiplexed photon upconversion under 980 or 1530 nm excitation, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, these pioneering works and other analogous strategies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> still suffer from the narrowband absorption of a single sensitizer.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we report a co-sensitization strategy to achieve ultra-wideband absorption and fine manipulation of both upconversion and downshifting luminescence of LnNCs. This co-sensitization strategy was established by adopting multiple Ln<sup>3+</sup> as co-sensitizers, a Ln<sup>3+</sup> as the joint mediator, and a group of Ln<sup>3+</sup> as activators (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>), which we referred to as the <italic>co-sensitizer-mediator-activator triplet</italic> that constitutes a basic optical unit (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The combination of two or more sensitizers endows an ultra-wideband absorption to LnNCs, and a joint mediator, instead of multi-mediators, is capable of transporting excitation energy from each sensitizer to activators. In contrast to the widely used asymmetric sequential core-shell structure (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>) in single sensitization, a symmetric core-shell structure was fabricated with two peripheral sensitizer/mediator layers surrounding the central activator/mediator layer (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>). As a result, the proposed co-sensitization strategy allows simultaneous visible and second near-infrared (NIR-II) fluorescence with an ultrawide response from UV to NIR, thus satisfying different excitation demands (e.g., low-powered white light) as opposed to the few choices of isolated high-energy lasers (e.g., 808 and 980-nm lasers). These features endow the LnNCs with compelling application outcomes in low-powered white-light-mediated bioimaging and excitation-regulated encryption.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Schematic illustration of co-sensitization strategy and design of symmetric multilayer core-shell structure.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Mechanism of the ET within a co-sensitization structure (S: Sensitizer, A: Activator). <bold>b</bold> Illustration of a universal ultra-wideband-responsive structure with multiple optical units (S: Sensitizer, M: Mediator, A: Activator). <bold>c</bold> Illustrated cross-section of prepared CSSSS with symmetric penta-layer core-shell structure (X = Er, Ho, Pr, and Tm).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2023_36510_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Principle of the ultra-wideband-responsive LnNCs</title><p id="Par6">To verify the feasibility of the proposed co-sensitization strategy, we first explored the capability of Ln<sup>3+</sup> candidates as co-sensitizers. Among the five typical Ln<sup>3+</sup> of Pr<sup>3+</sup>, Nd<sup>3+</sup>, Ho<sup>3+</sup>, Er<sup>3+</sup>, and Tm<sup>3+</sup> that had multiple responsive bands (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) and characteristic NIR-II emissions, Ho<sup>3+</sup> and Nd<sup>3+</sup> were found to show efficient ET to Yb<sup>3+</sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). This was attributed to the good match of energy levels of Ho<sup>3+</sup> and Nd<sup>3+</sup> with that of Yb<sup>3+</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, as evidenced by the intense Yb<sup>3+</sup> emission of NaGdF<sub>4</sub>:Ho<sup>3+</sup>,Yb<sup>3+</sup> and NaGdF<sub>4</sub>:Nd<sup>3+</sup>,Yb<sup>3+</sup> under the excitations of Ho<sup>3+</sup> and Nd<sup>3+</sup>, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). The &gt;4 times faster decay rates of Ho<sup>3+</sup> and Nd<sup>3+</sup> than that of Yb<sup>3+</sup> in a NaGdF<sub>4</sub> matrix (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>) offered the favorable conditions for efficient ET. Besides, Ho<sup>3+</sup> and Nd<sup>3+</sup> were found to present maximally complementary absorption characteristics with abundant narrow bands spanning from 300 to 900 nm (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>), thus promoting themselves as model co-sensitizers. Being an excellent energy-migratory mediator and a sensitizer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, Yb<sup>3+</sup> was testified to be capable of efficiently harvesting the excitation energy absorbed by Ho<sup>3+</sup> and Nd<sup>3+</sup> and transferring to four NIR-II fluorescent activators (Er<sup>3+</sup>, Ho<sup>3+</sup>, Pr<sup>3+</sup>, and Tm<sup>3+</sup>) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). The role of Yb<sup>3+</sup> as a mediator for ET between sensitizers and activators in core-shell structures was evaluated by using two model structures without or with Yb<sup>3+</sup> doping in the intermediate layer between a Ho<sup>3+</sup>/Nd<sup>3+</sup>-sensitization layer and an Er<sup>3+</sup>-emission layer. The prominent enhancement in Er<sup>3+</sup> emissions was detected only with the presence of Yb<sup>3+</sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrated that Yb<sup>3+</sup> could be the pivotal joint mediator in the proposed <italic>co-sensitizer-mediator-activator triplet</italic> to efficiently manipulate energy transfer and photon conversions in rationally designed LnNCs via co-sensitization.</p><p id="Par7">We designed co-sensitized LnNCs by using Ho<sup>3+</sup> and Nd<sup>3+</sup> as co-sensitizers, Yb<sup>3+</sup> as the joint mediator, and Er<sup>3+</sup> (or Ho<sup>3+</sup>, Pr<sup>3+</sup>, and Tm<sup>3+</sup>) as the activators in a symmetric penta-layer core-shell (core/shell/shell/shell/shell, CSSSS) structure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). In particular, the activator layer was surrounded by two spatially separated sensitizer layers to avoid unexpected ET between Ho<sup>3+</sup> and Nd<sup>3+</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>), thus governing the directional ET from sensitizers to the mediator and then to the activator. NaGdF<sub>4</sub> was selected as the matrix since it has been demonstrated as one of the best hosts for Ln<sup>3+</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The optimal molar doping amounts of two sensitizer/mediator layers to obtain excellent optical performances were determined to be 20%Ho<sup>3+</sup>/1%Yb<sup>3+</sup> and 5%Nd<sup>3+</sup>/5%Yb<sup>3+</sup>, respectively (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Notably, a pure NaHoF<sub>4</sub> core was introduced to compensate for the relatively weaker absorption of Ho<sup>3+</sup> in comparison to Nd<sup>3+</sup> to tune the excitation spectrum (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>), and the outermost inert shell of NaGdF<sub>4</sub> avoided the overflow of energy to peripheral quenchers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">The core-shell structured LnNCs were then synthesized sequentially by a hot injection method from the NaHoF<sub>4</sub> core. The coating schemes regarding temperature and the feed rate of precursors were explored to ensure the coherent epitaxial growth of shell-precursors on core NCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). These parameters were applicable for all coating processes, as tested by the preparation of CS and CSS LnNCs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>). The precursor amounts of Ho-layer and Nd-layer were critical to balance their respective contributions of absorption, and a molar ratio of Ho-layer/Nd-layer precursors of 1.0/1.5 presented analogous intensities of characteristic absorption bands that originated from individual Ho<sup>3+</sup> and Nd<sup>3+</sup> (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>). The precursor amount of the activation layer (Er-layer in this case) was determined to be 1.5 times that of the Ho-layer to guarantee the overall excitation spectrum with similar intensity (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>). Then through successive shell growth (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref>), we successfully prepared four kinds of LnNCs (Er/Ho/Pr/Tm-NCs) with a CSSSS structure by simple substitution of activator precursors (of Er<sup>3+</sup>, Ho<sup>3+</sup>, Pr<sup>3+</sup>, and Tm<sup>3+</sup>), which showed uniform hexagonal morphology with an average size of ~41 nm (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>). The perfect atomic arrangement across the whole crystal demonstrated the high crystallinity of Er-NCs and the robusticity of the regulation of shell growth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). X-ray diffraction (XRD) result confirmed the hexagonal phase structure (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref>). EDS mapping, line scan analyses, and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) analyses consistently revealed the clustered distributions of lanthanide ions (especially the high-amount Gd, Ho, and Er) in different regions of a single nanocrystal (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b, c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>), which provided rational evidence to support the designed penta-layer core-shell structure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

The three characteristic peaks at 540, 654, and 1527 nm corresponded to the <sup>4</sup>S<sub>3/2</sub>-<sup>4</sup>I<sub>15/2</sub>, <sup>4</sup>F<sub>9/2</sub>-<sup>4</sup>I<sub>15/2</sub>, and <sup>4</sup>I<sub>13/2</sub>-<sup>4</sup>I<sub>15/2</sub> transitions of Er<sup>3+</sup>, respectively. Other signals detected under partial excitation conditions were indexed to the intrinsic emissions of Ho<sup>3+</sup> (at 1180 nm and 1460 nm) and Nd<sup>3+</sup> (at 1340 nm). The possible transitions of energy levels corresponding to major absorptions and the visible/NIR emissions of Er-NCs were proposed in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">23</xref>. Further excitation-emission map indicated that the ultra-wideband excitation in the range of 350-1000 nm could spur intense emissions of Er-NCs at both visible and NIR-II regions, intuitively presenting a many-to-many relationship between excitation (multiple bands from 350-1000 nm) and emission (at 540, 654, and 1527 nm) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) with temperature-dependent optical stability (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24</xref>). This also confirmed that the co-sensitization strategy endowed Er-NCs with abundant choices of excitation beyond that of a single sensitization case. The strategy to achieve ultra-wideband-responsive photon conversion at both visible and NIR-II regions was also applied to Ho-, Pr-, and Tm-NCs (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">25</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">26</xref>). The photon conversion processes from co-sensitizers to the activator through the bridge of the joint mediator were then investigated by transient spectra. The typical green emission at 540 nm and NIR-II emission at 1527 nm of Er-NCs were selected as representative processes for analysis. In response to various excitations, the transient spectra at both emissions presented two modes, including a rise-decay mode and a rise-decay-rise-decay mode (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">27</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">28</xref>).

For 643 nm excitation, the Ho<sup>3+</sup> in Er-NCs absorbed the excitation energy. One part of the excitation energy was depleted by Ho<sup>3+</sup> itself through the radiation transitions of <sup>5</sup>S<sub>2</sub>-<sup>5</sup>I<sub>8</sub> (emission at 540 nm) and <sup>5</sup>I<sub>5</sub>-<sup>5</sup>I<sub>7</sub> (emission at 1527 nm) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29</xref>), as evidenced by the transient spectra of the control sample of NaGdF<sub>4</sub>:Ho<sup>3+</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). While another part of the excitation energy was transferred to Er<sup>3+</sup>, followed by the radiation transitions of Er<sup>3+</sup> of <sup>4</sup>S<sub>3/2</sub>-<sup>4</sup>I<sub>15/2</sub> (emission at 540 nm) and <sup>4</sup>I<sub>13/2</sub>-<sup>4</sup>I<sub>15/2</sub> (emission at 1527 nm). Thus, the monitoring of the transient responses of Er<sup>3+</sup> at 540 and 1527 nm would mix with the signal from Ho<sup>3+</sup>, i.e., the rise-decay-rise-decay mode of the transient spectrum was a superposition of two transient processes with different decay rates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Notably, the transient spectrum of Er-NCs with 980 nm excitation presented a rise-decay mode, which was attributed to the single step energy transfer from Yb<sup>3+</sup> to Er<sup>3+</sup>. For 574 nm excitation, the Nd<sup>3+</sup> in Er-NCs absorbed the excitation energy but did not produce any interfering emission with that of Er<sup>3+</sup> at either 540 or 1527 nm. The energy was transferred to Yb<sup>3+</sup> and then to Er<sup>3+</sup> step by step, followed by the radiation transitions of Er<sup>3+</sup> at 540 and 1527 nm. So, the transient spectrum presented a conventional rise-decay mode (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). These two different modes of transient spectra visualized distinct ET paths of Er-NCs in response to different excitations of Ho<sup>3+</sup> and Nd<sup>3+</sup> and affirmed the capacity of the co-sensitized symmetric core-shell structure in controllable manipulation of directional ET and multidirectional photon conversion, which were found to be superior to that of NCs with elements co-doping in one matrix (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">30</xref>) or with asymmetric or isolated sensitized structures (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">32</xref>). As a result, the combination of co-sensitization and ET manipulation collectively contributed to the ultra-wideband-responsive multidirectional photon conversion of lanthanide nanocrystals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>White light-excited whole-body angiography of mice</title><p id="Par11">The feature of ultra-wideband excitation and intense NIR-II emission at 1527 nm indicated the prospect of Er-NCs as a low-energy-excitable NIR-II fluorescent probe for real-time high-resolution bioimaging. A white light-emitting diode (WLED) and five monochromic LEDs centered at 450, 520, 570, 740, and 800 nm, corresponding to the excitation peaks of Er-NCs at 448, 520, 574, 739, and 793 nm (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">33</xref>), were employed to evaluate the performance of Er-NCs that placed in a lab-made imaging system with LEDs, an InGaAs camera, and a long-pass filter at 1500 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Upon exposure to each monochromic LED for 2 ms, obvious NIR-II fluorescence of Er-NCs was captured under the excitation of the visible LEDs at 450, 520, and 570 nm, as well as the conventional NIR-LEDs at 740 and 800 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The fluorescence of Er-NCs exhibited a positive correlation with the increase in the applied monochromic LEDs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> and Supplementary Video <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>) due to the abundant excitation bands of Er-NCs achieved by co-sensitization. Further increase of exposure time to 25 ms induced intense NIR-II fluorescence, and a single WLED was found to be capable of exciting Er-NCs with comparable intense fluorescence (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">34</xref>). The low-energy-LED excitability of Er-NCs might be attributed to the efficient NIR quantum cutting of Ho<sup>3+</sup>-Yb<sup>3+</sup> pair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and Nd<sup>3+</sup>-Yb<sup>3+</sup> pair<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> in the sensitizer layers of our nanostructure (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">35</xref>), while the downshifting luminescence at 1527 nm might be regarded as a long-range NIR quantum cutting of Ho<sup>3+</sup>/Nd<sup>3+</sup> to Er<sup>3+</sup> via the bridge of Yb<sup>3+</sup>.

The produced monodispersed Er-PP NCs exhibited good stability in normal saline solution (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">38</xref>)without apparent cytotoxicity (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">39</xref>).

Real-time whole-body angiography of mice with intravenously injected Er-PP NCs was first performed using an 808-nm laser (power density: 0.12 W cm<sup>−2</sup>) and a WLED (power density: ~0.12 W cm<sup>−2</sup>) as the excitation source, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>). Both the 808-nm laser and the WLED excitations visualized main vascular structures (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4f,g</xref> and Supplementary Videos 2 and 3). The 808-nm laser excitation presented a higher resolution due to the higher tissue penetration of NIR light. The common WLED excitation enabled a comparable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 12.3 with that of 808-nm laser excitation (16.1) in sketching the profiles of main vessels despite a moderate spatial resolution. A higher SNR of 19.0 was also obtained with a 980-nm laser (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">40</xref> and Supplementary Video <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM7">4</xref>), which might be attributed to the strong absorbance at 980 nm by the mediator of Yb in Er-NCs. Due to the high absorptivity of Er-NCs to WLED (0.3515 m<sup>2</sup>), 808-nm laser (0.2687 m<sup>2</sup>), and 980-nm laser (0.9867 m<sup>2</sup>) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">41</xref>), the excitation sources of LnNCs for high-resolution bioimaging could therefore be extended to visible light beyond previously reported sole NIR lasers or low-powered LED<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.

The regulation of excitation behaviors of LnNCs was realized by using a photochromic film composed of a photo-acid generator (PAG) and a pH-sensitive dye (bromocresol green, BG). The released acids from PAG upon exposure to a handheld UV lamp (365 nm) would induce the pH-dependent color (absorption) change of BG (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">42</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">43</xref>), endowing the photochromic film with a complete block region between 300~450 nm, a tunable transmit region between 450~700 nm, and a total transparent region beyond 700 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> and Supplementary Video <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM8">5</xref>). The tunable optical transmittance was closely correlated with the UV exposure time. In particular, the film with no exposure only allowed &lt;35% transmittance below 630 nm and a 4-min exposure provided a maximal transmittance (&gt;35% between 470 to 530 nm, and 100% beyond 530 nm). As a result, the film enabled fine control over the available excitation bands and intensities of Ho-NCs (Em: 1186 nm) and Er-NCs (Em: 1527 nm). Due to the maximal transmittance of the film, the accessible 450~700 nm of a WLED could excite encrypted LnNCs-printed patterns with clear visualization of a quick response code and ciphertext of “ILXE” (corresponding to the plaintext of “ROAD”) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">44</xref>).

A rationally designed symmetric multilayer core-shell nanostructure governs the directional energy transfer from multiple sensitizers to activators, achieving a distinctive multidirectional photon conversion mode surpassing the excitation limits. Note that the intrinsic spontaneous radiation of sensitizers and a mediator may preclude the maximal conversion of excitation energy, further structural optimization of LnNCs to regulate the energy flux may help improve the efficiency and promote functional diversification. The long-range downshifting NIR-II fluorescence endows the LnNCs with excellent performance in low-powered WLED-mediated angiography and excitation-regulated multiplex encryption. Moreover, the ultra-wideband responsive characteristics originated from our co-sensitization strategy also open possible avenues for chemiluminescence- or bioluminescence-excited NIR in vivo bioimaging applications and NIR fluorescence-guided surgery using common white-light as illumination sources (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>).

Before imaging, mice were anesthetized with 2 L min<sup>−1</sup> air mixed with 4% isoflurane. Then the hairs on the abdomen and legs of mice were removed by depilated cream.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>NIR-II fluorescence imaging of Er-NCs and whole-body angiography of mice</title><p id="Par30">(1) For the imaging of the powder Er-NCs sample, the sample was excited by several monochrome LEDs with central wavelengths at 450, 520, 570, 740, and 800 nm, respectively. A white LED was also adopted. The rated power of all LEDs was 5 W. The images were captured by an InGaAs camera (Artemis Intelligent Imaging, Shanghai, China) with an exposure of 25 ms. Then the exposure was reduced to 2 ms, and multiple LEDs were turned on and off gradually. The images and video were recorded in the process.</p><p id="Par31">(2) For the whole-body angiography, mice were anesthetized with 2 L min<sup>−1</sup> air mixed with 4% isoflurane throughout the imaging process. An 808-nm laser (power density: 0.12 W cm<sup>−2</sup>), 980-nm laser (power density: 0.12 W cm<sup>−2</sup>), and a WLED (power density: ~0.12 W cm<sup>−2</sup>) were adopted as the excitation sources to compare their imaging effects. The whole process from the injection of the probe to the visualization of vessel structures was recorded by using the NIR camera with a 1500 nm LP filter (Thorlabs), and mice were intravenously injected with the Er-PP probe by a drainage needle with a total amount of ca. 50 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>. The acquisitions lasted for several minutes. Data were processed using ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Preparation of photochromic film</title><p id="Par32">To a 20-mL vial was added PMMA (2.25 g) and acetone (15 mL). The mixture was stirred for 2 h to get a transparent solution. To this solution was added BG dye (2.0 mg), DEHP (0.4 mL), PAG (1.0 mg), and TEA (2 μL). After stirring for 30 min, the solution was poured into a glass Petri dish (Φ = 60 mm) and dried at 30 °C overnight (higher temperature may cause the production of bubbles). Finally, the film was cut into a 4 × 4 cm square and preserved in a dark place for further use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Information encryption and decryption application</title><p id="Par33">(1) Preparation of security ink. (A) Ligand exchange with NOBF<sub>4</sub>. Typically, a total of 50 mg Er-NCs (or Ho-NCs) were dispersed in 2 mL of cyclohexane followed by the addition of 5 mL of NOBF<sub>4</sub> (10 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> in DMF). The NCs were transferred to the DMF phase after ultrasonication for 5 min. The product was washed twice with ethanol to remove any remaining nonpolar organics. (B) Er-ink. The purified Er-NCs were dispersed in a 5-mL mixed solvent containing ultrapure water (20%), ethanol (50%), and glycerol (30%). (C) Ho-ink. The purified Ho-NCs were dispersed in a 2.5-mL mixed solvent containing ultrapure water (20%), ethanol (50%), and glycerol (30%).</p><p id="Par34">(2) Printing of encrypted pattern. The printing of the encrypted pattern was performed using a HP DeskJet 1112 printer. First, the original tri-color ink cartridge was washed thoroughly using deionized water and ethanol and dried in a vacuum oven. Then the as-prepared Er-ink was injected into the grid original placing C-ink, while the Ho-ink was injected into the grid original placing Y-ink. All patterns were printed on commercially available color-inkjet paper.</p><p id="Par35">(3) Information encryption/decryption application. For Information encryption, the pattern carrying confidential information was covered by the photochromic film (BG film), forming a security device (termed PBG). For Information decryption, the PBG was first irradiated by a handheld UV Lamp (365 nm), triggering the gradual photochromism of BG film from green to yellow. In this process, the transmittance of this film to white light increased gradually. A sequence of pseudocolor images could be captured by a NIR camera. With the right filter, the real information could be read out. Similarly, this technology could also provide encryption and decryption for the QR code and the ciphertext of Hill cipher.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, Project No. 81971704 (W.L.), the National Key Research and Development Program of China, Project No. 2017YFA0205304 (W.L.), and Translational Medicine Research Fund of National Facility for Translational Medicine (Shanghai), Project No. TMSK-2021-117 (W.L.).
