A marked enhancement of EET activity itself is verified by rapid reduction of exogenous electron acceptor, ferricyanide. The extracellular organic substances, including reducing equivalent(s), produced by this cyanobacterium serve as respiratory substrates for other heterotrophic bacteria.

Emerging among them is biophotovoltaics (BPV), in which the reducing equivalents are transferred extracellularly to electrodes or to other bacteria, a phenomenon called extracellular electron transfer (EET), eventually generating electrical power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Cyanobacteria, which are gram-negative bacteria capable of performing oxygenic photosynthesis, have been extensively studied in the field of BPV research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This is because cyanobacteria have higher energy conversion efficiency of photosynthesis than terrestrial plants, much like eukaryotic algae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Moreover, they are easy to culture, amenable to genetic manipulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, grow fast, and possess a simple cell structure compared with eukaryotes. Many studies on the mechanism of EET have been conducted using cyanobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and so far, direct EET via conductive nanowires<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and indirect, mediated EET by endogenous mediators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> have been put forward as possible EET pathways; some suggest that the latter is more likely than the former to occur in the case of cyanobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Although much progress has been made in the field of BPV in the past decade, the low EET activity of cyanobacteria remains a limitation. The EET activity of cyanobacteria, both in the dark and under illumination, is markedly lower compared with that of mineral-reducing, electricity-generating bacteria, e.g. the genera <italic>Shewanella</italic> and <italic>Geobacter</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, which are capable of utilizing diverse electron acceptors including an anode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. As previously pointed out, the main mechanism for the low EET activity of cyanobacteria is their autotrophy, in which EET could be totally useless and wasteful because electrons originating from phosynthesis should be fully utilized to provide enough reducing equivalents and energy to fix carbon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Here, we hypothesize an additional mechanism for the low EET activity of cyanobacteria: the low permeability of the outer membrane. The outer membrane of cyanobacteria exhibits more than 20-fold lower permeability to organic substrates than that of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the model gram-negative bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. This low permeability is thought to reflect its autotrophic life style<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, which does not necessarily rely on uptake of extracellular nutrients, although various transport systems do exist and function in cyanobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we show that, using an outer membrane-deprived <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter <italic>Synechocystis</italic>) mutant, slr0688i, in which the interaction between the outer membrane and the peptidoglycan is weakened so that the outer membrane is detached from the cell, a significant enhancement in cyanobacterial EET activity is achievable. EET activity is evaluated as extensively as possible in terms of photocurrent generation, ferricyanide reduction, and electron donation capacity as respiratory substrates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). This study verifies our hypothesis that the low permeability of the outer membrane contributes to the low EET activity of cyanobacteria.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>EET and photocurrent generation from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> cells.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic summary of EET from outer membrane-deprived <italic>Synechocystis</italic> cells, slr0688i. From slr0688i, reducing equivalents could be transferred to an exterior electrode via secreted compounds (mediated EET) or to an artificial electron acceptor, ferricyanide (ferricyanide-mediated EET). In addition, the extracellularly derived reducing equivalents could serve as respiratory substrates for other bacteria (here, <italic>Bacillus cereus</italic>), i.e., electron donors in BPV systems. <bold>b</bold> Slr0688i (OD<sub>730</sub> = 1.5, 4 mL; red points) and dCas9 (OD<sub>730</sub> = 1.5, 4 mL; black points) were injected by gravity onto plane ITO electrodes, and +0.25 V vs Ag/AgCl was applied to obtain chronoamperograms.

The growth curves of both cells and the typical electron-micrograph showing the outer membrane detachment of slr0688i cells are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>. Slr0688i and dCas9 resuspended in their respective supernatants were injected by gravity onto flat indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes to which +0.25 V vs. Ag/AgCl was applied, and the current generated under illumination was recorded. Photocurrent generated from slr0688i cells was increased by an order of magnitude compared to dCas9 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). On average, slr0688i generated approx. 40 and 20 times as much photocurrent as dCas9 at the initial stage and steady state (at <italic>t</italic> = 64 and 100 s in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>; Supplementary Table. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), respectively, with flat ITO electrodes; respresentative amperometric i-t curves of both strains are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>. To confirm that the observed enhancement in photocurrent generation of slr0688i did not stem from increased photosynthetic activity, the oxygen evolving activities of slr0688i and dCas9 were measured and compared. Under illumination with high light (750 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), neither photosynthetic nor respiratory activity was significantly different between them on a chlorophyll basis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>); moreover, under illumination with moderate light (120 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), the photosynthetic activity of slr0688i was slightly lower than that of dCas9 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). These results indicated that the enhanced photocurrent generation of slr0688i is not attributable to increased photosynthetic activity but to its outer membrane deprivation. As hydrophobicity of the cell surface is one of the decisive factors for the cell–electrode interaction, we performed a hydrophobicity assay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> by mixing slr0688i or dCas9 cell cultures with <italic>p</italic>-xylene. It was revealed that 49.0% ± 8.7% of dCas9 cells were adsorbed to <italic>p</italic>-xylene, whereas only 6.3% ± 1.8% of slr0688i cells were adsorbed (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). The finding that the hydrophobicity of slr0688i is significantly lower than that of dCas9, and the fact that hydrophobic cells are more adhesive to the ITO substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> suggest that cell–electrode interaction was not enhanced in the slr0688i mutant. Furthermore, we measured photocurrent under conditions where the influence of cell-electrode interaction was minimized by stirring the cell suspension in the presence of non-cell permeable mediator, ferricyanide (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). We confirmed that slr0688i cells generated significantly larger photocurrent than dCas9 cells. Therefore, the observed enhancement in current generation was attributable to outer membrane deprivation, not to enhanced cell–electrode interaction.</p><p id="Par7">Next, to examine the necessity of supernatants in photocurrent generation, the supernatant of slr0688i was substituted with that of dCas9 or fresh BG11, and the photocurrent was measured. Photocurrent generation from slr0688i was not affected by substitution with the supernatant of dCas9 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>; red versus pink lines) but was abolished by substitution with fresh BG11 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>; red versus green lines). In contrast, dCas9 did not generate a photocurrent with the supernatant of either slr0688i ((Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>; blue line) or dCas9 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>; black line) under our experimental conditions. These results demonstrated that redox-active, secreted compounds included in the supernatants of slr0688i and dCas9 serve as electron mediators in photocurrent generation from slr0688i. Some anodic peaks were observable in cyclic voltammograms taken from slr0688i resuspended in its supernatant (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>), which are possibily attributable to redox-active compounds secreted in the supernatant. These observations are consistent with recent suggestions that cyanobacterial secreted compounds serve as endogenous electron mediators in photocurrent generation from wild-type cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, photocurrent from the cells was observed with the supernatant of slr0688i containing compounds of molecular weight (MW) &lt; 3000 but not of MW &gt; 3000 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>), which is consistent with the prediction that small molecular compounds, such as quinones and flavines, might be responsible for photocurrent generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Taken together, these results indicated that outer membrane deprivation facilitates mediated EET, which requires secreted redox-active compounds regardless of deprivation of the outer membrane.</p><p id="Par8">As the level of photocurrent generation by BPV system is determined not only by EET activity of the cell but also by the properties of electrodes, a vast improvement of photocurrent generation is readily expected by utilizing slr0688i cells and electrode(s) more efficient than flat ITO. To verify this assumption, we utilized a carbon paper (CP) electrode as an anode, because (i) it provides high porosity and high specific area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> which increase chances of electron donation from extracellular mediator(s) to the electrode and (ii) carbon-based electrodes are empirically known to generate relatively high photocurrent in cyanobacterial BPV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Indeed, we observed approx. 30 μA/cm<sup>2</sup> photocurrent generation by slr0688i cells when using a CP anode (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). This was more than 100 times higher than that measured with a flat ITO anode, and represents the highest photocurrent by means of genetic manipulation of the cyanobacterial cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Also, this photocurrent amplitude is the highest among the previously reported values of BPV systems using the untreated whole cells of <italic>Synechocystis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>; note that Saper et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> reported that a mild physical pre-treatment of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> cells enhances the electrogenic activity and recorded appx. 30 µA/cm<sup>2</sup>. It should be noted that we employed the dense cell culture obtained after a prolonged cultivation period, i.e., 6-days cultivated cell culture, to achieve the high photocurrent value as above, but that we also noticed that this dense and ‘aged’ cell culture sometimes produced unstable photocurrent for unknown reason. As such, we used dilute and ‘young’ cell culture, i.e., 3-days cultivated cell culture, which tended to produce more stable photocurrent, for other comparative analysis with CP anodes such as the comparison of photocurrent between slr0688i and dCas9 cells or investigation of the effects of photosynthesis inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>, respectively). We confirmed that dCas9 cells produced only a modest level of photocurrent compared to slr0688i cells even when using a CP anode (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8a</xref>). This result assures that the high photocurrent level of slr0688i cells is attributed to the outer membrane deprivation but not to the property of the CP anode. It seemed noteworthy, however, that the photocurrent profile observed with a CP anode may not completely the same as that with an ITO anode, as we noticed that slr0688i cells generated photocurrent (approx. 2 to 3 µA/cm<sup>2</sup>) even after replacing the culture supernatant to fresh BG11 medium (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8b</xref>), on the contrary to the fact that this treatment completely abolished the photocurrent when using an ITO anode (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8b</xref>). Hence, the photocurrent generated by slr0688i cells with a CP anode might stem partially from EET pathway(s) distinct from that to an ITO anode, e.g., the one via direct interaction between the cells and the electrode. To focus solely on the effect of outer membrane deprivation on EET activity, ITO was used as an anode in all the following experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Electrons are suggested to stem from pathway(s) downstream of photosystem I</title><p id="Par9">To narrow down the site where the reducing equivalents were transferred extracellularly, we examined the effects of a series of photosynthesis inhibitors, namely 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), potassium cyanide (KCN), phenylmercuric acetate (PMA), glycolaldehyde (GA), and <italic>p</italic>-chloromercuribenzoate (pCMB), on photocurrent generation by slr0688i cells.

We therefore employed multiple photosynthetic parameters to specify the action of pCMB and to distinguish it from those of the other inhibitors (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>). The pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) measurements and NADPH fluorescence revealed that pCMB did not affect the light-dependent redox kinetics of P700 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12a</xref>) nor inhibit NADPH generation upon illumination (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13a</xref>). These results indicated that pCMB inhibited the reaction downstream of photosynthetic NADPH generation. While NADPH generation was not inhibited at the onset of light illumination, prolonged light illumination (&gt;1 min) of pCMB-treated cells caused a decrease in oxygen-evolving activity and effective quantum yield of PSII [Y(II)] (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11b</xref>). These phenomena are common in cells in which the Calvin cycle is inhibited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. These observations suggest that pCMB perturbs the consumption of photosynthetically generated reducing energy presumably by inhibiting the Calvin cycle, which may temporarily reinforce the reduction of possible electron mediator(s) as the alternative consumption route, thereby enhancing the photocurrent.</p><p id="Par11">As it was necessary to distinguish the action of the other inhibitors from that of pCMB, we likewise evaluated their effects on photosynthetic parameters. DCMU unequivocally inhibited electron transfer from Q<sub>A</sub> to Q<sub>B</sub> in PSII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, which was evident from the fact that Y(II) became zero from the onset of measurements (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10b</xref>). KCN at 5 mM completely inhibited both oxygen consumption and evolution activity measured with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> as the sole electron acceptor (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11a</xref>); this result was consistent with its reported inhibitory effects on respiratory terminal oxidases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> as well as plastocyanin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and possibly the Calvin cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. PMA induced decreases in Y(II) and oxygen-evolving activity upon illumination in a similar manner to pCMB (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11c</xref>), but NADPH generation and consumption upon illumination and in the dark, respectively, were clearly inhibited (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13b</xref>). Thus, the inhibition site of PMA was suggested to be ferredoxin and/or ferredoxin-NADP(H) reductase FNR as previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Besides, we note that P700 oxidation level under illumination with far red (FR) light (i.e., the level before the time point indicated by an upward-pointing arrowhead) was elevated in PMA-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12b</xref>). The P700 oxidation level under FR light depends on the redox state of PQ governed by the respiration and/or cyclic electron transfer (CET) around PSI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>; the possibility that PMA acts pleiotropically on CET or respiration cannot be ruled out. Indeed, previous studies suggested that FNR contributes to respiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Explanation of the effect of GA was not straightforward. GA is reported to be a Calvin cycle inhibitor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> but abolished the slr0688i photocurrent (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The effects of GA on Y(II) and oxygen-evolving activity were seemingly similar to those of pCMB. However, a closer look at P700 redox kinetics (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>) revealed that the P700 oxidation level under illumination with FR light was elevated in GA-treated cells. This suggests that GA not only inhibits the Calvin cycle but also interferes with respiration- or CET-related cellular metabolic pathway(s). The difference in action between pCMB and GA suggests that electrons involved in photocurrent generation are derived from the components or metabolic pathway(s) that is/are presumably connected to the PQ reduction activity; this issue is discussed in more detail later in this paper. Note that when steady-state NADP(H) contents and the NADP<sup>+</sup>/NADPH ratio were quantified, no significant differences between slr0688i and dCas9 were observed (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>). This suggests that the enhanced photocurrent generation from slr0688i is, at least, not associated with the amount of intracellular NADPH.</p><p id="Par12">Finally, we confirmed that, with CP anodes, the effects of the photosynthetic inhibitors on photocurrent generation were basically the same as those observed with ITO anodes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>).

Hence, we next used an exogenous electron acceptor, ferricyanide, and evaluated EET more directly at the level of ferricyanide reduction. Cell suspensions of slr0688i and dCas9 were mixed with 1 mM potassium ferricyanide, and changes in the ferricyanide concentration under illumination or in the dark were monitored spectroscopically. Under illumination, slr0688i reduced the extracellularly added ferricyanide at a rate of 2.3 µM OD<sup>−1 </sup>min<sup>−1</sup>, whereas dCas9 exhibited no reduction of ferricyanide in the tested time range (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, c</xref>). In the dark, slr0688i reduced ferricyanide at a lower rate (0.8 µM OD<sup>−1 </sup>min<sup>−1</sup>) than under illumination but still at a significantly higher rate than dCas9 in the same conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, d</xref>). Substitution of the supernatant with fresh BG11 did not affect the rate of ferricyanide reduction either under illumination or in the dark (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), indicating that ferricyanide-mediated EET, which could not be fully detected by the photocurrent measurements (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>), was detected by this assay. It has long been considered that ferricyanide freely passes through the outer membrane and accepts electrons from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> via some transmembrane protein at the cytoplasmic membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>; however, the aforementioned results (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) indicated that the outer membrane does serve as a barrier to ferricyanide, which is consistent with its role as a low-permeability molecular sieve that prevents passage of hydrophilic organic molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. By using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), we quantified the iron (Fe) concentration in the supernatant of the reaction mixture and confirmed that the total concentration of Fe did not change during the measurement period (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>). This result indicated that ferricyanide reduction was attributable to the EET activity of the cells and not to the uptake/sequestration of ferricyanide by the cells. Together with the results of the photocurrent measurements, these results clearly showed that deprivation of the outer membrane leads to a significant increase of both mediated and ferricyanide-mediated EET.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Rate of ferricyanide reduction by <italic>Synechocystis</italic> cells.</title><p>Time-dependent reduction of ferricyanide (<bold>a</bold>) under illumination and (<bold>b</bold>) in the dark by slr0688i (red) and dCas9 (black).

First, aforementioned physical treatments might partially perturb the structural integrity of the cell surface but is not expected to deprive the outer membrane from the cells because the cyanobacterial outer membrane is well known to be tightly anchored to the peptidoglycan even after the mechanical disruption of the cells, such as passing through a French pressure cell press at 14,000 psi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> or mechanical cracking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>. Detaching the outer membrane thus requires the enzymatic degradation of the peptidoglycan and/or solubilization of the outer membrane by detergent treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Second, suspending the cells in 400 mM NaCl unequivocally generates the osmotic pressure to the cytoplasmic membrane rather than to the outer membrane because the outer membrane contains abundant non-specific channels those allow the rapid passage of ions across the outer membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Indeed, Reed et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> showed that treating the cells with 490 mM NaCl affected the cytoplasmic membrane and resulted in the leakage of various cytosolic metabolites, which may include the possible mediator(s) for EET. Third, genetically engineered outer membrane deprivation avoids interfering the cytoplasmic membrane function and cytosolic metabolites release, so that even abundant cytosolic molecules, such as NADP(H), was not detected in the culture supernatant of the outer membrane-deprived cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>, which is discussed in detail later in Discussion section). Consequently, it appears reasonable to assume that the electron transfer path from the physically-treated cells and that from the outer membrane-deprived cells, to the electrodes, are different; as a matter of fact, this assumption was verified by a striking difference in their photocurrent properties that DCMU enhances the photocurrent of the former cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> but abolishes the photocurrent from the latter cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">Photocurrent measurements under the presence of a number of photosynthesis inhibitors demonstrated that the electrons stem from the pathway(s) downstream of PSI (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>). Among the effects of the inhibitors, the difference in effects of GA and pCMB appeared to be important; both compounds are suggested to inhibit the Calvin cycle (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, but the former inhibitor abolished the photocurrent, whereas the latter markedly enhanced it (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). One obvious difference in effects between GA and pCMB was that only GA-treated cells exhibited a high P700 oxidation level under FR light illumination (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>), suggesting that GA inhibits respiration- and/or CET-related pathway(s). It is not unreasonable to assume the inhibitors affect pathways other than the Calvin cycle because GA is known to be inherently pleiotropic owing to its electrophilicity; indeed, GA is reported to inhibit yeast growth and fermentation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. An additional difference between GA and pCMB was evident from NADPH fluorescence measurement (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>); the pCMB-treated cells showed a slowed decay of NADPH fluorescence after switching off the light and NADPH formation in the subsequent dark period was never observed. The slowed NADPH fluorescence decay may be attributable to Calvin cycle inhibition, but the lack of subsequent NADPH formation in the dark suggests the existence of other inhibitory effects of pCMB on the metabolic pathway(s) that reduces NADP, such as the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. We speculate that inhibition of dark NADPH formation changes cellular metabolism to accumulate alternative reducing equivalents instead of NADPH and this may be linked to the enhanced EET activity. Supporting this speculation, the pCMB-treated cells showed greatly enhanced EET current even in the dark (see the amperometric i-t curve in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Taken together, the electrons involved in photocurrent generation seem to be derived from intermediates of metabolic pathway(s) that is linked to PQ reduction but not to NADP reduction. Elucidation of the action of GA and pCMB will provide further insights into the EET mechanism.</p><p id="Par21">The notion that the photocurrent stems from the pathway(s) downstream of PSI is largely consistent with previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, the possible involvement of the pathway(s) connected to PQ reduction agreed with the previous observation that a mutant deficient in the functional NDH complex, which supplies electrons to PQ, exhibits significant enhancement of ferricyanide reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, contradictory observations hinder a straightforward understanding of the EET mechanism of this cyanobacterium. (I) Strikingly, some studies reported that DCMU enhances photocurrent generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, whereas others, including this study, reported the opposite effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. (II) Recently, Shlosberg et al. reported that NADPH serves as the electron mediator in this bacterium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, this mechanism is not necessarily applicable to this study because of the following two reasons. (I) We confirmed that the supernatant of slr0688i cells, regardless of before and after the electrochemical measurement, contained no detectable level of NADPH that was analyzed by means of the two-dimensional fluorescence mapping (2D-FM), enzymatic analysis, and LC-MS/MS analysis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>). The 2D-FL revealed the presence of strong fluorescent molecules and one of which exhibited the fluorescence pattern of excitation wavelength (Ex) of 360 nm and emission wavelength (Em) of 450 nm, which was similar to those of NADPH (Ex 340 nm/ Em 460 nm). However, the small discrepancy of Ex/Em led us to further analyze whether this fluorescence was actually derived from NADPH; neither an enzymatic assay whose detection limit was 0.0625 µM nor a LC-MS/MS assay using the 50-fold concentrated supernatant detected NADPH. On the basis of these results, we concluded that the fluorescent molecules found in the supernatant was not NADPH. The absence of NADPH in the supernatant is reasonable because the bacterial periplasm is well known to be an oxidizing environment, and bacteria possess various systems to convey reducing power to periplasmic space rather than directly exporting the cytosolic reducing equivalents such as NAD(P)H (one of the examples can be found in Depuydt et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>). Thus, just depriving the outer membrane is not considered to result in releasing NADPH into the external environment. (II) Furthermore, intracellular NADPH fluorescence intensity was not significantly changed even in pCMB-treated cells despite their showing greatly enhanced photocurrent generation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13a</xref>). One possible explanation for these contradictory observations is the assumption that the EET pathway may depend on the cellular physiology and intracellular electron flux, which are sensitive to numerous growth condition parameters, such as light intensity or CO<sub>2</sub> availability. Thus, further investigation is necessary to elucidate the EET mechanism of this organism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">Deprivation of the outer membrane is undoubtedly beneficial not only for the improvement of BPV systems but also for enhancing production of various chemicals ranging from biofuels to high-value compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>.

Measurements were performed in the remission mode, where measuring light (830/875 nm, intensity 10 with the DualPAM software) from the fiberoptics entered the cuvette and, after scattering and partial absorption by the cell suspension, was picked up by the fiberoptics from the same side. Changes in P700 absorption were measured by applying the multiple-turnover flash (300 ms, intensity of 16 with the software) following illumination for 10 s with FR light (720 nm, 2.7 µmol photons m<sup>-</sup><sup>2</sup> s<sup>-</sup><sup>1</sup>, which was an intensity of 20 with the DualPAM software).
