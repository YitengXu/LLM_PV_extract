The goal is to research, develop, and optimize technical procedures based on natural and engineering sciences as well as socioeconomic factors in order to provide high-quality and safe food for human consumption. Food processing refers to the conversion/transformation of raw materials to a safe food product. This chapter introduces the physical, chemical, and biological unit operations typically used in food processing to ensure food safety and quality. The influence of intrinsic as well as extrinsic parameters on microbial growth behavior is highlighted and examples of important factors that need to be considered during food processing are introduced (water activity, enzyme activity, lipid oxidation). At the end of the chapter, strategies for new product developments are also presented.</p><p id="Par2">Biotechnological Conversion: This chapter presents key terms and concepts in the field of industrial biotechnology. The inclusion of examples, such as ethanol fermentation, and production of polylactic acid (PLA) and propanediol (PDO), allows students to become acquainted with important concepts and their application. Industrial biotechnology, also known as “white biotechnology,” is devoted to the exploitation of living cells, such as yeasts, molds, bacteria, and enzymes. In the context of a bioeconomy, it may provide methods to replace and complement petroleum-based synthetics. Industrial biotechnology has been identified as a key enabling technology. Nowadays, industrial biochemicals are mainly produced from carbon sources based on sucrose and glucose. In a future bioeconomy, lignocellulosic plant biomass could become a key feedstock. However, for this purpose, technologies are required that can break down lignocellulosic biomass more easily, with less energy input, and creating less waste than is presently the case. The rapid development of genetic, synthetic biology and bioprocessing methods will lead to biotechnology increasingly complementing chemical industries.</p><p id="Par3">Thermochemical Conversion: All thermochemical conversions help to overcome two main hurdles in the bioeconomy: the high oxygen content of biomass (low heating value if used as fuel) and the large variability in biomass composition and characteristics. In addition, all thermochemical conversions have in common that they can produce platform chemicals, materials, or fuels from a wide range of biomass types, and that the oxygen content is lower in the product than in the feedstock. The bioeconomy is not only a concept, but also requires technologies that are attractive enough for companies to put into practice, thus creating the technological base for a large-scale use of biomass.</p><p id="Par4">For the substitution of fossil resources by biomass, new technologies are needed. In this chapter, students learn how biomass is converted by (thermo-)chemical conversion technologies to energy carriers or platform chemicals. One example is the conversion of chicory roots to the platform chemical hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). After further chemical conversion, HMF can be used to produce a wide range of common objects from daily life, including bottles and stockings. Thermal conversion can also be applied to produce special carbon materials, e.g., supercapacitors, which will enable a more flexible use of e-cars.</p><p id="Par5">Process and Product Cost Assessment: When a new product or process is developed and introduced, market analyses and cost estimates are required to examine its marketability and manufacturing or production costs. Before a company takes the decision to construct a production plant and invest in the production and marketing of a certain product, it needs to make sure that the planned process is the most economical and thus the most profitable alternative. In order to make this decision in a sound manner, various tools are used to carry out an economic assessment, weighing up the different costs and revenues against each other. Profitability considerations are also used to develop business plans and assess the state and value of a company. When decisions to invest in chemical conversion plants are taken, a large number of factors have to be taken into account. Hard factors such as profitability and amortization time are important to outline the investment opportunity. However, they are not sufficient to fully characterize the process and thus correctly assess the investment potential. Soft factors also need to be considered in order to weight up further advantages and disadvantages of an investment. These include a number of criteria relating to the technical process, the location of the production plant, and the market situation. Production costs are strongly influenced by the technology applied along with its materials and energy balance. Therefore, process and product cost analysis takes place in early stages and during process engineering. The resulting economic data allow an economic analysis and the creation of a business plan, which help to determine whether a planned project is profitable or not. This chapter provides the fundamental knowledge for this process, together with an example of a cost estimation.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Food quality</kwd><kwd>Food safety</kwd><kwd>Shelf life</kwd><kwd>Industrial processing</kwd><kwd>Food functionality</kwd><kwd>Water activity</kwd><kwd>Product development</kwd><kwd>Industrial biotechnology</kwd><kwd>Biological system</kwd><kwd>Bioprocess engineering</kwd><kwd>Strain development</kwd><kwd>Biocatalysts</kwd><kwd>Upstream and downstream processing</kwd><kwd>Biobased products</kwd><kwd>Pyrolysis</kwd><kwd>Gasification</kwd><kwd>Carbonization</kwd><kwd>Torrefaction</kwd><kwd>Supercritical water</kwd><kwd>Hydrothermal processes</kwd><kwd>Platform chemical</kwd><kwd>Costing</kwd><kwd>Investment costs</kwd><kwd>Manufacturing costs</kwd><kwd>Variable and fixed costs</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-3-319-68152-8_Chapter_7.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group><notes notes-type="Misc"><p>The original online version of this chapter was revised.

Due to the special characteristics of biobased resources (see Sect. <ext-link xlink:href="10.1007/978-3-319-68152-8_5" ext-link-type="doi">5.1</ext-link>), appropriate conversion approaches need to be selected with the desired application in mind.</p><p id="Par7">Food supply is the most traditional and, of course, most essential function of biobased resources. Section <xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec">7.1</xref> presents fundamental knowledge on food quality and food processing techniques.</p><p id="Par8">For production of materials, our economic system is predominantly based on finite fossil carbon resources, such as natural gas, crude oil, and coal. Crude oil is the basis for most fuels and is refined into more useful products such as naphtha, gasoline, diesel, asphalt, heating oil, kerosene, and gas. These are further processed to intermediates and final products including plastics, fibers, vanishes, and adhesives. Petroleum (or naphtha) is a liquid raw material consisting of reduced hydrocarbons which are mostly oxidized to the desired product. In this process, inorganic, often metallic, catalysts are used and both high temperatures and pressures are applied. The conversion starts with pure and relatively concentrated educts, making product recovery comparatively simple.</p><p id="Par9">Biorefinery concepts explore possible routes for the refining of renewable resources to fuels, energy, and materials, analogous to chemical refining processes. These generally make use of all biomass components, resulting in various educt streams which can be converted to basic products. In contrast to crude oil, naphtha, and other petrochemical fractions, biomass materials for biorefineries display lower energy densities, are solid rather than liquid, and are partially oxidized.</p><p id="Par10">Lignocellulose is the most abundant biopolymer and is a solid raw material. It consists of three main components, namely the carbohydrates cellulose and hemicellulose (polyoses) and lignin. Cellulose and hemicellulose are polymers consisting of hexoses and pentoses; lignin is a cross-linked phenolic polymer built up from aromatic alcohols.</p><p id="Par11">Fractionation and depolymerization are prerequisites for further bioconversion. Lignin is most often separated from the carbohydrates and combusted to supply the bioconversion process energy. The carbohydrates can be depolymerized by acid or enzymatic hydrolysis, to form aqueous sugar solutions with a sugar content of about 0.2–2%, which is then concentrated. In this approach, the structure of the resource is preserved, to give relatively defined sugar streams. These sugar streams may be used in biotechnological processes to supplement the substrates sucrose and glucose originating from sugarcane, sugar beet, and hydrolysis of starch (Sect. <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">7.2</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">Another concept is the thermochemical conversion (Sect. <xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">7.3</xref>) of the renewable feedstock, which is technologically less demanding. This method breaks down the biomass into a complex mixture of partly reduced substances.</p><p id="Par13">The sugar and lignin fractions are partially oxidized and, in many cases, have to be reduced to gain valuable products. For this purpose, CO<sub>2</sub> has to be removed from the carbon skeleton. This implies that on a mass base product yields generally are lower than in petrochemical production. For these reactions, catalysts have to be employed which act highly specifically and stop at a certain oxidative step. Biocatalysts (whole cells or enzymes) possess these properties but, in contrast to inorganic catalysts, they require physiological conditions. The reactions are performed at moderate temperature (10–60 °C), under normal pressure. But as the educt stream is yet diluted, also the product stream is diluted, consisting of only 1–10% of the product, and 90–99% of water. This demands a quite intensive downstream processing.</p><p id="Par14">In a biobased economy renewable feedstocks, thus mainly plants, form the basis for materials. Biorefineries provide concepts for thermochemical and biochemical conversion of biobased materials towards fuels, materials, and energy. However, for mobility and energy solutions solar, wind, or geothermal energy are promising, but for materials the use of renewable feedstocks is the most suitable solution so far. Carbon capture and utilization technologies potentially may be included in the biorefinery concepts.</p><sec id="Sec1"><sec-meta><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author" corresp="yes"><name><surname>Loeffler</surname><given-names>Myriam</given-names></name><address><email>myriam.loeffler@uni-hohenheim.de</email></address><xref ref-type="aff" rid="Aff7">7</xref><xref ref-type="corresp" rid="IDSec1_cor1">a</xref></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hinrichs</surname><given-names>Jörg</given-names></name><address><email>j.hinrichs@uni-hohenheim.de</email></address><xref ref-type="aff" rid="Aff8">8</xref></contrib><aff id="Aff7"><label>7</label><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ISNI">0000 0001 2290 1502</institution-id><institution-id institution-id-type="GRID">grid.9464.f</institution-id><institution content-type="org-division">Institute of Food Science and Biotechnology; Food Physics and Meat Science</institution><institution content-type="org-name">University of Hohenheim</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line content-type="city">Stuttgart</addr-line><country country="DE">Germany</country></aff><aff id="Aff8"><label>8</label><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ISNI">0000 0001 2290 1502</institution-id><institution-id institution-id-type="GRID">grid.9464.f</institution-id><institution content-type="org-division">Institute of Food Science and Biotechnology; Soft Matter Science and Dairy Technology</institution><institution content-type="org-name">University of Hohenheim</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line content-type="city">Stuttgart</addr-line><country country="DE">Germany</country></aff></contrib-group></sec-meta><title>Food Processing</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Abstract</title><p id="Par1000">Food science and technology is the science that deals with the physical, biological, and chemical processes relevant for the processing of food and food ingredients.

Moreover, ritual functions (e.g., the Eucharist) and prohibitions (e.g., Jewish food regulations) are linked to food and food consumption. Nowadays, quite a few of these prohibitions can be explained and understood by looking at former climatic and hygienic conditions and the related diseases. For instance, it is well known that beans should not be consumed without processing. Raw beans contain a toxic protein (phasin), which has to be denatured prior to consumption by heating or pickling to prevent intestinal colic. Thus, knowledge of the cultivation, storage, preservation, and processing of food was and still is of great importance. In this context, food processing describes the conversion/transformation of raw material to a safe food product.</p><p id="Par35">Today, there is a variety of possibilities (e.g., unit operations) to convert and hence process plant and animal raw materials to semifinished goods (e.g., flour), ready-to-eat end products (e.g., bread), and convenience food including special diets.</p><p id="Par36">A distinction has to be made between physical, biological, and chemical methods used for raw material and food processing. Depending on the requirements, these techniques may be applied individually, in a particular order or in combination. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">7.1</xref> gives an overview of unit operations used in food processing.

For instance, research findings of Justus Liebig led to an increase in agricultural production of about 90% between 1873 and 1913. The use of fertilizers, scientifically based animal breeding, and initial mechanization of agriculture allowed more and more people to be supplied with food. At the same time, new methods of preservation and packaging were developed (e.g., 1804, sterilization of milk) to extend storage time and improve food transportation, leading to a marked increase in small-scale and large-scale operating companies in Europe and North America.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Food Quality, Shelf Life, and Food Safety: Drivers of Technical Food Processing</title><p id="Par38">An important requirement for the storage and trade of food and food ingredients is that they either retain their specific properties (best case) or undergo only minor physicochemical and/or microbial changes over a longer period of time, thus guaranteeing food quality and safety.</p><p id="Par39">“Safe” in this context means that neither pathogens nor toxins are present in the food product prior to consumption. Many of the physical, biological, and chemical methods listed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">7.1</xref> are used to prolong shelf life, but they may vary depending on the product. In the past, food products were often preserved by reducing water activity (Sect. <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">7.1.5</xref>) or through fermentation. For instance, foods already traded in antiquity included dry products such as salt, sugar, cereals, dried meat, and spices, or fermented products such as wine or vinegar, as well as salt-conserved products including fish (e.g., salt cod), meat, and cheese.

Some products may have further requirements such as health aspects. In the food industry, all these requirements are the responsibility of the manufacturer and once products are on the market they are subjected to state quality standard monitoring.</p><p id="Par62">In general, industrial scale food production is characterized by a higher degree of automation. In addition, a “higher” safety level is required, since the semifinished or final products are often marketed over long distances, which in turn requires a longer shelf life and appropriate packaging.

For this reason, the chemical, biological, and physical properties of the raw materials and also their behavior during processing have to be taken into account. The technology-structure-function relationship behind the processing of raw materials (e.g., sugar beet, milk) into foodstuffs (sugar cubes, processed cheese) is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">7.3</xref>. In the figure, “technology” includes the substances and ingredients used, their concentration and composition, as well as the basic operation(s) applied (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">7.1</xref>). The desired functionality of the product is achieved through the choice of process parameters (e.g., pressure, temperature, pH). The structure of the final product (e.g., sugar cubes: small crystals in the form of a cube of defined edge length, white, solid) is predominantly influenced by the technology used. In turn, the structure provides the basis for the functionality of certain food products (e.g., sugar cubes: dissolve rapidly in hot liquids; desired sweetness).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 7.3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Technology-structure-function relationship for the processing of food as well as the development of new food products</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/450653_1_En_7_Fig3_HTML.gif" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par72">For the same raw material, even small changes in the process parameters of basic operations, the use of other machines/equipment, or a change in the order of the unit operations can influence the structure and thus also the functionality of the end product.

The physical properties (e.g., liquid/solid), the chemical composition, and, in particular, the water content of the raw materials to be processed are of high importance. However, it is freely available water rather than the total water content that is crucial for appropriate processing. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">7.4</xref> shows the intensity of various reactions depending on the water activity. The water activity (<italic>a</italic><sub>w</sub>) value is calculated as the water vapor pressure of the raw material/foodstuff divided by the vapor pressure of pure water at the same temperature. Substances of low molecular mass, such as salts or sugars, are surrounded by water molecules and can thus reduce the water vapor pressure above the food and therefore also the <italic>a</italic><sub>w</sub> value.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 7.4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Potential of microorganisms to grow on food depending on water activity (above).

Freezing also reduces the mobility of water, preventing microorganisms from growing and reducing the rate of chemical reactions. Consequently, this process is now widely used to protect raw materials, semifinished products, and finished products from spoilage and to preserve vitamins, color, and texture.

One way to prevent enzyme activity and kill microorganisms at the same time is through heating. However, heating can lead to nonenzymatic browning by the Maillard reaction. The reaction takes place between proteins and sugars and may cause desired (caramel, bread, malt beer) or undesired (juices, milk powder) effects depending on the characteristics of the food product.</p><p id="Par77">It is interesting to note that the oxidation of lipids (fats) is lowest at a water activity of 0.2 (minimum) and more pronounced in products with either a lower (<italic>a</italic><sub>w</sub> &lt; 0.2) or a higher water activity (<italic>a</italic><sub>w</sub> &gt; 0.2).

An autoclave is a pressure vessel in which temperatures of about 120 °C are reached using overpressure. If this temperature is maintained for about 20–30 min, mesophilic and thermophilic bacterial spores are inactivated. Sterilized milk has a shelf life of 1 year and can be stored at room temperature.

Food waste is composted and used either as fertilizer or in biogas plants for heat and electricity generation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Strategies/Approaches for New Product Developments</title><p id="Par92">Innovative companies generally launch a new product idea (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">7.8</xref>) following existing trends or resetting trends by responding to changing consumer habits, social conditions (e.g., full-day child care), or trade demands. This also involves innovative technologies, such as membrane separation processes. Once the functional characteristics have been specified and the target consumer groups defined, a marketing concept is required that includes analysis of the market potential with respect to sales volume and price. The functionality of the final product needs to be specified as clearly as possible in order to be able to elaborate a detailed product concept.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 7.8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>From the idea to the new food product</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/450653_1_En_7_Fig8_HTML.gif" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par93">Numerous aspects have to be taken into account during the product development process. The first step involves (preliminary) experiments in the laboratory, which consider the following aspects: selection of raw materials, additives, and other ingredients, a risk analysis (HACCP), specifications, appropriate test procedures for both the materials and functional properties, suppliers, shelf life, etc. The test procedures for the functional properties need to be defined and validated. The unit operations required to produce a product with certain functionalities as well as their sequence need to be defined. In addition, technical and legal requirements for the facilities have to be considered.</p><p id="Par94">A pilot test then validates the technology used to produce a product with a certain structure and function and experiments are carried out to assess the shelf life. All these steps are repeated several times (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">7.8</xref>) before the first production on a scaled-up level starts. At the same time, product declaration and packaging materials have to be adapted to the requirements of the product.</p><p id="Par95">Once all these steps have been completed and the product documentation is available, the official production and supply to retailers can begin. Once the new product is established on the market, it is important to constantly improve the recipe and to monitor market success. Only about 1 idea out of 100 will be successful in the long run.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><sec><p id="Par96">The technical processing of food should be seen as a continuous process of development that usually follows consumer demands. New technologies enable, for example, the decaffeination of coffee, the dealcoholization of beer, lactose reduction in dairy products, reduction of allergens, and production of fat-reduced foods that still taste good. Additionally, technical food production allows supply of a wide variety of high-quality food products at reasonable prices. Without technically processed products with a long shelf life, the supply of megacities could no longer be guaranteed, even in developing countries.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par97">A new focus is the valorization of product waste and side streams, biorefinery, and use of “new” resources (depending on the country). Current research studies therefore have a strong focus on, for example, alternative protein resources (e.g., from microalgae and insects) but also on techniques that help to monitor the temperature history of food products during transportation and storage (e.g., time temperature indicators).</p></sec><sec id="FPar16"><title>Review Questions</title><p id="Par98"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par99">What are the properties of proteins and fats in food?

The inclusion of examples, such as ethanol fermentation, and production of polylactic acid (PLA) and propanediol (PDO), allows students to become acquainted with important concepts and their application. Industrial biotechnology, also known as “white biotechnology,” is devoted to the exploitation of living cells, such as yeasts, molds, bacteria, and enzymes. In the context of a bioeconomy, it may provide methods to replace and complement petroleum-based synthetics. Industrial biotechnology has been identified as a key enabling technology. Nowadays, industrial biochemicals are mainly produced from carbon sources based on sucrose and glucose. In a future bioeconomy, lignocellulosic plant biomass could become a key feedstock. However, for this purpose, technologies are required that can break down lignocellulosic biomass more easily, with less energy input, and creating less waste than is presently the case. The rapid development of genetic, synthetic biology and bioprocessing methods will lead to biotechnology increasingly complementing chemical industries.</p></sec><sec id="FPar21"><title>Keywords</title><p id="Par1060">Industrial biotechnology; Biological system; Bioprocess engineering; Strain development; Biocatalysts; Upstream and downstream processing; Biobased products</p></sec><sec><p id="Par108"><fig id="Figb" position="anchor"><caption xml:lang="en"><p>© Bildarchiv Uni Hohenheim, photo by Manfred Zentsch</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/450653_1_En_7_Figb_HTML.jpg" position="anchor" id="MO10"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="FPar18"><title>Learning Objectives</title><p id="Par109">After reading this chapter, you should<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par110">Understand the importance of industrial biotechnology for a biobased economy.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par111">Know the key terms and concepts required to understand basic processes of bioprocess engineering.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par112">Know biotechnologically derived products of the present and the future.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Industrial Biotechnology</title><p id="Par113">Industrial biotechnology uses microorganisms and enzymes for the production of biobased materials. These materials are utilized in the chemical, food and feed, healthcare, and biofuel sectors. Currently, biotechnology is a niche within the chemical industry, mostly providing products with demanding structure or stereochemistry requirements.</p><p id="Par114">Historically, biotechnology dealt with uncontrolled food processing, such as in the production of wine, beer, vinegar, bread, cheese, and other fermented foods. In 1873, Louis Pasteur received a patent on isolated yeast, and since then the role of yeast in beer brewing and that of bacteria in vinegar fermentation has been exploited, and knowledge-based biotechnology began to evolve.</p><p id="Par115">Contemporary industrial biotechnology, by contrast, uses controlled and induced production of various microbial products. This is achieved through the choice of and, in some cases, the genetic manipulation of the producing organisms and the development of bioprocess engineering. Bioprocess engineering provides both sterile conditions and control of several physiologically important parameters such as temperature (T), pH, dissolved oxygen (pO<sub>2</sub>), and input of carbon and nitrogen sources as well as other components. Today, such methods enable reproducible processes to be performed, thus ensuring product quality.</p><p id="Par116">There are three phases in bioprocess engineering: upstream processing, bioreaction, and downstream processing (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">7.9</xref>). Upstream processing refers to all operations for the planning and preparation of the bioreaction. This includes the choice of the suitable biological system, the appropriate physiological parameters, as well as the strain development. The practical preparation of the bioreaction—i.e., preparation of media, sterilization of bioreactor, and preparation of pre-cultures—also belongs to this step. During the bioreaction, a given substrate is converted into the desired product by a biological system. Microorganisms (bacteria, yeast, fungi), mammalian cells, and enzymes may be utilized. As the resulting product typically comprises no more than 10–15% of the fermentation broth, downstream processing is needed in order to separate and purify the desired product.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 7.9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic overview of upstream, bioreaction, and downstream processing in biotechnology.

For the choice of a suitable biological system, it is important that the organism is able to produce the desired product efficiently.

They are easily genetically manipulated; robust against shear stress, pressure, and osmosis; show high productivity, cell densities, and growth rates; and are able to grow in comparatively inexpensive media. One disadvantage is that they are often deficient in secretion of proteins and are not able to perform important posttranslational modifications such as N-glycosylation. The bacteria may become infected by phages, possibly destroying the bacteria culture and resulting in the loss of production.</p><p id="Par119">Industrially employed <italic>yeast and fungi</italic> include <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> (beer and wine yeasts, ethanol), <italic>Penicillium (</italic>many antibiotics, e.g., penicillin), and <italic>Aspergillus</italic> (some antibiotics, many organic acids, e.g., citric acid). Their advantages are the following: high productivity of homologous proteins, high cell densities, very good secretion, fast growth rates, good pH tolerance (very important for the production of acids), large cell size (simplifies downstream processing), and no problems with phages. Additionally, yeast and fungi can perform posttranslational modification. However, their glycosylation pattern is neither identical nor similar to that of humans, and this limits their use in pharmaceutical products.</p><p id="Par120">The production of therapeutic glycoproteins for pharmaceutical use is performed by <italic>mammalian cell</italic> cultures.

It may even be that the production strain does not naturally produce the desired substance at all. In order to enable the production or improve the productivity, strains are genetically modified. This is called strain development. Methods used include classic screening and mutagenesis, genetic engineering, metabolic engineering (directed mutagenesis), and synthetic biology.</p><p id="Par126">In <italic>classical mutagenesis</italic> (example: penicillin), the microorganism known to produce the desired substance is mutagenized by chemicals or UV light, which introduces random changes in the genome. A screening is then carried out to select enhanced producers. Mutagenesis and screening are traditionally repeated iteratively for several generations of microorganisms. This approach is very time consuming. Another drawback is the introduction of several random mutations, which individually or collectively reduce the viability of the organism.</p><p id="Par127">If the desired product is a direct gene product (i.e., a protein), <italic>genetic engineering</italic> is a suitable choice (example: insulin). Here, the gene encoding for the desired protein is additionally incorporated via a vector or chromosomal integration into the production strain, which then produces it either intra- or extracellularly.</p><p id="Par128">In <italic>metabolic engineering</italic>, the metabolic pathways of a microorganism are improved by enhancement of desired pathways and deletion or attenuation of those that lead to by-products. Bottlenecks are identified through metabolic flux analysis (metabolomics and transcriptomics) and reduced by genetically enhancing biosynthesis routes. In this way, higher product titers (concentrations) with fewer by-products can be achieved (example: <sc>l</sc>-lysine and succinic acid).</p><p id="Par129">The currently most modern approach is termed <italic>synthetic biology</italic>. In this approach, pathways are designed based on formerly gained knowledge (example: propane-1,3-diol, PDO) and the biosynthesis is reconstituted in the most suitable microorganism. Modified biosynthesis genes originating from various donors including plants may be exploited. Existing genome, metabolome, proteome, and transcriptome data can be used in computational modeling for further enhancement. In synthetic biology, these data are used to design nonnatural, novel pathways and circuits in production strains. These strains may than be used for industrial application. Databases such as National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), BRaunschweig ENzyme DAtabase (BRENDA), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and many others are essential for the design of such microorganisms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Basics of Bioprocess Engineering</title><sec><p id="Par130">Bioprocesses are characterized by the utilization of living cells or enzymes as catalysts, which are therefore termed biocatalysts. The production of the biocatalyst is thus the first step in the conversion of a given substrate to a desired product.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2101"><title>Biomass Growth</title><p id="Par131">Bacteria and yeast multiply by binary fission. Bacteria grow by cell enlargement and subsequent fission in two identical bacteria cells. Yeasts grow by budding: they divide into a mother and a smaller daughter cell, leaving a scar on the mother cell. The daughter cell grows to the same size as the mother cell. Fungi are multicellular organisms and grow either by apical growth or ramification, where a new cell is added to an existing one. The rate of growth in the reactor is called the specific growth rate (<italic>μ</italic>). This may vary in a given bioprocess, depending on nutrient availability, substrate inhibition, accumulation of metabolites (acetate, alcohol, lactic acid), and population density. Typically, different growth phases can be distinguished (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">7.11</xref>): Initially microorganisms adapt to the new environment, which is apparent in the so-called lag phase, where the growth rate is zero. This is followed by an acceleration phase with an increased growth rate. A subsequent phase with constant growth rate, the exponential phase, is then observed. Population growth is finally limited by consumption of available nutrients and levels off. In bioreactor cultivations, the rates of growth and product formation are controlled by the setting of process conditions and feeding-in of nutrients.<fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig. 7.11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Formal classification of growth phases</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/450653_1_En_7_Fig11_HTML.gif" id="MO13"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="FPar22"><title>Media Composition and Culture Conditions</title><p id="Par132">In bioprocesses, the medium is the liquid in which the bioreaction is performed. It provides the microorganisms with an energy source and all necessary nutrients. Biomass is composed mainly of the elements carbon [C], oxygen [O], nitrogen [N], hydrogen [H], potassium [K], phosphorus [P], and sulfur [S] and other microelements. In order to produce biomass, all these elements have to be present in the medium in a suitable concentration. Additionally, other growth factors such as vitamins and essential amino acids may be required. If any of these are missing or have been consumed, the cell growth will stop. However, as the cells are still alive, they still consume nutrients for cell maintenance. For most biotechnological processes, the carbon and energy source consists of carbohydrates such as glucose, sucrose, or starch, or carbohydrate residues such as molasses. They may also be provided by triglycerides such as vegetable oils. The nitrogen sources most often used are ammonia or ammonium salts, urea, corn steep liquor, yeast extract, soy flour, fish meal, or protein hydrolysates. Media can be differentiated into complex and defined media. Complex media contain at least one non-defined component, e.g., yeast extract or corn steep liquor. In a defined medium, the chemical composition of the carbon source, inorganic salts, as well as any other additions is precisely specified. A defined medium is used when strict control and reproducibility of the process are essential. Complex media are less expensive and can be used when strict control is not necessary.</p><p id="Par133">Bioreactions have to be performed under physiological conditions, i.e., an environment that suits the microorganisms’ preferences in terms of temperature, pH value, oxygen availability, ion concentrations, and water activity.</p></sec><sec id="FPar23"><title>Bioreactors, Process Kinetics, and Process Control</title><p id="Par134">Bioreactions are performed in a vessel called a bioreactor, which provides a sterile barrier, thus preventing contamination. A bioreactor can be understood as any defined space or apparatus, in which material conversions take place with the participation of biocatalysts. Functions of bioreactors include mixing (homogenization) of content, suspension of solids (microorganisms, pellets), emulsification of two non-intersoluble liquids, dispersal of gases (air or O<sub>2</sub>) in the liquid, and ensuring that constant physical parameters (temperature, pH, pO<sub>2</sub>) are in the optimal range. Therefore, devices for tempering, stirring, aeration, pH control, pO<sub>2</sub> control, foam control, and further addition of medium and acid or base are necessary. In this way, the processes can be controlled and reproduced. There are various types and shapes of bioreactors, including bubble column, fluidized bed reactor, tubular reactor (mainly for algae), and stirred-tank reactor. The last is the type most often used (Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7.12</xref>).<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 7.12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A stirred-tank bioreactor for the controlled growth of microorganisms, with devices for stirring, O<sub>2</sub> and pH control, feeding-in of substrate, base, and antifoam</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/450653_1_En_7_Fig12_HTML.gif" id="MO14"/></fig></p><p id="Par135">Bioprocess kinetics describe the time-dependent courses of cell growth, product concentration, and substrate concentration during a bioprocess.

If investment and production costs are high, productivity is the most relevant parameter. If substrate costs are high, yield per substrate is most relevant.</p><p id="Par136">Reactions can be performed in batch, fed-batch, or continuous mode. The easiest process mode is a batch culture, where the whole reaction is performed in the initial volume without further nutrient addition over time. The growth rate is not constant, as nutrients are consumed. Nutrients in excess may lead to metabolic overflow reactions. Fed-batch processes are started with a low volume and subsequent addition of nutrients. A constant or an exponential growth rate can be achieved and metabolic overflow prevented. Correspondingly, the volume increases over time. A continuous culture enables a steady flow of fresh medium into and of bioculture out of the reactor. The volume remains constant, but the microorganisms grow at the set growth rate. With this kind of bioprocess, a quasi-steady state of biomass and nutrient concentrations can be achieved. Batch and fed-batch cultivations are advantageous where defined charges are required, e.g., in the pharmaceutical industry. Most industrially relevant bioproduction processes are carried out in fed-batch mode.</p></sec><sec id="FPar24"><title>Downstream Processing</title><p id="Par137">Downstream processing deals with the recovery of the desired product. This is often an extensive task, as the fermentation broth consists of 90–99% of water and hence the desired product is very diluted. In general, water has to be eliminated during downstream processing. Normally, further by-products are formed, which may be very similar to the target product. If, for example, an intracellularly produced heterologous protein is to be recovered, it has to be separated from numerous other proteins present in the cell, all consisting of chemically similar amino acid chains. For the recovery of the desired product, a generalized purification scheme can be followed, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">7.13</xref>. The first step is nearly always a solid-liquid separation, where the solid biomass is separated from the surrounding liquid. If the target product is an extracellular compound, the biomass is discarded. If the target is an intracellular product, the supernatant is discarded. In the latter case, the cells are then disintegrated, and the solids are once again separated off and disposed of. In both cases, the remaining liquid is concentrated and then further purified in the next step. The degree of purification depends on the purity demands of the target product. For medical applications in particular, compliance with legislative regulations is cost intensive. In the last step, the product is dried, formulated, and packed, giving the final product, which is ready to be sold (Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">7.13</xref>).<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 7.13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>General downstream processing scheme for a biotechnological product</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/450653_1_En_7_Fig13_HTML.gif" id="MO15"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="FPar25"><title>Possible Products</title><p id="Par138">For the biological conversion of renewable materials, microorganisms are used as catalysts. As a rule, only naturally occurring metabolites and products can be produced so far.</p><p id="Par139">These products are formed by metabolization of a given substrate (mostly glucose from starch hydrolysis) to the desired product. In the process, the substrate passes through different metabolic pathways, which can be classified as primary or secondary metabolism. In the primary metabolic pathways, intermediates and products of low molecular weight are formed, which are then either used for the generation of macromolecules or broken down to supply the cell with energy. Examples of primary metabolic pathways are glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. With the exception of fermentation end products, all primary metabolites are normally only synthesized in the amount required by the cell. Overproduction of these products can be achieved by modification of the metabolic regulation. For some primary metabolites, e.g., citric acid, the appropriate choice of fermentation conditions, such as low pH and excess substrate supply, leads to overproduction. Secondary metabolic pathways generate substances that do not appear to be directly needed for the survival of the organism. Secondary metabolites are often complex in structure and can be biologically active. One example of a secondary metabolism pathway is the mevalonate pathway, which leads to the production of isoprenoids.</p><p id="Par140">Some metabolic pathways require oxygen for the transfer of electrons. In this case, aerobic conditions, i.e., with aeration, need to be provided. Other metabolites are formed in anaerobic conditions, so here no aeration is required.

There are several antibiotics on the market. The best known is penicillin, which inhibits cell membrane formation and thus bacterial growth. Antibiotics have revolutionized the cure of bacterial infections. However, the spread of multi-resistance in pathogenic bacteria poses a global health threat, as the infections caused can no longer be treated with widely used antibiotics.</p><p id="Par144">Penicillin was discovered by chance in 1927 by Sir Alexander Fleming. He noticed a fungal contamination growing on a bacterial culture. A halo with no bacterial growth had formed around the fungal (<italic>Penicillium notatum</italic>) colony. Fleming was able to produce an antibacterial extract with a titer of about 1.8 mg/L and named it penicillin. At first, penicillin was produced as surface cultures, making upscaling quite difficult. Nevertheless, as penicillin became important, especially for the cure of wounded soldiers, these surface cultures were performed industrially with high labor intensity in up to 100,000 milk bottles in parallel. With the development of bioprocess engineering and respective strains, it became possible to produce penicillin in submerged cultures, where the scaling up of the tank is comparatively easy. New and more potent penicillin-producing strains were screened for. With improved strains and bioprocess engineering technology, the penicillin titer was increased by a factor of 40,000 within the following 80 years. Today, about 10,000 different microbial antibiotics are known. However, only a fraction of these is exploited for medical purposes.</p></sec><sec id="FPar27"><title>Organic Acids</title><p id="Par145">Organic acids are basic chemicals and serve as building blocks for polymers or as acidifiers. Most of them are produced chemically (e.g., adipic acid), but citric, lactic, gluconic, itaconic, and succinic acid are almost exclusively produced biotechnologically. The four most important organic acids, each with a global production of more than one million tons per year, are acetic acid, acrylic acid, adipic acid, and citric acid. Of these, only citric acid is produced biotechnologically.</p></sec><sec id="FPar28"><title>Acetic Acid</title><p id="Par146">About 7,000,000 t of acetic acid are produced annually by chemical carbonylation of methanol. The conditions applied (150–200 °C and 3–6 MPa) are relatively mild for a chemical process. This reaction has a total carbon yield (<italic>Y</italic>c) of about 95%, i.e., 95% of the deployed carbon is converted to acetic acid. Biotechnological production by fermentation is modest in comparison: 200,000 t of acetic acid as a component of vinegar. Vinegar is produced by employing bacteria of the genus <italic>Acetobacter</italic> or <italic>Gluconobacter</italic> in an incomplete oxidation of ethanol to acetate. This reaction has to be performed under aerobic conditions, as an oxygen molecule is added to the ethanol. The fermentation takes place at 26–28 °C at normal pressure. Even though the yield (<italic>Y</italic><sub>(P/S)</sub>) is 85–90%, the final concentration is only 100–150 g/L and the total carbon yield (<italic>Y</italic><sub>c</sub>) starting with glucose is about 57%.</p><p id="Par147">Acetic acid is used in the food industry as acidulants, preservatives (E 260), and vinegar. The main fraction of acetic acid is used for the preparation of polymers, such as polyvinyl acetate (PVAC) for paints and varnishes and ethylene vinyl acetate and cellulose acetate for cigarette filters, films, and other plastic products.</p></sec><sec id="FPar29"><title>Succinic Acid</title><p id="Par148">Succinic acid is one of the new substances which may pave the way to a biobased industry. It can be used as a platform chemical to be transformed into further products. These may then serve as building blocks, e.g., in polymers. It can also be used directly as a monomer for alkyd and polyester resins; plasticizers; flexibilizers; paint solvents; food additives (E 363); flavor enhancers; potassium, calcium, and magnesium succinate as a substitute for sodium chloride; and acidifier or acidity regulator. Succinic acid is a metabolite within the citric cycle and is gained under anaerobic conditions. Succinic acid can be produced by <italic>E. coli</italic> (company BioAmber)<italic>, Basfia succiniciproducens</italic> (company Succinity, a joint venture between BASF and Corbion Purac), and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (joint venture between DSM and Roquette)<italic>.</italic> Whereas <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> had to be extensively genetically modified for high-titer succinic acid production, <italic>B. succiniciproducens</italic> secretes it naturally in relatively high quantities. In <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the by-product formation is deleted and the biosynthetic pathway enhanced. Under anaerobic conditions, the citric acid cycle is passed through in the reductive direction and succinic acid is formed and secreted into the medium as end product. Technically, this is realized in a two-phased bioprocess. For <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, biomass is built up in the first phase under aerobic conditions. The second phase is the anaerobic production, where titers of about 100 g/L can be achieved.</p></sec><sec id="FPar30"><title>Biopolymers</title><p id="Par149">Nowadays, most plastics (300 Mt/a) are of petrochemical origin, and thus rely on a nonrenewable resource. The terms “bioplastic” and “biopolymer” incorporate several concepts. One is the biotechnological manufacture of monomers used to produce biobased synthetic materials such as lactic acid, propane-1,3-diol, succinic acid, isoprene, adipic acid, 1,5-diaminopentane, and others. Biobased synthetic materials may or may not be biodegradable. The term “biopolymer” also covers microbial polymers and in general polymers synthesized by living organisms such as polynucleotides (the nucleic acids DNA and RNA), polypeptides (proteins), and polysaccharides (polymeric carbohydrates). Biopolymers utilized as bioplastics are polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) such as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). However, the term “bioplastic” can also refer to a biodegradable plastic of petrochemical or mixed origin. In this chapter, we focus on biobased synthetic materials. From an economic point of view, polylactic acid (PLA) (global production ~370,000 t/a in 2011) and xanthan (global production ~110,000 t/a in 2012) are the most important biopolymers.</p></sec><sec id="FPar31"><title>Bio-Nylon and Diamines, Cadaverine</title><p id="Par150">Nylon (PA66) was the first 100% synthetic fiber to be produced. It is a polyamide that can be spun and is produced by the condensation of two chemically produced monomers: 1,6-hexanediamine and adipic acid. Similar biobased, or at least partly biobased, products can be made by replacing the 1,6-hexane diamine by 1,5-diaminopentane and the adipic acid by either sebacic or succinic acid, to give the products PA 5.10 or PA 5.4. These biobased polyamides can, for example, be used in textiles, carpets, and sportswear. 1,5-Diaminopentane (cadaverine) can be produced biotechnologically. For this, the lysine biosynthetic pathway of <italic>C. glutamicum</italic> was extended by one step, the lysine decarboxylase. This product has been manufactured by BASF at pilot scale and processed together with sebacic acid derived from castor oil.</p></sec><sec id="FPar32"><title>Polylactic Acid</title><p id="Par151">Polylactic acid (PLA) is a thermoplastic material with a rigidity and clarity similar to polystyrene (PS) or polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Its availability and attractive structure make it the front runner in the emerging bioplastics market. Its building block is lactic acid, produced by the fermentation of sugars. PLA is biodegradable and hence can be used for packaging material or single-use items, but also for household items. Lactide is formed by intermolecular dehydration of lactic acid. Polylactide (PLA) is prepared by catalytic ring opening polymerization of lactide. Only the pure enantiomers, generally <sc>l</sc>-lactic acid, can be polymerized. Even though <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> are wild-type strains able to generate lactic acid, they are no longer used for large-scale lactic acid production. This is due to the product inhibition, pH sensitivity, and susceptibility to phages. Today, genetically optimized <italic>S. saccharomyces</italic> strains are used, where an acetate dehydrogenase has been added to the genome. The advantages of this organism are its pH tolerance (&gt;pH 2), no problems with phages, and the simple downstream processing. Disadvantages are lower productivities and that ethanol is formed as by-product.</p></sec><sec id="FPar33"><title>Propane-1,3-Diol (PDO)</title><p id="Par152">Propane-1,3-diol is a clear, colorless, odorless, biodegradable liquid with low toxicity. It is used in the manufacture of polyesters, for example polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) also known as 3GT. From these polyesters, clothing, fibers, automotive parts, carpets, solvents, and coatings are produced. Biotechnological production of PDO was the first industrial application of synthetic biology, as there is no organism known, which produces PDO directly from glucose. But it is known that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> converts glucose to glycerol and that the bacterium <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> transforms glycerol to PDO. The cloning of the appropriate genes of both these microorganisms into <italic>E. coli</italic> gave a recombinant organism able to convert glucose to PDO. This is done in an aerobic process with a final concentration of 135 g/L propane-1,3-diol, a volumetric productivity (<italic>P</italic><sub>v</sub>) of 3.5 g/(L h), and a yield (<italic>Y</italic><sub>P/S</sub>) of 51% (m/m).

Natural rubbers are isoprene rubber (IR), gained from plants like the rubber tree (<italic>Hevea brasiliensis</italic>). Isoprene is a colorless liquid which is insoluble in water and volatile, as its boiling temperature is 34 °C. DuPont is working together with Goodyear on the development of a fermentation-based process for the production of bio-isoprene monomer (2-methyl-1,3 butadiene). The largest application area for bio-isoprene is the production of synthetic rubbers for “green” tires and elastomers. Two metabolic pathways exist, which lead to isoprene as secondary metabolite: the mevalonate (MVA) pathway and the methyl-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway. For the fermentative production, an <italic>E. coli</italic> was chosen as production strain. The MEP pathway is endogenously present in <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the MVA pathway was additionally cloned into it. Later, an adapted isoprene synthetase was added to the genome. With this strain, an isoprene titer of 60 g/L and a volumetric productivity (<italic>P</italic><sub>V</sub>) of 2 g/(L h) were achieved. The yield (<italic>Y</italic><sub>P/S</sub>) was 11% isoprene per glucose. This is quite ineffective, given that the theoretical maximum is 24% for the MVA pathway and 29% for the MEP pathway. Isoprene is gaseous at 37 °C and therefore can be continuously removed from the exhaust gas of the bioreactor.</p></sec><sec id="FPar35"><title>Polyhydroxyalkanoate</title><p id="Par154">Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) are microbial polymers (polyesters) produced by bacterial fermentation of sugars.

Numerous bacteria (&gt;90) including <italic>Cupriavidus necator</italic> form PHAs as a reserve or storage materials. PHAs are therefore fully biologically degradable and have further useful properties such as thermoplasticity, biocompatibility, and nontoxicity. In 1990, the first biodegradable product (Biopl<sup>®</sup>) was launched in Germany. However, the plastic recycling system (“Gelber Sack”) introduced here a year later inhibited the advance of this bioplastic. Today, PHA products are insignificant. Nevertheless, Metabolix has successfully commercialized PHA biopolymers for a range of applications. PHAs are considered a replacement for petrochemical polymers. Their potential applications include packaging material, hygiene products, and medical industry products.</p></sec><sec id="FPar36"><title>Biofuels</title><p id="Par155">Biofuels are renewable fuels derived from biomass through chemical or biochemical reactions. Depending on the feedstock used, three generations of biofuel can be differentiated. “First-generation” biofuels are based on food crops, such as sugarcane and corn, and are thus in direct competition with food. “Second-generation” or “advanced” biofuels are based on nonfood crops and lignocellulose with reduced or no food competition. “Third-generation” biofuels are based on algae, which avoids competition with food and lowers land requirements. The main biofuel used today is ethanol. Other biotechnologically producible biofuels are biobutanol, alkanes, biodiesel, and biogasoline. For biobutanol production, either <italic>Clostridium acetobutylicum</italic> or metabolically engineered <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> can be used.

In addition, all thermochemical conversions have in common that they can produce platform chemicals, materials, or fuels from a wide range of biomass types, and that the oxygen content is lower in the product than in the feedstock. The bioeconomy is not only a concept, but also requires technologies that are attractive enough for companies to put into practice, thus creating the technological base for a large-scale use of biomass.</p><p id="Par161">For the substitution of fossil resources by biomass, new technologies are needed. In this chapter, students learn how biomass is converted by (thermo-)chemical conversion technologies to energy carriers or platform chemicals. One example is the conversion of chicory roots to the platform chemical hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). After further chemical conversion, HMF can be used to produce a wide range of common objects from daily life, including bottles and stockings.

Cellulose, the main component of biomass, contains one oxygen atom per carbon atom. This reduces the heating value of biomass when used as fuel. The high oxygen content is also a disadvantage when biomass is used as chemical compounds to produce, for example, plastics. Figure <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">7.14</xref> represents a small part of cellulose, using Lego<sup>®</sup> bricks to demonstrate its structure. Every red brick (which represents a carbon atom) has an OH group attached to it. In chemistry, this is called a functional group, which, put simply, means “a place to make chemical bonds.” As can be seen, cellulose has a functional group at each carbon atom and is therefore considered “over-functionalized.” For plastics, every basic chemical needs to have two functional groups, one at each end. This enables the formation of long chains, which are the basis of all polymers. In fact, this is what the word polymer means: a long chain of repeating units.<fig id="Fig14"><label>Fig. 7.14</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Charcoal formation from biomass, illustrated using Lego<sup>®</sup> bricks. Red bricks represent carbon atoms, blue oxygen atoms, and yellow hydrogen atoms</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/450653_1_En_7_Fig14_HTML.gif" id="MO17"/></fig></p><p id="Par167">In principle, there are three possibilities to convert biomass into products: (1) biological or biochemical methods applied at low temperatures, (2) chemical conversion at medium temperatures, and (3) thermochemical processes at higher temperatures. This chapter focuses on thermochemical processes, which means chemical conversions that use heat as an important tool for the conversion. Thermochemical conversions are characterized by the desired product and the “agents” added to influence the reaction. The products are solids (char, coke, charcoal), a tarry liquid, and gases. Important agents include oxygen and air. The addition of these leads to a partial combustion of organic material, delivering the heat necessary for the conversion. This is then called an “autothermic process.” Another important agent is water, added as a liquid or in the form of steam. Due to the large range of processes which are performed with or without water, the following sections distinguish between dry, steam-assisted, and hydrothermal biomass conversions. All conversion methods have one thing in common: the oxygen content is reduced, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">7.14</xref> for charcoal formation.</p><p id="Par168">The characterization of fuels by the ratio of hydrogen to carbon and the ratio of oxygen to carbon can be displayed in so-called van Krevelen diagrams. Figure <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">7.15</xref> shows different types of fossil coal and fossil oil, as well as wood as an example of biomass.<fig id="Fig15"><label>Fig. 7.15</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Van-Krevelen diagram of fossil fuels and biomass</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/450653_1_En_7_Fig15_HTML.gif" id="MO18"/></fig></p><p id="Par169">Biomass materials used for thermochemical conversions mainly consist of hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, and ash. Cellulose and lignin have also been added to the van Krevelen diagram (Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">7.15</xref>). Lignin has a chemical composition similar to brown coal. As can be seen, fossil coal has both a lower oxygen and hydrogen content in relation to carbon. A line could be drawn from cellulose to coal in Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">7.15</xref>, corresponding to the elimination of water, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">7.14</xref>. It should be pointed out here that the production of a liquid product similar to fossil oil can only be achieved by the addition of hydrogen, e.g., by coal hydrogenation. A conversion that eliminates oxygen only, instead of water, is not chemically possible. The only possibility of reducing the oxygen content without reducing the hydrogen content is through the elimination of carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide. Here methane or hydrogen is the other end product, not hydrocarbons.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>“Dry” Processes</title><sec><p id="Par170">Dry processes are considered the more “traditional” conversion processes. In dry processes, the water content of the biomass needs to be below 10 wt%, which means the processes can only be applied to biomass with low water content, such as wood, straw, and crops which produce similar biomass, such as miscanthus. Other biomass feedstocks with higher water content have to be dried before being processed. As this requires a lot of energy, it is not usually done in practice.

At the lowest temperatures of around 300 °C, the so-called torrefaction occurs. For this, continuous reactors like rotating tubes are often used. From a chemical point of view, the heating process first dries the biomass, and then leads to the formation of volatilized compounds from hemicellulose to leave a solid, partially charred material. At higher temperatures, cellulose also forms volatiles and starts charring. The condensable gases are combusted outside the torrefaction plant to generate the heat required for the process. Torrefaction is usually regarded as a pretreatment process and is followed by another thermal treatment, e.g., gasification or combustion. The torrefied product has a slightly higher heating value than the original biomass as it has a lower oxygen content [e.g., 19 MJ/kg to 20–22 MJ/kg (Gucho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>)]. This reduces the relative transport costs and, in addition, the structural changes that occur during torrefaction mean that much less energy is required for milling.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par172">Slow pyrolysis is applied to obtain a solid fluid and to reach complete conversion. Here, temperatures of 500–600 °C and longer reaction times lead to a complete charring of the biomass. Again, a rotating tube is often used and the combustible gases are used for heat generation. The classic process to produce charcoal is with kiln. In these, first a high amount of air is entered so that part of the volatiles formed by wood pyrolysis are burned. Once a high temperature has been reached, the air supply is reduced. Charring then occurs. The process takes several weeks. A large amount of tar compounds and particles leave the kiln with the gases, as no gas cleaning takes place. A more advanced version of the process uses a retort. Here, the reaction time is reduced to hours and no oxygen/air is added. The volatiles are combusted outside the retort in a burner and the off-gas is used for heating. There are virtually no emissions of tarry or hazardous compounds (see also “Biokohle—Herstellung, Eigenschaften und Verwendung von Biomassekarbonisaten” in further reading).</p></sec><sec id="FPar39"><title>Pyrolysis</title><p id="Par173">Conversion of biomass with heat and no or low amounts of oxygen to avoid combustion.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par174">Many different types of slow pyrolysis reactors have been developed (Demirbas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>; Kan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>). Charcoal is used for the production of activated carbon, e.g., as a feed additive, in medicine, as a basis for catalysts, and for gas and water cleaning. It also forms the basis of black powder in fireworks and is used for metallurgic purposes, e.g., the production of copper. Today, the production of advanced carbon materials, such as supercapacitors and electrodes for fuel cells and hydrogen storage as well as modern battery parts, is of particular interest (see also “<italic>Advanced Carbon Materials and Technology</italic>” in further reading).</p></sec><sec id="FPar40"><title>Carbonization</title><p id="Par175">Reaction of biomass leading to a higher carbon content. Charring is a special case of carbonization, usually at around 500 °C and “dry.”</p></sec><sec><p id="Par176">In the case of complete conversion of biomass at around 500/600 °C, tar can be regarded as intermediate. The mixture containing hundreds of different compounds reacts further by polymerization processes to form coke and by further splitting to gases. Therefore, if this tar or the so-called pyrolysis oil is the desired product, fast heating up to 500–600 °C, a short reaction time of a few seconds, and quenching for fast cooling down are applied (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">7.3</xref>). This is necessary to avoid the consecutive reactions to coke and gases. The formation of char and gases cannot be avoided completely, but the yields of pyrolysis oil can be maximized by a short and defined reaction time. From the point of heat transfer, fast heating up is only possible by solid-solid contact. There, in all types of reactors applied, biomass is heated up by direct contact with a hot surface, which might be metallic or sand particle. Usually burners, burning the gases coming out of the process, generate the heat necessary. At reaction condition, the pyrolysis oil is a condensate in one, two, or more steps, after separations of the char/coke particles usually by cyclones. If the water content is low, condensation of the pyrolysis oil is possible without phase separation in one step. Pyrolysis oil usually has a water content of 20–30% (g/g) (Bridgwater et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1999</xref>; Oasmaa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2003</xref>). This water is partly a product of the reactions and originates from moisture in the biomass used. This is possible because of a lot of polar compounds like acids, sugars, aldehydes, and ketones are formed. Various types of phenols are also found in pyrolysis oil. If the water content is increased to above ~45%, phase separation occurs with the formation of an aqueous and organic phase. In addition, a lignin-like solid is precipitated. Therefore, in the case of relatively high water content it is useful to use a two-step condensation process. Here, an aqueous phase with high contents of acetic acid and an organic phase is produced (Dahmen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>). Pyrolysis products can be upgraded to car fuels, but this requires large amounts of hydrogen (Wildschut et al<italic>.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2009</xref>). Pyrolysis oil, or one fraction of it, is used as “liquid smoke” in the food industry and to attract wild pigs for hunting.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par177">In the process called bioliq<sup>®</sup> (Dahmen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2012</xref>), the first step of biomass conversion is fast pyrolysis and the second gasification. This addresses one of the principal challenges of biomass conversion process chains: the widespread, decentralized occurrence of biomass by splitting the biomass conversion into two steps, fast pyrolysis and gasification: The goal of the bioliq<sup>®</sup> process is to produce a fuel via syngas. To achieve economies of scale, the gasification and synthesis plant needs to have a high throughput, which means the biomass has to be supplied from a very large area. However, the amount of energy necessary to transport biomass—a material of relatively low heating value (16–19 MJ/kg, dry matter)—over long distances to supply a large gasification plant is very high. In the bioliq<sup>®</sup> concept, the biomass is first pyrolyzed in smaller, fast pyrolysis plants. Then the coke and the pyrolysis oil are mixed to a slurry. This slurry has an energy density ten times higher than that of straw, the biomass used as feedstock. The slurry is then transported to the gasification plant. In this case, a gasification temperature above 1000 °C is used to avoid tar formation.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par178">The products resulting from gasification of biomass, for example in the bioliq<sup>®</sup> process, are very important in the bioeconomy for the substitution of fossil fuels by biomass. Gasification for the production of syngas and the following use of syngas to produce different products are common processes in industry today. Usually, coal or residues from fossil oil processing are gasified. Therefore, the resource can be changed to biomass to which the available processes for converting syngas can be applied without further need for adaptation. The processes are the production of ammonia, methanol production, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to produce diesel fuel, oxosynthesis to produce aldehydes, ketones, and others. Besides air or oxygen, water or carbon dioxide is also added as a so-called gasification agent (Hofbauer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>):<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>7.1</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ1_Math"><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:mn>6</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi><mml:mn>12</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi><mml:mn>6</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">6H</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">↔</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>6CO</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">12H</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

This alters the gas composition by increasing the hydrogen yield, as shown in Eq. (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">7.1</xref>). In addition, the heat transfer is improved. The heat transfer from gases to solids and throughout the solids is a limiting step for the conversion of biomass in slow pyrolysis and torrefaction.

Biomass conversions in liquid water at increased temperatures are called “hydrothermal.” This expression originates from geology where it refers to reactions in liquid water at increased pressure and temperature. Depending on the temperature required, the pressure has to be adapted to avoid evaporation. An overview of hydrothermal processes is given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">7.17</xref>.<fig id="Fig17"><label>Fig. 7.17</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Thermochemical conversion: hydrothermal and supercritical water processes</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/450653_1_En_7_Fig17_HTML.gif" id="MO20"/></fig></p></sec><sec><p id="Par182">In addition to the different conversion processes, Fig. <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">7.17</xref> includes the vapor pressure curve of water, ending in the critical point.

If the critical point is reached, the phase boundary between gaseous and liquid states no longer exists. This is called “supercritical” region.</p></sec><sec id="FPar41"><title>Supercritical Water</title><p id="Par183">Water at a temperature above 374 °C and a pressure above 22 MPa.

In addition, the subcritical processes are all in the liquid region. This is due to the special properties of water, which change with temperature. Subcritical water has a higher ionic product, behaving like a mixture of a weak acid and a weak base. Therefore, reactions, which usually require the addition of acid or base, occur without these additions. In supercritical water—in contrast—the ionic product is very low. This means that, per definition, no Brønsted acids (compounds which produce H<sup>+</sup> ions in water) or bases can exist anymore. On the other hand, the solvent polarity of water decreases with temperature, although water remains as a polar and very reactive molecule. The reason for this is the lower interaction of the water molecules with each other and their faster thermal movement. As a consequence, the solubility of gases and nonpolar compounds increases and the solubility of salts decreases. At around 30 MPa, supercritical water behaves like pentane, with complete miscibility with gases, very good solubility of nonpolar compounds, and very low solubility of salts (Kruse and Dahmen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec><p id="Par186">Hydrothermal and supercritical water processes are of special interest for the use and conversion of “wet biomass.” A living plant has a water content of 80–90%. Many biomass residues from agriculture and the food industry also have such high water contents. This kind of biomass can be converted by digestion. In this case, methane is the desired product, but the conversion is not complete because lignin and some type of fibers cannot be digested. The biomass could be dried if other products than methane are desired and a complete conversion is strived for, but this would cost a lot of energy. In hydrothermal processes, wet biomass is converted without drying and the water in the biomass becomes the reaction medium. Therefore, from a chemical point of view, hydrothermal processes are completely different from dry processes. In hydrothermal processes, the polar water molecules split the polar bonds of the biomass by hydrolysis. In contrast to dry processes, which are mainly solid–gas reactions, hydrothermal conversions usually occur in one phase, with fast degradation of the solid biomass by reaction with water. The fast splitting of biomass in water is the reason for the lower temperatures needed at hydrothermal conversions compared to dry processes. On the other hand, the high pressure is often regarded as a disadvantage of hydrothermal conversions of biomass (Kruse and Dinjus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="FPar42"><title>Hydrothermal</title><p id="Par187">Reaction conditions in liquid water at temperatures usually above 100 °C at increased pressure.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par188">Hydrothermal carbonization occurs at temperatures typically in the range of 180–230 °C. Most of the carbohydrates, possibly even the complete biomass, are hydrolyzed and dissolved. The desired product, called HTC-coal or hydrochar, is formed via polymerization (Titirici et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">b</xref>). This process has been further developed, e.g., to produce supercapacitors to store electricity from renewable resources or in electric cars (Titirici et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="FPar43"><title>Box 7.2 Nutrient Recovery</title><p id="Par189">In high temperature, dry process nutrients like phosphates are part of a glass-like slag. They are not available for plants, directly. In low-temperature dry conversions, nutrients like phosphate leave the reactor with the char. They have to be leached by strong acids or used together with the char. In hydrothermal conversions, the situation is completely different: Hydrothermal carbonization offers the opportunity to recovery around 80% as pure fertilizer. In hydrothermal liquefaction, nutrients stay solved in water, and can be used, e.g., for algae growth (López Barreiro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015a</xref>). In supercritical waster salts, also nutrient precipitates and solids can be removed from the reactor.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par190">Hydrothermal liquefaction occurs at around 300 °C in liquid water, often in the presence of basic catalysts. Here biomass is completely converted to smaller molecules like substituted phenols and different acids or other carbonyl compounds. This process was developed under the trade name “hydrothermal upgrading” by the company Shell (Goudriaan and Peferoen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1990</xref>). There are three differences between hydrothermal liquefaction and fast pyrolysis, also producing a liquid or “tarry” mixture from biomass. First, the process temperature of the hydrothermal method is very low. During flash pyrolysis, temperatures of around 500–600 °C and very short reaction times of a few seconds are applied. The short reaction times are necessary to avoid char/coke formation. Such limitations do not exist for hydrothermal liquefaction; this is the second difference between hydrothermal liquefaction and fast pyrolysis. A wide range of reaction times is applied. In dry flash pyrolysis, large amounts of solid and gaseous products are always formed. The third difference is that hydrothermal liquefaction leads to a low gas yield, mainly carbon dioxide and therefore with no energy content, and very low solid yields. The solids formed are often salts. In the reaction conditions, the tarry compounds are dissolved in water. After cooling down, the tarry liquid phase separates from the aqueous phase. Through this separation, the phenols formed from the biomass are concentrated in the tarry phase. Acid and other polar (i.e., oxygen-containing) compounds stay in the aqueous phase. Phase separation may take some time but leads to a tarry product with a high heating value. This heating value is higher than that of the tarry product of fast pyrolysis. In addition, the water content of hydrothermally produced oil is very low (&lt;0.5% (g/g)) compared to fast pyrolysis oil (20–30%). The reason for this is simply that all polar compounds are in the water, not in the oil. A minor disadvantage of the low water content is the rather high viscosity of hydrothermally produced oil (López Barreiro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2014</xref>; López Barreiro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015a</xref>). It usually flows above 80 °C. To decrease the viscosity and to obtain a more diesel-like fuel, this oil is hydrogenated. The product is called “HTU-Diesel” and in the Netherlands large efforts have been made to establish such a process. Due to the relatively low oxygen content, such a process is energetically and economically more interesting than for pyrolysis oil. Today, hydrothermal liquefaction is often used for the conversion of algae (Valdez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2014</xref>; López Barreiro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">c</xref>).

Wood is not a typical “wet” biomass. The use of relatively dry wood opens up the opportunity to recycle water, because wood has a relatively low water content. In the case of wet biomass, the water coming out of the process has to be “treated,” maybe by digestion.

Here, temperatures of around 400 °C are usually applied because of the lower reactivity of pure lignin than lignocellulose.

Phenols are interesting platform chemicals for resin production.</p></sec><sec><p id="Par196">Another special case of liquefaction is the production of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF, Fig. <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">7.18</xref>) from sugars. HMF is one of or perhaps the most interesting platform chemical for the bioeconomy (Teong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014</xref>), mainly because of the two functional groups enabling the formation of many different consecutive products. These chemicals can replace fossil-based plastics, and potential end products include bottles for drinks and nylon stockings. HMF can be produced in hydrothermal conditions (Antal and Mok <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1990</xref>; Yin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2011</xref>) and is assumed to be an intermediate product of hydrothermal carbonization (Kruse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2013</xref>).<fig id="Fig18"><label>Fig. 7.18</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Hydroxymethylfurfural with its two functional groups: an aldehyde and an alcohol</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/450653_1_En_7_Fig18_HTML.gif" id="MO21"/></fig></p></sec><sec><p id="Par197">Depending on the temperature and main product formed, three different hydrothermal gasification processes can be distinguished:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par198"><italic>Aqueous phase reforming</italic></p><p id="Par199">At relatively low temperatures of around 200 °C and in the presence of a noble metal catalyst, hydrogen is formed from compounds originating from biomass (Davda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2005</xref>; Luo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>). Hydrogen formation as product is thermodynamically possible at this low temperature, but the concentration has to be very low at around 1% (Feng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>; Kruse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>). A hydrogenation catalyst is necessary. This process can only be applied to biomass compounds, not to raw biomass. Therefore, it can be applied to aqueous effluent of other processes. The most important advantage of this process is that the catalyst uses the formed hydrogen to hydrogenate the feedstock. The extent to which this consecutive reaction occurs depends on which noble metal is used as catalyst (Davda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2005</xref>; Huber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>). In a following step, aromatic compounds which can substitute terephthalic acid can be produced that can be used for PET bottles (Kumula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2011</xref>; Serrano-Ruiz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2011</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par200"><italic>Near-critical catalyzed gasification</italic></p><p id="Par201">Near the critical point, methane is the thermodynamically preferred burnable product. Here, the (nearly) complete gasification and the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide to methane occur in the same reactor. In dry processes, this is not possible, because higher temperatures are needed for gasification, too high for methane formation. The formation of methane from hydrogen requires hydrogenation catalysts (Ni, Ru, Rd, PT, Pd) for sufficient yields. Only small amounts of methane can be formed via the decarboxylation of acetic acid, without a catalyst. In principle, two versions of near-critical gasification are conducted: Elliott et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2004</xref>) prefer subcritical conditions. The advantage is that salts are still soluble and the risk of plugging is low. In this concept, the biomass is first liquefied and then gasified in a solid-bed reactor filled with the catalyst. A mobile trailer version has also been constructed and is in use (Elliott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>). F. Vogel and his group prefer supercritical conditions, which have the advantage of good solubility of organic compounds and gases. To handle the salt deposition, a special gravity separator is used (Brandenberger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>; Dreher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2013</xref>). In near-critical catalyzed gasification, the stabilization of the catalyst is a special challenge. In particular, the support of the catalyst has to be stable in the highly aggressive aqueous medium. Pure carbon and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> have been found to be sufficiently stable as catalyst support. Elliott et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2006</xref>) found monoclinic zirconia, rutile titania, and carbon as the best choice for the support.

Before a company takes the decision to construct a production plant and invest in the production and marketing of a certain product, it needs to make sure that the planned process is the most economical and thus the most profitable alternative. In order to make this decision in a sound manner, various tools are used to carry out an economic assessment, weighing up the different costs and revenues against each other. Profitability considerations are also used to develop business plans and assess the state and value of a company. When decisions to invest in chemical conversion plants are taken, a large number of factors have to be taken into account. Hard factors such as profitability and amortization time are important to outline the investment opportunity. However, they are not sufficient to fully characterize the process and thus correctly assess the investment potential. Soft factors also need to be considered in order to weight up further advantages and disadvantages of an investment. These include a number of criteria relating to the technical process, the location of the production plant, and the market situation. Production costs are strongly influenced by the technology applied along with its materials and energy balance. Therefore, process and product cost analysis takes place in early stages and during process engineering. The resulting economic data allow an economic analysis and the creation of a business plan, which help to determine whether a planned project is profitable or not. This chapter provides the fundamental knowledge for this process, together with an example of a cost estimation.</p></sec><sec id="FPar53"><title>Keywords</title><p id="Par218">Costing; Investment costs; Manufacturing costs; Variable and fixed costs</p></sec><sec><p id="Par215"><fig id="Figd" position="anchor"><caption xml:lang="en"><p>© Ricardo Vargas</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/450653_1_En_7_Figd_HTML.jpg" position="anchor" id="MO22"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="FPar46"><title>Learning Objectives</title><p id="Par216">After studying this chapter, you should<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par2170">Understand the principles of cost estimation in manufacturing.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par2180">Be aware of the most important cost-determining factors.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par219">Be able to conduct your own simple estimates of process investment and manufacturing costs.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par220">Be able to understand cost assessments given in the literature.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Cost Assessment</title><p id="Par221">In order to make sound investment decisions, the anticipated manufacturing costs of the product to be commercialized need to be known.

This method, which was developed by Lang in 1940 (Hirschberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1999</xref>), can only be applied once the required main apparatuses have been determined and dimensioned and their prices are known. Instead of listing the individual prices of all other components (i.e., for each valve, tube) their costs are related to the main pieces of equipment based on empirical values; for example the cost of pipes lies between 30 and 100% of the main apparatus costs. These empirical values are included in the calculation of the ISBL costs in the form of so-called Lang factors. These factors, which may be different for different types of plant, are added up and then multiplied by the sum of the costs of the main apparatus to give an estimate of total ISBL costs (Eq. <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="disp-formula">7.4</xref>):<disp-formula id="Equ4"><label>7.4</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ4_Math"><mml:mtext>ISBL</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>LF</mml:mi><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:msub><mml:mi>FOB</mml:mi><mml:mi>k</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ4_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Therefore, they are the most relevant factor in the economic assessment of a production process. Additional costs to be considered for the production and sale of chemical products stem from marketing and selling activities (5–25% of revenues), research (2–5% of revenues, in larger companies), and for generalia such as financial, legal, and patent departments (3–5% of revenues) (Baerns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>). A number of key performance indicators (KPI) are used to calculate the economic performance and profitability of an investment. The earnings (profit) are calculated from the revenues minus all costs within a certain time period. The profit depends on how much product can be sold to the market at the anticipated price. Thus, the earnings are directly related to the workload of a plant and primarily determined by the fixed (also incurred when the plant is not in operation) and variable costs of production.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Cost Estimation Example</title><p id="Par266">Synthesis gas, a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, can be produced from lignocellulosic biomass, for example, in the bioliq<sup>®</sup> process at KIT (Dahmen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>). For this process, biomass is pretreated decentrally (close to the place of production) by fast pyrolysis to produce an energy-dense intermediate, which is collected from a number of these decentral plants to be further processed in industrial scale facilities. There, it is gasified to produce syngas, which, after cleaning, can in turn be used to produce various types of fuels and chemical products. Figure <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">7.20</xref> shows a block flow diagram of the downstream production of gasoline in a hypothetical process. The mass and energy balance of a process is usually available from process simulation using software tools like ASPEN Plus or CHEMCAD. All the main pieces of equipment form blocks of unit operations (cooling, heating, pumping, filtration, distillation, reaction, etc.) characterized by specific operating conditions combined with input and output streams of defined composition and conditions. Here, to reduce the complexity, we only consider the synthesis of the raw product for cost estimation. After an initial heat exchange (HE1), the high-pressure syngas (in the bioliq<sup>®</sup> process, a high-pressure gasifier is utilized) passes through a turbine producing electricity. Then, the CO<sub>2</sub> contained in the syngas (formed by partial oxidation in the previous gasification process) is separated at ambient temperature. In heat exchanger HE2, the temperature is adjusted for the first synthesis reactor. Here, the syngas is converted at 200 °C and 35 MPa into dimethylether (DME) in an exothermic reaction using a mixed catalyst that facilitates methanol synthesis, its dehydration, and the water-gas-shift reaction all at the same time (sum reaction equation: 3CO + 3H<sub>2</sub>⇄CH<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>). After reaction, a heat exchanger (HE3) is utilized to adjust the temperature to the optimum for gasoline synthesis over a zeolite catalyst at around 340 °C (sum reaction equation: CH<sub>3</sub>OCH<sub>3</sub>⇄ − (CH<sub>2</sub>) −  + H<sub>2</sub>O, where –(CH<sub>2</sub>)– stands for a formal hydrocarbon fuel unit in the resulting fuel mixture). The gas is then cooled down by heat exchanger HE4 prior to separation of raw gasoline, water formed during the reaction and non-reacted gas. Half of the remaining gas is recycled to the DME reactor.<fig id="Fig20"><label>Fig. 7.20</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Block flow diagram of gasoline production from synthesis gas</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/450653_1_En_7_Fig20_HTML.gif" id="MO24"/></fig></p><p id="Par267">A process simulation is carried out with some necessary assumptions to give a material and energy balance: the syngas composition is fixed (30 vol.% of H<sub>2</sub> and CO each, 20 vol.% CO<sub>2</sub>, 15 vol.% N<sub>2</sub>, and 5 vol.% H<sub>2</sub>O), and the conversion of syngas to DME is 0.85 and that of DME to gasoline is 1.0. Side products are not considered. 20,000 kg of gasoline is produced per hour. Process simulation is extremely helpful when heat shifts are necessary: the heat of both exothermic reactions is to be used to preheat colder input streams and to produce steam for use in other parts of the plant. Therefore, efficiencies have to be considered: that of heat exchange is assumed to be 0.8 and that of steam generation 0.5.
