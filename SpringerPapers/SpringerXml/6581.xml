For a given surface area, it is the lightest weight electronic conductor of any material and can be produced relatively inexpensively, and in large volume, from natural graphite resource. This leads to its potential use in a multitude of applications for improved energy storage (capacitors, batteries, and fuel cells), energy generation (solar cells), biomedical, sensors or even as an advanced membrane material for separations.</p><p id="Par5">A lot of effort had been devoted for creating high-quality large-area graphene. The earliest method, mechanical exfoliation of graphene from highly oriented pyrolytic graphite using scotch tape, yields good quality but μm-sized graphene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, it is uncontrollable and not scalable. Other formation techniques, such as epitaxial graphene from a single crystalline SiC substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or transition metals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], can yield larger graphene domains. However, they encounter difficulty for large-scale production due to the high cost of the substrates, the requirement of ultrahigh vacuum, and limited scalability. Recently, high-quality monolayer or bilayer graphene was obtained via the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of CH<sub>4</sub> or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> gases on copper or nickel substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Commercial wafer-scale and 30-in. (76.2 cm) graphene films have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Currently, CVD technique is widely employed and has great potential for the large-scale production of high quality films [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]<sup>.</sup> However, since the CVD growth of high quality graphene requires a nearly oxygen-free environment or high-vacuum (10<sup>−6</sup> Torr) base pressure, a long pumping and/or purge time is needed to evacuate the air in the chamber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In addition, some of the gaseous raw materials are hazardous. These disadvantages limit its use in some applications and are a concern for large-scale production. Recently, much simpler, less expensive, and less hazardous techniques for growing graphene have been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. These techniques use solid carbon sources (e.g., polymers, SiC, and amorphous carbon). For a Ni catalyst, carbon atoms diffuse into the Ni film during a high-temperature annealing process. Some of the C atoms segregate from the bulk to the Ni surface due to lower solid solubility at lower temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. A graphene layer forms with a specific and well-controlled cooling rate in a high-vacuum environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. A nearly oxygen-free environment is required in the graphene growth process not only to prevent the precipitated carbon from reacting with oxygen but also to avoid catalyst surface oxidation at high temperature. If graphene can be grown in a non-vacuum environment could open new applications. Many recent works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] have shown that graphene can be grown at the interface of silicon dioxide and metal catalysts and Pt-based catalyst approach is also useful and was discussed in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Moreover, a very important catalyst-free approach was also presented in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Presently, there are several synthesis routes of graphene such as mechanical, chemical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition, pyrolysis, epitaxial methods for obtaining graphene films [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. A scheme depicting various conventional synthesis methods of graphene along with their important features, and their current and prospective applications are discussed in reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Unfortunately, very few commercial technologies involving graphene-based materials have emerged, in large part due to the difficulty in processing these 2D sheets into useful, 3D materials with predicable structure and thus function. To address this challenge, this research aims to develop new sources, tools, and processes to create a platform of graphene-based materials whose structure can be manipulated and fine-tuned at the nanoscale. Among these methods, reduction from graphene oxide is one of the most promising ways and is probably the most widely accepted method in large scale preparation. Considering both the scalability of this method and the purity of the final product, reduction of graphene oxide is better than other techniques. Nevertheless, industrialization with low cost is one of the major challenges in graphene field. With such consideration, the mechanical exfoliation and reduction of graphene oxide are the two possible methods for bulk production of graphene. On the other hand, pyrolysis and other chemical etching and gasification have been common techniques to synthesize graphene on metal surfaces from different carbon sources or other activated carbons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. These also can be achieved by developing processes capable of depositing large-area monolayer graphene films onto a variety of substrates from biomass sources.

The binary phase diagrams of C-Ni and C-Cu are similar in that C has a limited solubility in the metal without the presence of a metal-carbide line compound. The only significant difference is that the solubility of C in Cu is much lower than that in Ni. Since only a small amount of carbon can be dissolved in Cu, the source for graphene formation is mainly from the CH<sub>4</sub> that is catalytically decomposed on the Cu surface with minimal carbon diffusion into the Cu. Once the surface is fully covered with graphene growth terminates because of the absence of a catalyst to decompose CH<sub>4</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]</p><p id="Par20">In contrast, Ni can dissolve more carbon atoms and hence it is difficult to get uniform graphene films due to precipitation of extra C during the cool-down. The C precipitation process is a nonequilibrium process, which should be suppressed if one aims to achieve monolayer graphene growth, for example, by using a controlled thin Ni film and/or high cooling rate. However, because of microstructural defects, predominantly grain boundaries, it is very difficult to fully eliminate the effect of precipitation for metals with high carbon solubility. Hence, metals with low C solubility such as Cu offer a possible path to large-area growth of graphene.

SEM/TEM is conducted in vacuum environment, and AFM is conducted in an ambient or fluid environment. The above techniques are used for topography (the surface features of an object or how it looks, its texture), morphology (the shape and size of the particles making up the object), composition (the elements and compounds that the object is composed of and the relative amount of them), crystallographic information (how the atoms are arranged in the object) of materials.</p><p id="Par100">If the expected value is in the &gt; 100 nm range, standard SEM on sample cross section may be used. In the 30–100 nm range a FESEM (Field Emission SEM) is better. For thinner samples, a TEM cross sectional analysis is needed, that however require a proper sample preparation. Of course, some special care must be taken in all the above measurements. First, the sample must be properly prepared even in the case of SEM analysis. For example. if the interested film is the top most one, need to deposit a dummy thin coating (e.g. a thin Au layer) before cutting the cross-sectional sample. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) has been used as the ultimate method of thickness measurement for thin films. SEM/AFM images are three dimensional and are accurate representations while TEM pictures are two-dimensional and might require little bit of interpretation. In terms of resolution and magnification, TEM gains more advantages compared to SEM. SEM/TEM gives information regarding surface morphology, while AFM gives true surface topography and various types of surface measurements. Compared with SEM, AFM provides extraordinary topographic contrast direct height measurements and un-obscured views of surface features (no coating is necessary).</p><p id="Par101">Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref> shows the various applications of graphene and its derivatives eg. graphene oxide, graphene quantum dots (GQDs).<table-wrap id="Tab7"><label>Table 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Applications for graphene and its derivatives</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Application</p></th><th align="left"><p>Capabilities</p></th><th align="left"><p>Examples</p></th><th align="left"><p>References</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Energy storage and generation devices, membranes, coatings, composites</p></td><td align="left"><p>Graphene could dramatically increase the lifespan of a traditional lithium ion battery, meaning devices can be charged more quickly—and hold more power for longer</p><p>Graphene supercapacitors could provide massive amounts of power while using much less energy than conventional devices.

The use of bio-graphene in production of lightweight car components will lead to the revolution in transport.</p><p id="Par130">The Graphene is expected to have significant impact on various levels through the development of new synthesis techniques, new processes, and an improved understanding of how structure affects materials performance in a range of applications for energy including solar cell, super capacitor as well as sensors for food safety, health, agriculture, biomedical sectors etc. Continued development and successful implementation of the technologies that could lead to new jobs and a potentially huge source of revenue to fuel the future economy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The research funding supports from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and The Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) Project Grants are highly acknowledged.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Geim</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Novoselov</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">The rise of graphene</article-title><source>Nature</source><year>2007</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>183</fpage><lpage>191</lpage></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Novoselov</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name><name><surname>Geim</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Morozov</surname><given-names>SV</given-names></name><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Dubonos</surname><given-names>SV</given-names></name><name><surname>Grigorieva</surname><given-names>IV</given-names></name><name><surname>Firsov</surname><given-names>AA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Electric field effect in atomically thin carbon film</article-title><source>Science</source><year>2004</year><volume>306</volume><issue>5696</issue><fpage>666</fpage><lpage>669</lpage></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>ZM</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>TB</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>XB</given-names></name><name><surname>Ogbasghi</surname><given-names>AY</given-names></name><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Dai</surname><given-names>ZT</given-names></name><name><surname>Marchenkov</surname><given-names>AN</given-names></name><name><surname>Conrad</surname><given-names>EH</given-names></name><name><surname>First</surname><given-names>PN</given-names></name><name><surname>de Heer</surname><given-names>WA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Ultrathin epitaxial graphite: 2D electron gas properties and a route toward graphene-based nanoelectronics</article-title><source>J.
