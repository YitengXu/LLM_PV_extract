Neutron reflectometry and grazing incidence x-ray absorption spectroscopy were utilised to distinguish between the surface and bulk signals, with a surface sensitivity of 3 nm. Here we show, contrary to what is typically assumed, that the A cations are active sites that undergo oxidation at the surface as a consequence of the water splitting process. Whereas, the B cations undergo local disordering with the valence state remaining unchanged. This surface modification reduces the overall water splitting efficiency, but is suppressed when the oxynitride thin films are decorated with a co-catalyst. With this example we present the possibilities of surface sensitive studies using techniques capable of operando measurements in water, opening up new opportunities for applications to other materials and for surface sensitive, operando studies of the water splitting process.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">While solar-driven water splitting may afford a renewable means to harvest energy, it is essential to understand how photocatalysts transform during catalysis.

For this process, in semiconductor photocatalytic materials, electron/hole pairs are created upon absorption of sunlight. The photogenerated charges reach the solid−liquid interface at the surface of the semiconductor and are used for the water reduction and oxidation reactions.</p><p id="Par4">Photochemical splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen using titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) irradiated under ultraviolet (UV) light was first observed by Honda and Fujishima in 1972<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In the past several decades since the now termed Honda−Fujishima effect was first demonstrated, extensive research in this field has been targeted at trying to find suitable and efficient water-splitting photocatalysts on which the development of cost-effective and state-of-the-art technology could be based<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. However, if the hydrogen evolution reaction does not represent a key limiting factor, the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) remains a major hurdle in the search of suitable materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, owing to the fact that the OER is a complex reaction severely hampered by sluggish kinetics and significant overpotential losses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Meaningful progress has been made for oxide-based photocatalysts in furthering the insight into the reaction mechanisms, whilst also improving the performance and efficiencies of the photocatalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, these oxide-based materials are all wide band gap materials, sensitive only to the near-UV region of the solar spectrum, which consists of just a small percentage of its entirety, compared to the visible region which contributes to almost half<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Therefore, an alternative approach has been adopted related to the search of novel semiconductor photocatalysts with narrower band gap energies, which lie in the visible-light range, yet still possess band gap widths greater than the theoretical 1.23 eV required for the water-splitting process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">One promising class of alternative materials for visible-light-driven water splitting are perovskite oxynitrides, whose general formula can be written as ABO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>N<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> (where A = La, Ba, Sr, Ca; B = Ti, Ta, Nb; <italic>x</italic> + <italic>y</italic> = 3). The substitution of N into the O sites affects the position in energy of both band edges leading to a band gap width in the visible energy range (between 1.8 and 2.5 eV) with band edges comprising both, the hydrogen and oxygen evolution potentials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. There have been various studies to date regarding oxynitrides and they have shown to be effective photocatalysts for visible-light-driven water splitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, there seems to be a common problem for oxynitrides in that degradation of the initial performance of these materials is generally observed. It is not uncommon to observe a 30−50% decrease in the initial performance during operating conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. To date, the vast volume of literature with respect to oxynitrides has predominantly comprised of the synthesis of oxynitride powders, improving synthetic routes and applying surface modifications to increase their photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance under varying experimental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

We show that the combination of NR and GIXAS provides invaluable experimental approaches for surface-sensitive measurements (3 nm resolution) of the structural, electronic and compositional properties of materials.

The MgO substrate (200) reflex has been marked in green. The compositions of the thin films used in this work were determined by the RBS/ERDA measurements (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The compositions of the LTON films consist of La:Ti and O:N ratios of 1.04−1.06 and 10.3−10.7 respectively. The experimental uncertainties on the compositions measured by RBS for La and Ti and ERDA for O and N are ±2% and ±3% respectively. We assume that the chemical composition of the films, while affecting the light absorption and charge migration properties, has little influence on the evolution of the physicochemical state of the surface layer.</p><p id="Par10">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> shows the transmission electron microscope (TEM) cross-sectional image of the epitaxially grown film, with the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern inset in the top left corner. The TEM image indicates a well-defined surface and interfaces between the layers. The SAED pattern also confirms the epitaxial growth of LTON and TiN on the MgO substrate. The protection layer seen in the cross-sectional image was applied on the sample solely for the TEM measurement. The high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image with atomic resolution is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>. The O:N ratio for the LTON films was determined using electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDX) and are in agreement with the RBS/ERDA analysis. Although the O:N ratio is low, this is usual for epitaxially grown LTON films where there is a trade-off between crystalline quality and total nitrogen substitution/content. Films grown using larger laser fluence tend to grow polycrystalline films with much higher nitrogen contents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Experimental strategy</title><p id="Par11">To study the physicochemical evolution of the surface of the semiconductor, the use of oxynitride thin films as model systems provides a clear advantage over the corresponding powders in the fact that they offer relatively wide, atomically flat, and well-defined surface where one can more easily distinguish between the surface and the bulk of the material. With respect to powders, decreasing the nanoparticle radius size does increase the surface area-to-bulk ratio; however, any measurements would still represent an average of the contributions from the surface and the bulk. Literature pertaining to oxynitride thin films for water splitting remains fairly limited to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">Some of the most prevailing surface-sensitive techniques currently available are not without their limitations. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) for example involves the surface bombardment with a primary ion beam in an ultra-high vacuum. Therefore, the technique is locally destructive due to sputtering effects that can lead to modified surface chemistry and ion implantations. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is another key technique for surface characterisations, though like SIMS it requires a high vacuum environment. These environments do not simulate natural operating conditions and can alter the sample itself, whilst also ruling out future in situ and operando measurements performed in water. Recent advances in Near Ambient Pressure XPS (NAP-XPS) have been made using dip and pull methods in water and offer promising opportunities for in situ measurements; however, one must consider changes in pH values, drying and salt formation. XRD is limited to long-range order and X-ray reflectivity (XRR) is not sensitive enough to distinguish between elements next to one another in the periodic table. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and more specifically tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is another good possibility; however, the Raman effect is also very weak, and can require a long measurement time not suitable for operando measurements. The sensitive nano tips used can be prone to unwanted chemisorption and degradation during operation conditions.</p><p id="Par13">Taking into consideration the type of information that can be obtained from the current existing techniques, their limitations and practicalities, we chose for this study to employ the complementary surface-sensitive techniques, NR and GIXAS, to probe the surface modifications of epitaxially grown LTON films (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

Neutron reflectometry is a non-destructive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> technique similar to XRR for measuring the depth profile of the density of thin films. The difference between using neutrons over X-rays is that the neutrons scatter from the atomic nuclei rather than from electrons. The neutron scattering power can vary greatly between neighbouring elements and isotopes of the same element; therefore, NR, unlike XRR, is sensitive to neighbouring light elements (H, C, O, N) and isotopic substitution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and can provide depth profiles with sub-Ångstrom resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Experimental overview.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Instrument description for AMOR time-of-flight neutron reflectometer at SINQ/PSI. <bold>b</bold> Neutron reflectometry measurement for multilayer thin films. <bold>c</bold>, <bold>d</bold> Surface-sensitive GIXAS measurement, side view and top down respectively. <bold>e</bold> Penetration depth of X-rays for LTON at the Ti K edge energy range as a function of incident angle, the error bars correspond to the penetration depth at a given incident angle with an error of ±0.1 degrees.

To perform surface-sensitive measurements, grazing incident X-ray absorption spectroscopy (GIXAS) was performed on the LTON thin films, while powder reference samples were measured by XAS in transmission mode. Measurements were performed at grazing incident angles varying between 0 and 1° at intervals of 0.1° (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c–e</xref>).

In these semiconductor photocatalysts, electrons are excited from the valance band to the conduction band forming electron−hole pairs (e<sup>−</sup>−h<sup>+</sup>) under light irradiation (photons) with energy greater than or equal to that of the band gap (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The photogenerated electrons are collected by the TiN seed layer and transferred to the Pt counter electrode where the excited electrons can directly reduce protons to form H<sub>2</sub>. As for the photogenerated holes, they are consumed in the OER where they oxidise water to generate O<sub>2</sub> at the surface of the photocatalyst. Co-catalysts can also be used in conjunction with the photocatalysts (not shown), which provide alternative active sites for the evolution of hydrogen and oxygen by acting as electron and hole scavengers for the photogenerated charges, respectively. Thus, co-catalysts can increase performance by reducing electron/hole charge carrier recombination which is a detrimental effect that suppresses the photocurrent.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Photoelectrochemical water splitting.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Energy diagram for the LTON semiconductor photocatalyst. <bold>b</bold> Photoelectrochemical three-electrode cell. <bold>c</bold> Three consecutive potentiodynamic scans for LTON without catalyst. <bold>d</bold> Stabilised photocurrent for the bare LTON film and IrO<sub>2</sub> decorated LTON film shown in red and blue respectively. <bold>e</bold> The degradation from the initial photocurrent with successive potentiodynamic linear sweeps comparing the bare and IrO<sub>2</sub> decorated LTON films values taken at 1.5 V vs. RHE.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2020_15519_Fig3_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par17">The PEC characterisations of LTON were performed with a standard three-electrode configuration in 0.5 mol.

It was exposed to the same electrolyte for the same time period and irradiated with the same light intensity. However, no external bias was applied to the film and no measureable photocurrent was observed, the reason for doing so was to try establishing which stimulus is the driving force for the observed surface degradation. The resulting reflectivity plots for the before and after comparisons of the two sets of films are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a–b</xref>.

From the fit, a 1D SLD profile is inferred and is portrayed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>. Comparing before and after PEC the TiN layer remains unchanged, contrast differences in the SLD profile at each TiN interface arise due to the slight diffusion of oxygen to the TiN layer from the substrate and from the LTON film during growth which has also been evidenced previously by TEM and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Comparing before and after PEC for the LTON film, a minor difference is apparent at the TiN/LTON interface inferred by an almost negligible O:N ratio change but the largest changes in SLD profile occur at and just below the surface, as seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref> and the inset. The model suggests slight nitrogen content loss in the film below the surface layers, but at the surface within the first 3 nm there is a greater degree of nitrogen loss and a slight increase in the oxygen content which would generate a small degree of vacancy formation in the film after PEC measurements. However, the quantitative analysis of the stoichiometric changes resulting in the scattering length density profile changes involve some degree of uncertainty and require additional complementary techniques to reference.</p><p id="Par21">Qualitatively, the differences in the scattering length density profile confirm that a physiochemical change in the film has taken place, most significantly at and near the surface where the model suggests slight stoichiometric changes. Since no difference was observed in the film where no external bias was applied, we could conclude that the density changes observed for the oxynitride are of a direct consequence of the applied external bias and the water-splitting process. The electrolyte and incident light alone has minimal/negligible effect on the LTON sample.

There are, however, significant differences in the intensities of the peaks for the three samples, which are attributed to the different and perhaps non-uniform particle sizes. Different size particles possess different surface areas and as a result can exhibit partial oxidation reflected in the changes of the peak intensities.

As expected the Ti valence states in the perovskite powder samples and the LTON film are a mixture of 3<sup>+</sup> and 4<sup>+</sup>. This can be seen by edge positions and peak intensities that are situated in-between those of Ti<sup>3+</sup> in titanium nitride and Ti<sup>4+</sup> in anatase. The comparison between the bare and co-catalyst-loaded LTON films measured in the bulk before and after PEC characterisation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>) conveys that the water-splitting process has no effect on the valence state of the titanium cations in the bulk of the samples. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref> shows the comparison of the LTON films measured at the surface with and without the co-catalyst before and after PEC measurements.

After PEC measurements, the intensity of this peak increases. Since it has been previously assigned to defects in TiO<sub>2</sub>, it therefore suggests that after the water-splitting process the local geometry surrounding the surface and near-surface Ti cations become a little more disordered. Increasing disorder lowers the octahedral D<sub>2h</sub> symmetry even further, introducing more dipolar character to the A2 peak by p-d orbital mixing.

It has been previously shown by ab initio FDM calculations for TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> that oxygen vacancies can lead to strong enhancements in the A2 peak region due to the lowering of symmetry and a spectral shift of the A1 peak for pentacoordinated Ti atoms with oxygen vacancies.

According to the calculations, the introduction of axial and equatorial oxygen vacancies leads to large peak intensities for TiO<sub>2</sub> situated at ca. 2.5−3 eV higher in energy than B1. For LTON the difference between B1 and B2 is also separated by a similar energy difference (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Since this contribution is suggested to be due to oxygen vacancies, the increase in the intensity of this peak after PEC measurements seems to suggest that the OER creates oxygen and/or nitrogen vacancies driven by the loss of nitrogen at the surface of the oxynitride films.

The antibonding B<sub>1u</sub> molecular orbital is comprised of the Ti 4P<sub>z</sub> orbitals and N/O 2P<sub>z</sub> orbitals. The large increase for this transition may be explained by the loss of N/O and the creation of vacancies at the apical position of the Ti octahedra where the surface terminates and adsorption of intermediates during the OER takes place.</p><p id="Par39">The contributions of these peaks seem large due to the fitting of the difference spectra, the overall disorder of the Ti environment as a consequence of the water-splitting process are quite subtle when looking at the XANES data. However, we would like to highlight the fact that the edge position does not change, yet XAS is a suitable technique to detect this short-range structural information not seen by XRD or XPS. The change in stoichiometry and the increase in disorder of the environment surrounding Ti would induce changes in the degree of local strain of the films. These physiochemical changes can account for the reduced OER activity by increasing the binding energies of the *O, *OH and *OOH intermediates and increasing the OER overpotentials.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par40">We have applied complementary NR and surface-sensitive grazing incidence absorption spectroscopy techniques to probe the detrimental surface modifications associated with oxynitrides that occur during operation.

The addition of the IrO<sub>2</sub> co-catalyst not only increases the performances of the oxynitride sample by a factor of two but also protects the surface by preventing the observed surface modification as a direct consequence of the water-splitting process. The surface modification involves the oxidation of the La A cations and a disordering of the local environment surrounding the Ti B cations which are thought to be detrimental and the reason for the reduced performance observed in the oxynitrides, whereas La undergoes a reduction in the bulk and Ti remains unaffected as a consequence of the water-splitting process. These findings were unexpected due to the fact that we have evidence that the A site plays a significant role in the OER and La does not exist solely in the nominal +3 valence state.

The opening time of the nozzle valve was set at 400 μs and the delay between the valve closing and the laser pulse was set at 30 μs.</p><p id="Par43">The titanium nitride current collector layer was grown by conventional PLD using a commercially available TiN target under vacuum with a base pressure of ca. 5 × 10<sup>−6</sup> mbar. The substrate temperature was set at 750 °C. A laser fluence of about 3 J/cm<sup>2</sup> with a laser repetition rate of 10 Hz was applied.</p><p id="Par44">In this work we used three independent sets of samples that were characterised in three dedicated measurement campaigns at the synchrotron light source and two at the neutron source. The best data were acquired with the third set of samples after optimisation of the experimental set-ups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Photoelectrochemical characterisation</title><p id="Par45">Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed using a three-electrode configuration. The working and counter electrode were the LTON thin films and Pt wire respectively. A KCl saturated Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference. An aqueous solution of 0.5 mol. NaOH (pH = 13) was used as an electrolyte. For the electrical contact of the LTON films, on one side of the films, a small section of LTON was carefully removed to expose the TiN current collector to apply the electrical contact to the potentiostat (Solatron 1286). The electrically connected area was then insulated with epoxy and the sample then immersed into the electrolyte. The samples were illuminated with a 150 W Xe arc lamp (Newport 66477) with an AM 1.5 G filter with an output intensity of 100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>. To measure the dark and light current, a chopper was used to intermittently block the irradiation of the sample. The potentiodynamic and potentiostatic measurements were performed at a scan rate of 10 mv/s. IrO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles were deposited by immersion in an IrO<sub>2</sub> colloidal solution for 30 min. The IrO<sub>2</sub> solution was prepared by hydrolysis of Na<sub>2</sub>IrCl6·6H<sub>2</sub>O (0.010 g) dissolved in H<sub>2</sub>O (50 mL), and the pH was adjusted to 11−12 with NaOH (1 M). The solution was heated at 80 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature by immersion in an ice water bath. The pH of the cooled solution was adjusted to 10 with HNO<sub>3</sub>. Subsequent heating at 80 °C for 30 min resulted in a blue solution containing colloidal IrO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Chemical composition</title><p id="Par46">Metal ratios, oxygen content and film thickness were determined by Rutherford backscattering (RBS). Measurements were performed using a 2 MeV He beam and a silicon PIN diode detector. Data were analysed using RUMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.

There the neuron beam is focused to the sample by elliptic reflectors leading to a divergence of 1.6°. The angular resolution is realised via the position sensitive detector. The intensity of the reflected neutron beam from the sample is measured as a function of the scattering angle and the time-of-flight from the chopper to the detector. The wavelength resolution was 5% and measurements were performed over a Q-range (1/Å) ranging between 0.005 and 0.1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>X-ray absorption spectroscopy</title><p id="Par50">XAS measurements were performed at the SuperXAS beamline at the SLS, Paul Scherrer Institut in Switzerland. The energy resolution was optimised using (111)-Si monochromator crystals. Energy calibration was performed using a thin Ti reference foil. A focused beam was used with a spot size of 100 × 100 μm<sup>2</sup>. The samples were mounted in grazing incidence to the incoming X-ray beam, with an incident angle between 0° and 1°. XAS spectra were obtained in fluorescence yield using a five-element SDD detector situated at 90° to detect fluorescence.
