id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Magnetic field structures in the cosmos occur on many scales, spanning a range of over 15 decades in spatial dimension, from extragalactic winds and jets down to the terrestrial magnetosphere. Yet in all these objects the properties of magnetic fields lead to a very similar, multi-scale, spatial and temporal structure. Magnetic fields originate in electric currents, as described by Maxwell’s equations. They have energy, pressure, and tension, as quantified by their energy-momentum (stress) tensor. They exert a force on ionized matter, as expressed by the Lorentz force. Finally, their equivalent mass is small when compared to the mass-energy of ambient matter.</p><p id="Par3">These basic properties lead to a common appearance in a variety of objects which can be understood as follows. Since there are no magnetic charges, magnetic fields are not neutralized and they extend over large stretches of space and time. The Lorentz force which keeps ionized matter and magnetic fields together allows gravitation to anchor a magnetic field in a condensed ionized object. Since there gas and dynamic pressures dominate over the magnetic pressure, magnetic fields tend to be amplified by differential motions such as occurs in a stellar convection zone, a differentially rotating accretion disk, binary motion, or a stellar wind around a planet. Expressed in circuit language, a voltage source is set up by fluid motions which drives a current and forms a dynamo in which magnetic field is amplified at the expense of kinetic energy. Next, the small equivalent mass of the magnetic fields makes them buoyant, and as ionized matter slides easily along magnetic fields, they pop up out of the dense dynamo into their dilute environs. Whereas this central domain is dominated by fluid pressure the environs are dilute so that there the magnetic pressure dominates. The tension of the magnetic field then allows for transport of angular momentum from the central body along the field outward into a magnetized atmosphere such as a corona or magnetosphere. As more and more magnetic flux rises into the corona, and/or differential motions at the foot-points of magnetic structures continue to send electric currents and associated Poynting flux into the corona the geometries of these nearly force-free structures adapt, expand and generally lead to the appearance of thin sheets of concentrated electric currents. The same process occurs in the terrestrial magnetosphere but now the Poynting flux is going inward toward the central body. Finally, the magnetic structure in the envelope becomes unstable and the deposited energy is released in a process equivalent to an electromotor or Joule heating but now in a multitude of small ‘non-force-free’ regions created by the currents themselves, often together in explosions, such as storms, (nano-)flares, ejected plasmoids, jets, but also in a more steady fashion, such as super-fast winds.</p><p id="Par8">The description of the formation and dynamics of complicated magnetic structures in terms of simplified electric current circuits in a variety of objects elucidates the fundamental physics by demanding consistency, and distinguishing cause and effect. Also, it allows for a unified answer to a number of pertinent questions: <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par4"><italic>Current Distribution</italic>: what is the voltage source, how does the current close, which domains can be considered frozen-in, where (and when) is the effective resistivity located?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par5"><italic>Angular Momentum Transport</italic>: where are the balancing (decelerating and accelerating) torques?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par6"><italic>Energy Transport</italic>: what is the relative importance of Poynting flux versus kinetic energy flux?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par7"><italic>Energy Conversion</italic>: what is the nature of the effective resistivity (Lorentz force, reconnection, shocks), and what is the energy partitioning, i.e. the relative importance of gas heating, particle acceleration, bulk flow, and MHD waves?</p></list-item></list> For this review we have chosen to zoom in on the magnetosphere of the <italic>radio pulsar</italic>, on the <italic>solar flare</italic>, and on <italic>terrestrial aurorae and magnetic storms</italic>. We will point out parallels and similarities in the dynamics of the multi-scale magnetic structures by considering the relevant electric circuits.

As a result, when the charge density is equal to the local GJ density everywhere, the parallel electric field vanishes. This is the situation on the ‘closed’ field lines which are located near the star. <fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><italic>Left</italic>: The Goldreich-Julian picture of the pulsar magnetosphere for an aligned magnetic rotator (Goldreich and Julian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1969</xref>).

Things are complicated here because a strictly steady state pair creation is not possible. It is clear that the <italic>parallel</italic> electric field momentarily vanishes as soon as the charge density reaches the value <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>GJ</italic></sub>. However, to produce this GJ-density one needs a very strong parallel electric field to exist. Actually, the strong time-variations within a single radio pulse are believed to mirror the temporal process of pair creation. For our purpose we assume a steady-state relativistic wind to exist in the average sense. This is the reason for the appearance of the GJ density in (<xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="disp-formula">4</xref>). The current (and the much denser wind) only exist on the so-called ‘open’ field lines, the field lines which connect to infinity (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Left). For a steady current the incoming current (poleward for the aligned rotator of Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Left) must be balanced by the outgoing current (equator-ward). This defines a critical field line in the wind (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Left) separating the two parts of the current. Note, however, that in contrast to Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Left the incoming current may consist of outgoing electrons while the outgoing current may be composed of outgoing positrons. This current brakes the rotation of the star through the torque created by the Lorentz force density <bold>j</bold>×<bold>B</bold>/<italic>c</italic> in the stellar atmosphere. Stellar angular momentum is then transported by the electric current (which twists the magnetic field) in the wind, and dumped somewhere far out in the wind. Where, is the big question.</p><p id="Par13">The main problem with the pulsar wind is that apparently the value of <italic>σ</italic> in (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>) changes from <italic>σ</italic>≫1 near the star to <italic>σ</italic>≪1 somewhere in the wind.

To solve this problem one needs to know where and how the electric current closes in the wind so as to dump the Poynting flux in the form of kinetic energy of the wind.</p><p id="Par14">Our approach to the pulsar wind problem starts with the 1D, non-relativistic, stellar wind description in terms of an electric circuit in Sect. <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">2.1</xref>.

Our starting point is the 1D MHD description of a magnetized stellar wind by Weber and Davis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">1967</xref>). Their aim is to find a steady-state smooth wind. They assume the validity of ideal (i.e. non-resistive) MHD and consider an axially symmetric magnetic structure of a special kind—a so-called split magnetic monopole—which is obtained by reversing the magnetic field of a magnetic monopole in one half-sphere. This structure rotates around the axis of symmetry (<italic>aligned</italic> rotator), and it is assumed that the poloidal structure is not changed when rotation sets in. Finally, they consider the outflow just above the equatorial plane. They define an <italic>Alfvén</italic> radius <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub> in the equatorial plane where the ram pressure of the radial flow part equals the radial magnetic tension. More generally, the Alfvén radius is determined by the <italic>poloidal</italic> components (Mestel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">1999</xref>, Chap. 7): <disp-formula id="Equ6"><label>6</label><alternatives><tex-math id="Equ6_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Their main finding then is that the total torque of a magnetized wind is equal to producing effective co-rotation of the wind out to the Alfvén radius. Nice and simple though this result is, it is also deceptive in that the current does not close at the Alfvén surface. Actually, most of the current goes off to infinity. The authors find that the distribution of angular momentum over electromagnetic and kinetic parts with distance follows Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Left which shows that only a part of the Poynting torque is converted into a kinetic torque, and that asymptotically at large distance the Poynting contribution becomes constant and dominates.

Of course, a radio pulsar only exists if the magnetic rotator is <italic>oblique</italic>, or at least if deviations from axial symmetry exist. However, there are separate important electromagnetic effects which come in already for an aligned relativistic wind apart from the effects of obliquity, and we will try to disentangle these. Two basic consequences from Maxwell’s theory require our attention: <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par21">In vacuo, an axially symmetric magnetic rotator is—in a steady state—surrounded by an axially symmetric magnetic field. Since the stellar environs are assumed to be a vacuum no electric current flows. Any external electric fields are axially symmetric and therefore time-independent. Therefore, there is no displacement current. The absence of both material and displacement electric currents imply that the surrounding magnetic field is purely poloidal. Since the magnetic field is time-independent any electric field has to be poloidal as well. A <italic>circulating</italic> Poynting flux does exist in the toroidal direction but there is <italic>no outgoing</italic> Poynting flux. A fortiori then, there are no radiative electromagnetic losses.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par22">In the presence of an ionized wind, the situation is different. Now, poloidal electric currents do exist, both as a result of the unipolar induction by the rotating magnet, and because of the drag on the wind from the rotating field. As a result, the external magnetic field has a toroidal component. Also, because of the ideal MHD condition (<xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>), an electric field appears in the lab frame which has a poloidal component. These electric and magnetic field components imply an outgoing Poynting flux (as in a common stellar wind). The magnetic field and the gas motion are, however, again time-independent, and as a result the electric field is time-independent as well. Therefore, there is no displacement current, and again no radiative losses (such as will be the case for an oblique rotator).</p></list-item></list> Thus, by confining ourselves to the aligned rotator first, we postpone the discussion about the importance of displacement electric fields, and isolate the Poynting flux which appears in the ideal MHD approximation. Such a pulsar wind is the (relativistic) extension of the above magnetized stellar wind. The electric circuit is expected to close along the path of least resistance, which means across the magnetic field inside the star and along the magnetic field in the wind. However, an important difference with an ordinary star appears. The neutron star may not be able to provide sufficient gas to short out the electric field component in the wind along the magnetic field. This happens, when the local charge density is not everywhere equal to the GJ charge density (<xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="disp-formula">4</xref>).

Secondly, as can be seen in Fung et al.

Such a shortage of charges leads to strong electric fields parallel to the ambient magnetic fields which try to maintain the current. The effect of the parallel electric fields can be described as <italic>Generalized Magnetic Reconnection</italic>, a term introduced by Schindler et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">1988</xref>) and Hesse and Schindler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1988</xref>). In this region ideal MHD must break down and particles are accelerated (heated) along the magnetic field. At the same time, the parallel electric field causes the external magnetic field pattern to slip over the inner fast rotating pattern at a much smaller rate. This implies a much smaller external toroidal magnetic field, and this implies a much smaller current. In other words, the current closes across the field, and the associated Lorentz force accelerates the wind in both radial and toroidal directions. As a net result the current dissipates in this layer and causes both heating and bulk acceleration of the wind. A sketch of such a dissipative shell is given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. This current closure due to current starvation is a natural candidate for the main conversion of the Poynting flux in the MHD wind of a pulsar into kinetic energy (Kuijpers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2001</xref>). Finally, note that this current starvation occurs throughout the wind and already for the aligned pulsar, which is different from the current starvation in Melatos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">1997</xref>) who considers the singular current layer which he postulates to occur at the site of the displacement current, and which exists for an oblique rotator only. <fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Sketch of the magnetic field lines (<italic>black arrows</italic>) and of the electric current lines (<italic>open arrows</italic>) far out in the wind where current starvation occurs. Here strong electric fields are generated parallel to the ambient magnetic fields, the electric current closes and dissipates, thereby converting most of the Poynting angular momentum into kinetic, and the wind is strongly heated and accelerated. As a result, the toroidal magnetic field component drops sharply. Outside the dissipative layer the field pattern rotates much slower and slips over the inside field structure.

Further, in an oblique rotator also new effects appear because of the change of magnetic geometry. In particular the time-dependence causes the appearance of a displacement current which is absent in the aligned case. The overall magnetic geometry is sketched in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>. Although axial symmetry is lost on a small scale, still the rotation together with magnetic (hoop) stresses are expected to lead to some global axial symmetry in two polar jets each of one (opposite) polarity only. In between, there is an equatorial wind consisting of alternating ‘stripes’ of magnetic field combining both polarities (Coroniti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1990</xref>). All three domains contain electric currents. However, whereas the magnetic field inside a jet varies smoothly, the magnetic field in the equatorial wind has an alternating ‘striped’ spiral structure, and is therefore strongly time-dependent. As a result, a new phenomenon appears in the equatorial wind, the displacement current which usually is absent in a non-relativistic MHD approximation. <fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Sketch of a relativistic oblique magnetic rotator.

However, when these current sheets become ingredients of dissipation it is relevant to ask how they have developed out of space-filling ‘body’ currents, as for example one is used to do in the solar corona flare context. Below, we will discuss the nature of two main classes of current sheets invoked in pulsar studies: singular return currents at the boundary between open and closed field lines, and current sheets between the stripes in the striped wind model.</p></sec><sec id="FPar11"><title>Current Sheets on the Boundary Between Open and Closed Field?</title><p id="Par44">Models of the magnetosphere of a magnetic rotator show distributed currents along the open magnetic field lines above the pulsar polar caps but often return currents in the form of sheets, such as indicated by arrows in Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>, Left. The current sheet then is along the last open magnetic field line, separating zones of open and closed magnetic field lines. However, as we see it, this is just a simplification. By its very origin the return current is not a singular layer but a body current, just as the polar cap current. Actually, this was discussed already in the early seminal paper by Goldreich and Julian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1969</xref>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>, Right). Also, numerical studies find that the electric (polarization) currents to and from the pulsar in the polar cap region are quite broad as can be seen in the representative example of Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>, Right, which is computed for an oblique 60<sup>∘</sup> dipole and under the force-free assumption. Another recent numerical study (Timokhin and Arons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2013</xref>) shows a distributed return current with dimensions comparable to the polar cap width (Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>, Left). In particular, the perpendicular rotator presents an interesting example where the symmetry causes currents and return currents to have the same finite width as can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>, Right. Note that there is a puzzling difference between the two papers in the directions of the currents for the perpendicular rotator: in Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>, Left, the currents in the polar cap above the equator have the same directions as those below the equator, while in Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>, Right, the currents are opposite, and form part of one circuit. In our opinion, the latter picture is correct as it is based on the sign of the surface charges for a perpendicular vacuum rotator which is given by the sign of <bold>Ω</bold><sub>⋆</sub>⋅<bold>B</bold>, and which is opposite on both sides of the equator. <fig id="Fig15"><label>Fig. 15</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><italic>Left</italic>: Sheet currents in a typical theoretical model (<italic>blue</italic>).

The most simple case is that of the aligned rotator (Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>), Left, which shows the meridional projection of the equatorial tangential discontinuity. In 3D this current spirals inward in the equatorial plane. Of course, in the oblique case this flat current sheet becomes undulating (Fig. <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>, Left). Many authors concentrate on this tangential discontinuity in the striped equatorial wind as a source of converting magnetic into kinetic energy (Coroniti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1990</xref>; Bogovalov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1999</xref>). There are, however, two objections to be made to these studies. One is that this wrinkled current sheet is in reality made up out of a combination of the tangential discontinuity current plus the displacement current we have discussed above. Surely, dissipation of this current sheet then cannot be handled purely from a resistive MHD point of view. The second objection is that, in confining the study to the singular layer, one neglects the ‘body’ currents within the stripe which connect to the magnetic poles and which carry both angular momentum and energy from the star. How such body currents would condense into a singular sheet is not made clear. <fig id="Fig17"><label>Fig. 17</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><italic>Left</italic>: Meridional (<italic>top</italic>) and equatorial (<italic>bottom</italic>) cross-section of the oblique split-monopole wind.

As we see it, the equatorial region of the wind of an oblique rotator consists of mainly toroidal magnetic flux tubes which come from both poles and join up, arranged in an alternating pattern in radial direction. Each flux tube carries a body current, with opposite signs above and below the equator. These currents correspond to the internal twist of the flux tubes caused by the polar in-coming and out-going current system. We have constructed this sketch based on the evolutionary scenario of the events when a finite flux tube is drawn out from a star when it starts rotating (Fig. <xref rid="Fig19" ref-type="fig">19</xref>). Apart from these currents there is a current which separates two flux tubes. This current consists to a negligible amount (of order <italic>Γ</italic><sup>−2</sup>) out of a charge current, and mainly out of a displacement current. Altogether, the Poynting flux of the oblique rotator is supported by two electric current systems: a charge body current, which may be subject to current starvation and consequent dissipation at some distance from the star, and a displacement current, which probably is distributed instead of singular as well, and which dissipates by the CPA process. The third component of a postulated singular charge current separating flux tubes from both hemispheres—on which several papers focus—can be completely neglected as to its contribution to the total Poynting energy flux. In our opinion this is corroborated by the results from Komissarov (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2006</xref>) who computes the amount of Poynting flux dissipated by numerical resistivity in MHD approximation of a pulsar wind constructed according to the recipe by Bogovalov (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1999</xref>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>, Right).

An important example is the polar gap in a pulsar, which leads to abundant pair creation. Secondly, they also act as regions of ‘rupture’ on both sides of which ideal, force-free magnetic structures slide along each other (‘slippage’), and where electric currents cross the magnetic field, thus leading to bulk acceleration by the Lorentz force.

Broadly speaking, the heat and the excess radiation resulting from the non-thermal particles and their interactions with their environment constitutes the <italic>flare</italic>, whereas the motion of the magnetized plasma constitutes a <italic>coronal mass ejection</italic> (CME) which is often, but not always associated with a flare. The overall duration of the primary energy release phase (the impulsive phase) is on the order of 10 minutes, with significant variations in the energy release rate indicated by X-ray ‘elementary flare bursts’ on ∼10 s timescales (and also lower-amplitude variations on shorter scales). The broadly accepted view of a solar flare is that the magnetic field is permitted to reconfigure by reconnection of the magnetic field—a highly localized process which nonetheless allows the global field/current system to relax to a very different energy state. The magnetic field changes dramatically in the impulsive phase, and steady-state models are certainly inappropriate. It was for a long time assumed that the photospheric magnetic field did not change during a solar flare meaning that the photospheric current also did not change, but this is not correct. Substantial non-reversing changes in the photospheric line-of-sight and vector fields are observed to coincide with, and occur over, the few minutes of the impulsive phase of strong flares (Sudol and Harvey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2005</xref>; Petrie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par57">The usual approach in solar physics is to consider the corona to be an ideal MHD plasma (see (<xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>)) in which the primary variables are plasma velocity and magnetic induction (magnetic field), <bold>v</bold> and <bold>B</bold>, with current density <bold>j</bold> and electric field <bold>E</bold> being derived quantities. Of course, a flare can only happen when the ideal approximation breaks down, allowing field dissipation, and reconfiguration.

One or more components of the magnetic field can be deduced from spectropolarimetric observations, while plasma flows can also be deduced spectroscopically or from feature tracking. Explaining field and flow observations has driven very successful developments in large-scale solar MHD models. However, one result of this is that the current circuit and how it changes is not much discussed at present. Simple current circuit models for flares have long existed (e.g. Alfvén and Carlqvist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1967</xref>; Colgate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1978</xref>), but we do not often grapple with the reality of the time-dependent driving, re-routing and dissipation of currents in an intrinsically complex magnetic structure.</p><p id="Par58">This section overviews the several ways that electrical currents are considered in the context of solar flares, primarily as a means for storing energy in the magnetic field, and several models for the onset of a flare involve the classical instabilities of a current-carrying loop. The release of energy in a single current-carrying loop or a pair of interacting loops illustrates the transformation of non-potential magnetic energy to kinetic energy of accelerated particles, and to a mechanical and Poynting flux as the twist redistributes. However currents are also associated with <italic>singular magnetic structures</italic> in a more complex coronal field geometry, such as <italic>X-lines</italic>, <italic>current sheets</italic> and <italic>separatrix surfaces</italic>, and when reconnection occurs here fast particles can be accelerated forming a non-thermal particle beam, also constituting a current. More generally, the transport of the energy of a flare is often attributed to a beam of electrons which flows together with a counter-streaming population in a beam-return current system.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Coronal Currents and Energy Storage</title><p id="Par59">The energy for a solar flare—i.e. the current system—is thought to arrive in the corona primarily by emerging through the photosphere already embedded in the twisted and stretched field of a magnetic active region (e.g. Leka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1996</xref>; Jeong and Chae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2007</xref>). Small-scale photospheric stressing following emergence may also occur and be important in destabilization of a current-carrying coronal structure but it is not expected to be energetically significant. Magnetic active regions are composed of a small number of dominant magnetic bipoles (quadrupolar fields are commonly observed in complex, flare-productive regions) and the strongest magnetic poles are associated with sunspots. The best data available at present demonstrate significant non-neutralized currents in strong field regions, meaning that at photospheric heights there are net currents entering the corona on one side of the polarity inversion line, and re-entering the photosphere on the other side. In particular, this is the case close to the active region magnetic polarity inversion line (see e.g. Wheatland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2000</xref>; Georgoulis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>). The sign of these currents is strongly correlated with the sign of their host magnetic element, suggesting a dominant sense of <italic>current helicity</italic>. Overall the current is balanced within observational errors, in the sense that currents emerging on one side of the polarity inversion line have, somewhere, an oppositely-directed counterpart submerging on the other side. This non-neutralized current flow is an observed property of the active region on scales of tens of arcseconds, or thousands to tens of thousands of kilometers, i.e. both the separation and the size of the main current and magnetic sources in the region. Figure <xref rid="Fig21" ref-type="fig">21</xref> shows the magnetogram and net electrical currents calculated by Georgoulis et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>) flowing in individual magnetic fragments of the active region that hosted the last large (X-class) flare of Solar Cycle 23. The size of the current sources, as illustrated in this figure may at least conceptually be linked to a scale of sub-photospheric generation or aggregation of ropes or bundles of magnetic flux carrying like (i.e. similarly directed) currents. The character of the sub-photospheric magnetic dynamo is of course not yet known, but both turbulent convective flows and ordered shear and rotational flows are likely to play a role (e.g. Tobias and Cattaneo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2013</xref>) and thus a bundle with both a strong net current flow direction, and also a fragmentary character are to be expected. Oppositely-flowing currents already present in the sub-photospheric structures, and maintained during rise into the photosphere are hinted at by the interspersed red and blue sources in this figure, on the scale of a few arcseconds, though some of these current sources are weak and are not considered as being significantly non-neutral by the authors. The net currents in the largest negative and positive polarities in Fig. <xref rid="Fig21" ref-type="fig">21</xref> have values of 45×10<sup>11</sup> A and −35×10<sup>11</sup> A respectively. The imbalance indicates that the main negative polarity must also provide current to sources other than the main positive polarity, as would be revealed by field reconstructions. Sub-resolution structures are also to be expected, and these may—indeed should—include coronal return currents in thin surface sheets, providing partial neutralization of currents flowing through the photospheric boundary. <fig id="Fig21"><label>Fig. 21</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Vertical magnetic field in magnetic active region (NOAA AR 10930) partitioned into flux elements (<italic>LH panel</italic>; <italic>black/white</italic> for opposite polarities) and showing calculated current density (<italic>RH panel</italic>).

The mathematical formulation of magnetic field extrapolations, with field lines having at least one end in a photospheric source, means that it is not possible to find field-aligned currents closing completely within the corona. However, one could envisage energy-storing force-free ‘tokamak’ structures entirely disconnected from the photosphere yet prevented from leaving the corona by overlying field, or (perhaps rather implausibly) by being threaded by an anchored magnetic loop.

This is adequate for most purposes, but in reality currents must close. This is presumed to happen somewhere below the photospheric layer (at least in conditions of slow evolution) in a layer where flux tube identity is established, and yet the flux tubes themselves are small enough that they can be stressed by plasma flow (McClymont and Fisher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">1989</xref>). This implies a plasma dense enough that it can provide the mechanical stresses on the field-carrying plasma to twist it up. Melrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1995</xref>) argues that this may happen deep in the solar convection zone. However, during a solar flare the energy release and therefore the coronal current evolution is much faster than the timescales on which signals about changing magnetic fields can propagate (Alfvénically) out of or into the region below the photosphere. The evolving current system in a flare requires current re-routing across the field at higher layers, in processes possibly analogous to magnetospheric substorms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Instability of Current-Carrying Flux Ropes and Flare Onset</title><p id="Par63">Prior to a flare and CME a coronal current system exists in a stable or metastable equilibrium. There are many theoretical models for the processes leading to the loss of equilibrium (see e.g. a recent review by Aulanier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>); we focus our discussion here around the role of the current. Roughly speaking instability is to be expected when the axial current becomes strong, such that the toroidal component of the field exceeds the poloidal component. This can be seen as consistent with the result by Aly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1984</xref>) that the maximum energy above the potential field that can be stored in a 3D stressed force-free field with the same normal field at the boundary is of the same order as that of the potential field itself.</p><p id="Par64">In one of the earliest models for an electrical current in the corona by Kuperus and Raadu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">1974</xref>), an over-dense (straight) current-carrying filament in the corona is kept in stable equilibrium by a balance between three forces: the downward Lorentz force from the current acting on the background field of the overlying magnetic arch and the (relatively small) force of gravity are balanced by the upward Lorentz forces due to screening currents induced above the photosphere by the filament’s electrical current (also described mathematically in terms of a sub-photospheric ‘mirror current’). It was demonstrated by van Tend and Kuperus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">1978</xref>) that an initially low-altitude current filament would become unstable and that the filament field structure and its entrained plasma would accelerate upwards if its current exceeded some critical value, or if it were given a sufficiently large upward displacement. If the filament is allowed to bend around to become a twisted loop, or ‘flux rope’, anchored in the photosphere a semi-toroidal configuration arises and the destabilizing role of the curvature (or hoop) force of the loop on itself must be considered. An overlying dipolar field can keep this system in equilibrium. The resulting magnetic field of even a simple construction of this kind shows features—separatrix surfaces and concave-up field lines tangential to the photosphere (known as bald patches)—indicating the structural complexity present in realistic force-free fields (e.g. Titov and Démoulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">1999</xref>). An example of the field and currents arising in an MHD model of this configuration is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig23" ref-type="fig">23</xref>, from Gibson et al.

These simulations can exhibit quite baffling complexity; the results must be analyzed carefully to unravel the dynamic features that appear and disappear as instability and reconnection occurs. Reconnection takes place at the current sheets around, above and also below the flux rope, and this allows the kind of dramatic field reconfiguration necessary to extract energy from the field and launch a CME.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Fixed Circuit (Single Loop) Flare Models</title><p id="Par66">Flare models can be much simpler than the elaborate MHD model shown above, their purpose being to explain the energy release, transport and conversion rather than dynamics. A basic flare structure is a simple, single loop (as is often seen in soft X-ray or extreme UV images) and models for flares invoking the enhanced dissipation of field-aligned electrical currents within such a loop have a long heritage, starting with Alfvén and Carlqvist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1967</xref>). In this type of model an electrical current <italic>I</italic> encounters a region of enhanced resistivity <italic>R</italic>. By analogy with various laboratory examples, Alfvén &amp; Carlqvist argue that—if the current cannot divert around it—the entire magnetic energy stored in the current system will tend to dissipate in the region of enhanced resistivity. The enhanced resistivity in the Alfvén &amp; Carlqvist model starts with a small local plasma density depletion. Persistence of the current across this region means that the (more mobile) electrons must be accelerated into the depletion and decelerated as they exit it. The local parallel electrostatic electric field thus generated drives ions in the opposite direction, further enhancing the depletion of charge-carriers and creating an electrostatic double-layer. This requires that the current-carrying electrons move through the double layer faster than the electron thermal speed (otherwise the potential can be shorted by redistributing thermal electrons). It was noted by Smith and Priest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">1972</xref>) that the situation where electrons drift faster than the local thermal speed is equivalent to the condition for the current-driven Buneman instability. The suggestion follows that the microinstability resulting from the Buneman instability provides the enhanced resistivity in the Alfvén &amp; Carlqvist model. The ion-acoustic instability has an even lower threshold for onset, occurring when the electrons and ions have a relative drift that is greater than the ion sound speed but requires the electrons to be much hotter than the ions. Both of these instabilities provide an anomalous resistivity by setting up waves which scatter electrons and ions.</p><p id="Par67">The power <italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup><italic>R</italic> dissipated in the resistive region produces flare heating, and the potential drop across the resistance may be able to accelerate charged particles. The typical power needed for a flare is ∼10<sup>27</sup>–10<sup>28</sup> ergs s<sup>−1</sup> (10<sup>20</sup>–10<sup>21</sup> W), and with a current of ∼10<sup>20</sup>–10<sup>21</sup> statA (3.3⋅10<sup>10</sup>–3.3⋅10<sup>11</sup> A) this means that the resistance is around 10<sup>−13</sup>–10<sup>−12</sup> s cm<sup>−1</sup> (9⋅10<sup>−1</sup>–9⋅10<sup>−2</sup> Ω). This gives rise to a potential drop of around 3⋅10<sup>10</sup>–3⋅10<sup>9</sup> V, producing electrons and protons up to about 10<sup>10</sup> eV. This is very much larger than the kinetic energy of a few tens of keV typical of flare electrons, so a single potential drop in this system is not a good model for flare particle acceleration.</p><p id="Par68">In a later iteration of this model, Carlqvist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1979</xref>) demonstrated how part of the energy, previously stored in the twisted field structure, arrives at the double layer as a Poynting flux. Figure <xref rid="Fig24" ref-type="fig">24</xref> illustrates an electrostatic double layer introduced into a (twisted) coronal loop, leading to a radial electrostatic field on its boundary (due to its finite radial extent). When crossed into magnetic field of the current-carrying loop this electrostatic field gives rise to a Poynting vector <bold>S</bold>=<italic>c</italic>(<bold>E</bold>×<bold>B</bold>)/4<italic>π</italic>, and a plasma drift with the same direction <bold>v</bold><sub><italic>d</italic></sub>=<italic>c</italic>(<bold>E</bold>×<bold>B</bold>)/<italic>B</italic><sup>2</sup>, and therefore with both an axial and a toroidal component. The azimuthal component of the drift represents the unwinding of the twisted flux tube across the resistive region at the top of the loop. This idea, forming an interesting bridge between Alfvénic energy transport and particle acceleration, was subsequently generalized by Melrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1992</xref>) to include an arbitrary source of resistance, which could in principle be placed anywhere in the current-carrying loop. <fig id="Fig24"><label>Fig. 24</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The radial electrostatic field <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>br</italic></sub> formed at the boundary of a double layer crossed into the magnetic field <bold>B</bold>=(0,<italic>B</italic><sub><italic>ϕ</italic></sub>,<italic>B</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub>) gives rise to a plasma drift <bold>v</bold>=<italic>c</italic><bold>E</bold>×<bold>B</bold>/<italic>E</italic><sup>2</sup>=(0,<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>dϕ</italic></sub>,<italic>v</italic><sub><italic>dx</italic></sub>), and a Poynting flux <italic>S</italic>=<italic>c</italic>(<bold>E</bold>×<bold>B</bold>)/4<italic>π</italic>.

The presence of more than two bright chromospheric (or occasionally photospheric) foot points during a flare demonstrates that multiple flux systems are present. Quadrupolar systems, with at least 4 groups of foot point, are rather common. The spreading of those foot points or ribbons in the chromosphere that is particularly evident in H<italic>α</italic> and UV emission indicates that from instant to instant the identity of the bundle of magnetic flux that is involved in the flare is changing—in a process very similar in appearance to the racing of auroral curtains across the sky (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec">4.4</xref> and Fig. <xref rid="Fig36" ref-type="fig">36</xref>). The appearance of previously invisible flare loops indicates that the topology has changed. This happens during the impulsive and the gradual phases of the flare; a particularly (perhaps the only) compelling solar observation of this was recently presented by Su et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2013</xref>), but the ample circumstantial evidence for reconnection means that its existence in the flare corona is not generally in doubt. A large fraction of flares thus involve the formation of new flux and new current systems as magnetic connections are broken and reformed.</p><p id="Par71">Melrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">1997</xref>) associates the flare energy with the change in energy stored in coronal currents as the current path shortens, and this process was explored in a model of two interacting current-carrying loops, as sketched in Fig. <xref rid="Fig25" ref-type="fig">25</xref>. Reconnection was involved only in so far as it allowed the field to reconfigure and the currents to re-route and the field lines to shorten, corresponding to the release of energy. More recent work by Melrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2012b</xref>) demonstrates how this process happens; it is argued that the cross-field current enabling the re-routing of previously field-aligned currents in the corona is a result of the intrinsically time-varying character of the flare magnetic field, which is quite appropriate for the flare impulsive phase. The resulting inductive electric field plays a critical role in the overall problem.

The idea that the energy in a flare can be transported by Alfvénic perturbations has also been explored by, e.g., Haerendel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2006</xref>) and Fletcher and Hudson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>). The reconnection region, in which the rapid field variations at the root of the process begin, can be arbitrarily small (with arbitrarily small energy dissipation locally); its role instead is to allow the transfer of current from pre-reconnection field to post-reconnection field, and in doing so it launches Alfvénic Poynting flux along just-reconnected field lines, redistributing energy throughout the corona with the current.</p><p id="Par74">The discussion above indicates how the currents in the corona may be rerouted and in the process energy transported away from the reconnection site and a new current profile established throughout the corona. In the magnetosphere/ionosphere system the current restructuring implied by substorms (flare analogues) involves current closure in the partially ionized layers of the ionosphere, supported by the Pedersen resistivity (Sect. <xref rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec">4.4</xref>). The deep chromosphere is also a partially ionized plasma, however the high density and resulting strong collisional coupling between ions and neutrals means that the collisional friction that provides the Pedersen resistivity is too small to support cross-field currents (e.g. Haerendel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2006</xref>). That is not to say that ion-neutral collisions have no role to play in the flare energy dissipation; if the period of the Alfvénic pulse (moving the ions) is short compared to the ion-neutral collisional timescale then frictional damping can take place. The ion-neutral collisional timescale is longest around the temperature-minimum region of the solar chromosphere where the number density of protons is also at a minimum, and significant wave damping can occur here for wave pulses of duration a second or less (Russell and Fletcher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par75">An Alfvén wave entering the chromosphere passes through a region in which the Alfvén speed is varying rapidly; the reflection and transmission and damping of the wave needs to be carefully calculated (e.g. De Pontieu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2001</xref>). Moreover, if the wave enters at an angle to the density gradient, mode conversion can also occur (e.g. Khomenko and Collados <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2006</xref>). Therefore, the wave energy is unlikely to be dissipated straightforwardly, in a “single pass” through the chromosphere or photosphere, but multiple reflections leading to counterstreaming waves, generation of plasma turbulence, and other complexities, are to be expected. However, at some level the photospheric currents are fixed, and somehow the new and old currents must match, which implies current dissipation or current diversion into a singular layer. At some point in the atmosphere the field becomes line-tied, and the high inertia of the material means that the Alfvén wave front reaching the photosphere cannot continue. Its energy and current must be dissipated in full or in part. Dissipation at this layer, as well as the damping occurring elsewhere in the atmosphere, must be what provides the intense heating and particle acceleration that characterize a solar flare. In broad terms, the stressed magnetic field in the wave pulse leads to field-aligned electric fields which can be a source of both heating and acceleration in the plasmas of the lower atmosphere. This is described further in Sect. <xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">3.7</xref>. Another effect of the high inertia of the photospheric material is that any excess photospheric current can be diverted across the magnetic field into a thin envelope around the coronal flaring region. It can do so since the photospheric material can take up the stresses resulting from the Lorentz force.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Singular Current-Carrying Structures in a Complex Corona</title><p id="Par76">As indicated in Sect. <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref> the magnetic field and the current structures arising from something even as simple as a current-carrying flux rope embedded in an overlying potential field arcade can be quite complex. The extrapolated magnetic field shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">22</xref> suggests multiple magnetic domains (regions with the same magnetic connectivity).</p><p id="Par77">Coronal field configurations can be analyzed to identify sheet-like magnetic discontinuities—regions of rapid change of field-line connectivity—known as separatrices. These are regions where, in non-potential configurations, current sheets can develop (e.g. Low and Wolfson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1988</xref>). In fields determined from realistic magnetic boundaries singular separatrices are not found; the relevant structures are instead quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs). An example of this for the whole Sun field is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig26" ref-type="fig">26</xref>, where the semi-transparent separatrix domes indicate the interfaces between fields which are closed on the scale of an active region, from those which open to the heliosphere. <fig id="Fig26"><label>Fig. 26</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A rendering of the separate coronal magnetic domains over the entire Sun (<italic>semi-transparent colored surfaces</italic>), and a few selected field lines (in <italic>cyan</italic>).

The flare ribbons—or at least the subset of them defined by the non-thermal X-ray and optical foot points—are where the majority of the flare energy arrives at the lower atmosphere. However, the field extrapolations suggest that the bulk currents are stored in and released from large-scale flux ropes. It is not clear how these pictures match up—whether in fact sufficient current can be stored in QSLs as opposed to flux ropes, or whether the process of flux-rope destabilization involves reconnection with and current transfer onto the QSL field.</p><p id="Par79">A further type of current system often discussed in the solar flare context is that which exists in the dissipation region of a reconnecting structure, where the magnetic field is sufficiently small and thus the particle Larmor radii are large compared to the scale length on which the magnetic field varies. Reconnection—even in the steady state—involves the advection of magnetized plasma into a current sheet or X-line. This results in a −<bold>v</bold>×<bold>B</bold>/<italic>c</italic> electric field, and electrons which are demagnetized in a small region around the X-point can be accelerated in the direction of this electric field. Ions, due to their larger gyro radii, are demagnetized over a larger region and are accelerated in the opposite direction. Where this current closes will depend on the configuration of the magnetic field and on the orbits of the particles; these exhibit properties of dynamical chaos meaning that they can be deflected out along the magnetic separatrices into higher field regions where they become re-magnetized and may leave the system, or mirror and return for further acceleration (Hannah and Fletcher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2006</xref>). In 2.5D the X-line or current sheet extends indefinitely and currents run uniformly along it, but of course in 3D these currents must close; the X-line is generalized as a magnetic separator which meets the photosphere at either end—the model of Somov (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">1986</xref>) shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig27" ref-type="fig">27</xref> indicates one possible geometry for this. <fig id="Fig27"><label>Fig. 27</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The X-line, indicated by the field vectors in the <italic>top right</italic>, is the separator between reconnecting magnetic domains.

The standard model of solar flares separates the region where particles are accelerated from the region where the flare energy is dissipated as radiation, placing the former in the corona close to (or perhaps in) the magnetic reconnection region and the latter in the lower atmosphere—the chromosphere. The chromosphere is where the flare radiation is primarily generated and where the signatures of accelerated particles are primarily seen. If they are accelerated in the corona the particles must then travel from the corona to the chromosphere transporting energy, and must therefore have a significant component of velocity directed along the magnetic field, in a beam-like distribution.</p><p id="Par81">The properties of the accelerated particles can be deduced from the radiation that they produce—hard X-rays (at typically a few 10s of keV) for electrons, and <italic>γ</italic>-rays for ions. Most of the work on flare non-thermal particles focuses on electrons, simply because HXRs are more readily observed than are <italic>γ</italic>-rays, and our knowledge of ions is thus rather poor. In particular, we do not know whether electrons and ions are always accelerated together in flares, but electron acceleration is a central feature. Energy transported to the chromosphere by a beam of electrons must be dissipated there, which means that the electrons give up their energy and stop; at the minimum this involves Coulomb collisions in the dense chromospheric plasma. Under this assumption, the so-called <italic>‘collisional thick-target model’</italic>, the rate of incident electrons required to explain the observed HXRs can be calculated (Brown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1971</xref>). The deduced rate of ∼10<sup>35</sup>–10<sup>36</sup> electrons s<sup>−1</sup> would, if not neutralised, constitute a colossal current, of 10<sup>14</sup>–10<sup>15</sup> A (3⋅10<sup>23</sup>–3⋅10<sup>24</sup> statA), orders of magnitude greater than is present in the pre-flare corona (and with a correspondingly large associated magnetic field). However, this current will not exist un-neutralized. Driven by the inductive electric field of the beam and the (transient) electrostatic field at its head, a return current of electrons will flow (e.g. van den Oord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">1990</xref>), drawn presumably from the chromosphere where there is a large charge reservoir. It has frequently been proposed that this return current could replenish the accelerator, thus neatly solving the problem of how to replenish the acceleration region (which operates in a tenuous corona, and cannot pump out 10<sup>35</sup> electrons per second for long). It remains to be seen what the overall electron current circuit joining a chromospheric foot point and the coronal acceleration region would look like. In the case of a free-streaming beam, a return-current could flow co-spatially with the beam. Such a return current would not be able to re-enter an accelerator that involves a large-scale direct electric field; in other DC field accelerators such as around a reconnecting X-line the return current could re-enter the accelerator if particles could drift across the field (similarly in accelerators with many small-scale and possible transient current sheets). However, there are doubts about whether the intense electron beam demanded by observations (e.g. Hoyng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1976</xref>; Krucker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2011</xref>) can co-exist stably with its co-spatial counter-streaming return current, or instead have its energy substantially dissipated as heat via an instability. Other configurations with a large-scale DC electric field, and thus without a co-spatial return current, have also been discussed. For example in the sketch from Winglee et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">1991</xref>) shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig28" ref-type="fig">28</xref> the return currents flow over the surface of the channel through which the electron beam is accelerated and flows, and ions are drawn into the channel across the magnetic field, and are themselves accelerated (in the opposite direction to the electrons). <fig id="Fig28"><label>Fig. 28</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of ion and electron currents produced by a cross-field driving current in the corona, and closing across the field in the lower atmosphere.

The ions would carry the bulk of the energy, and it is not entirely clear that such a beam arriving at the chromosphere can readily produce the non-thermal HXR spectrum observed though it is plausible under certain conditions (Karlický et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2000</xref>). It would be premature to discount this model, though there is strong evidence for ions in only a few flares.</p><p id="Par83">It should be emphasized that the main challenge in the electron-beam model is meeting the requirement of a high electron flux from the corona implied by HXR observations interpreted in the collisional thick-target model. Electrons decelerate collisionally in the chromosphere and only have a finite radiating lifetime (thus a finite and well-specified amount of radiation they can produce) before they join the thermal population. Electron flux requirements can be alleviated by allowing the electrons to be re-accelerated once they have entered the chromosphere (Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>), e.g. in multiple current sheets or turbulence. However, the flare <italic>energy</italic> must still reach the chromosphere; the quiescent magnetic energy density of the chromosphere is not sufficient to explain a flare (e.g., compare the energy flux required to heat the chromosphere, of ∼10<sup>3</sup>–10<sup>4</sup> W m<sup>−2</sup> (10<sup>6</sup>–10<sup>7</sup> erg cm<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>), with the flare requirement of ∼10<sup>8</sup> W m<sup>−2</sup> (10<sup>11</sup> erg cm<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>)). Flare energy may also be transported through the atmosphere by conduction (slow) or by MHD waves. The latter is an integral part of the holistic view of coronal currents discussed in Sect. <xref rid="Sec16" ref-type="sec">3.4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Current Circuits and Flare Particle Acceleration</title><p id="Par84">A large fraction—estimates suggest up to 50 %—of the flare energy emerges in the kinetic energy of mildly relativistic electrons and ions. Electrons, which are more straightforward to detect via their bremsstrahlung radiation, typically have non-thermal energies of a few tens of keV. Spectra suggest that a true non-thermal tail can be distinguished from a core thermal distribution at energies exceeding ∼25 keV, and the spectral distribution is a power-law in energy <italic>F</italic>(<italic>E</italic>)∼<italic>E</italic><sup>−<italic>δ</italic></sup> with spectral index <italic>δ</italic> typically between 3 and 8. Imaging demonstrates that hard X-ray radiation, which is collisional bremsstrahlung from the non-thermal electrons, usually originates primarily in the dense chromosphere, except in rare ‘dense-loop flares’ where the coronal density is high enough to lead to significant coronal non-thermal emission. In the flare standard model electrons are accelerated in the corona and propagate approximately collisionlessly to the chromosphere where they radiate. In this way the flare energy is also carried to the chromosphere, powering the optical and UV emission which is the flare’s main radiation loss. As mentioned in Sect. <xref rid="Sec18" ref-type="sec">3.6</xref> the electron beam required may not be able to propagate stably together with its return current; this condition arises because the beam current density required by observations (e.g. Krucker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2011</xref>) is so high that it flows relative to its return current at speeds well in excess of the ion or even electron thermal speed, a condition that should lead to the ion-acoustic or Buneman instabilities respectively (Brown and Melrose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1977</xref>). Other ideas for flare particle acceleration, including placing the accelerator in or near the chromosphere, are being investigated (Fletcher and Hudson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>; Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>), which may considerably reduce the number of accelerated electrons required (though not their total energy).</p><p id="Par85">There are numerous models for particle acceleration in solar flares, and again we will be selective here, mentioning only those closely associated with the existence or disruption of electrical currents and thus providing a very incomplete view of flare particle acceleration. A recent overview of the many acceleration processes that may be operating in the solar atmosphere can be found in Zharkova et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2011</xref>). As mentioned in Sect. <xref rid="Sec17" ref-type="sec">3.5</xref> reconnecting structures such as current sheets or X-lines are a location where particle acceleration may take place, in the zone close to the singular region where one or more components of the magnetic field goes to zero and the particles become demagnetized and can accelerate freely in the electric field of the current sheet. Outside these regions particles are magnetized and the population as a whole experiences various kinds of drift, rather than the acceleration of a small tail to high energies. It is hard to see how a single macroscopic current sheet in the corona can fulfill the number requirement of 10<sup>36</sup> electrons s<sup>−1</sup> in a large flare; if the electrons are advected into the current sheet by the reconnection inflow at the external Alfvén speed <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>=<italic>B</italic>/(4<italic>πn</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub><italic>m</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>)<sup>1/2</sup> then the total electron flux that can pass through the sheet of area <italic>A</italic> is 2<italic>n</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub><italic>v</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub><italic>A</italic> electrons s<sup>−1</sup>=1.4×10<sup>22</sup><italic>n</italic><sub>9</sub><italic>B</italic><sub>2</sub> A for <italic>n</italic><sub>9</sub> the electron number density in units of 10<sup>9</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> and <italic>B</italic><sub>2</sub> the magnetic field strength in units of 100 G=10<sup>−2</sup> T.

Such a structure will not be stable and will fragment into many smaller structures. Fragmented current sheets distributed throughout a coronal volume may offer a better prospect. The need to continually supply the accelerating volume with fresh electrons remains the same though. For this reason, moving the current sheet accelerators into the low atmosphere—for example the transition region or upper chromosphere—is an attractive prospect since both the number density of electrons and the magnetic field strength are significantly increased; for example if <italic>n</italic><sub>9</sub>=100 and <italic>B</italic><sub>2</sub>=10, which might be found in the upper chromosphere, then <italic>A</italic> is a more manageable 1000 km on a side, comparable in height to the thickness of the chromosphere.

If a parallel potential drop at least this large can be generated in a chromospheric/transition region current sheet, over a distance of a couple of thousand km, this could potentially supply the required electron flux.</p><p id="Par86">Field-aligned acceleration by parallel electric fields is much more explored in pulsar and terrestrial magnetospheres than in solar flares; the literature dealing the obvious solar analogies is small. Field-aligned potential drops were part of the early current-interruption models of Alfvén and Carlqvist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1967</xref>) and Carlqvist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1979</xref>) mentioned in Sect. <xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">3.3</xref>, but the basic problem with these is that for the inferred currents the parallel potential drops generated are of the order 10<sup>10</sup> V, much higher than the typical electron energy. A more complex geometry is needed, and current fragmentation may provide the solution. Holman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1985</xref>) suggested a very large number <italic>n</italic> of filamented counter-streaming currents. If these currents provide the total power radiated by the flare, then they can do so at a lower potential drop per current channel. If the potential drop along each current channel is reduced by a factor <italic>n</italic> then the current per channel is increased to give the same power. Potential drops of ∼100 keV are obtained with <italic>n</italic>∼10<sup>5</sup> small currents, implying filamentation of the large-scale magnetic field into the same number of bundles (Holman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1985</xref>). A model with many counter-streaming currents is in conflict with the observations of large net currents flowing in flare regions, and the current channels would be very narrow. We know that most of the energy emerges in the hard X-ray part of the spectrum, and it is very hard to determine the size of HXR footpoints, but in well-observed flares scales on the order of a couple of arcseconds are found, and are consistent with optical source sizes on the order of 1–2×10<sup>16</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> (Krucker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2011</xref>). Each of the 10<sup>5</sup> current channels would then have an area of 1–2×10<sup>11</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> at the footpoint. The coronal current channels could be larger, allowing for expansion of the field from the footpoint into the corona, but if the expansion of the flux tube is large then one must also incorporate the effect on particles of magnetic trapping.</p><p id="Par87">In the magnetospheric case the existence of parallel electric fields is not in doubt. The exact altitude distribution of these fields is still debated (Birn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>). The electric fields can be quite extended along the magnetic field in a quasi-static fashion, or they can be concentrated in multiple thin, so called double layers as for instance envisaged by Alfvén and Carlqvist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1967</xref>). In the case of the magnetosphere, there seems to be no general agreement on the process generating the <italic>E</italic><sub>||</sub> that is observed as also dispersive Alfvén waves have been observed and speculated as the source of small-scale structures in the aurora (Birn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2012</xref>). The solar case however, is much less well explored.</p><p id="Par88">Perhaps of most relevance here is that parallel electric fields in general play a role in dissipating magnetic stresses, as is required when the large-scale magnetic field relaxes. The general argument made by Haerendel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1994</xref>) and Melrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2012b</xref>) is that a parallel electric field allows the decoupling of two regions of magnetized plasma experiencing a shear flow relative to one another and perpendicular to the magnetic field threading both. In the solar case these would correspond to the photosphere where the magnetic field is frozen into a high-inertia fluid, and the corona through which an Alfvén wave pulse is traveling. Figure <xref rid="Fig29" ref-type="fig">29</xref> sketches this process; in the left-hand panel, an initially vertical field (indicated by the solid lines with arrowheads), frozen in to the lower plasma, is distorted by a mechanical stress on the magnetized plasma at some (distant) top boundary. In a zone termed the ‘fracture zone’ by Haerendel, field reconfiguration takes place to release the stress, and the result is a plasma flow indicated in the Figure by <italic>v</italic><sub>⊥<italic>F</italic></sub>. The ‘fracture’ allows energy to be dissipated. Examining this scenario in cross-section, as in the right-hand panel of Fig. <xref rid="Fig29" ref-type="fig">29</xref>, the <italic>v</italic><sub>⊥<italic>F</italic></sub> in the region above the fracture results in an electric field <italic>E</italic><sub>⊥</sub> perpendicular to the magnetic field (RH side of this panel). The <italic>E</italic><sub>⊥</sub> is an electrostatic field, existing for much longer than the transit of the magnetic disturbance through the fracture zone, and is balanced by an oppositely-directed electrostatic field in the adjacent plasma (LH side of this panel), which sets that plasma into motion. The electrostatic equipotentials must be continuous, as sketched in the dashed lines, meaning that somewhere in the fracture zone there is an electric field parallel to the magnetic field, where acceleration may take place. The physical scales of the structure can be estimated based on the fact that in the region of parallel electric field in the fracture zone, the potential drop should be up to 10 MeV, to allow the acceleration of ions to <italic>γ</italic>-ray producing energies. The electric field should be in excess of the Dreicer field, which was earlier calculated as 0.7–7 V m<sup>−1</sup> in the upper chromosphere, but—varying as it does with the plasma density—can easily reach 100 V m<sup>−1</sup> in the mid-chromosphere. If we take 100 V m<sup>−1</sup> as a plausible value, this means that to obtain MeV energies would require an accelerating length of around 100 km. The width of the equipotential structure shown in the right-hand panel of Fig. <xref rid="Fig29" ref-type="fig">29</xref> would then be on the order of 200 km. This is not dissimilar to the arcsecond-scale of flare ribbon widths. <fig id="Fig29"><label>Fig. 29</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>View of a magnetic fracture zone, face-on (<italic>LH panel</italic>) and in cross-section (<italic>RH panel</italic>).

This may happen directly in the solar corona resulting in an intense beam of electrons—a current—propagating through the corona and balanced by a return flow of ambient electrons in a beam-return current system. Or, in processes more analogous with the magnetosphere, the relaxation might proceed in the form of Alfvénic perturbations launched by the introduction of an interruption to the current flow in a single loop, or by reconnection in a system of two or more interacting loops. In the case of two interacting loops it may be shown how the inductive electric field leads to cross-field currents which allow the currents to reroute during reconnection, and drives a Poynting flux along the reconnected field. However we know that coronal magnetic topology is often more complicated than two interacting loops and this must be included in our thinking. Electrical currents with high individual particle energies can also be formed in the diffusion region of a reconnecting coronal structure, where individual particles become decoupled from the reconnecting components of the field and are accelerated in the −<bold>v</bold>×<bold>B</bold>/<italic>c</italic> field. However we note that Longcope and Tarr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2012</xref>), who treat the redistribution of energy stored in a current sheet in 2D, demonstrate that the vast majority of the stored energy is carried away from the sheet by fast magnetosonic waves launched by unbalanced Lorentz forces in the sheet, leaving little to be dissipated locally.

It remains to be seen how these different views of current-carrying structures can be reconciled, also with the complex current sheets that arise and that are observed to be strongly associated with the chromospheric locations of energy deposition.</p><p id="Par93">An energy flow carried by magnetic perturbations must be dissipated somewhere, and there are several avenues through which it could lead to both heating and particle acceleration (though observations dictate that eventually non-thermal particle kinetic energy must dominate). Assuming that it is large enough to overcome Coulomb collisional friction, the parallel electric field set up by the (inertial) Alfvén wave propagating through the very low <italic>β</italic> environment of the flare corona and upper transition region may accelerate or heat particles, depending on the ambient plasma conditions. The release of shear stresses in the wave as it travels towards the deep atmosphere where it is line-tied also generates a parallel field. More complex processes such as partial wave reflection in a converging field and the development of a turbulent cascade may also provide a source of first heating and then, as the plasma heats and becomes less collisional, particle acceleration in the lower atmosphere. The idea of waves rather than particles carrying flare energy through the corona to the chromosphere finds close analogy with the terrestrial magnetosphere-ionosphere system described in the next section, and deserves further examination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Electric Currents in the Earth’s Magnetosphere and Ionosphere</title><p id="Par94">The main difference between electric currents around pulsars or in solar flares and currents in the Earth’s magnetosphere and ionosphere is that the former are dominated by the effects coming from inside the pulsar or the Sun while the latter are generated by the interaction of the Earth’s magnetosphere with the solar wind.

The solar wind plasma interacts with the originally dipolar magnetic field of the Earth, with a terrestrial surface magnetic field of 25–65 μT (0.25–0.65 G), (and all other magnetized bodies in the solar system like Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus (Russell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2003</xref>)) whereby the Earth’s magnetosphere is formed into a tear-drop shape with a compressed side facing the sun and a long tail extending anti-sunward (Roelof and Sibeck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">1993</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Magnetopause Current</title><p id="Par95">Large-scale currents in space are the source of magnetic fields in distant regions and deform planetary dipole magnetic fields to produce planetary magnetospheres (Parks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2004</xref>).

The enhanced pressure pushes the magnetopause inward by several Earth radii, enhances the magnetopause current, and temporarily causes an increase of the magnetic field on the ground. This phenomenon is known as the storm sudden commencement (SSC) and can be seen as the slight increase of the Dst (Disturbance storm time index, Mayaud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">1980</xref>) index in Fig. <xref rid="Fig32" ref-type="fig">32</xref>. During the main phase of the magnetic storm charged particles in the near-Earth plasma sheet are energized and injected deeper into the inner magnetosphere drastically enhancing the quiet time ring current and producing the so-called storm time ring current. This leads to a strong decrease of the Dst index and marks the main phase of the storm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig32" ref-type="fig">32</xref>). This main phase lasts generally for several hours but can last for several days during severe storms. After a turn of the IMF to northward directions the recovery phase of the storm begins during which the injection of plasma sheet material slows down or stops completely and various loss processes (primarily charge exchange and precipitation) weaken the ring current. The recovery phase can last several days up to several weeks. <fig id="Fig32"><label>Fig. 32</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Development of the Dst index during the large magnetic storm in February 1986 and the increase of the energy content of the ring current between <italic>L</italic>=3–5 (expressed in R<sub><italic>E</italic></sub>).

Clues about how these ionospheric ions are accelerated and transported out into the magnetosphere come from correlated observations of electric field fluctuations and upward flowing ions. These observations indicate that low frequency (frequency &lt; ion cyclotron frequency) electric field fluctuations with amplitudes of ≥0.1 V/m accompany upward flowing ions. Several researchers have shown theoretically that large-amplitude electromagnetic waves can give rise to a significant ponderomotive force that can accelerate and transport ions out of the ionosphere and favor acceleration of heavier mass species.

The values for the field-aligned conductance can be deduced from satellite measurements and vary over a rather large range of 10<sup>−9</sup>–10<sup>−11</sup> S/m<sup>2</sup> (9⋅10<sup>−2</sup>–9⋅10<sup>−4</sup> (cm s)<sup>−1</sup>). One reason can be that it was deduced ignoring additional particle sources, like trapped electrons, secondary and backscattered electrons (Sakanoi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">1995</xref>), and/or wave acceleration (Frey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1998</xref>). The resulting current densities are in the range of several μA/m<sup>2</sup> and current continuity requires that similar current densities are also found in the downward current region. The requirement for current closure combined with the low plasma density along auroral field lines are then the reasons for the generation of substantial potential drops parallel to the magnetic field in the range of a few hundred to a few thousand volts. The current-voltage relation along such magnetic field lines can be determined for simple profiles of the background ion density. For typical parameters, the current density is found to be a few times larger in the downward current region compared to currents in the upward current region for similar potential drops. Thus potential drops up to a few thousand volts and the consequent acceleration of ionospheric electrons up to keV energies, such as has been observed by the FAST satellite, are a necessary consequence of the observed current densities in the downward auroral current region (Temerin and Carlson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">1998</xref>).</p><p id="Par111">Looking at quiet auroral arcs in the evening sector they almost always slowly move equator-ward. As auroral arcs are the ionospheric foot point of the upward field-aligned current the question arises why they are moving and what is the context of their motion. Given the observational fact of motions of arcs and of the oval as a whole it would just be a ‘logical’ conclusion to assume that the whole ionosphere and with it the frozen-in auroral arcs move equator-ward in the evening sector and poleward in the morning sector following the general distorted shape of the auroral oval which extends to much lower geomagnetic latitudes at midnight than it extends at dawn or dusk. Coordinated campaigns of an ionospheric radar measuring the ionospheric plasma motion and an all-sky camera observing the motion of several auroral arcs however, showed that there is a speed difference of 100–200 m/s, and that these arcs perform proper motion (Haerendel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1993</xref>; Frey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1996</xref>). Almost always this proper motion is performed into the direction towards the downward field-aligned current.</p><p id="Par112">The relative arc-plasma motion provides a way to supply auroral arcs with both fresh plasma and energy. The process is driven by the ‘generator’ region in the magnetotail which provides the energy that is then used for the conversion into particle kinetic energy and Joule heating <bold>j</bold>⋅<bold>E</bold>. Haerendel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1994</xref>) studied a system in which an auroral arc propagates into a region of stored magnetic energy, drawing power from a region bounded by upward and downward current sheets. The reason for their propagation is the exhaustion of energy stored in form of magnetic shear stresses in the flux tubes pervading the arc. As these shear stresses are released within time scales of the order of the Alfvén transit time, <italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>, between the generator region in the plasma sheet and the auroral acceleration region at 1–2 R<sub><italic>E</italic></sub> above the ground, the maximum (∇×<bold>B</bold>)<sub>∥</sub>=4<italic>πj</italic><sub>∥</sub>/<italic>c</italic> moves into the stressed field region. Hence the propagation speed must be <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>=<italic>w</italic><sub><italic>arc</italic></sub>/<italic>τ</italic><sub><italic>A</italic></sub>, where <italic>w</italic><sub><italic>arc</italic></sub> is the effective arc width (Paschmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2003</xref>). Some of the consequences of this propagating system are summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig37" ref-type="fig">37</xref>. <fig id="Fig37"><label>Fig. 37</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Qualitative picture of a magnetic fracture region with the generator region (<italic>top</italic>) in motion with respect to the ionosphere (<italic>bottom</italic>). In the fracture region (<italic>middle</italic>) concentrated field-aligned currents become unstable, allowing finite potential drops and field-aligned acceleration. An interference region between the fracture zone and the ionosphere is characterized by multiple reflections. The fracture zone itself is shown in more detail in Fig. <xref rid="Fig29" ref-type="fig">29</xref>.

At some point this current exceeds a threshold for the generation of micro-instabilities, allowing for a non-zero field-aligned electric field and breakdown of the frozen-in condition. This magnetic ‘fracture’ zone is therefore a region where magnetic field lines break and reconnect again. Most of the liberated magnetic energy is then transferred into kinetic energy of field-aligned accelerated electrons. Most of the energy that is dissipated in the arc is deposited as heat in the ionosphere. A consequence of this heating is the expansion and expulsion of plasma from that region. Most of the ionospheric plasma is excavated by the front of the arc and the so-called auroral cavity is formed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig38" ref-type="fig">38</xref>). The fracture zone is highly structured and dynamic, launching disturbances toward the ionosphere in the form of small-scale Alfvén waves. These waves can reflect both from the ionosphere and the fracture zone. Multiple reflections lead to highly structured fields in the interference region which can modulate the auroral electron flux and energy. This interference mechanism has been proposed as a potential source of auroral fine structure and multiple arcs as seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig36" ref-type="fig">36</xref> (Haerendel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1983</xref>). <fig id="Fig38"><label>Fig. 38</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Sketch of an auroral cavity.

In addition to extracting energy from the current circuit the proper motion of the auroral arc will maintain the current flow by providing fresh plasma to the acceleration process. To prevent a shortage of current carriers a local field-aligned parallel potential is generated to enlarge the loss cone for thermal magnetospheric electrons. By increasing the parallel velocity of downgoing electrons their pitch angle is decreased and more of them will not mirror in the converging dipole field but will rather penetrate deep enough to be finally lost in the ionosphere through collisions. One clear example where this process happens was demonstrated with High Latitude Dayside Aurora (HiLDA) (Frey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>).</p><p id="Par115">Space-based observations revealed the occurrence of a bright aurora spot well inside the generally empty polar cap. The spot appeared with a 20–60 minutes delay after a substantial drop in solar wind density. No obvious change in solar wind properties could be related to the time of first appearance of the bright spot, which pointed to an internal magnetospheric process rather than a solar wind driven process. Two observations coincided with passes of the FAST satellite just on top of the spots where a strong upward field-aligned current and monoenergetic particles with a clear signature of parallel acceleration were determined. On field lines threading the cusp region (Fig. <xref rid="Fig30" ref-type="fig">30</xref>) downward field-aligned current was determined (Frey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2003</xref>). Statistical analysis of solar wind conditions demonstrated a clear preference of spot occurrence during positive IMF <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>y</italic></sub> and <italic>B</italic><sub><italic>z</italic></sub> when a current circuit is set up (Richmond and Kamide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">1988</xref>) with downward field-aligned current in the cusp region, Pedersen current in the ionosphere, and the upward field-aligned current in the polar cap in the center of the dayside convection cell over the HiLDA spot (Le et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2002</xref>).</p><p id="Par116">The impact of the low solar wind density on the occurrence of the aurora spot may be twofold. When the solar wind density decreases, the magnetosphere expands in order to maintain pressure balance with the external solar wind plasma medium. This expansion, combined with the reduced supplement of fresh plasma through diffusion, will reduce the number of available current carriers to maintain the upward current. In order to keep the current flowing (Siscoe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2001</xref>) the system sets up a parallel potential that accelerates the few existing electrons into the ionosphere and subsequently creates the HiLDA at the footprint, thus avoiding current starvation. The other possible impact of the low solar wind density is the reduction of the Alfvén Mach number and a lower plasma <italic>β</italic> in the magnetosheath adjacent to the reconnection site. The reduced Mach number enhances the strength of the dusk convection cell (Crooker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1998</xref>) and thus the strength of the upward current at the HiLDA footprint. The lower plasma <italic>β</italic> is considered favorable for the onset of reconnection and can create a stronger downward current into the cusp (Fig. <xref rid="Fig39" ref-type="fig">39</xref>, Frey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2007</xref>). <fig id="Fig39"><label>Fig. 39</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Qualitative picture of the field-aligned current distribution for the case of a high latitude dayside aurora spot with the upward current over the spot, downward current connecting the cusp foot point with the high latitude magnetopause, and Pedersen current in the ionosphere.

The magnetized Earth and the plasma bound by the Earth’s magnetic field represent an obstacle to the solar wind which compresses the magnetic field at the dayside and stretches it out into the long tail on the nightside. The magnetopause and neutral sheet currents are driven by this interaction.</p><p id="Par118">Magnetic reconnection transfers plasma and energy from the solar wind into the magnetosphere and drives convection. Magnetic flux is transferred from the dayside magnetosphere to the tail lobes. As the system cannot accumulate energy forever, it has to employ certain methods to get rid of the accumulated energy and one way is to set up field-aligned electric fields that convert electromagnetic energy into kinetic particle energy and drive field-aligned currents. The system also has to remove accumulated plasma and that is achieved through reconnection at the x-line and the ejection of plasmoids down the tail out into the solar wind. It has been shown that the energy conversion above a system of auroral arcs can make a substantial or even larger contribution to the magnetospheric energy loss than ionospheric friction and Ohmic dissipation, and exactly for this reason the notion of an ‘<italic>auroral pressure valve</italic>’ was introduced (Haerendel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2000</xref>). The optical aurora is just a small result of this energy conversion as most of the precipitating particle energy goes into heat and only ≈10 % is actually released as energy of photons.</p><p id="Par119">Auroral acceleration is not just found at Earth but on all magnetized planets of the solar system (Bhardwaj and Gladstone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2000</xref>; Paschmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2003</xref>). Additionally, it has also been suggested that auroral acceleration processes happen on other astrophysical objects too, like solar flares, cataclysmic variables, and accreting neutron stars (Haerendel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2001</xref>). Intense field-aligned currents driven by forces in the outer, weak magnetic fields of an astrophysical object are the key to the generation of field-aligned potential drops. In the strong fields near the object the currents may reach a critical limit where the mirror force or current-driven anomalous resistivity require the setup of parallel potential drops for the maintenance of current continuity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par120">We have investigated electric current systems in three very different magnetized objects in the cosmos: radio pulsar winds, the solar corona, and the terrestrial magnetosphere. Their dimensions and physical conditions differ greatly, yet their main physical effects are very similar. Essentially, this happens because, in all three cases, an electric current system is set up inside a magnetically dominated plasma by a kinematically dominated plasma, i.e. the rotating magnetic neutron star, the dynamo below the solar surface, and the solar wind. These ‘drivers’ continue to try and increase the free energy of the electric circuit via transport of Poynting flux. However, ultimately, this results in electric current densities which in a number of small spatial domains are too large to be maintained. These domains are the locations of episodic conversion of electric current energy and the release of energized plasma in the form of ejected plasmoids, particle acceleration and heating, and magnetic turbulence.</p><p id="Par121">These electric circuits are largely force-free inside their magnetically dominated domains, and can be described to a first approximation within the framework of MHD. Yet we underline that it is important to consider the complete electric circuit and not just the force-free part of the magnetic field. While it is well-known that a force-free structure cannot exist on its own and has to be anchored in a non force-free bounding plasma, these boundary conditions are easy to overlook in a magnetic field picture only. When one considers an electric circuit, one automatically includes the voltage source and the resistive regions, which of course are non force-free. Although their relative volumes are minor they do determine the evolution of the system.</p><p id="Par122">Finally, one would like to know to what extent the end products of bulk motion, particle acceleration and heating, and the release of magnetic turbulence come about by the same physical effects in these different objects. With the proviso that we can make in situ observations inside the terrestrial magnetosphere only, while this is not possible in the corona, let alone in a pulsar wind, we conclude that possibly in all three cases one and the same process does play an important role in converting magnetic/current energy into particle acceleration. This is the occurrence of electric fields along the magnetic field whenever the local plasma conditions cannot provide for the electric current dictated by the global circuit. It is clear, however, that ‘common’ reconnection occurs as well next to or in combination with this ‘Generalized Magnetic Reconnection’.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>HUF was supported through NSF grant AGS-1004736.
