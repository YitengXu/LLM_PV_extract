sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been intensively investigated as emerging photovoltaics (PVs) owing to the superior inherent advantages of perovskite as a photo-absorber such as long carrier diffusion length, high defect tolerance, high carrier mobility and high absorption coefficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Another crucial benefit of perovskite material is a feasible solution process to deposit thin film, which allows a cost-effective production of highly efficient PVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. So far, both efficiency and stability of PSCs have been considerably improved, but the scalable fabrication remains a big challenge for the successful commercialization of PSCs. Specifically, the roll-to-roll (R2R) process enables high-throughput, low-cost production of flexible and light-weight PSCs, which will expand the applicability of PSCs into a variety of mobile electronic devices, vehicle- and building-integrated PVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. There have been only a few reports on the R2R production of PSCs so far, and even they are only about partial R2R production or R2R running at laboratory scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In order to realize R2R production of PSCs, uniform, large-area deposition of sequential layers should be achieved. The R2R deposition of charge-transporting layers was already established by many researchers in organic PVs, but R2R deposition of perovskite layers has not yet been fully explored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The R2R deposition of perovskite layers contain three key steps; (1) deposition of lead halide precursor through scalable coating techniques, (2) conversion of wet film of precursor state into supersaturation state through solvent removal, and (3) crystallization through thermal annealing. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Formation of high-quality perovskite layers via antisolvent bathing.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic diagram representing R2R processing of perovskite layer.

Among various scalable coating methods, gravure printing enables a simultaneous deposition and patterning of a desired layer with high resolution at relatively fast speed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The potential of gravure printing for PSCs has been proved by us, successfully demonstrating a fabrication of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) PSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">The conversion of wet film of precursor state into the intermediate phase has been considered as a critical step to realizing large-area, scalable production of perovskite film. The solvent-engineering method has been widely utilized to achieve high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) in a small-area device of PSCs by reaching a supersaturation state via a rapid antisolvent dripping during the spin-coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In general, the dripping process involves the physical wiping of solvents driven by centrifugal forces and solvent extraction by chemical affinity. Therefore, this led to a formation of the supersaturated film from the precursor wet film with the retardation mediator by washing out the excess solvent upon the spin-coating.</p><p id="Par7">The dripping process, however, should be modified to be well-fitted into R2R deposition process of large-area perovskite layers. Various alternative methods have been reported including gas-blowing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, vacuum flash<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, hot-substrate deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and flash infrared annealing (FIRA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, however, they have still several problems to be solved for R2R applications, which are the use of expensive apparatus, questionable reproducibility, or narrow processing window.</p><p id="Par8">In this work, we choose the antisolvent-bathing approach for R2R fabrication. The bathing method is the most analogous method to the dripping with a view of the extraction of excess solvent from precursor wet film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, the bathing method requires more precise control of processing conditions to reach a high level of supersaturation state for inducing rapid crystallization. In particular, formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI<sub>3</sub>) has more complex crystallization behavior with narrow processing window, which makes it more difficult to achieve the high-quality layer via bathing. The bathing method also demands a large amount of solvents, and inevitably discharges the waste solvent. Therefore, antisolvent should meet some criteria such as eco-friendliness and controllable processing window for a practical R2R production at pilot-scale. Several attempts have been made to utilize eco-friendly antisolvents in PSCs, but their usage has been limited only to dripping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In addition, the processing windows of antisolvents have not been yet considered thoroughly, especially for bathing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">As a final step, the thermal annealing is crucial for inducing a highly crystalline perovskite film upon crystal nucleation/growth step. The temperature must be lower than the processing temperature limit of the polymer substrate. Shorter annealing time is also preferred to achieve high throughput.</p><p id="Par10">Herein, we demonstrate R2R-processed flexible PSCs at pilot scale through gravure printing, antisolvent bathing and subsequent annealing process. Tert-butanol (tBuOH) is introduced as an eco-friendly solvent into antisolvent-bathing, thereby generating a highly crystalline and uniform perovskite film with wide processing window. As a result of bathing in tBuOH:EA, we achieve a champion PCE of 23.5% (in reverse scan) from the glass-used device prepared by spin-coating. The gravure printing of FAPbI<sub>3</sub>-based perovskite layers is conducted with aid of wide processing window of tBuOH. The best PCE of 19.1% is achieved in gravure-printed flexible PSCs, which is comparable to the highest PCE of spin-coated flexible PSCs. Full R2R gravure printing of flexible PSCs except for top electrodes is demonstrated at pilot-scale via process optimization to produce a 100-m-long roll. The PSCs fabricated by R2R printed SnO<sub>2</sub>/perovskite exhibit a PCE of 16.7% and 16.5% when N2,N2,N2′,N2′,N7,N7,N7′,N7′-octakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9,9′-spirobi[9H-fluorene]-2,2′,7,7′-tetramine (Spiro-OMeTAD) is spin-coated and shear-coated as HTL, respectively. The fully R2R printed PSCs with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as HTL show the best PCE of 13.8%, which is the highest PCE ever reported for a fully R2R-processed PSCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Comparison of various eco-friendly antisolvents</title><p id="Par11">In this work, tBuOH is newly suggested as an eco-friendly antisolvent. Various antisolvents are compared under various safety criteria in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Common antisolvents widely used for fabricating high-quality perovskite layers are as follows; diethyl ether (DEE), chlorobenzene (CB), chloroform (CF), and toluene (Tol). However, all of them are harmful to human health. We selected eco-friendly alternative antisolvents, such as alcohols or esters, or anisole. Specifically, ethanol (EtOH) and 2-propanol (IPA) as normal-alkyl alcohols, ethyl acetate (EA) as an ester, and anisole as an aromatic were chosen. We also suggested an antisolvent, tBuOH, a tert-alkyl alcohol, which is eco-friendly and has a polarity between those of normal-alkyl alcohols and esters, thereby being expected to show different behavior during antisolvent bathing. Since tBuOH has a melting point of around 30 °C, we added a small amount of EA to ensure the liquid state of the antisolvent at room temperature. DEE was also selected as a reference.</p><p id="Par12">The time evolutions in appearance and morphology of as-prepared films of FAPbI<sub>3</sub> after bathing using various antisolvents were investigated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). As can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, prolonged bathing in the antisolvents except for tBuOH:EA gives rise to a dark wine-red appearance to the film after only a few seconds. This indicates that a nucleation/growth for the generation of perovskite phase occurs at the same time during the antisolvent-bathing process at room temperature. In addition, specific irregular stains with inhomogeneity are found on the film surface. Such characteristic pattern on the intermediate film is directly transferred to the final film, and the darker intermediate film has a hazy appearance after annealing. The bathing time in these antisolvents should be very short at about 1–2 s, so as to reduce haziness on the surface, and the films do not seem uniform even under that condition. In the case of tBuOH:EA, however, intermediate films look uniform in appearance and only become slightly darker as time goes on. The final perovskite film obtained by bathing in tBuOH:EA looks uniform and consistent appearance irrespective of the bathing time.</p><p id="Par13">We attempted to reveal the origins of the different behaviors upon bathing by directly mixing a precursor solution with the antisolvents (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, and Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). As not expected for the bathing method, it was found that DEE is not effective in extracting DMF and DMSO. EA and anisole can extract the solvents, but they also disperse some of the FAPbI<sub>3</sub>, leading to inhomogeneity in the intermediate film with irregular stains and haziness after bathing. It is obvious that IPA partially dissolves FAI while extracting PbI<sub>2</sub>-DMSO from FAPbI<sub>3</sub> solution (See Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). It is worth noting that tBuOH:EA can extract DMF and excess DMSO without dispersing FAPbI<sub>3</sub> or dissolving FAI in the solution. This aspect explains the homogeneous, uniform FAPbI<sub>3</sub> films made using tBuOH:EA. The strong chemical interaction of tBuOH:EA with DMF and DMSO was also confirmed by the shift of the Fourier-transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectra (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Characterization of perovskite layers formed by bathing in various antisolvent.</title><p><bold>a</bold> XRD spectra of perovskite films obtained by bathing in various antisolvents. <bold>b</bold> SEM image of the perovskite film made by bathing in tBuOH:EA. <bold>c</bold> Grain size distribution curves for perovskite films fabricated with various antisolvents. <bold>d</bold> Champion PCE of PSCs fabricated by bathing in various antisolvents.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2020_18940_Fig2_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par14">FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film fabricated by using tBuOH:EA as antisolvent looks uniform and highly crystalline with no trace of PbI<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). FAPbI<sub>3</sub> films made using other alcohols have distinct peak at around 12.5°, indicating the generation of PbI<sub>2</sub>. It was probably due to the partial dissolution of FAI. FAPbI<sub>3</sub> prepared by using DEE, EA, anisole, and tBuOH:EA showed no peaks of PbI<sub>2</sub>; in particular, for tBuOH:EA, the film had the highest crystallinity among all the samples.</p><p id="Par15">To gain into more insight of the alkyl effect of alcohol derivatives as antisolvent, we selected n-butyl alcohol (nBuOH) and t-pentyl alcohol (tPeOH) for comparison with tBuOH. nBuOH has similar viscosity to tBuOH while tPeOH has similar polarity to tBuOH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>, and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).

The irregular stains are observed on the surface and a trace of PbI<sub>2</sub> is also found from XRD pattern<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. In contrast, the quality and the appearance of the film fabricated using tPeOH looks entirely consistent with that using tBuOH:EA. The role of the antisolvent is to extract the retardation mediator and the excess processing solvent without dissolving the perovskite precursors from the wet film. It is elucidated from this result that the polarity of the antisolvent should be considered to ensure a good quality film with uniform and consistent morphology even for a long bathing time.</p><p id="Par16">The fabricated film using tBuOH:EA has a smooth morphology with a large grain size of ~1 μm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). In the case of EtOH and anisole, the films have a poor surface coverage with a relatively rough surface (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). In contrast, in the case of tPeOH, nBuOH, EA, and IPA, the films exhibit a full surface coverage without the pinholes. The sizes of grains were measured using ImageJ software; results were averaged over 110 grains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). The average grain size of FAPbI<sub>3</sub> fabricated using tBuOH:EA is 955 ± 330 nm, which is much larger than that of FAPbI<sub>3</sub> obtained from the other solvents. (791 ± 319, 777 ± 267, 726 ± 221, and 636 ± 238 nm from tPeOH, nBuOH, EA, and IPA, respectively).</p><p id="Par17">We have investigated fluorescent lifetime images (FLIM) and their corresponding time-resolved photoluminescent (TRPL) spectra (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). From FLIM images, the distribution of the PL lifetimes in the entire area for the film processed with tBuOH:EA is much more even as compared to that with DEE. Its average PL lifetime is found to be 101 ns, which is higher than those of the films processed with DEE and EA (60 and 53 ns, respectively). This can support a formation of a highly crystalline and defect-less perovskite film with a good uniformity after the treatment with tBuOH:EA. The champion PCE of tBuOH:EA-used PSCs is 21.7%, which is the highest among PSCs treated with various antisolvents (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). The photovoltaic parameters of the champion PCE of PSCs treated with various antisolvents are summarized in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>. The PCE values of PSCs processed with other antisolvents except for DEE and anisole are around 20%. In particular, a low PCE of 9.2% for the device fabricated using anisole is mainly attributed to a poor morphology of the perovskite film (as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Processing window of new antisolvent and device performances</title><p id="Par18">As expected from the bathing results of Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, a wide processing-time window could be anticipated when tBuOH:EA is used for the antisolvent bathing. To verify this, we design the modified device fabrication by mimicking R2R process of a perovskite film as follows; sequential procedures of spin-coating of precursor, stopping at a desired time, subsequent antisolvent bathing, air blowing, and annealing.</p><p id="Par19">Firstly, the processing tolerance for the amount of DMSO was investigated. The amount of DMSO in the precursor solution is a critical factor determining the amount of solvents left in the precursor wet film after deposition, because DMSO has a high boiling point and strong affinity to perovskite precursors. Adjusting the amount of DMSO can alter the maximum duration before unwanted and rapid phase conversion begins, thereby allowing optimal control of the duration between printing and bathing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The use of higher amount of DMSO than 1 equivalent to FAPbI<sub>3</sub> in the perovskite precursor solution affords uneven and hazy perovskite films when other common antisolvents, e.g., EA and DEE are used (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). In the case of tBuOH:EA, however, the perovskite film looks very uniform without any haziness regardless of the amount of DMSO, from 0.7 to 2 equivalent molar amount to FAPbI<sub>3</sub>. This tendency is also confirmed in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). The perovskite films made by tBuOH:EA looked uniform and smooth regardless of the amount of DMSO, while the film made by EA or DEE with an amount of DMSO &gt;1 showed a very rough and non-uniform morphology.</p><p id="Par20">Accordingly, PSCs processed by tBuOH:EA maintain their PCE values with an increasing amount of DMSO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). PSCs made using other antisolvents exhibit a huge drop of PCE with increasing amount of DMSO except for tPeOH which has a tendency identical to that of tBuOH. The amount of solvent left in the wet film can be also controlled by adjusting the spin-coating duration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). As expected, a longer spin-coating time can result in a larger amount of the solvent evaporation during the spin-coating. For the devices using tBuOH:EA, high average efficiencies above 20% are found irrespective of the spin-coating duration. Furthermore, it is noted that varying the bathing time (within 60 s) in the antisolvent of tBuOH:EA also does not affect the device performance significantly (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The wide processing window of tBuOH:EA is also confirmed by uniform morphology of perovskite layer fabricated upon various operation conditions (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Processing window of perovskite formation processes via antisolvent bathing and champion device performance.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Average (bar) and champion PCE (circle) of PSCs made by bathing in antisolvents according to amounts of DMSO in the precursor solution with respect to the amount of perovskite.

The champion PCE of rigid, planar PSCs made on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate and using SnO<sub>2</sub> as an electron-transporting layer (ETL) is 22.2% in reverse scan, and 21.95% on average (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Solution shear-coating of Spiro-OMeTAD was also applied to the R2R-processed perovskite, resulting in a device with 16.5% of PCE, which value is almost the same to that from spin-coated HTL. We also attempted to apply gravure printing to deposit Spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT as a HTM on the top of R2R gravure-printed SnO<sub>2</sub>/(FAPbI<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.95</sub>(MAPbBr<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.05,</sub> which resulted in slightly lower performance for Spiro-OMeTAD than other processing methods (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Fully R2R gravure-printed PSCs showed PCE of 13.8% from scan in reverse direction, and 13.55% on average when P3HT was used as HTL. This is the highest PCE ever reported for fully R2R-processed PSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Note that the P3HT-based devices fabricated by table-top or R2R gravure printing showed almost identical efficiencies, revealing the effectiveness of R2R gravure-printing at a pilot scale (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Average PCE from fully R2R-processed devices was 12.4%, with relatively narrow distribution, which illustrates the reliable production of PSCs by sequential R2R gravure printing (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>). The stability of the fully R2R-processsed PSCs was investigated by fabrication of the PSCs from the different part of the as-prepared roll (PET/ITO/SnO<sub>2</sub>/(FAPbI<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.95</sub>(MAPbBr<sub>3</sub>)<sub>0.05</sub>/P3HT) for every few days, by randomly cutting into sheets and evaporating Au electrodes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22</xref>). The PSCs made after almost 40 days from the production of the roll showed similar levels of PCE, indicating the high storage stability and reliability of the PSCs made by R2R gravure printing and the process itself. The large-area applicability and reliability of the R2R gravure printing was confirmed by a slight decrease in PCE of large-area (1 cm<sup>2</sup>) devices compared to that of the smaller devices (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">23</xref>). We believe that the device performance for fully R2R-processed PSCs would be obviously enhanced by incorporation of new HTL suitable for R2R process. Our approach using eco-friendly antisolvent bathing with a wide processing window can be universally applied into gravure-printed flexible PSCs at lab &amp; pilot-scale, thus offering an effective way toward R2R fabrication of flexible PSCs with high efficiency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par31">In conclusion, we demonstrated R2R-processed flexible PSCs at pilot scale through gravure-printing, antisolvent bathing, and subsequent annealing process. As an eco-friendly anti-solvent, we choose tert-butanol (tBuOH), which was used for antisolvent-bathing. The mixed co-solvent of tBuOH:EA offers a formation of a highly crystalline and uniform perovskite film with wide processing window. As a result of antisolvent-bathing, we achieved a champion PCE of 23.5% (in reverse scan) from the glass-used spin-coated device. The gravure printing of FAPbI<sub>3</sub>-based perovskite layers was conducted and the best PCE of 19.1% was achieved in gravure-printed flexible PSCs, which is one of the highest PCE of flexible PSCs to the best of our knowledge. As an extended work, we attempted to fabricate full R2R gravure printing of flexible PSCs except for top electrodes at a pilot-scale via process optimization to successfully demonstrate a manufacturing of 100-meter-long roll and a high PCE exceeding 16% and 13%, when Spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT was used as HTL, respectively. We believe that this work will pave a new way for high throughput, low-cost production of flexible PSCs at larger scale via R2R processes in the near future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="Par32">For perovskite layer, lead (II) iodide (99.999%, ultra dry) from Alfa Aesar, lead (II) bromide (perovskite precursor grade) from TCI, formamidinium iodide (FAI, Greatcell Solar), methylammonium iodide (MAI, Greatcell Solar), methylammonium bromide (MABr, Greatcell Solar) and methylamine hydrochloride (≥98%, MACl, Sigma-Aldrich)) were used.

The lifetime measurements were performed at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Daegu Center, Korea. A single-mode pulsed diode laser (470 nm with a pulse width of ~30 ps) was used as an excitation source. A dichroic mirror (490 DCXR, AHF), a 75 μm pinhole, and a single-photon avalanche diode (PDM series, MPD) were used to collect emission from the samples. Time-correlated single-photon counting technique was used to count emission photons.
