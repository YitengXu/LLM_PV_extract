Cyanobacterial photobiotransformations utilize photosynthetic electrons to form reducing equivalents, such as NADPH-to-fuel biocatalytic reactions.

No increase in both effective photosynthetic yields of Photosystem II and Photosystem I was found upon D-Glucose addition. However, we observed higher NAD(P)H fluorescence when D-Glucose was supplemented, suggesting increased glycolytic activity.

photosynthetic water splitting and carbon dioxide fixation for the sustainable synthesis of chemicals and biofuels and could greatly alleviate land-use conflicts associated with the provision of the raw materials for a circular bioeconomy. Furthermore, cyanobacteria can be also applied for the catalytic upgrading and synthesis of high-value chemicals. Yet, biomass productivity and achievable space–time-yields have been too low for the successful production of biofuels and other bioproducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Current processes use approximately half of the fixed carbon for the production of organic molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This shows to which extent the already existing production systems are pushing the photosynthetic metabolism to its limits. To assess the metabolic boundaries of an electron-consuming process in cyanobacteria, we investigated a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)—or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-dependent photobiocatalytic reaction in the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter <italic>Synechocystis</italic> or Syn). Photobiocatalysis has emerged as an interface between renewable energy and chemical synthesis. While light-driven enzymatic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and the coupling of photocatalysts with enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] expand the catalytic scope of biocatalysis, the photobiocatalytic cofactor regeneration in cell-free [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] or cellular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] systems has the potential to increase the efficiency of biocatalytic redox reactions. Current processes for the recycling of redox cofactors rely on auxiliary organic co-substrates, such as isopropanol or glucose. The oxidation of these co-substrates is highly problematic in terms of the atom economy of the process: one of the 12 principles of green chemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The use of photosynthetic water-splitting as an electron source completely solves this problem and, additionally, avoids the formation of side-products such as acetone whose separation requires additional energy and cost. Whole cell photobiotransformations have been achieved by the expression of the genes of several oxidoreductases in cyanobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] with activities in the range of 26–60 µmol min<sup>−1</sup> g<sub>DCW</sub><sup>−1</sup> (or U g<sub>DCW</sub><sup>−1</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. With up to 100–120 U g<sub>DCW</sub><sup>−1</sup><sub>,</sub> the highest rates have been obtained so far in the stereoselective reduction of activated C=C double bonds by the ene-reductase YqjM from <italic>B. subtilis</italic> in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The major limitation of photosynthetic production system is light penetration in dense cultures leading to the formation of photosynthetically inactive ‘dark zone’ and the loss of productivity. This is especially true in reactions utilizing high optical densities where the surface layers are already light-saturated while the inner layers are light-limited. Even though modern photobioreactors using internal illumination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and other geometries with short light pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] improve light supply and alleviate this to some extent, previous work has shown that whole cell cyanobacterial biotransformations cannot be performed with cell densities above a few grams per liter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This makes it imperative to increase the enzyme’s specific activity in order to achieve competitive volumetric productivities and to identify potential bottlenecks for cell productivity.</p><p id="Par28">Previously, we have shown that cyanobacterial photobiotransformation is limited by the supply of the reduced NADPH cofactor. Although the ene-reductase accepts NADH, it prefers NADPH as the main electron source. Stopped-flow kinetic measurements showed that in the stereoselective conversion of prochiral 2-methylmaleimide <bold>1a</bold> to <italic>R</italic>-2-methylsuccinimide <bold>1b,</bold> the reduction of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) cofactor by the nicotinamide cofactor is the limiting step in the mechanism of YqjM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The observed rates in darkness spurred our interest to which extent glycolytic pathways contribute to the observed specific activity and might increase reaction rates.</p><p id="Par29">Several photosynthetic organisms possess the ability to metabolise exogenous sources of organic carbon in dark (heterotrophy) or under light (mixotrophy). Mixotrophic culture under light and with a reduced carbon source in the medium leads to the co-action of light-dependent pathways and organic carbon metabolism and has been used to increase biomass accumulation and bioproduct yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The mixotrophic approach is usually justified when productivity and robustness of manufacturing should be significantly increased and when the approval of a pharmaceutical or nutraceutical product is at stake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In this regard, <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is able to natively switch from photoautotrophy to mixotrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which significantly enhances its growth. Additionally, the cyanobacterial metabolism has a flexible response to additional electron demands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Three pathways have been described to oxidize carbohydrates: (i) glycolysis, the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway (EMP); (ii) the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (OPPp), which is highly active in cyanobacteria and whose oxidative part provides reduced NADPH; (iii) the Entner–Doudoroff pathway (ED), whose presence in cyanobacteria and plant plastids was only recently shown. The oxidation of carbohydrates is physiologically significant especially in day–night cycles, under mixotrophic and also under autotrophic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Under light, the OPPp generates two molecules of NADPH per molecule of glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The OPPp plays a dominant role in the catabolism of D-Glucose (D-Glu) and glycogen in mixotrophic and heterotrophic conditions and the increase of its intermediates at the steady state levels has been noted in mixotrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Via the EMP, two ATP and two NADH molecules are formed per molecule of glucose. On the other hand, when D-Glu is metabolized via the ED, only one of each compounds (i.e. ATP, NADH and NADPH) are produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Moreover, the NADH generated in later catabolic steps (such as the oxidation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and the reactions of the tricarboxylic acid cycle) can be used for NADP<sup>+</sup>-reduction via the pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase complex PntAB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The EMP seems to be beneficial in terms of energy, since it has a higher ATP yield than ED and OPPp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Unlike the OPPp, the oxidative tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle has low efficiency in NADPH generation in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>. The OPPp dehydrogenase activity is repressed as the flow of the oxidative TCA cycle increases, avoiding NADPH overproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. While mixotrophic cultures are well-investigated, little is known about the influence of mixotrophic conditions on the reaction rate of heterologous redox reactions that represents an additional electron sink for the photosynthetic cell and are thus a representative for electron-consuming biosynthetic pathways. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the C=C reduction catalysed by YqjM in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> as well as possible sources of reductants in photosynthetic microorganisms. To investigate a possible contribution of light-dependent and independent pathways on the photobiotransformation, we studied the effect of D-Glu addition on the reaction rate of the NAD(P)H-dependent, YqjM-catalyzed ene-reduction in the D-Glu-tolerant strain <italic>Synechocystis</italic> using various substrates. It should be noted that the enzymes of these glycolytic pathways are produced to some extent under photoautotrophic conditions, which made us confident that addition of D-Glu to a photobiotransformation should have an accelerating effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Moreover, we also investigated the applicability of D-Glu addition in a scalable reaction system utilizing a Bubble Column Reactor (BCR) internally illuminated by Wireless Light Emitters (WLE).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>A</bold>) C=C reduction catalysed by recombinant ene-reductase YqjM in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>; (<bold>B</bold>) Two possible sources of reductants in photosynthetic microorganisms and their use in intracellular cofactor recycling</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13068_2022_2237_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Glucose supplementation enhances production rates of <italic>Synechocystis</italic></title><p id="Par30">To verify a possible contribution of glycolytic pathways to whole-cell biotransformations, we determined the rates of the same enzymatic ene-reduction with and without D-Glu under light and darkness. <italic>Synechocystis</italic> cells expressing the <italic>yqjM</italic> gene under the control of the strong promoter, P<sub><italic>cpcB</italic></sub> (Syn::P<sub><italic>cpcB</italic></sub>YqjM), were cultivated under photoautotrophic conditions (that is, in the absence of D-Glu), harvested in the exponential phase (OD<sub>750</sub> = 1–2) and then applied for whole-cell photobiotransformations. In previous works, a relatively high light intensity of approximately 150–200 µmol photons m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] was identified to yield the highest specific activities in whole-cell biotransformations. Therefore, this light intensity was selected for the biotransformations.

These findings indicate strong and rapid consumption of photosynthetically generated NAD(P)H by YqjM, supporting the idea of NAD(P)H availability as the limiting factor to YqjM activity. Addition of D-Glu causes a slow upward drift in the NAD(P)H fluorescence signal, which may be explained by NADH and NADPH supplied by increased glycolytic and OPPp activity, respectively. This could explain higher specific biotransformation rates (and yields) obtained in the presence of D-Glu.

Oxidoreductases expressed in cyanobacteria represent a strong electron drain which allows us to investigate how much of the electrons (i.e. originating from the photosynthetic electron transport chain) can be deviated towards heterologous biotechnological processes, ranging from the production of high-value products to bulk chemicals and even biofuels.

This finding shows that glycolytic pathways in cyanobacteria can sustain heterologous NAD(P)H-consuming redox reactions, albeit at lower rates than under light. In this work, the stimulating effect of D-Glu addition was observed at different cell densities and was independent from the light intensity during the cultivation and the choice of the substrate. This demonstrates that the biotransformation can be supplied with electrons originating from glycolytic pathways. Addition of D-Glu to the reaction under light led to a 50% increase of the rate at a cell dry weight of 0.6 g L<sup>−1</sup>.

We hypothesize that under the photoautotrophic conditions, the reaction is electron-limited, which is mitigated by the metabolized D-Glu. These findings are in line with the observation that whole-cell biotransformations led to a decrease of intracellular NAD(P)H levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Addition of D-Glu may increase the amount of NADH and NADPH available to YqjM, but the extra electrons are likely derived from glycolysis and OPPp.

It should be mentioned that <bold>1a</bold> is a thiol-reactive compound that potentially disturbs the thiol-based regulatory mechanisms in the cell, such as the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems. Indeed, glycolysis, the TCA cycle, the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle (CBB), and OPPp, all of which profoundly affect the NADPH/NADH metabolism, are likely subject to light-dependent redox regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

Several factors are involved upon the addition of D-Glu. The breakdown of storage compounds may be to some extent light dependent.

These works provide proof-of-concept, but also show that the rates obtained in photoautotrophic microorganisms are not higher than rates obtained in heterotrophs. This raises the question on how cyanobacteria might be engineered to sustain processes for the production of chemicals and biofuels with much higher electron consumption. In this context, some recent works indicate the possibility to engineer the cyanobacterial metabolism for an increased electron supply: deletion of flavodiiron proteins (FDPs) as competing electron sinks increased the specific activities of ene-reductions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and Baeyer–Villiger oxidations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>.

The higher activity can be attributed to an increase of NAD(P)H. As glycolytic pathways lead to the reduction of NADPH and NADH, and the enzyme accepts electrons from both nicotinamide cofactors, it is not possible to assign the activity increase to either one of them. A further increase of the yields of cyanobacterial processes thus requires a substantial improvement by cell engineering. Nevertheless, several recent works demonstrated the feasibility of such an optimization, which opens an avenue toward much higher productivity in the photosynthetic production of biofuels and bioproducts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>General</title><p id="Par48">The substrate, <bold>1a</bold> has been synthesized as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].
