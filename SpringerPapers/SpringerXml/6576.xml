id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par30">Today more than ever before, massive climate change such as global warming is the main issue that is often highlighted by the world communities. The rapidness of sea ice melting and the rise of sea level which resulted from global warming are currently happening in our ecology. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the average global temperature is forecasted to rise by as much as 10.4Â° F over the next century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The scientists believe that the rise of global temperature is largely due to the rapid accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) produced by human activities. In addition, the transportation sector has contributed in almost 14% of the 2010 total global GHG emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In fact, the increase in the number of vehicles fuelled with petroleum-based fuel also results in the depletion of fossil fuel reserves. Approximately 50% of the total fossil fuel consumption relates to the energy needs of the transport sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These fossil fuels are slowly becoming obsolete and anticipated to scarce within the next decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">With regard to these problems, numerous alternative fuels have been discovered to replace fossil fuels, while the demand for energy source will continue to increase day by day. In view of the current urgency plan to reduce the net GHG emissions in transportation, biofuels are the most promising alternative that have been studied to replace fossil fuels to be utilized as the whole transportation energy supply system, besides solar and fuel cell. The biofuel industry is continuously coming up with various sources, utilizing vegetation, biomass as well as micro-organisms, which can be leveraged for biodiesel and bioethanol production for transportation system. Southeast Asia countries, such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam, are endowed with plenty of natural resources, e.g. palm oil, rice husk, etc. which could significantly provide a continuous supply of biofuels to meet the worldâs energy demand. However, the lack of technical expertise, government policies and technology experience in this region will provide challenges in strengthening the biofuels sector. Therefore, it is important for these countries to identify the impending and subsequent challenges to stay in the forefront of sustainable development.</p><p id="Par32">Latin America countries, e.g. Brazil and Colombia, are the world-class biofuel producer, which has a vast experience in producing bioethanol from sugarcane as an alternative liquid biofuel widely since the 1970s. The supportive government policies and technological advances have led the countries to become the forefront in the worldâs biofuel sectors and become a policy model to neighbouring countries in Latin America. The growing biofuel market in the region is mainly triggered by the success of the Brazilian bioethanol production for both domestic market and export. National policies, agricultural structures and practices, labour conditions, environmental aspects, land use competition and strategies on biofuels and the enforcement of existing laws are several important factors which influence the sustainability of biofuels in the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">In this study, Colombia has been chosen for this review based on the fact that there is a little information available stated that its palm biodiesel industry has been considered as the main palm oil producer in Latin America region and the pioneer of bioethanol industry. Therefore, Colombia serves as an ideal comparative case for Malaysia in terms of biodiesel development. A comprehensive review is studied extensively to discuss the scenario of biofuel implementation in transportation sector towards sustainable development in both respective nations. This review also will help to point out several opportunities for international collaboration amongst the nations towards achieving the global quest for a sustainable development in the transportation sector.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Biofuel as an Alternative Fuel</title><p id="Par34">Biofuels offer many priorities, including renewability, biodegradability, sustainability and carbon neutrality. Therefore, it holds great promise to solve environment-related problems, i.e. greenhouse effect as well as air pollution. The two most common liquid biofuels are bioethanol and biodiesel, which are widely used as replacements to hydrocarbon transportation fuels like gasoline and diesel, respectively. Biofuels are also available in other forms, i.e. solid fuel (e.g. bio-char) and gas fuel (e.g. hydrogen and methane). The utilization of biofuels as an alternative fuel is not a new concept as long as there are vehicles on the road. Samuel Morely has developed an engine fuelled with ethanol in 1826 and Henry Ford built a Model T engine to run on ethanol in 1908 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Ethanol is the most widely used biofuel today for gasoline engine. Conventional ethanol (first generation), e.g. starch and sucrose-rich materials, can be produced via alcoholic fermentation. Meanwhile, advanced ethanol (second generation) is produced from lignocellulosic material, e.g. agricultural waste undergoes additional pre-treatment process before it is hydrolysed and fermented into ethanol. Besides that, ethanol can be used in its pure form (neat), as a blend with gasoline or as a fuel for fuel cells. Brazil and the USA together are accounted for 85% of the worldâs total fuel ethanol production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In Brazil, ethanol derived from sugar cane claims 40% of the light fuel market and has contributed the country to end its dependence on imported oil. On the other hand, biodiesel became popular as the replacement to petroleum-based diesel in transportation. The biodiesel blend was introduced worldwide for more than 60 countries including Indonesia (B20), the USA (up to B10 in some states), Colombia (B2-B10), Argentina (B10), Brazil (B10), France (B8) and Malaysia (B10). Biodiesel is a vegetable oilâ or animal fatâbased diesel fuel consisting of long-chain alkyl (methyl, ethyl or propyl) esters. Biodiesel can be derived from edible oils (palm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], soybean [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], corn and sunflower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]), non-edible oils (<italic>Jatropha curcas, Calophyllum inophyllum, Ceiba pentandra</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and <italic>Mahua</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]), algae oils (<italic>Chlorella</italic>, spirulina and pond water algae) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], waste vegetable oils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and animal fats (tallow, lard, yellow grease and chicken fat) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">However, the extensive utilization of food-based crops for biofuel production has attracted some criticisms. The global food crisis occurred very badly from 2007 to 2008 due to the failure of the world food system to preserve food security. It was claimed that the conversion of these food crops to biofuel would significantly increase the food prices, consequently affecting the lives of the poor, especially in developing countries. The oil crops such as palm oil, soybean, rapeseed, sunflower and peanut are renewable sources of oils and fats that can be used either as edible foodstuffs or as industrial feedstocks. Malaysia as the main palm oil producer is not spared from this negative criticism as the palm oil has fallen trap into this debate too. Palm oil is indeed the largest vegetable oil, by dominating more than a quarter of the total global oil and fat production, and perceived as the most promising for biodiesel feedstocks. Nonetheless, the extensive replacement of rapeseed and corn oil as biofuel feedstocks in Europe and the USA, respectively, is the main reason behind the shortage of soybean and rapeseed as the source of oils and fats in the world market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. As we will now see, palm oil is far more efficient than all other oil crops in terms of oil yield, land usage and asset deployment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This efficiency is reflected in the pricing of palm oil, which is almost invariably considerably cheaper than its rivals. Therefore, palm oil has been proven the most sustainable and economically feasible source of food and biofuel in the world market, thus satisfying both demands simultaneously rather than engaging in priority debate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Energy Supply in Malaysian and Colombian Transportation Sector</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Malaysia</title><p id="Par36">Malaysia is situated within Southeast Asia and has two distinct regions. The western region includes the Peninsular Malaysia, while the eastern region is where Sabah and Sarawak are located. It has a total landmass of 330,803 km<sup>2</sup> and consists of 13 states and three federal territories. Malaysia is the fourth largest economy and the second largest oil and natural gas producer in Southeast Asia. Therefore, energy industry is the most important sector of Malaysiaâs growth economy which accounted approximately 20% of the total growth domestic product (GDP) in the recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Malaysiaâs economy has been fuelled by its energy resources, both renewable and non-renewable, and rapid development across the country. Prior to that, Malaysia has spent heavily in refining activities by gearing up its capacity to become a regional oil and natural gas storage, trading and development hub that can compete within Asia. To date, Malaysia has six refineries with a capacity of about 596,700 barrels per day (b/d) and is currently developing a new refinery, Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex in Johor, with a capacity of 300,000 b/d as a part of Malaysiaâs desire to compete with the oil refinery and storage hub in Singapore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">Malaysia is focusing on securing energy by diversifying energy supply portfolio as part of the countryâs economic transformation program to leverage its useful resources to become Asiaâs top energy players by 2020. Natural gas and petroleum as well as other liquids are the main energy sources in the country with their share of 41 and 33%, respectively, in 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The government emphasizes fuel diversification through investments in renewable energy, i.e. biodiesel, solar, biomass and biogas, to sustain the economic growth and heavy reliance on petroleum and natural gas. Besides that, the transportation sector is the largest energy consumer in 2016 with its share of 42% from the final energy consumption to register at 24,004 ktoe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, the performance of the transportation sector declined in 2015 by 3.7% from the previous year due to the economy slowdown during that respective year. In fact, according to the Malaysian Automotive Association (MAA), the sales of new vehicles in Malaysian market in 2016 dropped from 666,674 units to 580,124 units in 2015. The sales dropped further to 576,635 units in year 2017. This is due to the depreciation of Malaysian ringgit against US dollar, high living cost, higher cost of newer vehicles and difficulties to receive loans. Gasoline-powered engines such as motorcycles, cars, light trucks and boats are the dominant vehicles in Malaysia, which accounted about 80% of the market sales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Meanwhile, diesel-powered engines such as pick-ups, buses and trucks are slowly growing in the country. In fact, the total gasoline and diesel utilization increased tremendously from 2009 to 2017, with values of 3622 to 7686 million litres and 3568 to 5712 million litres, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Colombia</title><p id="Par38">The Republic of Colombia is situated in the northwest of South America, with territories in Central America. It has a total landmass of 1,141,748 km<sup>2</sup> and comprises 32 departments, with the capital in Bogota. Colombia is the second largest economy in Middle America and the fourth largest economy in Latin America. The country has experienced a historic economic boom over the last decades; in fact, it was the Latin Americaâs fifth largest economy in 1990 and it became the fourth in Latin America by 2015. Colombia is a country gifted with numerous fossil fuels and natural resources, reflected in an energy matrix rich in petroleum reserves, natural gas reserves, coal reserves and extensive hydroelectric resources. Oil is the mainÂ source for Colombiaâs total energy consumption in 2017 with its share of 39%, followed by hydroelectric power, natural gas and coal with their shares of 30, 20 and 9%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The oil production increased vigorously in 2007 to 2013 due to the increase in new exploration and development, spurred by new reforms in energy sector regulatory by 2003. As evidence, Colombia has produced more than one million b/d of petroleum and other liquids in 2015, with an average increase of 11% from 2008. The country has utilized 293,000 b/d; the rest is exported to foreign countries, mainly to the USA with total exports of 330,000 b/d in 2017. Colombiaâs total petroleum and other liquids production is continuously declining in the following 2 years, with an average production of 879,000 b/d in 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Similar to Malaysia, transportation sector is the largest energy consumer in Colombia with its share of 45% from the final energy consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition, the sector has emerged as one of the driving forces of the Colombian economy, which contributed 7% of the total GDP in Colombia in 2017. As of 2015, road transport is the most preferred transport mode for passenger movement in Colombia with its share of 84.4%, followed by air, rail and maritime with their shares of 15.2, 0.3 and 0.1%, respectively. For cargo transportations, road and maritime are the most preferred transport modes with shares of 46.3 and 37.1%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. According to Unit of Mining and Energy Planning (UPME) of MME, demands for diesel and gasoline will rise for the next 10 years mainly due to the growth of Colombian economy.

In the 1960s, the cultivation of palm oil rapidly increased under the Malaysian governmentâs agricultural diversification program, which aims to diversify its agricultural land whilst reducing the countryâs economic dependency on rubber and tin. The government also introduced land settlement schemes for planting oil palm in the late 1960s to eradicate poverty for the landless farmers and smallholders. The total planted area of Malaysia palm oil crops increased gradually from 2009 to 2018, from 4.6 to 5.85 million hectares, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

The global production of palm oil is predominantly dominated by Indonesia and Malaysia, which together supply about 84% of the total palm oil. This is followed by Thailand, Colombia and Nigeria with small shares of 4, 2 and 1%, respectively. Based on the consumption, the largest consumers of palm oil are India, the European Union and China with nearly 50% of the total world exports.</p><p id="Par44">The Malaysian government intended to promote palm oil production and the utilization of palm-derived biodiesel especially in transportation and industrial sector under Malaysiaâs National Biofuel Policy 2006 (NBP).

A significant growth of palm oil production is projected with 2.3 million tons in the year 2028 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In terms of consumption, Malaysiaâs domestic consumption made up only a fraction of its total palm oil output, which is around 3.7 million metric tons; thus, the industry easily met the local oil and fat demands, leading to the excess being exported. Based on the production in 2018, more than 84% of the total CPO was exported to several countries such as India (15.2%), EU (11.6%), China (11.3%), Pakistan (7%) and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

However, the production of biodiesel in Malaysia is significantly low as the total palm biodiesel production in 2017 only produce 40% of its full annual capacity which is 2.34 billion litres.

The study shows that feedstock cost has the largest share which accounts for 79% of the total production cost. Sensitivity analysis results also indicated that the variation in feedstock price will significantly affect the life cycle cost for biodiesel production. An increase of $0.10/kg of crude palm oil will cause a $0.05/L rise in the production cost.

The B7 biodiesel blend was then fully implemented throughout the country to replace the former B5 blend in 2015. To date, Malaysia has rolled out B10 mandate in February 2019 for the transportation sector while introducing B7 mandate for industrial sector in July 2019. This implementation will increase the local consumption of the palm oil harvested as well as reduce surplus in the global market.

The Colombian biofuel policy aims to support additional revenue stream for the sugarcane and palm oil industries, diversify sources of the energy by reducing its dependency on fossil fuels and introduce a clean and environmentally friendly fuel to reduce GHG emissions. Biofuel initiative was launched in Colombia with the establishment of Law 693 of 2001 for ethanol and Law 939 of 2004 for biodiesel. The first implementation of palm biodiesel in Colombia was begun in 2007, with an initial mandatory blend of 2% (B2) in some regions of the country. However, the B2 mandate is still being implemented in three border departments due to some problems with cross-border smuggling issue. On February 2017, the biodiesel blend mandate has increased from B9 to B10 in Bogota as well as the central and eastern region, by considering Colombiaâs environment commitments and to increase biodiesel plants production capacity. The biodiesel blending mandate in Colombia is occasionally being changed across the country. This is because the Colombian government changes their mandate to accommodate domestic industry rather than satisfying blending mandate goals. In March 2018, the Colombian government has raised the mandated biofuelsâ blend limit in gasoline and diesel, in a bid to tackle rising metropolitan cities pollution, contribute to Colombiaâs climate change commitments under the 2015 Paris Climate Conference (COP21), and resolve oversupply issue that threaten to disrupt biodiesel production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p id="Par62">The Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) is responsible to regulate Colombiaâs biofuel policy.

Recently, the European Parliament (EP) has been reported to be in the process of banning the utilization of palm oil for biofuel in 2020, while Britain and Iceland will stop to use this commodity in their retail markets. After receiving protest from the Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries (CPOPC), the EP agreed to phase out the palm biodiesel starting from 2020 to 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The palm has been claimed as unsustainable crop by palm oil competitors. They concern that the deforestation of million-year-old tropical forest for the utilization of palm cultivation will lead to the extinction of wildlife species such as orangutan, Sumatran tiger, and elephant as well as increase GHG emissions.</p><p id="Par66">As one of the worldâs biggest palm oil producers and exporters, Malaysia is committed to play a key role to ensure that the palm commodity remains sustainable and competitive fuel replacement for the global markets. Palm oil is a viable option to reduce the countryâs dependency on fossil fuels and it brings much benefits to the energy and transportation activities. It is an important fact that only 10% of palm oil production in Malaysia currently ends up towards non-food applications and the remaining are applied into food applications. Therefore, biofuel industry cannot be held solely responsible for the deforestation. On top of that, the Malaysian government committed to preserve half of Malaysiaâs total land areas for its forest to limit the expansion of the palm oil plantations in the country to 6.5 million hectares as a step towards ensuring the sustainability of the palm oil industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In fact, the expansion of palm oil plantation in Malaysia does not cause deforestation as most of the new lands are replacing other agricultural crops area such as rubber, coconut and cocoa which have lower market value. Besides that, the Malaysian government also took measures to prohibit palm cultivation on peat soils and permanent forest reserves across the country.</p><p id="Par67">Moreover, the production size and quality of palm-based energy products in Malaysia is continuously improving as the country is equipped with the technology capabilities and market size along with support from various agencies such as the MPOB, SIRIM Berhad as well as Malaysia Automotive Robotics and IoT Institute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In fact, Malaysian palm oil meets the strictest sustainability standards and was certified as sustainable under the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) by leading European sustainability schemes, regulated by the EU Commission.</p><p id="Par68">Colombia is also standing firm on its position alongside with Malaysia and Indonesia to urge EU to not restrict the utilization of palm biodiesel within Europe. It is an important fact that 65% of the total palm oil plantation area in Malaysia are smallholder plantations which are usually managed by farmers and the rest are ruled by companies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. These palm crops are their primary source of income especially for the smallholder farmers; thus, it will only bring negative consequences to their quality of life if the EU ban is implemented. In terms of land usage, the Colombian palm oil is produced responsibly and sustainably on degraded lands and plains, where the lands were formerly cleared for cattle ranching, but not on their primary forest. The environmental impact of palm oil in Colombia is relatively low, although it is not completely deforestation free.</p><p id="Par69">Additionally, a lot of local and international standards and policies have been implemented to tackle these issues and to have more sustainable development of palm oil industry. Relevant sustainable policies and/or conventions including the global Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certification, Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) scheme, European Union Renewable Energy Directives (EU-RED) 1 &amp; 2 and various zero-deforestation commitments. Besides that, the advancement in genetic modification technology, tissue culture propagation, marker-assisted breeding and marker-assisted selection have revolutionized the biotechnology applications to produce higher yield palm oil cultivations, thus meeting the energy growing demand and also ensuring the sustainable food supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The successful biotechnology provides a clear way towards sustainability of the biofuel industry. Furthermore, the crop growth simulation model also has been developed as an excellent assessment for the long-term different intercropping systems, thus giving more accurate information to support smallholder decision-making.

The policy brings a lot of advantages to Malaysian and Colombian transportation systems in terms of environmental, technology, economy as well as social aspect. Since biodiesel is derived from renewable source such as palm oil as the replacement for fossil diesel, it can reduce the dependency on fossil fuels and eventually tackle on the issues of the pollution produced by them. The crops are more suitable for current world energy security, satisfying the world transportation needs. It is notably stated that oil palm is a highly efficient vegetable oil in comparison with other bearing crops; thus, it requires less plantation area, only 0.26 hectare to produce 1 ton of palm oil compared with 2.2, 2.0 and 1.5 hectares for soya bean, sunflower and rapeseed, respectively. At the same time, palm biodiesel also contributes to environmental stability where it considerably leads to less engine exhaust emissions in comparison with neat diesel. Several researchers have proven that palm oil biodiesel is a clean fuel because it will not increase the amount of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions during combustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Besides that, palm biodiesel is also biodegradable; thus, it is easier and safer to be utilized.</p><p id="Par71">In addition, palm oil biodiesel mandate in transportation sector brings advantages in terms of technology development in Malaysia and Colombia. The countries are equipped with advanced technologies, facilities and expertise in this particular field to play a key role in ensuring that the palm oil biodiesel can bring much more benefits to global market especially for transportation and energy ecosystem. The researches done by MPOB and other experts from local universities resulted in the development of several technological processes to convert crude palm oil and palm kernel oil into methyl ester for the application of biodiesel. Palm methyl ester or palm biodiesel is often used as a fuel blend with petroleum diesel inside many diesel vehicles without engine modification.</p><p id="Par72">The competitiveness of the oil palm industry and successful implementation of the biodiesel policy would benefit to the Malaysian and Colombian economy as well. In Malaysia, the oil palm industry attains a significant achievement in palm oil production and exports, which contributes 5 to 7% of Malaysiaâs gross domestic product (GDP), exchange earnings as well as creation of job opportunities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].Â In fact, Malaysiaâs export revenue palm oil alone averages at MYR 64.24 billion per annum for the last 5 years. Malaysia also expanded its export markets to more than 200 markets worldwide, including India sub-continent, West Asia and Africa to cater the ever-growing demand of consumers. Meanwhile, in Colombia, oil palm sector has contributed 0.22% to the countryâs GDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Colombiaâs palm oil industry is expected to move forward with plans to increase palm oil production, targeting six times increment in 2020.</p><p id="Par73">Furthermore, promoting oil palm production and biofuel policy for transportation sector is positive for smallholder and small-scale oil palm growers who represent approximately 40% of the total global palm oil production. In Malaysia, as of April 2017, the number of people directly employed into the oil palm industry registered at 440,262 (exclusive of 280,977 independent smallholders). The oil palm cultivation and biodiesel blending mandate directly and indirectly gives socio-economic benefits to the oil palm growers to increase their living standard, which provides primary income source from steady demand, thus allowing thousands of the oil palm growers to invest in improving their cropland, enhancing environmental conditions and providing a good education for their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Meanwhile, Colombian oil palm industry engages more than 80% of the smallholders and small-scale growers, literally providing important source of income for them.

Malaysiaâs MPI plans to double its current biodiesel programme to B20 in transportation sector by 2020 and B30 by 2025. Meanwhile, Colombiaâs MME has drafted a resolution to increase biodiesel mandate to B12 by 2019. Prior to that, biodiesel implementation roadmap, an international collaboration as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, will be a good initiative for both countries to improve their existing policies, strategies and blueprints relating to the biodiesel industry development.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Potential international collaboration between Malaysia and Colombia</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12155_2020_10165_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par75">The difference between Malaysian and Colombian palm oil policy is that the Malaysian policy is initiated for domestic use in transportation and related sectors and currently is focusing in becoming the worldâs largest palm oil exporter. Meanwhile, the Colombian palm industry policy is entirely focused on local consumption to meet the biodiesel blend mandate and not for the trades. In fact, the production of palm biodiesel in Malaysia is at 907 million litres in 2017, and it was expected to increase to 1.22 and 1.56 billion litres in 2018 and 2019, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The production of palm biodiesel in Colombia registered is at 393 million litres in 2017, and it is projected to reach 480 million in 2018. In addition, Malaysia has exported 267 million litres in 2017, while Colombia neither imports or exports palm biodiesel. Through this international cooperation, Malaysia can help in improving Colombia palm oil biodiesel production yield and quality at a lower cost. There are several reasons for the higher production cost in Colombia such as poor soil condition in certain plantation area, bud rot disease, low degree of mechanisation and high labour charge. In fact, as the worldâs largest palm oil exporter, Malaysia is able to lend a helping hand to promote Colombia palm oil for exportation. This situation also promotes Malaysian palm oil players to do joint ventures with the existing biodiesel companies in Colombia.</p><p id="Par76">Besides that, collaborative research between Malaysia and Colombia may result in more sustainable development of biodiesel industry to meet global quest, thus providing greater benefit to the industry as a whole. There are several reasons for the higher production cost in Colombia such as poor soil condition in certain plantation area, bud rot disease, low degree of mechanisation and high labour charge. For example, Malaysia has been able to produce high-quality winter-grade palm biodiesel consistently at an optimised cost. This biodiesel grade is suitable to be used in non-tropical region as they experience winter season. Malaysia has also successfully introduced a hybrid oil palm tree between the deli dura and pisifera species, known as tenera which is the most efficient oil-bearing crop in the world. The tenera species requires 0.26 hectares of land to produce one tonne of the oil. Meanwhile, the researches in Colombia are more focused on the sustainability of the palm biodiesel production in terms of socio-economic impact, carbon footprint, agribusiness and energy balance. Since both countries complement each other, a cross-disciplinary collaborative research is strongly required to improve the quality and sustainability of the palm oil production in a manner by following RSPO standards and adopting good agricultural practices.</p><p id="Par77">The fact that Malaysia has limited amount of lands to further expand their palm cultivation area, hence, they have to convert secondary forest and other existing crops area such as rubber, cocoa and coconut which are less competitive compared with oil palm. However, Colombia has ample land availability with a potential area of 3.5 million hectares for palm cultivating area. Therefore, Malaysian palm oil companies have to put into consideration to invest for global plantation and refining capacity in Colombia which has similar soil and climate conditions.</p><p id="Par78">Moreover, technology cooperation between Malaysia and Colombia is important towards sustainability of palm oil biodiesel in transportation sector. An exchange in technology and infrastructures will benefit both Malaysia and Colombia. Through years of extensive researches, Malaysia can provide relevance technologies, expertise and experience in terms of biotechnology, biodiesel processing as well as fuel blending. Malaysia has successfully decoded palm oil genome to further increase palm oil yield. Apart from that, Malaysia is also now recognized as one of the most cost-effective biodiesel production processes, thus having higher demands from many countries. By encouraging technological exchange, these technologies can be utilized to aid the production process of biodiesel in Colombia. Further expansion of palm cultivating area will affect the sustainability of our nature. In this context, advanced technology and expertise are needed to increase the crops yield per cultivation area. The expertise of Colombia in precision agricultural techniques, plant agronomy as well as biotechnology also can help Malaysia to further optimized production rate within land availability.</p><p id="Par79">Another strength of Colombia is that the country has a fairly strong biofuel policy and programmes that promote sustainable energy and biofuels in transportation sector. Besides being a world bioethanol pioneer, Colombian biodiesel projects are gaining strength, thus giving greater impact to the society, economy and environment. Though Colombia does not focus on biodiesel export, its biodiesel policy is more focusing on domestic uses based on Colombian Law 939 of 2004. The Colombian full implementation of biodiesel blend in transportation began in 2007 and currently implement B9~B10 since 2017. Meanwhile, Malaysian full nation implementation of biodiesel blend officially took place in 2014 and currently implemented B10 on February 2019. As the largest biodiesel exporter, Malaysian government should take an aggressive approach to convince the automobile manufacturers to increase the utilization of palm biodiesel in transportation sector. The adoption of higher biodiesel blend policy is a solution to increase domestic consumption of palm oil, and at the same time, it acts as an alternative to heavy reliance on export of palm oil.</p><p id="Par80">Furthermore, the oil palm industry in Malaysia and Colombia faces many challenges and negative perception especially from the palm oil competitors in western countries. They are claiming that the oil plantations are unsustainable which causes deforestation, thus leading to climate change and mass species extinction. Through this collaboration, Malaysia may work closely with Colombia to negotiate in a constructive manner in seeking dispute settlements on the EUâs decision to phase out the utilization of palm biodiesel. In this regard, both countries are able to voice out their common concerns towards the issue to ensure that the palm commodity receives non-discriminatory treatment, thus allowing market access into the EU countries. Besides that, both countries may also work together in promoting palm oil to raise public awareness among consumers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par81">The implementation of palm oil biodiesel as an alternative fuel to the conventional petroleum hydrocarbon marks an important milestone in reducing the harmful emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. However, the sustainability of the palm biodiesel industry is very crucial as the increase of palm biodiesel production can cause global imbalance to the food industries. Thus, several local and international sustainability standards and policies have been implemented to ensure the sustainable development of the industry which includes forest conservation, environmental management, biological control of pests and reduction of greenhouse gases. As major players of the palm oil business, Malaysia and Colombia can deal with their internal consumption of palm oil products (food, biodiesel, etc.) and are committed to ensuring that the palm commodity remains sustainable for the global markets through the implementation of various policies. Palm oil biodiesel has been the founding base of biodiesel policies for the transportation sector in both Malaysia and Colombia. The policies bring a lot of advantages to the countriesâ transportation systems in terms of environmental, technology, economy and social aspect. Both countries are equipped with advanced technologies, facilities and expertise in this particular field in ensuring that the palm oil biodiesel can bring many more benefits to the global market especially for transportation and energy ecosystem. Owing to that reason, international collaboration between these two nations would be a good initiative to improve their existing policies, strategies, and blueprints relating to the palm biodiesel industry development especially to their respective regions. The successful collaboration between Malaysia and Colombia can overcome the challenges when dealing with the global energy issue and consequently become a good role model for other countries.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge with gratitude the financial support given by the University of Malaya under the Equitable Society Research Cluster (ESRC) research grant GC003D-17SBS entitled âEnhancement of Biofuel Production from Tropical Biodiversity Sourcesâ.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">IPCC (2001) Climate change 2001: The scientific basis.
