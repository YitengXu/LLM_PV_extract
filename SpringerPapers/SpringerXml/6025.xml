The thiolate compounds are readily prepared via the reaction of metal bases and tertiary-alkyl thiols. The thiolate complexes are soluble in common organic solvents and can be solution processed by spin coating to yield thin films. Upon thermal annealing in the range of 200–400 °C, the tertiary-alkyl thiolates decompose cleanly to yield volatile dialkyl sulfides and metal sulfide films which are free of organic residue. Analysis of the reaction byproducts strongly suggests that the decomposition proceeds via an SN<sub>1</sub> mechanism. The composition of the films can be controlled by adjusting the amount of each metal thiolate used in the precursor solution yielding bandgaps in the range of 1.2 to 3.3 eV. The films form functioning p-n junctions when deposited in contact with CdS films prepared by the same method. Functioning solar cells are observed when such p-n junctions are prepared on transparent conducting substrates and finished by depositing electrodes with appropriate work functions. This method enables the fabrication of metal chalcogenide films on a large scale via a simple and chemically clear process.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep36608.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>23</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep36608" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep36608</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since their discovery, solar cells have been recognized as an appealing energy source due to the abundance of solar energy, their simplicity and lack of moving parts and their ability to generate power in remote locations. Although the practical use of solar modules in the past has been confined to niche applications (where their high cost could be justified), the aggregate amount of energy produced by solar modules has increased by more than one thousand times over the past 20 years and power generation from photovoltaics now constitutes approximately 1% of global electrical energy production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. As other energy sources become increasingly scarce and the burning of fossil fuels is curbed to mitigate climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, the impetus to produce energy from sunlight continues to grow stronger every year. The large scale production of solar energy requires the deployment of solar cells over large surface areas, which is economically problematic due to the relatively high cost per area to manufacture photovoltaic modules. Thus, finding low-cost materials and strategies to fabricate solar cells constitutes an immensely important scientific challenge facing our generation.</p><p>Recent years have witnessed the development many new types of solar technologies which can be deposited like inks by low cost solution coating techniques including organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and perovskite solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Although the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of these technologies have developed rapidly to approach those of their inorganic counterparts, their stabilities and reliabilities remain unresolved.</p><p>Another route to accomplish the same goals as BHJ, DSSC, CQD and perovskite approaches is to develop strategies to prepare more traditional inorganic solar cells by solution processing methods. CuInS<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and related Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> materials have been shown to yield PCEs of over 20%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, as high as any solar cell based on BHJ, DSSC, CQD or perovskite materials, while the long-term stability of these modules has already been established. Although these chalcogenide materials are generally insoluble, it has been demonstrated that using appropriate chemistry, soluble precursor compounds can be prepared and processed like inks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. For instance, Mitzi and co-workers have shown that Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> cells can be fabricated by processing films from solutions of hydrazinium metal selenides (using hydrazine as a solvent) followed by thermal annealing and selenization of the precursor films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Although this has proven to be an effective method to prepare Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> type solar cells, hydrazine is a toxic, corrosive and chemically reactive solvent. Alternatively, Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (NPs) can be synthesized and deposited by solution processing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, these NP based devices typically lead to low PCEs without a subsequent high temperature selenization step.</p><p>The ultimate goal of researching solution-processed solar cells is to enable the manufacture solar cells on a large scale using industrial printing equipment. In the context of large-scale printing operations, inks based on non-toxic and non-polar solvents offer the best performance due to their low reactivity, low surface tension, good wettability, evaporation rates and ability to form smooth and uniform films. Thus, the ability to process solar cells using non-toxic, non-polar solvents offers the best compatibility with industrial-scale printing equipment.</p><p>There are few examples of CuInS<sub>2</sub> or Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> solar cells being deposited from precursors using common organic solvents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Until now, these works have utilized metal xanthate precursors which must be prepared using carbon disulfide, which poses health and reactivity problems like hydrazine. Metal xanthates additionally possess undesirable reactivity; they are very sensitive to pH and yield an ill-defined a mixture of reactive products when they decompose. Other works<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> have utilized mixtures of metal halides and thiourea instead of single molecule precursors, however, it is unclear what happens to the halide anions or thiourea decomposition products after the metal sulfides are formed. Thus, molecular precursors which decompose by a well-defined reaction to yield well-defined products have until now not been demonstrated.</p><p>In this contribution, we have used a rational, organo-chemical approach to design metal complexes which are soluble in non-toxic, non-polar solvents and decompose thermally to yield pure metal sulfide films. The t-butoxy carbonyl (TBOC) group was used as a model and starting point in the design of these complexes; the TBOC moiety is well-known to decompose quantitatively via SN<sub>1</sub> or E<sub>1</sub> mechanisms at elevated temperatures to yield volatile iso-butene and CO<sub>2</sub> byproducts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The thermally-labile TBOC moiety has been successfully exploited as a solubilizing group to solution-process organic semiconductor films which become crystalline and insoluble after heating, allowing high-mobility, multilayer films to be processed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In this work, we have extended this concept to solution-process insoluble, inorganic metal sulfide films. We show that tertiary-alkyl metal thiolates (TAMTs) decompose analogously to the TBOC group to yield volatile alkyl sulfides and insoluble metal sulfide films which are free from organic residue.</p><p>We show that CuInS<sub>2</sub> and Cu(In,Ga)S<sub>2</sub> films can be readily prepared by annealing TAMT films which are deposited from solutions in common organic solvents, as illustrated in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Films with a range of compositions can be prepared by adjusting the ratio of each TAMT (Cu, In, and Ga) in order to achieve a range of band gaps and allowing detailed control of the energy band structure. These films can be deposited on conductive transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates, with appropriate electrodes, in order to produce photovoltaic devices (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). By grading the bandgap of the active layer, it is possible to create a band structure which drives photoexcited electrons from the absorbing layer to the p-n junction.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic diagrams including (<bold>a</bold>) TAMT precursor molecules used to prepare sulfide films and (<bold>b</bold>) processing strategy.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep36608_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic diagrams of architectures used for (<bold>a</bold>) n-type substrates, (<bold>b</bold>) p-type substrates and (<bold>c</bold>) p-type substrates using an active layer with a graded band-gap.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep36608_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>This report marks the first of its kind to utilize rationally designed CuInS<sub>2</sub> precursors which thermally decompose via a well-understood reaction.

In the case of copper t-dodecanethiolate (CuTDT), Cu(II) acetate reacted with 2 equivalents of t-dodecanethiol, undergoing a reduction/oxidation reaction with simultaneous anion displacement to afford the Cu(I) thiolate, with acetic acid and t-dodecyl disulfide as byproducts. Ga and In isopropoxides were found to readily react with t-dodecanethiol; isopropoxide is a strong base which is quickly neutralized by proton transfer from t-dodecanethiol (a weak acid) to yield Ga and In t-dodecanethiolates (GaTDT and InTDT) and isopropanol. The isolated TAMTs were found to be insoluble in polar solvents including water and methanol, but exhibited excellent solubility in non-polar solvents and solvents with intermediate polarity including hexane, toluene, chloroform and tetrahydrofuran (THF). The TAMTs were found to be stable for months at room temperature in the absence of light, but decomposed rapidly to metal sulfides upon heating to moderate temperatures.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Synthesis of metal thiolates and their thermal decomposition to metal sulfides.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep36608_Fig3_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Thiolate Decomposition</title><p>In order to quantify the thermal decomposition of the precursors into metal sulfides, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows TGA traces of each thiolate complex as well as a 1:1 molar mixture of CuTDT and InTDT. CuTDT begins to decompose at 160.4 °C (95.7% of original weight) and rapidly loses mass to 32.4% of its original weight during an increase of 9.1 °C. InTDT decomposes to 27.1% of its original weight in the range of 121.9 °C to 133 °C, while GaTDT steadily decomposes to 17.3% of its original weight starting at 78.7 °C and ending at 129.4 °C (a range of 50.7 °C).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TGA plots of (<bold>a</bold>) CuTDT, (<bold>b</bold>) InTDT, (<bold>c</bold>) GaTDT, and (<bold>d</bold>) a CuTDT and InTDT 1:1 molar mixture, respectively.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep36608_Fig4_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The 1:1 molar mixture of CuTDT and InTDT converts to the metal sulfide phase somewhat more gradually over a range of 46.5 °C, losing 62.8% of its weight without showing two distinct decomposition steps. The losses in mass are consistent with the thermal decomposition mechanisms outlined in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. Although all materials decompose to metal sulfides below 200 °C, TAMT films were processed at a reference temperature of 300 °C throughout this study to ensure complete conversion of the insulating precursors to semiconducting sulfide films. For some experiments, higher annealing temperatures were used as noted in order to achieve better film crystallinity.</p><p>In order to confirm the decomposition mechanism and identity of the reaction by-products, we decomposed samples of the complexes by heating to 300 °C under vacuum and trapped the volatile decomposition products with a liquid nitrogen trap. The decomposition products were dissolved in chloroform and analyzed by gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (MS, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>) and Raman spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>A control sample consisting of the thiol starting material was analyzed as a reference, however, no peak corresponding to the MW of the parent thiol (M = 202) was observed in the MS spectrum and the largest MW observed in the thiol spectrum (M = 168) corresponded to the MW of the thiol – H<sub>2</sub>S, i.e. the alkene, indicating that the C-S bond of the thiol was completely fragmented during ionization in the MS instrument. This is consistent with reference MS spectra of t-dodecanthiol (2-methyl-2-undecanethiol) which show no peak at M = 202 corresponding the un-fragmented compound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The decomposition products obtained by heating a mixture of CuTDT and InTDT also showed a highest MW of 168 with spectra which closely resembled the parent thiol. The MS results thus did not distinguish between alkylthiol, alkene or dialkyl sulfide, due to the ease with which the C-S bond is cleaved in the MS instrument, however, were consistent with the presence of any one of these compounds.</p><p>Raman spectra of the decomposition products (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S2</xref>) clearly showed that no alkene or thiol were present, but showed strong peaks corresponding to C-S vibrations, indicating that the volatile decomposition product consists chiefly of the dialkyl sulfide. This strongly suggests that the decomposition of the TAMT occurs primarily via an SN<sub>1</sub> mechanism as shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. Although we initially anticipated that the thiolates decomposed via an E<sub>1</sub> mechanism, (dashed arrow, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) the SN<sub>1</sub> route is not unexpected given the presence of the thiolate anions in the films, which are known to be exceptionally strong nucleophiles and apparently react with the carbocation intermediate before proton transfer and elimination of the alkene can occur. The rapid, thermally activated decomposition at lower temperatures than primary or secondary thiolates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> is also consistent with E<sub>1</sub> or SN<sub>1</sub> processes and further substantiate the decomposition mechanism.</p><p>Raman spectra of CuInS<sub>2</sub> films prepared by spin coating an equimolar ratio of CuTDT and InTDT and annealing at 200 °C and 300 °C are also shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S2</xref>.

We expected that the enhanced absorption of the thicker CuInS<sub>2</sub> layer would increase the J<sub>SC</sub>. However, the EQE was significantly reduced after 2 coats of CuInS<sub>2</sub>. This indicates that the reduced EQE can be attributed to lowered internal quantum efficiency of the device, or poor charge carrier extraction due to the ill-defined crystalline structure confirmed by Raman (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S2</xref>) and XRD patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S3</xref>). The different spectral shape of the EQE depending on the thickness of the devices arises from optical interference effects inside the active layer due to the thickness of the active layer, which is comparable to the wavelengths of incident light. Although such optical interference effects are unusual in CIGS devices (which are typically thicker than 1000 nm) they are common in devices with thin active layers such as organic and perovskite solar cells. Devices were prepared in an inverted architecture by depositing the CuInS<sub>2</sub> film (two coats) first onto glass/ITO substrates, followed by deposition of CdS and ZnO layers.

These PCE values are comparable to other CuInS<sub>2</sub> devices prepared by solution processing methods such as NPs or other precursors without a high-temperature annealing or selenization step<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, however, are low compared to CuInS<sub>2</sub> or Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> devices which are grown epitaxially or selenized at high temperature. Although the films are chemically pure, the relatively low PCE and thin optimum active layer thickness are consistent with a disordered film structure with small crystal domains, where abundant grain boundaries lead to short minority carrier diffusion lengths and limit the active layer thickness. Initial attempts to increase the annealing temperature to 400 °C unfortunately led to a dramatic drop in V<sub>OC</sub> and high rate of device failure, which we presume may be due to instability between the ITO substrates and deposited chalcogenide layers at high temperatures. Although the band structure of the Ga-doped films indicates a slope in the conduction band which should provide an increased driving force pushing photogenerated electrons towards the p-n junction, initial attempts to incorporate Ga into the device structure yielded low J<sub>SC</sub> values. We are currently investigating methods to improve the crystallinity of the materials using higher annealing temperatures with alternative substrates such as molybdenum, as well as post-deposition selenization, which we anticipate will allow much higher efficiencies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Various metal thiolates (Cu, In, Ga) were synthesized as effective metal sulfide precursors through a low-cost and straightforward synthetic strategy. Spin coated films could be easily processed using non-polar and non-toxic solvents and decomposed cleanly at moderate temperatures to yield films free of organic residue. The volatile decomposition products were identified as dialkyl sulfides indicating that the complexes decomposed via a well-defined SN<sub>1</sub> mechanism, analogously to the TBOC group. Binary, ternary, and even quaternary systems of metal sulfide films were solution-processed using mixed TAMT precursor solutions by spin casting followed by mild thermal annealing. The versatility of this method was demonstrated using four different metal complexes. The films were characterized electronically and exhibited band structures consistent with semiconducting Cu<sub>2</sub>S, In<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, CuInS<sub>2</sub> and Cu(In,Ga)S<sub>2</sub> films. Functional solar cells were fabricated using the same techniques and equipment used for polymer solar cells by successive deposition of metal sulfide layers. This report marks the first of its kind to demonstrate the preparation of environmentally friendly CuInS<sub>2</sub> type solar cells from non-polar thiolate precursors which are soluble in common organic solvents. In contrast with the widely used epitaxial growth methods used to prepare metal chalcogenide films, this approach constitutes a rapid, low-cost, strategy to prepare metal chalcogenide thin films, which is compatible with large-scale deposition methods such as printing or roll-to-roll coating. It offers great potential for application in the fabrication of a range of large-area semiconducting devices such as solar cells, LEDs, photodiodes and transistors, as well presenting the possibility for use in conjunction with solution-processed organic and hybrid semiconducting devices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Synthesis</title><p>All reagents were procured from Aldrich or Alfa Aesar and used as received.
