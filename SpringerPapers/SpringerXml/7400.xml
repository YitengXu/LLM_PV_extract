In this work, we assess the influence that diethylammonium dihydrogen phosphate (DEAP), an ionic liquid (IL) and sodium chloride (NaCl), an ionic salt (IS), have on the structural changes in hemoglobin (Hb) in the presence of RS generated using dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma in the presence of various gases [O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, Ar, He, NO (10%) + N<sub>2</sub> and Air]. We carry out fluorescence spectroscopy to verify the generation of <sup>•</sup>OH with or without the presence of DEAP IL and IS and we use electron spin resonance (ESR) to check the generation of H<sup>•</sup> and <sup>•</sup>OH. In addition, we verified the structural changes in the Hb structure after treatment with DBD in presence and absence of IL and IS. We then assessed the structural stability of the Hb in the presence of IL and IS by using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. Our results indicate that the IL has a strong effect on the conservation of the Hb structure relative to that of IS against RS generated by plasma.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep17781.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep17781" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep17781</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cold temperature plasma (CAP) at atmospheric pressure provides a wide range of cutting-edge applications for various fields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Researchers in plasma medicine have used different types of plasma devices among them atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) and dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) as the most common.

Plasma medicine has been mainly dependent upon the specific action of various reactive species (RS) that affect various cellular functions. CAP contains a variety of UV, reactive oxygen species (ROS), charged particles, reactive nitrogen species (RNS), electrons, etc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

Many researchers have performed experiments to identify the various RS in bio-solution and to determine their primary mechanism. CAP can generate RS that have selective action with living tissue, such as killing and healing activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

Nevertheless, the action of RS generated by plasma in the presence of various salts remains poorly understood.</p><p>Ionic liquids (ILs) are organic salts that are wholly composed of ions.

This shows that such materials are promising as green alternatives to replace conventional volatile organic solvents (VOC). ILs can be used in numerous applications, including organic synthesis, electrochemical studies, extraction/separation, solar cells and proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

However, we observed in another study that IL can protect the structure and activity of enzymes against plasma toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Additionally, in our previous studies we observed that DEAP IL acts as the stabilizer to different proteins/cyclic dipeptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.

When we used the N<sub>2</sub> feeding gas, we observed an N<sub>2</sub> second-positive system (C<sup>3</sup>П<sub>u</sub>–B<sup>3</sup>П<sub>g</sub>) and an N<sub>2</sub> first positive system (B<sup>3</sup>П<sub>g</sub>–A<sup>3</sup>П<sub>u</sub><sup>+</sup>). For the N<sub>2</sub> 2<sup>nd</sup> positive system, we observed peaks at 294.5, 314.1, 335.3, 353.7 and 379.0 nm, but the N<sub>2</sub> 1<sup>st</sup> positive system lies between 500–700 nm, as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>. When O<sub>2</sub> feeding gas was used in the DBD chamber, we observed a high-intensity <sup>•</sup>OH peak at 306.9 nm, nascent oxygen atoms at 543.7 and 616.1 nm and O<sub>2</sub> 1<sup>st</sup> positive system peaks at 777.2 and 844.1 nm, as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>. In contrast, we observed the N<sub>2</sub> 2<sup>nd</sup> positive system for NO (10%) + N<sub>2</sub> at 294.5, 314.1, 335.3, 353.7 and 379.0 nm, which is the same as that for the N<sub>2</sub> gas plasma spectra but the intensity of the peaks at 294.5, 314.3 and 379.3 are quite low for the NO (10%) + N<sub>2</sub> gas plasma when compared to those for N<sub>2</sub> gas plasma, as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>.

These complex reactions result in the formation of other short- and long-lived radicals or species and some of these long-lived species contribute to a change in the pH. The combined action of the electrons and radicals can affect the temperature of the solution and hence, we have checked the pH and temperature of the solution with or without 2% (w/v) DEAP IL and 2% (w/v) IS after 10 min of DBD treatment in the presence of all gases, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1</xref>. We observed that in DI water, the pH of the solution varies from gas to gas. The pH decreases the most for Air plasma and the least for Ar plasma. The pH also decreases the least for DEAP IL followed by IS and water. This trend in the different salts remains the same for all feeding gases, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1a</xref>. We also observed that the change in pH for O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub> and NO (10%) + N<sub>2</sub> was not too different. However, the change in the temperature was not much for the different gases in the DBD discharge for 10 min and the presence of DEAP IL and NaCl IS does not have an influence on the temperature, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1b</xref>. The temperature increases from 25 °C to 31 °C after a 10 min treatment and this shows that during treatment, the temperature does not play a significant role in the deformation of the Hb structure. To understand the role that the stable species has in the pH decrease, we carried out ion chromatography for nitrogen species such as NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1c,d</xref>. Our results show that both the NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> species are the highest in air plasma and the least in Ar plasma. Since the air plasma contains both oxygen and nitrogen species, these react together to form NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> during plasma treatment. Traces of nitrogen and oxygen that are dissolved in water might be present in the treatment chamber, which leads to the detection of the NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> species for other gases, even for noble gases.<disp-formula id="Equ12"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep17781_Equ1_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="Equ13"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep17781_Equ2_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Fluorescence and Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis for <sup>•</sup>OH detection in different gases plasma</title><p>In radical chemistry and in plasma chemistry, <sup>•</sup>OH plays an important role because it is the neutral form of the hydroxide ion (OH<sup>−</sup>). Although there are many pathways to generate <sup>•</sup>OH, four main pathways are the 1) decomposition of O<sub>3</sub>, 2) decomposition of nitrous acid, 3) decomposition of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and 4) reaction between the peroxyl radical (<sup>•</sup>HO<sub>2</sub>) with NO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.

The electrons generated due to plasma collide with water molecules that generate hydroxyl radicals (<sup>•</sup>OH) and hydrogen radicals (H<sup>•</sup>). To investigate the generation of <sup>•</sup>OH, we used terephthalate anions obtained by mixing terephthalic acid (TA) in alkaline aqueous solution. These terephthalate anions react with <sup>•</sup>OH to create highly fluorescent hydroxyterephthalate ions (HTA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> and this reaction is a very sensitive measure of the presence of <sup>•</sup>OH, so many other research and groups have used this method to determine the generation of <sup>•</sup>OH during plasma treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. We also used this method in our study to show how the formation of <sup>•</sup>OH was also related to the gases used in the plasma chamber. This study provides a new way in which to use different gases in different experiments to test plasma medicines. We have used the several gases (O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, Ar, He, NO (10%) + N<sub>2</sub> and Air) in a chamber where we the DBD plasma is generated and hence, during treatment, the main gas (environment gas) is the same as the treatment gas, therefore the interference of air is limited during treatment. We can also check that the conversion of the TA to HTA occurred through a fluorescence analysis. We have provided an excitation at ~310 nm and the emission was observed at ~425 nm for the formation of HTA. We found that during the fluorescence scan, there are two peaks with one at ~350 nm and other at ~425 nm. The small peak at ~350 nm is the unreacted or side product of TA during the reaction with <sup>•</sup>OH to form HTA, while the peak at ~425 nm belongs to the formation of HTA formation, as shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. The intensity of the fluorescence is directly related to the amount of HTA formation. First, we have studied the formation of HTA in water (DI) in the presence of N<sub>2</sub>, Ar, He, NO (10%) + N<sub>2</sub> and Air gases plasma. We found that HTA is formed the most with the use of N<sub>2</sub> gas as the feeding gas and the least with NO (10%) + N<sub>2</sub> as the feeding gas.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Fluorescence analysis of OH radicals using TA solution in (<bold>a</bold>) water; (<bold>b</bold>) 2% (w/v) NaCl solution and (<bold>c</bold>) 2% (w/v) DEAP IL solution after DBD plasma treatment with different feeding gases, such as Air (red), Ar (blue), He (cyan), NO (10%) +N<sub>2</sub> (orange) and N<sub>2</sub> (magenta).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep17781_Fig4_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>Similar trends were observed in the presence of NaCl IS and DEAP IL, as shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. However, the difference in the HTA formation using NO gas and Air gas plasma is not much for water, but the difference looks to be more clear for the IS and DEAP IL solution. To obtain a clear understanding of the amount of HTA formed from different gases, we have separately arranged the O<sub>2</sub> gas plasma with other gases because the fluorescence intensity is very high for the O<sub>2</sub> gas plasma, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S2</xref>. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S2</xref>, no peak is observed at ~350 nm for the O<sub>2</sub> gas plasma, which is present in the other gas plasmas. This shows that the rate of conversion of TA to HTA is the maximum for the O<sub>2</sub> gas plasma. Therefore, we can finally say that that the generation of <sup>•</sup>OH depends upon the gas to gas interaction. Gases play a significant role in the formation of <sup>•</sup>OH and the final order to generate <sup>•</sup>OH in our experiment was O<sub>2</sub> &gt; N<sub>2</sub> &gt; Ar &gt; He &gt; Air &gt; NO (10%) + N<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, the intensity of the fluorescence related to the formation of HTA is less for NaCl IS and decreases further for the DEAP IL solution in all gas plasmas.</p><p>ESR spectroscopy is widely used due to its sensitivity and selectivity and spin-trapping ESR can be used to detect various unstable radicals with a short life of even 1 ns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. In this work, we have used the spin-trapping EPR technique to detect H<sup>•</sup> and <sup>•</sup>OH generated during plasma treatment in the presence of NaCl IS and DEAP IL. We used 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) as the spin trapping agent, which is one of the most frequently used spin traps that can trap nitrogen, oxygen and carbon centered radicals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The DMPO spin trap can be used to detect <sup>•</sup>OH and superoxide anion radical (O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup>).

Hence, the signal initiated from DMPO-OH not only belongs to <sup>•</sup>OH alone, as previously suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. We checked the ESR signals for O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> gas plasma in water using DMPO and we observed the DMPO-OH signals in the O<sub>2</sub> gas plasma and observed DMPO-OH and DMPO-H signals for the N<sub>2</sub> gas plasma. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S3</xref>, the ESR spectrum of the O<sub>2</sub> gas plasma consisted of DMPO-OH and a spin adduct derived from <sup>•</sup>OH (hyperfine coupling constant, aN = 1.51; aH = 1.46 mT) while for N<sub>2</sub> gas plasma we observed signals for the DMPO-OH with a hyperfine coupling constant (aN = 1.51; aH = 1.46 mT) and also the DMPO-H, a spin adduct derived from <sup>•</sup>H (hyperfine coupling constant, aN = 1.68; aH = 2.24 mT), as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S4</xref>, that matches with that in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. The highest signal intensity for the DMPO-OH was detected in the O<sub>2</sub> gas plasma. The amount of <sup>•</sup>OH was much greater for the O<sub>2</sub> gas plasma than for that determined in any of the other gas plasma samples. However, the presence of NaCl IS in O<sub>2</sub> gas plasma was observed in the DMPO-OH signals, but the intensity is less than that for water signals (without IS). We did not observe any signal for the DEAP IL mixture using DMPO and although we did not obtain DMPO-H signals for N<sub>2</sub> gas plasma using IS, only DMPO-OH signals were observed with hyper fine coupling aN = 1.51; aH = 1.46 mT. Similarly for N<sub>2</sub> gas plasma with DEAP IL and DMPO, we did not observe any EPR signals, which show that the intensity of the signals is affected with the presence of NaCl IS and DEAP IL in the solution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Structural stability analysis of Hb protein in the presence of 2% (w/v) DEAP IL and 2% (w/v) NaCl IS using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations</title><p>In order to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the DEAP stabilizing Hb structure, we studied the DEAP-hemoglobin interactions through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

RMSF values of the two simulations shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>. DEAP and NaCl bind to the surface of the Hb structure, as shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a,b</xref>, respectively. When compared to NaCl-soaked Hb, DEAP-soaked Hb had lower RMSF values in most residues, which is an indication that DEAP stabilized the residue motilities of Hb. Particularly for the residues between D75-P95, the RMSF values were significantly higher (Orange ribbon of <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The amino acid sequence of this region is DMPNALSALSDLHAHKLRVDP with seven charged residues. Since DEAP interacts with the charged residues of the protein surfaces, many DEAPs are bound to this region and significantly stabilize the region. This region for hemoglobin includes 4 helix structures and both side of the loops. His87 in this region interacts with Fe of the heme group and therefore, one can argue that DEAP, by binding to this region of the hemoglobin binding site, keeps the hemoglobin function intact. However, during the simulations, DEAP maintained ±150 hydrogen bonds with the Hb structure and NaCl also had a similar number of hydrogen bonds. However, both cases were observed to be different (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). The NaCl components were uniformly distributed in solutions and interacted with the Hb surface (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>) and the DEAP components were also distributed in solutions but were clustered on the surface of Hb, as shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>.

For the control Hb, there is 69.39% of α-helix and 8.3% of β-sheet and after treatment with O<sub>2</sub> plasma, the α-helix becomes 68.81% and the β-sheet is 7.59%. For the N<sub>2</sub> gas plasma, the change in the α-helix is 68.54% and the change in the β-sheet is 7.42%. For NO (10%) + N<sub>2</sub> plasma, we observed 68.97% of α-helix and 7.84% of β-sheet. This shows that there is an increase in the α-helix and a decrease in the β-sheets after treatment with different feeding gases. The smallest change in the structure is observed for Ar, He and NO (10%) + N<sub>2</sub> gas plasmas and major changes in the structure are observed for O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub> and Air gas plasmas. When we checked the changes in the structure with the addition of 2% (w/v) of NaCl IS and 2% (w/v) of DEAP IL, we observed different levels of structural changes.

On the other hand, the Hb structure changes in the presence of 2% (w/v) DEAP IL as compared to Hb in water (without treatment).

The quantum efficiency of tyrosine (Tyr) is much less than that for tryptophan (Trp), so the fluorescence behavior of Hb is considered according to the Trp residues. The change in the Trp emission wavelength is a result of the change in the tryptophan microenvironments that might result from the plasma action. The denaturation process or the structural deformation can be followed by changes in the maximal intensity of the fluorescence (I<sub>max</sub>) and the red-shift of the maximal emission wavelength (E<sub>max</sub>) as well as the increased polarity of the Trp residues of the protein. The maximal emission wavelength (E<sub>max</sub>) of Hb is ~330 nm and this changes after plasma treatment to ~350 nm. For plasma treatment in water, there is a decrease in intensity with a red shift that shows that the Hb structure is either denatured or the Trp environment has changed significantly, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S5</xref>. The maximum red shift is observed for Air plasma, but quenching is the highest for O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> plasma. Quenching might be a result of the modification of the Trp group after treatment while the shift is mainly due to the change in the Trp environment and moves to a more polar environment. In the presence of NaCl, no quenching is observed after plasma treatment. An E<sub>max</sub> ~330 nm is the same for NaCl as for water. After plasma treatment, we observed a red shift in the 2% (w/v) NaCl solution, which is similar to the case with water, but the shift is small for all gas plasmas. This again supports the results of the CD that structural changes of Hb in the presence of NaCl is independent of the gas used during plasma treatment. The plasma effect on the Trp group of Hb in the presence of NaCl is consists of a quite similar action for all gas plasmas. The different gas plasmas in the presence of DEAP IL have no effect on the Trp emission wavelength, except that we observed a slight red shift for the O<sub>2</sub> gas plasma. This shows that the addition of IL can control the Trp environment from becoming distorted or changing due to the plasma action.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we explain the role of different feeding gases in DBD plasma and their behavior in the presence of NaCl IS and DEAP IL.

Recently, Takamatsu <italic>et al.</italic> showed that nitrogen plasma produced the highest <sup>•</sup>OH followed by Ar, He, O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> plasma in PBS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This trend is similar to that observed in our experiment, except for the O<sub>2</sub> gas plasma.</p><p>One of the main reasons for this trend is the lifetime of the reactive species. The lifetime of the oxygen metastable state 2<sup>1</sup>D<sub>2</sub> is 100 s, nitrogen metastable state 2<sup>2</sup>D<sub>5/2</sub> is 6.1 × 10<sup>4</sup> s, argon metastable state 4<sup>3</sup>P<sub>2</sub> is 56 s and for helium metastable state 2<sup>3</sup>S<sub>1</sub> is 7.9 × 10<sup>3</sup> s <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The lifetime of the metastable states can explain the presence of <sup>•</sup>OH through a direct reaction, which is consistent with our data. However, there are other ways to obtain indirect equations for O<sub>2</sub> gas plasma with respect to the generation of <sup>•</sup>OH. As such, Equations <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">5</xref>, <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="disp-formula">13</xref>, <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="disp-formula">15</xref> and <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="disp-formula">18</xref> are mainly responsible for the increase in <sup>•</sup>OH. Furthermore, we have checked the generation of <sup>•</sup>OH using ESR for N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> gas plasma. We observed that DMPO-OH signals for the O<sub>2</sub> gas are higher than the N<sub>2</sub> signals and additionally, we observed DMPO-H signals for N<sub>2</sub> gas plasma absent in the O<sub>2</sub> gas plasma. This also supports the above fluorescence data in that the O<sub>2</sub> gas plasma can produce more <sup>•</sup>OH.</p><p>The further generation of <sup>•</sup>OH for O<sub>2</sub> plasma relative to N<sub>2</sub> plasma is also supported by Kohno <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. They show that during sonolysis of water in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> gas, more <sup>•</sup>OH is created than with N<sub>2</sub> and Ar gas. The radicals attached with DMPO are very sensitive to the pH of the solution and DMPO reacts with O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> or HO<sub>2</sub><sup>•</sup> to form DMPO-OOH. At the same time, DMPO reacts with <sup>•</sup>OH to form DMPO-OH. However, the main idea is that the rate constant for the DMPO-OH is &gt; 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, while the rate constant for the DMPO-OOH is &lt; 10<sup>2</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, which shows that the chance to form DMPO-OH is much higher than for DMPO-OOH. Moreover, the conversion of DMPO-OOH to DMPO-OH takes place after 1 min<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Hence, the intensity of the DMPO-OH signals is contributed by the O<sub>2</sub><sup>•─</sup>, HO<sub>2</sub><sup>•</sup> and <sup>•</sup>OH. While H<sup>•</sup> generated by N<sub>2</sub> plasma is in the same amount as <sup>•</sup>OH. Therefore, we have observed both DMPO-H and DMPO-OH signals and the rate constant for DMPO-H is &gt;10<sup>3</sup> M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p>Another observation is that the intensity of the ESR signals and fluorescence signals decrease with the addition of the NaCl. In our early work, we found that there is less microorganism deactivation for saline solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. This shows a correlation between the presence of NaCl solution and radicals that are generated or radical interaction. When we checked the fluorescence, we observed a decrease in the intensity of HTA formation linked with the decrease in the generation of <sup>•</sup>OH generation or some other reaction that decreases the effect of <sup>•</sup>OH in solution. Similarly, we also observed less intense signals for EPR in the presence of the NaCl solution. The Finlayson-pitts group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> showed the reaction of <sup>•</sup>OH with aqueous NaCl with the following equation<disp-formula id="Equ31"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep17781_Equ31_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="Equ32"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep17781_Equ32_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="Equ33"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep17781_Equ33_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="Equ34"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep17781_Equ34_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="Equ35"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep17781_Equ35_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>In the experiment with 2% (w/v) NaCl solution, these reactions result in the decrease in the <sup>•</sup>OH reaction with TA to form HTA. Similarly, we also observed a lesser intensity in the signals for ESR in the presence of the 2% (w/v) NaCl solution. However, for the signal in the presence of the 2% (w/v) DEAP IL, the intensity of the fluorescence decreases much for all gases as compared to control and the 2% (w/v) NaCl solution. It is possible that IL interacts with the TA molecule and does not allow the <sup>•</sup>OH to react with TA to form HTA. In the presence of the 2% DEAP IL solution, we did not observe ESR signals. To understand this phenomenon, we conducted semiempirical calculations and investigated the hydrogen bonding between DEAP and DMPO. As, seen from <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S6</xref>, we can find that DEAP IL interacts with the DMPO molecule and this interaction restricts the DMPO to interact with <sup>•</sup>OH, which might be one of the main reasons for the absence of the ESR signals. The second is that DEAP IL produces interference in the ESR signals, so a further understanding on this issue will be investigated in future research.</p><p>To understand the action of NaCl IS and DEAP IL on the Hb protein, we carried out MD simulations. We found that 2% (w/v) DEAP stabilizes the Hb structure more than 2% (w/v) NaCl in the presence of plasma treatment. The CD and fluorescence results show that structural changes are different in different gases, but in the presence of NaCl, the structure for Hb did vary much in the presence of different gas plasmas. The change in the structure is also due to the change in the pH, but the change in temperature has no effect on the structure of Hb because the melting temperature of Hb is greater than the temperature change in the solution after plasma treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In addition, the NaCl controls the changes in the Hb structure to a greater extent than the solution without NaCl. However after treatment with plasma in 2% (w/v) DEAP, the slight structural changes in Hb observed by using the CD and fluorescence spectroscopy. Hence, both DEAP and NaCl can control the Hb structure in the presence of RS generated through plasma. Nevertheless, DEAP stabilize the structure of Hb more strongly than NaCl. But we can’t predict that protective action of other ILs on proteins in the presence of plasma, because action of IL on proteins varies from IL to IL and protein to protein<sup>52</sup>. Similar, we can’t predict the action of the all ionic salts on proteins in the presence of plasma, because the every salt has different action with different proteins and also in the presence of plasma and salt many complex reactions can generate that result in multiple possibilities. Therefore, it need more study for understanding the action of other ionic salt and ionic liquid on various proteins, this issue will be investigated in future research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Materials</title><p>The Hemoglobin protein, DMPO (5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide), sodium chloride, diethylamine and phosphoric acid (85 wt.% in H<sub>2</sub>O) were supplied by Aldrich Chemical Co.
