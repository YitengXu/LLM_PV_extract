In addition, the observations taken at these stations are often used to study the long-range transport of dust as well as anthropogenic and biomass burning pollutants from source regions and to evaluate the performance of global and regional models. In this paper, we summarize the results from past and ongoing field measurements of atmospheric constituents at high-altitude stations across the globe, with particular emphasis on reactive trace species including tropospheric ozone, along with its precursors such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, total reactive nitrogen, and nonmethane hydrocarbons. Over the past decades, our understanding of the temporal variability and meteorological mechanisms of long-range transport has advanced in tandem with progress in instrumentation and modeling. Finally, the future needs of atmospheric chemistry observations at mountain sites are addressed.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Atmospheric observation</kwd><kwd>High-altitude station</kwd><kwd>Long-range transport</kwd><kwd>Seasonal cycle</kwd><kwd>Long-term trend</kwd><kwd>Biomass burning</kwd><kwd>Anthropogenic pollution</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40645_2016_Article_109.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Earth Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Earth Sciences, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Geophysics/Geodesy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Planetology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biogeosciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Hydrogeology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Atmospheric Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>SC7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par49">Trace gases and aerosols present in the atmosphere are responsible for global changes in the environment and climate of the Earth. These changes include global warming, which has caused a temperature increase of 0.85 °C during the period from 1880 to 2012, primarily due to increases in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) since the pre-industrial era (Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">2013</xref>), poor air quality associated with high levels of photo-oxidants, and fine particulate matter with particle diameters of less than 2.5 μm (PM<sub>2.5</sub>). These changes have been traced to high population densities and hasty industrialization in rapidly developing regions (World Health Organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR428">2006</xref>). Such air pollution problems, which can cause damage to human health and to vegetation growth, are now recognized as important, and robust evidence based on reliable observations is needed to support related policymaking processes.</p><p id="Par50">Located far from anthropogenic emissions, high-altitude mountain stations are ideal sites for monitoring the temporal variations of trace gases and aerosols in the atmosphere at background levels. As a result, atmospheric monitoring programs have been established at a substantial number of mountain stations in order to obtain information on the levels, variability, and trends of trace gases and aerosols in the free troposphere (FT), as well as to assess the influence of anthropogenic and natural emission sources. It is widely accepted that observations at mountain sites are affected by the horizontal and vertical transport of polluted air masses from the ground surface (Henne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2004</xref>; Trickl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR387">2003</xref>). Based on the analysis of tropospheric ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) data collected at 27 stations located in mountainous and rural areas in Western Europe at altitudes ranging from 115 to 3550 m above sea level (a.s.l.), Chevalier et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2007</xref>) suggested that ground-based stations devoted to the monitoring of background free tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> should be settled, if possible, above 2000 m a.s.l.</p><p id="Par51">Tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>, which is an important GHG, has an estimated radiative forcing (RF) of 0.40 ± 0.20 W m<sup>−2</sup> (Intergovermental Panel on Climate Change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">2013</xref>). The RF from tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> depends strongly on altitude and latitude due to the coupling of O<sub>3</sub> changes with temperature, water vapor, and clouds (Bowman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2013</xref>; Worden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR424">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR425">2011</xref>). O<sub>3</sub> is the main source of hydroxyl radicals (OH), which drive the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere. It is widely accepted that tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> has two sources: subsidence transport from the stratosphere and in situ photochemical production, which occurs when carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbons are photo-oxidized in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> = NO + NO<sub>2</sub>) (Crutzen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">1974</xref>; Monks et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR256">2009</xref>). The major loss pathways for O<sub>3</sub> in the troposphere include dry deposition to the Earth’s surface, chemical destruction via photolysis to O(<sup>1</sup>D) which reacts with water vapor, and chain reaction with hydroperoxyl radicals (HO<sub>2</sub>) and OH (Seinfeld and Pandis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR345">2006</xref>). The lifetime of O<sub>3</sub> in the troposphere varies strongly in different seasons and locations, ranging from a few days in the tropical boundary layer to 1 year in the upper troposphere. The modeled mean lifetime of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> has been reported as 22.3 ± 2 days (Stevenson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR364">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par52">Although CO is not a radiatively active gas, it affects the climate indirectly via its interaction with OH radicals, which are the primary CO sink. The oxidation of CO by OH leads to the formation of HO<sub>2</sub>, which then can become involved in reactions to produce O<sub>3</sub> in NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>-rich environments. In contrast, CO oxidation by OH radicals can lead to O<sub>3</sub> destruction through catalytic cycles of HO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> in low-NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> environments (Kanakidou and Crutzen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">1999</xref>). The changes in the OH radical concentration due to changes in CO can perturb the concentrations of GHGs such as methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) (Thompson and Cicerone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR382">1986</xref>) and chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) along with others such as hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The major sources of CO emissions into the atmosphere are direct emissions from incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels associated with in situ production via the oxidation of hydrocarbons such as CH<sub>4</sub> and isoprene (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub>). Global estimates for anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions for 2000 were 611 and 459 Tg (CO) year<sup>−1</sup>, respectively (Lamarque et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">2010</xref>). The global mean tropospheric lifetime of CO is relatively long at approximately 2 months (e.g., Prather <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR297">1996</xref>) and seasonal and spatial CO lifetime variations have been reported in the study of Duncan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2007</xref>). In the Northern Hemisphere winter season, the lifetime tends to be long, so CO from fossil fuels and industry accumulates. Conversely, in the Southern Hemisphere, CO approaches its seasonal minimum in austral summer because its lifetime is short and biomass burning activities are at a minimum. This latitudinal gradient becomes weak as summer approaches because the CO lifetime declines, over a scale of weeks to months, across most of the Northern Hemisphere. Simultaneously, however, the CO lifetime increases at southern mid-latitudes since the biomass-burning season is beginning in the Southern Hemisphere.</p><p id="Par53">The term “background” concentrations have been used with various definitions in the literature over time. Calvert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1990</xref>) described “background concentration” as “the concentration of a given species in a pristine air mass, in which anthropogenic impurities of a relatively short lifetime are not present”. However, because the troposphere is globally influenced by the long-range transport of pollution, Parrish et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR284">2012</xref>) adopted the term “baseline,” which refers to measurements obtained when local emission influences are determined to be negligible. Since remote coastal or mountainous sites are regarded as having no direct influence from local sources/sinks, such sites are the primary choices when looking to obtain representative data on continental to hemispheric scales. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defined the “Policy Relevant Background (PRB)” concentration as the concentration that would occur in the USA in the absence of anthropogenic emissions in continental North America (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR394">2006</xref>). Hence, since the sources of PRB concentrations include natural emissions and long-range transport of pollutants, they cannot be controlled by domestic regulations in the USA and/or neighboring countries.</p><p id="Par54">Most studies have assumed the representativeness of mountain sites without providing evidence to support the assumption. Nappo et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR262">1982</xref>) suggested that “representativeness is the extent to which a set of measurements taken in a space-time domain reflects the actual conditions in the same or different space-time domain taken on a scale appropriate for a specific application”. However, representativeness not only varies with time, it also strongly depends on the trace gases because the concentration within a certain volume is controlled by vertical/horizontal transport and mixing, chemical transformations, surface deposition, and emissions.</p><p id="Par55">The spatial representativeness of monitoring sites has been assessed by different approaches, primarily in Europe (e.g., Henne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2010</xref>; Joly and Peuch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">2012</xref>; Kovač-Andrić et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">2010</xref>; Spangl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR359">2007</xref>; Tarasova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR380">2007</xref>). In addition, observations at mountain-based stations provide information of the lower FT, which is located between the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and the tropopause. Many species in the FT, such as O<sub>3</sub>, have longer lifetimes than those in the PBL owing to the lower temperatures and lack of deposition in the FT, which is also where most of the transport of chemical species within the atmosphere occurs. The combination of long-range transport and longer chemical lifetimes in the FT indicates that the chemistry of this zone is an important factor when determining the chemical composition of regions remote from pollutant sources (Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par56">However, observations at ground-based stations can often be influenced by local sources. The objective of data selection is to differentiate the concentrations representative of well-mixed air masses near the site from those substantially affected by local sources or meteorology. Data selection can be performed on the basis of independently measured parameters such as wind direction and speed, statistical approaches for rejecting particular data, or combined meteorological and statistical filters. For example, statistical approaches have been applied to trend analyses of trace gases (e.g., Novelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR264">1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR265">2003</xref>; Ruckstuhl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR326">2012</xref>; Schuepbach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR340">2001</xref>; Thoning et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR383">1989</xref>; Zellweger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR449">2009</xref>) in order to evaluate source regions and their emission estimates (e.g., Greally et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2007</xref>; Prinn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR300">2001</xref>) and to model the long-range transport of trace gases (Balzani Lööv et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par57">When using measurements at mountainous sites, it is necessary to consider upslope flow, which often imposes pollution from local anthropogenic sources located in the foothills. This source is the most likely factor in the contamination of clean air masses arriving at the site from the FT. Conversely, in the absence of emission sources near the site, the upslope flow can transport clean air masses from the boundary layer that have atmospheric compositions that are different from that from the FT (e.g., Hahn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">1992</xref>; Oltmans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR272">1996b</xref>; Peterson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR289">1998</xref>).</p><p id="Par58">Upslope flow on isolated mountains results from two primary mechanisms: mechanically forced lifting and buoyant upslope flow. Mechanically forced lifting is caused by the deflection of strong winds by a mountain slope. The importance of this mechanism differs among mountains and depends mainly on the height of the mountain and the mean speed of the wind. Buoyant upslope flow is caused by the daytime solar heating of air near the surface of the mountain. During the day, warmed air masses rise toward the summit. At night, flows down the mountain occur due to radiative cooling of the ground surface. Both the upslope and downslope flows are important for mountain meteorology and the transport of local pollution (e.g., Furger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2000</xref>). In practice, however, determination of baseline concentrations is difficult because the nature and magnitude of such local influence depend on the mountain topography, local wind patterns, and the characteristics of local emission sources.</p><p id="Par59">The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) launched the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) Programme in 1989 to promote systematic and reliable observations of the chemical composition of the atmosphere. Currently, the GAW has the most extensive measurement program. Its focal areas include aerosols, GHGs, selected reactive gases, O<sub>3</sub>, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and precipitation chemistry. In October 1990, WMO designated the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) in Tokyo as the World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG) and tasked it with collecting, archiving, and providing data related to GHGs and reactive gases in the atmosphere and oceans from observation sites throughout the world that participate in the GAW and other scientific monitoring programs.</p><p id="Par60">Since its establishment, WDCGG has provided users with data and other information through its regular publications and the WDCGG website (<ext-link xlink:href="http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/gmd/wdcgg/" ext-link-type="uri">http://ds.data.jma.go.jp/gmd/wdcgg/</ext-link>).

Kenya (MKN), Kenya</title><p id="Par64">MKN is a GAW Global station that has been designated for long-term measurements of various chemical compounds and physical and meteorological parameters in the lower troposphere. The main office is the Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD). MKN is located on the northwestern slope of Mt. Kenya and in a protected portion of the Mount Kenya National Park. The climate of equatorial East Africa is dominated by seasonal displacement of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). During boreal summer, the ITCZ is situated far to the north, resulting in southerly to southeasterly winds over Kenya. From September onward, the ITCZ begins to retreat southward, followed by a rainy period from mid-October to December over Kenya. Throughout boreal winter, the ITCZ is situated south of the equator. As a result, a northeasterly monsoon circulation dominates East Africa. When the ITCZ begins to progress northward again, it brings a second rainy period from mid-March to the beginning of June to equatorial East Africa. One noteworthy feature of the boreal monsoon circulation is the East African low-level jet (EALLJ), which develops from May onward in the southeast trade winds over Madagascar. With the northward transition of the ITCZ, the EALLJ strengthens and extends northward, reaching its maximum extent in June or July. Its counterpart, blowing from the north along the East African coast during boreal winter, is less pronounced (Henne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Izaña (IZO), Spain</title><p id="Par65">IZO is a GAW Global station operated by the Agencia Estatal de Meteorología (AEMET) for long-term measurements of various chemical compounds and physical and meteorological parameters. The station is located on the Island of Tenerife roughly 300 km west of the African coast. As typically occurs in subtropical oceanic atmospheres to the west of continents, the low troposphere in this region is strongly stratified owing to the synoptic-scale subsidence conditions. Two air masses are well differentiated by the presence of a temperature inversion layer: the marine boundary layer (MBL) and the FT (Rodríguez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR322">2009</xref>).</p><p id="Par66">In the moist and cool MBL, the north to northeast trade wind blows. Because the condensation level is usually lower than the inversion level under the trade wind regime, the top of the MBL, which is frequently located just below the temperature inversion layer, is characterized by a layer of stratocumulus clouds formed by the condensation of water vapor onto available pre-existing particles. The presence of this stratocumulus layer creates a quasi-continuous foggy and rainy regimen throughout the year at altitudes between 800 and 2000 m a.s.l. on the island.</p><p id="Par67">In the FT, northwest subsiding dry airflows dominate throughout the year, except in summer, when they frequently alternate with southeast airflows laden with Saharan mineral dust particles (Chiapello et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">1999</xref>). In winter (January to March), air masses originate from the North Atlantic, North America, and the Sahara (Cuevas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2013</xref>). In spring (April to June), a pattern similar to that in winter is observed. The contributions from the Sahara and the southern part of the North Atlantic are weaker, and the transport from North America is more well-defined than that in winter. In summer (July to September), essentially only two geographical sectors of the air mass pathways are identified: that from North America and that from the Sahara and Northern Sahel. Air masses from North America and the North Atlantic travel at relatively high altitudes, whereas those from the Sahara originate from low levels.</p><p id="Par68">The observational records of a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer that began routine operation in March 1999 have been utilized in many studies (García et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2012</xref>; Schneider et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR335">2005a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR336">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR337">2008</xref>; Sepúlveda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR350">2012</xref>; Viatte et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR408">2011</xref>).

Waliguan is 90 km from Xining and 260 km from Lanzhou, which are the main industrial and most populated regions of central–eastern China. The wind patterns near WLG are controlled by the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau monsoon and are thus associated with seasonal variations. The predominant wind directions are from the southwest in cold seasons and from the east in warm seasons. Locally, WLG is affected by the mountain–valley breezes (Fu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2012</xref>). Xue et al.

This phenomenon strongly affects the air quality, visibility, and the energy budget of the atmosphere over the entire Indian subcontinent. The high-altitude meteorology in the Himalayas is strongly influenced by the Asian monsoon circulation and by local mountain wind systems (Bollasina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2002</xref>).

The seasonal cycles of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> have been argued as a clue to understanding the contributions from the stratospheric influence and the tropospheric photochemistry.

Additionally, the lifetime of O<sub>3</sub> in winter is long enough to allow its accumulation once produced from the precursors emitted from anthropogenic sources (Fenneteaux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">1999</xref>; Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR229">1987</xref>). Intensive campaigns such as the Mauna Loa Observatory Photochemistry Experiment (MLOPEX) were made to gain an understanding of the detailed photochemical mechanisms of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> in the pristine marine atmosphere, thereby suggesting an important role of in situ photochemical production of O<sub>3</sub> (e.g., Ridley and Robinson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR312">1992</xref>).</p><p id="Par112">In more recent years, chemistry transport models, evaluated against the seasonal cycles of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>, predicted that photochemical production and stratospheric influence were 4974 ± 223 and 556 ± 154 Tg(O<sub>3</sub>) year<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, thereby highlighting the importance of photochemical production of O<sub>3</sub> (e.g., Stevenson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR364">2006</xref>; Sudo and Akimoto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR369">2007</xref>). Based on these state-of-science models, the contribution of stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> to the spring maximum is thought to be minor. Nagashima et al.

The calculated net O<sub>3</sub> production rate showed an increasing seasonal trend from late winter to late spring. Zanis et al.

This seasonal pattern and magnitude are controlled by a combination of two factors. Although O<sub>3</sub> produced by photochemical activity accumulates from winter to summer, the East Asian monsoon brings pristine air masses from the Pacific Ocean during summer, yielding the spring maximum and the summer minimum (Tanimoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR375">2005</xref>). It should be noted that the mean concentration at the spring peak during the period from 2008 to 2012 at HPO is 70 ppb, which is higher than those at European and North American sites owing to the substantial effects of anthropogenic activity in East Asia. It is considered likely that air mass intrusion from the stratosphere might not contribute directly to the high springtime O<sub>3</sub> concentration at HPO, according to analysis of the correlation between O<sub>3</sub> and absolute humidity (Kajii et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">1998</xref>). In East Siberia, the seasonal cycle of O<sub>3</sub> at MDY showed a spring maximum and summer minimum (~50 ppb; Pochanart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR295">2003</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>k). This summer minimum is not caused by a continental–marine air mass exchange because MDY is located in the middle of Siberia. Rather, it is caused by an O<sub>3</sub> sink that includes surface deposition and more active vegetation (Pochanart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR295">2003</xref>). Wild et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR420">2004</xref>) reported that the mean European influence on the O<sub>3</sub> concentration at MDY varied between 3.5 ppb in spring and 0.5 ppb in summer. In South Asia, the seasonal cycle at PYR showed a spring maximum and a summer minimum (~65 ppb; Bonasoni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>m), which is similar to the case in East Asia. This likely occurred because PYR is under a greater influence from the South Asian monsoon, which brings clean maritime air masses during summer (Bonasoni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>). In addition, STE events at PYR showed frequency maxima during the dry winter and pre-monsoon spring seasons, which affected the O<sub>3</sub> concentration (Bracci et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2012</xref>; Cristofanelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2009a</xref>). The estimated average O<sub>3</sub> increase with respect to the average mean values by STE events for the period from 2006 to 2008 was 24 % (Bracci et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2012</xref>). The seasonal cycle of O<sub>3</sub> at MAB also depends on the South Asian monsoon. However, springtime O<sub>3</sub> at MAB did not show a value as high as that at PYR, and the seasonal cycle was characterized by the summer minimum and late autumn–winter maximum in the period from October to February of ~50 ppb (Naja et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR259">2003</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>n). It is considered likely that one of the reasons for the disagreement is the altitude difference of approximately 3400 m. Because the stratospheric influence generally increases with an increase of altitude, PYR was frequently influenced by STE in spring (Bracci et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2012</xref>; Cristofanelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2009a</xref>).</p><p id="Par117">In central Asia, a broad summer maximum was found in the surface O<sub>3</sub> concentration observed at ISK (~50 ppb; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>j) in Kyrgyzstan and at WLG on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau (~60 ppb; Ding and Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2006</xref>; Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR217">2007</xref>; Liang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR227">2008</xref>; Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239">2005</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR416">2006</xref>; Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR432">2015</xref>; Xue et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR433">2011</xref>; Zhu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR456">2004</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>i). Analyses of the summer maximum at WLG have yielded contradicting results that have led to two competing hypotheses on its cause: long-range transport of polluted air masses from central–eastern China and intrusion of O<sub>3</sub>-rich air masses from the stratosphere. In a three-dimensional (3D) regional chemical transport model study, Zhu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR456">2004</xref>) concluded that the seasonal O<sub>3</sub> transitions associated with the Asian monsoon system and transport from eastern–central China, central–South Asia, and even Europe are responsible for the distinct seasonal O<sub>3</sub> cycle at WLG. An alternative theory is that downward transport of air masses from the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere plays a key role in controlling the seasonal cycle of O<sub>3</sub> at WLG (Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239">2005</xref>). An analysis of O<sub>3</sub> measurements and tropospheric and stratospheric tracers such as water vapor, CO, NMHCs, PV, and δ<sup>18</sup>O (CO<sub>2</sub>) attributed the summertime O<sub>3</sub> enhancements at WLG to stratospheric intrusion rather than the transport of anthropogenic pollution (Ding and Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2006</xref>; Liang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR227">2008</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR416">2006</xref>). From measurements of <sup>7</sup>Be and <sup>210</sup>Pb, Lee et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR217">2007</xref>) suggested that the combined processes of the downward transport of the stratospheric–upper tropospheric air masses and the long-range transport of polluted air masses from eastern–central China caused the summertime O<sub>3</sub> peak. A model calculation using the Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System (NAQPMS) estimated the contributions of the regional transport of photochemically produced O<sub>3</sub> and stratospheric O<sub>3</sub> at 10–25 and ~5 ppb, respectively (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR225">2009</xref>). An analysis of backward trajectories for the period from 2000 to 2009 revealed that air masses from central–eastern China dominated the airflow at WLG in summer, suggesting strong impacts of anthropogenic forcing on the surface O<sub>3</sub> and other trace constituents such as CO, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>, PAN, HNO<sub>3</sub>, and particulate nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) on the Tibetan Plateau (Xue et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR433">2011</xref>). Using a photochemical box model constrained by observations, Xue et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR434">2013</xref>) calculated the photochemical budgets of O<sub>3</sub> and radicals and showed that O<sub>3</sub> production was significantly greater than O<sub>3</sub> destruction during daytime in both spring and summer, which is indicative of net O<sub>3</sub> production in both seasons. In contrast, Ma et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR238">2002</xref>) reported that the net O<sub>3</sub> production is positive in winter but negative in summer. Xue et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR434">2013</xref>) determined that the key factor leading to this disagreement was the difference in NO levels and suggested that the transport of anthropogenic pollution from central–eastern China might perturb the chemistry in the background atmosphere over the Tibetan Plateau. The circumstances described above indicate that the summer maximum at WLG can be attributed to the transport of anthropogenic pollution. Based on the source-receptor analysis, Nagashima et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR258">2010</xref>) suggested that the summer maximum of O<sub>3</sub> at ISK was mainly due to the enhanced contribution of O<sub>3</sub> produced in the surrounding regions.</p><p id="Par118">In North America, three different types of seasonal cycle were found in surface O<sub>3</sub>. A spring maximum was observed at WHI (~50 ppb; Macdonald et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">2011</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>r) and CHA (~55 ppb; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>y). A broad spring–summer maximum was observed at GRB (~50 ppb; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>w), LAV (~45 ppb; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>u), MBO (~50 ppb; Gratz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2015</xref>; Weiss-Penzias et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR418">2007</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>s), NWR (~55 ppb; Oltmans and Levy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR270">1994</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>v), and YEL (~50 ppb; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>t). A distinct summer maximum was observed at YOS (~60 ppb; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>x). It is possible that these types of seasonal cycle in western North America reflect a difference in the influence of the boundary layer at each site. All high-O<sub>3</sub> events at MBO were observed between early March and late September and were caused by the Asian long-range transport, the subsidence of O<sub>3</sub>-rich air from the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere, and the mixed influence of these two mechanisms (Ambrose et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>). Therefore, the seasonal cycle at MBO might have been caused by the spring peak of background O<sub>3</sub> in the Northern Hemisphere and high O<sub>3</sub> events occurring between early spring and late summer.</p><p id="Par119">Compared with the Northern Hemisphere, O<sub>3</sub> seasonal cycle observations have not been conducted extensively in the Southern Hemisphere and the equatorial regions, and the O<sub>3</sub> seasonal cycles observed at MKN and TAR, which are located in the tropics, appear to be rather flat relative to those at other mid-latitude sites. The O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at MKN exhibit little variation, with a minimum in November and a broad maximum in boreal summer (Henne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2008</xref>). This cycle can be explained by the seasonal variation of monsoon flow over equatorial East Africa, which is driven by seasonal displacement of the ITCZ. Although the seasonal variations in O<sub>3</sub> at TAR were not pronounced (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>p), based on observations from 2006 to 2008, Toh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR385">2013</xref>) reported a substantial seasonal cycle associated with a minimum that occurred twice a year in the November–December and March–April timeframes, along with a maximum that occurred in the summer monsoon season in late May–September, which that coincided with the regional biomass burning period. This discrepancy is likely to be due to the interannual variability of O<sub>3</sub> in tropical regions. The seasonal cycle at ASK, which is located in the Sahara Desert of Algeria between IZO and MKN, has an autumn minimum and a summer maximum in the July–August timeframe (~45 ppb; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>g). In South America, the seasonal cycle of O<sub>3</sub> observed at LQO is characterized by an autumn minimum in the March to May period and a spring maximum in September–October timeframe (~40 ppb; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>z). It should be noted that while these O<sub>3</sub> maximum periods coincide with the August to October biomass burning season in the Southern Hemisphere (Duncan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2003</xref>), the actual mechanism involved in the seasonal cycles has not been investigated.</p><p id="Par120">The latitudinal gradient in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> has also been discussed in previous research. For example, Scheel et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR333">1997</xref>) found that the O<sub>3</sub> seasonal cycle amplitude was smaller in the northwest area than in the southeast area within Europe, and Winkler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR421">1988</xref>) showed that the surface O<sub>3</sub> concentration over the Atlantic Ocean, which was twice as high in the Northern Hemisphere as that in the Southern Hemisphere, generally increased with latitude, and then dropped rapidly at 70° N. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the annual mean concentrations and the amplitude (annual maximum and minimum) of the seasonal cycles of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> observed at the mountain sites as a function of latitude or altitude for the period of 2008 to 2012. As can be seen in this figure, the mean O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and the seasonal amplitude generally increased with latitude for the range of 0°–40° N and decreased or stabilized at higher latitudes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). The means were ~50 ppb in Europe and 30–45 ppb in Africa. Those in Asia were 35–50 ppb depending on the location, although three maxima were noted above 45 ppb at WLG, PYR, and HPO. In particular, the maxima at HPO and PYR were higher than those at other sites. Although one of the reasons for such a high value at PYR is believed to be its altitude at 5079 m a.s.l., no altitude dependency was observed for the annual mean O<sub>3</sub> concentration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Therefore, the high maximum values at PYR and HPO are associated with their seasonal cycle spring maxima. The minima were in the range of 30–50 ppb for all of the mid-latitude stations except for LLN. The tropical sites differed from other mid-latitude sites, showing small variability over the course of the year. Insufficient data were available to discuss the latitudinal gradient south of ~20° N. The seasonal amplitude for the 22 stations was 10–20 ppb, and again, the magnitude was generally dependent on the latitude. Moreover, the seasonal amplitude at MAB, LLN, HPO, and PYR, at ~25–30 ppb (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d) was substantially larger than that at the other stations. This result was caused by either a larger spring or autumn maximum due to intense photochemical production, and a smaller summer minimum due to the Asian monsoon, than those reported at other sites. No altitude dependency was observed for the amplitude of the O<sub>3</sub> concentration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Annual mean concentration and range (maximum–minimum) of seasonal cycles of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> observed at mountain sites with respect to latitude and altitude of station (<bold>a</bold>–<bold>d</bold>).

The abundance of O<sub>3</sub> was first observed in the 19th century. The relevancies of old measurement data were examined and an apparent increase in the background O<sub>3</sub> levels was observed throughout the 20th century in Europe (Marenco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR243">1994</xref>; Volz and Kley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR413">1988</xref>). More recently, Gilge et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2010</xref>) calculated the long-term trends for surface O<sub>3</sub> at SNB, ZUG/ZSF, and JFJ to be 0.22 ± 0.17 ppb year<sup>−1</sup> (1989–2007), 0.42 ± 0.09 ppb year<sup>−1</sup> (1975–2007), and 0.26 ± 0.16 ppb year<sup>−1</sup> (1986–2007), respectively. During the past 40 years, the O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at ZUG/ZSF showed significant increases in the 1980s that slowed in the 1990s (Gilge et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2010</xref>; Logan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">2012</xref>; Oltmans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR275">2013</xref>; Parrish et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR284">2012</xref>). In the 1990s, O<sub>3</sub> increases at European stations including SNB, CMN, ARO, ZUG/ZSF, and JFJ were broadly observed, indicating that the increasing trend of O<sub>3</sub> is a regional-scale phenomenon. The O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at European stations peaked in the late 1990s or early 2000s, followed by the current decreasing trend (Brönnimann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2002</xref>; Cristofanelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2015</xref>; Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2011</xref>; Gilge et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2010</xref>; Logan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">2012</xref>; Parrish et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR284">2012</xref>; Oltmans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR275">2013</xref>; Staehelin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR361">1994</xref>). For the period from 2000 to 2009, Logan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">2012</xref>) calculated the mean rate of O<sub>3</sub> decrease at seven European alpine sites including SNB, ZUG/ZSF, and JFJ to be −0.16 ± 0.14 ppb year<sup>−1</sup>. They discussed possible contributing factors to the O<sub>3</sub> changes in central Europe, including changes in stratospheric input and in O<sub>3</sub> precursors. In addition, they showed that emissions of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> from both the USA and Europe were almost constant in the 1980s but decreased in the 1990s. Model studies have suggested that variations in domestic emissions should have the largest influence on O<sub>3</sub> in summer, whereas variations in emissions in North America and Asia should have the largest influence in spring and late autumn over Europe (Fiore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2009</xref>; Jonson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">2010</xref>). Such studies concluded that CO and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions should have only a minor influence on O<sub>3</sub> trends. However, the relationship between the observed O<sub>3</sub> trends and anthropogenic emission changes is complex. Although total anthropogenic NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions at northern mid-latitudes increased by only ~14 % for the period from 1980 to 2010, long-term O<sub>3</sub> trends showed remarkable increases (Parrish et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR286">2014</xref>). The long-term trend for surface O<sub>3</sub> at KSL in Caucasus differed from that in central and southern Europe (Senik and Elansky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR348">2001</xref>; Tarasova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR379">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR381">2009</xref>) with the former showing a decreasing trend in the 1990s (Senik and Elansky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR348">2001</xref>; Tarasova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR379">2003</xref>). For the period from 1991 to 2001, a strong concentration change of −0.91 ± 0.17 ppb year<sup>−1</sup> was observed, after which the O<sub>3</sub> changes decreased to −0.37 ± 0.14 ppb year<sup>−1</sup> for the period from 1997 to 2006 (Tarasova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR381">2009</xref>). Tarasova et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR381">2009</xref>) reported that the O<sub>3</sub> surface trend difference was caused by differences in the station locations relative to the source areas affecting the O<sub>3</sub> variations. The decreasing O<sub>3</sub> trend at KSL was caused by both substantial emission decreases in the 1990s due to the breakdown of the former USSR and emission control measures implemented in Europe.</p><p id="Par122">In the North Atlantic, the surface O<sub>3</sub> record at IZO showed a slightly positive trend at 0.09 ± 0.02 ppb year<sup>−1</sup> for the period from 1988 to 2009 with a rapid increase between 1996 and 1998 (Cuevas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2013</xref>). Cuevas et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2013</xref>) suggested that the abrupt changes in the O<sub>3</sub> levels reflect a phase shift of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), which altered the transport pattern to IZO. The predominant high positive phase of the NAO changed from 1995 to 1996. IZO is influenced by flow from both the mid-latitudes and the subtropics and NAO changes have resulted in an increased flow of the Westerlies in the mid-latitude subtropical North Atlantic, thus favoring the transport of O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors from North America. This process increased the tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> in the subtropical North Atlantic region after 1996.</p><p id="Par123">In East Asia, a positive O<sub>3</sub> surface trend at 0.25 ± 0.17 ppb year<sup>−1</sup> was observed at WLG for the period from 1994 to 2013 (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR432">2015</xref>), and an especially strong increase was found in autumn, followed by spring. HPO in Japan experienced a generally large increase in springtime O<sub>3</sub> compared with the increases over Europe and North America during the 2000s (Tanimoto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR374">2009</xref>; Parrish et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR284">2012</xref>). The mean growth rate in springtime O<sub>3</sub> was ~1 ppb year<sup>−1</sup> for the period from 1998 to 2006 (Tanimoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR377">2009</xref>). Tanimoto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR377">2009</xref>) showed that variations in NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions and satellite observations of tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> for East Asia were consistent with a remarkable increase of O<sub>3</sub> at HPO. Although this increasing trend is consistent with the increasing anthropogenic emissions in East Asia, it can only explain half of the observed increase by the model calculation. In the western USA, positive trends in springtime O<sub>3</sub> concentrations have been reported (e.g., Cooper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2014</xref>; Jaffe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">2003b</xref>; Jaffe and Ray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">2007</xref>; Parrish et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR284">2012</xref>; Vingarzan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR411">2004</xref>). Jaffe and Ray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">2007</xref>) reported positive trends in O<sub>3</sub> concentration at LAV and at YEL in all seasons with growth rates of 0.33 and 0.50 ppb year<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, based on the analysis of deseasonalized monthly mean O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (daytime data only) for the period from 1987 to 2004. Moreover, they proposed possible explanations for these O<sub>3</sub> trends that include (1) increases in regional emissions, (2) changes in the distribution of emissions, (3) increases in biomass burning in the western USA, and (4) increases in global background O<sub>3</sub>. Jaffe et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2008</xref>) showed that the increase in fires is largely responsible for the increase in summertime O<sub>3</sub>, but fires could not explain the trend in O<sub>3</sub> for other seasons. Jaffe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">2011</xref>) found statistically significant correlations between springtime O<sub>3</sub> at 11 sites in the western USA including CHA, GRB, and YEL and free tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>, as measured by an ozonesonde in Boulder. This correlation indicates a downward transport of enhanced O<sub>3</sub> from the FT to the surface. In summer, free tropospheric and surface O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and the number of days exceeding the US National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) threshold were all significantly correlated with emissions from biomass burning in the western USA. This also indicates that wildfires had a large impact on O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in the western USA. The mean springtime O<sub>3</sub> at MBO showed significant increases of 0.73 ± 0.54 ppb year<sup>−1</sup> for the period from 2004 to 2013, whereas the annual mean O<sub>3</sub> did not show a significant trend (Gratz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2015</xref>). An analysis of transport patterns by Gratz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2015</xref>) suggested that long-range transport from Asia has a dominant influence on the increasing springtime O<sub>3</sub>. At HPO and MBO, which are both strongly influenced by springtime outflow from East Asia, the O<sub>3</sub> levels showed larger increases at higher percentile levels than those at lower percentile levels (Gratz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2015</xref>; Tanimoto <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR374">2009</xref>). A statistically significant positive trend in the mean maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O<sub>3</sub> concentration at 0.12 ppb year<sup>−1</sup> was observed at CHA for the period from 1989 to 2010 (Chalbot et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2013</xref>). The surface O<sub>3</sub> recorded at MLO in the Northern Pacific has shown a significant increase of 0.16 ± 0.04 ppb decade<sup>−1</sup> (Oltmans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR275">2013</xref>). Oltmans et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR275">2013</xref>) showed an increasing trend into the early 2000s followed by a decline in later years. In the earliest period, the increase was observed primarily in spring, but in the most recent decade, increases during autumn and early winter were observed to be greater. This change is attributed to a shift in the transport pattern associated with greater outflow from higher latitudes north of 30° N (Oltmans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR274">2006</xref>). Such a seasonal shift in the O<sub>3</sub> maximum has not been observed at most stations in the mid-latitudes, but shifts in the seasonal cycle to an earlier time of the year were observed at ZUG/ZSF, at 5.1 ± 3.5 days decade<sup>−1</sup> (Parrish et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR285">2013</xref>); JFJ, at 5.6 ± 4.1 days decade<sup>−1</sup> (Parrish et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR285">2013</xref>); and LAV, at 14 ± 19 days decade<sup>−1</sup> (Cooper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2014</xref>; Parrish et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR285">2013</xref>). Additional studies are needed to determine why the seasonal O<sub>3</sub> cycle shifts across northern mid-latitudes are only seen at some sites and not others. Parrish et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR286">2014</xref>) showed comparisons of long-term O<sub>3</sub> records observed at northern mid-latitude sites with three chemistry–climate model results. Some disagreement was noted between the observed and modeled results, suggesting that only limited confidence can be placed in the estimates of the present RF of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> derived from modeled historic concentration changes and in the prediction of future O<sub>3</sub> concentrations.</p><p id="Par124">Some differences between the changes in O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at high-altitude sites and those at low-latitude sites have been observed. The temporal behavior at Mace Head, which is a remote site in western Ireland, was similar to that at the alpine site, even though the O<sub>3</sub> increase in the late 1990s occurred earlier at ZUG/ZSF than at Mace Head (Logan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">2012</xref>). Parrish et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR284">2012</xref>) showed the long-term O<sub>3</sub> trends of 11 datasets regarded as baseline conditions. These datasets covered the range from low level to FT level, and included ZUG/ZSF, ARO, JFJ, HPO, and LAV data. They showed that both absolute O<sub>3</sub> concentrations and positive trends in O<sub>3</sub> generally increased with the altitude of the measurement site. In addition, they suggested that the changes in O<sub>3</sub> concentration showed a high degree of longitudinal uniformity over the last half of the 20th century at northern mid-latitudes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Carbon monoxide</title><p id="Par125">In the Northern Hemisphere, the seasonal maximum of CO occurs in late winter and early spring, and the seasonal minimum occurs in summer (Novelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR264">1998</xref>); the maximum occurs 3 to 4 months after the seasonal minimum in OH radicals. The summer minimum in CO is explained well by the maximum occurrence of OH radicals, which are a CO main sink in the troposphere. The time lag for the CO maximum in late winter–early spring reflects the mixed effects of the seasonal variations in OH radical concentrations and CO emissions. The slower chemical destruction of CO by OH leads to a longer CO lifetime in winter, which allows more accumulation. Because the lifetime of CO is long enough for it to be transported across the globe, the long-range transport of industrial and biomass burning emissions originating on the Asian and North American continents can have substantial impacts on seasonal variations, depending on the location of the observation site (Novelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR265">2003</xref>; Pfister et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR291">2006</xref>; Yurganov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR437">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR438">2005</xref>).</p><p id="Par126">Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows seasonal cycles of CO at 16 high-altitude stations around the globe.

Similar to that of O<sub>3</sub>, the seasonal pattern and magnitude are controlled by a combination of two factors: the impact of continental outflow from the Asian continent from winter to spring and the East Asian monsoon that brings pristine air masses from the Pacific Ocean during summer. It should also be noted that the mean concentration of the spring peak during the period from 2008 to 2012 at HPO and LLN was between 200 and 250 ppb, which is higher than those at European and North American sites, due to substantial impacts from anthropogenic activities in East Asia in the case at HPO (Pochanart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR296">2004</xref>), and Southeast Asia biomass burning activities in the case at LLN (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2013</xref>; Ou-Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR277">2014</xref>).

The seasonal cycle at MDY is a typical pattern with a spring maximum and a summer minimum (Pochanart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR295">2003</xref>). Wild et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR420">2004</xref>) reported that the mean European influence on the CO concentration at MDY varied between 30 ppb in spring and 10 ppb in summer. However, the seasonal pattern at WLG (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR454">2011</xref>) has a broad spring and summer maximum, which is similar to that of O<sub>3</sub> at WLG, thereby suggesting that both O<sub>3</sub> and CO are controlled by the same mechanism. At WLG, the CO data plotted in the present study showed a different seasonal cycle from that found by Zhang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR454">2011</xref>), which showed a late winter and early spring maximum. This discrepancy is likely caused by large interannual variability and variance in the flask sampling data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>i).</p><p id="Par131">In the tropics, the seasonal cycle of MKN, located in the equatorial region, differs from that at other stations. The maximum CO levels occur in January to March, followed by a sharp decrease toward April and May and an increase by the end of the year (Henne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2008</xref>). Henne et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2008</xref>) determined that this seasonal cycle is associated with two maxima in February and August and is caused by the oscillation of monsoon circulation. The winter and spring maximum is caused by advection of CO-enriched air masses in the Northern Hemisphere during boreal winter. In contrast, the summer maximum was observed during advection of air masses from the Southern Hemisphere that were affected by biomass-burning emissions in southern Africa.</p><p id="Par132">Similar to O<sub>3</sub>, CO also shows a gradient from south to north and greater seasonal amplitude in the Northern Hemisphere than that in the Southern Hemisphere. Based on the analysis of the global distribution of surface CO determined by flask sampling, Novelli et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR265">2003</xref>) revealed a gradient between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, with a greater seasonal amplitude in the Northern Hemisphere than that in the Southern Hemisphere and greater interannual variations in CO concentrations in the Southern Hemisphere than that in the Northern Hemisphere. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows the annual mean concentrations and amplitude of the seasonal cycles of tropospheric CO observed at the mountain sites as a function of altitude or latitude for the period from 2008 to 2012. The annual mean concentrations and amplitude (annual maximum/minimum) of the seasonal cycles of CO generally increased with latitude (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c, d). This is a reverse latitudinal distribution of tropospheric OH (e.g., Spivakovsky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR360">1990</xref>). The annual mean concentrations and amplitude of the seasonal cycles of CO generally decreased with altitude (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), reflecting the fact that the emission sources of CO are located at the ground surface. The means were from 120 to 180 ppb in Europe and Asia and 100 ppb in Africa, and the maxima at HPO and LLN were higher than those at other sites. One of the reasons for such a high value at HPO is believed to be its averaging of the period from 1998 to 2003. The seasonal amplitude for the 15 stations except for LLN fell into the range of 85 to 180 ppb (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b, d). The large seasonal amplitude at LLN was caused by a high spring maximum of ~215 ppb due to biomass burning activity in Southeast Asia (Ou-Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR277">2014</xref>), rather than the low CO of ~85 ppb in summer due to the Asian monsoon, because the summertime CO concentration at LLN was not significantly lower than that at other stations.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Annual mean concentration and range (maximum–minimum) of seasonal cycles of tropospheric CO observed at mountain sites with respect to latitude and altitude of station (<bold>a</bold>–<bold>d</bold>).

Based on observations from NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory sites, Novelli et al.

Worden et al.

They stated that further studies are needed in order to understand the trends and the contributions from anthropogenic emissions and possible changes in atmospheric chemistry through reactions with OH radicals.

In the troposphere, NMHCs are predominantly transformed not only by the chemical processes of photolysis and reaction with OH radical typically during daytime but also by reaction with the NO<sub>3</sub> radical during nighttime, and reaction with O<sub>3</sub> for unsaturated species, in addition to coastal and marine area reactions with chlorine (Cl) atoms, during daytime (Atkinson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2000</xref>). The reaction rate constants increase with molecular weight within a given class of NMHCs, causing lighter, saturated NMHCs to exhibit slower atmospheric decay and longer lifetimes (Atkinson and Arey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2003</xref>). NMHC concentrations are determined by the strength of the emission sources and their atmospheric removal processes. Generally, the seasonal cycles of NMHCs show a maximum in winter and a minimum in summer owing to reaction with OH radicals. NMHC concentration ratios are useful indicators of the degree of photochemical processing or aging because NMHCs are removed at different rates, and their concentration patterns change during transport due to reaction rate differences, which span several orders of magnitude (e.g., Helmig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par135">Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows the seasonal cycles of NMHCs at eight high-altitude stations.

This pattern corresponds to the climate pattern in equatorial East Africa induced by the displacement of the ITCZ. Acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>), with a lifetime of ~16 days, showed a distinct seasonal cycle with a winter maximum and summer minimum at CMN with ~340 ppt (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>h), IZO with ~250–280 ppt (Schmitt and Volz-Thomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR334">1997</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>j), and MLO with ~260–320 ppt (Greenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">1996</xref>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>k).

For the period from 1998 to 2009, the overall annual averages of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> were the highest in 2003, which was the hottest year in recorded European history caused by an exceptionally prolonged summer heat wave (e.g., Tressol et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR386">2008</xref>).

These emissions are illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>. HPO, which is located near the Sea of Japan, is an appropriate site for assessing the influence of air mass transport from the continent. Wild et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR420">2004</xref>) estimated that local sources in Japan and regional East Asian sources contributed about 15 and 8 %, respectively, to O<sub>3</sub> observed at HPO in April 1996. The mass concentration of BC at HPO in a study by Liu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR232">2013</xref>) showed the highest value in spring and the lowest value in winter. By using the 3D Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) chemical transport model combined with the Process, Age, and Source Region Chasing Algorithm (PASCAL) source and process apportionment method, Liu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR232">2013</xref>) estimated that approximately 53 % of the observed BC was transported from northern China. Tanimoto et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR377">2009</xref>) examined the contribution of Asian anthropogenic emissions to the observed O<sub>3</sub> trends at HPO by using CMAQ. However, a discrepancy was found between the observation and model results, thereby suggesting a significant underestimation of the actual growth of the Asian anthropogenic emissions or incompleteness of the modeling of pollution exported from continental Asia. MBO has proven to be effectively positioned for observing the transpacific transport of Asian plumes. Ambrose et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>) described the detailed mechanism of Asian long-range transport to MBO. Surface emissions are lifted from the Asian boundary layer into the FT by convective, frontal, and orographic lifting (Bey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2001</xref>; Cooper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2004</xref>; Liang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR226">2004</xref>; Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR230">2003a</xref>). Frontal lifting is the primary mechanism for delivering eastern Asian emissions to the FT (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR231">2003a</xref>). Once lifted to the FT, pollutants can be efficiently transported eastward toward North America by the prevailing westerly winds. Stohl et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR365">2002</xref>) estimated the time scale of the trans-Pacific transport in the FT to be from 4 to 10 days. Subsidence wind over the northeast Pacific delivers air masses bearing Asian emissions to the lower FT over the US West Coast. This eastward export of Asian emissions is most efficient in spring due to intense frontal activity coupled with a strong westerly jet over the central Pacific (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR230">2003a</xref>; Yienger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR435">2000</xref>). A calculation using the Goddard Earth Observing System chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) revealed that, during the Intercontinental Chemical Transport Experiment Phase B (INTEX-B) period (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR453">2009b</xref>), most of the O<sub>3</sub> production in Asian O<sub>3</sub> pollution events occurred over East Asia, with maxima over northeast China and southern Japan in the spring of 2006. This model predicted significant O3 production over the North Pacific during plume transport. The plume on May 1 passed a more northerly and higher-altitude route than that on May 10, resulting in less O<sub>3</sub> production over the Pacific (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR451">2008</xref>). Both plumes showed a secondary O<sub>3</sub> production maximum at the West Coast of the USA, where the subsidence of air masses caused PAN decomposition and more O<sub>3</sub> production (e.g., Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR451">2008</xref>). In addition to the trans-Pacific transport, regional pollution from North America has been observed at MBO (Fischer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2010b</xref>; Primbs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR299">b</xref>; Reidmiller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR311">2010</xref>; Strode et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR368">2008</xref>; Weiss-Penzias et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR417">2006</xref>) and WHI (Macdonald et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">2011</xref>). The influence of Asian anthropogenic emissions on MLO has been identified through observations of CO (Jaffe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">1997</xref>) and aerosols (Perry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR288">1999</xref>). Jaffe et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">1997</xref>) concluded that the majority of the elevated CO events occurred during spring and were usually associated with transport from Asia. Perry et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR288">1999</xref>) estimated that at least one third of the sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>) species including sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), ammonium bisulfate ((NH<sub>4</sub>)HSO<sub>4</sub>), and ammonium sulfate ((NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) detected during spring from 1993 to 1996 were anthropogenic in origin. This result is consistent with the seasonal cycles of bromine (Br), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn), high concentrations of which are found in the fine fractions of fly ash from coal-fired power plants. Levy and Moxim (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR223">1989</xref>) concluded that the NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> maximum in the summer was caused by fossil fuel combustion in the USA, and that the Asian emissions contributed to only a small increase in spring.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic overview of long-range transport pathways for dust (<italic>blue arrows</italic>), anthropogenic pollutants (<italic>yellow arrows</italic>), biomass burning (<italic>red arrows</italic>), and volcanic emissions (<italic>green arrows</italic>), which have been reported in the literature over time</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40645_2016_109_Fig9_HTML.gif" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par140">Air masses affected by anthropogenic emissions have been observed at WLG by the enhancement of O<sub>3</sub>, CO, NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>, total gaseous mercury (TGM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Backward trajectory analysis at WLG for the summers of 2000 to 2009 suggests the dominance of anthropogenic pollution transported from central and eastern China in most years (Xue et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR433">2011</xref>). Fu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2012</xref>) identified potential source regions of anthropogenic pollutants at WLG as eastern Gansu, eastern Qinghai, western Shanxi, Ningxia, and northern India, while Zhang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR452">2009a</xref>) described the transport mechanisms for polluted air from Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu province. They found that the plumes from Lanzhou were advected by strong easterly winds, which were vented to the FT by a belt-like mountain and were transported to WLG, either directly or by mixing, by nighttime mountain breezes. In addition, the high concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) such as hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs), and polybrominated biphenyls (PBDEs) were found to be related mainly to air masses passing over Russia and Kazakhstan (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2007</xref>). The particle number concentration at WLG was higher during the summer and lower during the rest of the year in the study of Kivekäs et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">2009</xref>). Their back trajectory analysis revealed that air masses transported from the east are associated with higher particle number concentrations than those transported from other directions. As a result, they concluded that the eastern air masses might be affected by regional pollution sources such as Xining and Lanzhou.</p><p id="Par141">The atmospheric conditions at PYR can be influenced by the transport of polluted air masses from South Asia and the Indo–Gangetic Plains and the ABCs extend from the Indian Ocean to the Himalayan ridge (Bonasoni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>). Bonasoni et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>) showed that a mountain valley can provide an efficient channel favoring the transport of pollutants to high altitudes when the brown clouds extend as far as the Himalayan foothills under active valley breezes. They found that the most frequent direct transport of brown clouds occurred during the pre-monsoon season, occupying 20 % of total pre-monsoon days. Aerosol total number concentration, aerosol optical properties, PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>1–10</sub>, and BC showed a maximum during the pre-monsoon season and a minimum during the monsoon season (Marcq et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR242">2010</xref>; Marinoni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR246">2010</xref>; Sellegri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR346">2010</xref>). The monsoon minimum was attributed to wet scavenging caused by frequent clouds and precipitation. The pre-monsoon maximum was linked to an increase in anthropogenic emissions in the Indian subcontinent coupled with dry meteorological conditions, and to the large vertical extent of the regional PBL on the Indo–Gangetic Plains. At MAB, ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>), NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, and non-sea-salt SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> (nss-SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>) aerosol concentrations showed a distinctive seasonal cycle, with a decrease (increase) during the wet (dry) season (Rastogi and Sarin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR308">2005</xref>). They attributed the low levels of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, and nss-SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> concentrations during the wet season to the predominance of the oceanic air mass and the high levels during the dry season to the enhanced downwind transport of pollutants and the lack of wet removal. The relative enrichment of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> and nss-SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> and their linear relationship in PM<sub>2.5</sub> suggests that their predominant source is anthropogenic in northern India in winter (Kumar and Sarin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">2010</xref>). Francis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2012</xref>) identified a high sulpher dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>) region surrounded by (30° N, 75° E) north of MAB by using the GEOS-Chem model and concluded that the observed spikes in SO<sub>2</sub> concentration at MAB were caused by the transport from that high-SO<sub>2</sub> region.</p><p id="Par142">Emissions transported from North America have been observed at IZO (Cuevas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2013</xref>; Schultz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR341">1998</xref>), PMO (Honrath et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2004</xref>), ARO (Huntrieser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2005</xref>), ZUG/ZSF (Huntrieser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2005</xref>), and JFJ (Guerova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2006</xref>; Huntrieser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2005</xref>; Pandey Deolal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR280">2013</xref>). Most of the elevated CO events observed at PMO during the summers of 2001 to 2003 were attributed to the outflow of North American pollution and the long-range transport of biomass-burning emissions, whereas O<sub>3</sub> and CO concentrations were strongly correlated with the flow from the eastern USA when the biomass-burning effects were absent (Honrath et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2004</xref>). The concentration ratios of NMHCs have been used as indicators of the degree of photochemical processing or aging, mainly via reaction with OH radicals, because the ratios evolve as atmospheric processing occurs depending on the individual OH rate constants (e.g., Parrish et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR283">2007</xref>). Honrath et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">2008</xref>) demonstrated that continuous measurements of NMHCs are a useful tool for identifying and characterizing pollution transport events. Owen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR278">2006</xref>) described the transport mechanisms of North American CO emissions to PMO in the lower FT over the central North Atlantic. They found that two mechanisms were responsible for the export of pollution from the North American boundary layer that led to the enhanced CO events at PMO: direct advection from the continental boundary layer eastward over the Atlantic Ocean and uplift ahead of cold fronts. In another study, NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> levels were significantly increased in the presence of North American anthropogenic emissions (Val Martin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR399">2008a</xref>). Zhang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR455">2014</xref>) analyzed the chemical evolution of two pollution plumes transported from North America to PMO in the summers of 2009 and 2010. They concluded that the enhanced change in O<sub>3</sub> relative to CO (ΔO<sub>3</sub>/ΔCO), which has been frequently used as an indicator of O<sub>3</sub> production in transported plumes, might not reflect O<sub>3</sub> chemistry alone, and that the CO destruction in the plume could also explain the higher values. Kumar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">2013</xref>) showed significant decreasing trends of CO and O<sub>3</sub> for the period from 2001 to 2011 by in situ measurements at PMO and model simulations using GEOS-Chem. They concluded that the most important factor contributing to these decreasing trends was the decline in anthropogenic emissions from North America. Under the framework of the Convective Transport of Trace Gases into the Middle and Upper Troposphere over Europe (CONTRACE) project, aged plumes of North American pollution that passed over Europe were observed by Huntrieser et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2005</xref>) at ARO, ZUG/ZSF, and JFJ. They used the FLEXible PARTicle (FLEXPART) Lagrangian particle dispersion model to simulate the transport pathway of the pollution plume over the Atlantic and its dispersion over Europe. The passage of the North American plumes over Europe required almost 3 days. The time elapsed since the pollutant emission, derived by the NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>/CO slope in the polluted plumes, was in good agreement with that simulated by the FLEXPART age spectra. Furthermore, a positive correlation between O<sub>3</sub> and CO in the plumes suggested that photochemical O<sub>3</sub> production occurred. A comparison of the model results with observations at JFJ revealed that the GEOS-Chem model tended to underestimate the O<sub>3</sub> concentrations (Guerova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2006</xref>). Because the stratospheric contribution to the estimates based on the <sup>7</sup>Be/<sup>10</sup>B ratio was shown to be reasonable (Zanis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR444">2003b</xref>), Guerova et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2006</xref>) suggested that this discrepancy resulted from an underestimation of the European contribution. They found that a substantial North American contribution over Europe did not always result in O<sub>3</sub> enhancement in summer. Cui et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2009</xref>) estimated the contribution of stratospheric intrusion and intercontinental transport from the North American PBL to JFJ in 2005 by using FLEXPART and the Lagrangian analysis tool (LAGRANTO) trajectory model. They determined that JFJ was influenced by stratospheric intrusion during 19 and 18 % of the total annual time and by intercontinental transport from North American PBL during 13 and 12 % of the total annual time, as indicated by FLEXPART and LAGRANTO, respectively. At IZO, a good correlation between O<sub>3</sub> and CO in winter and spring was observed, suggesting long-range transport of photochemically generated O<sub>3</sub> from North America (Cuevas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2013</xref>). Sholkovitz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR353">2009</xref>) estimated that from 12 to 30 % of the annual apportionment of the soluble aerosol Fe fluxes was contributed by anthropogenic aerosols. IZO has also been influenced by North African pollution. During the summer, IZO remains in the altitude of the Saharan Air Layer (SAL), which is exported westward at low tropical latitudes (&lt;15° N) in winter and at higher subtropical latitudes in summer (15–30° N; Rodríguez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR323">2011</xref>). Rodríguez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR323">2011</xref>) suggested that North African industrial pollutants, including emissions from crude oil refineries, the phosphate-based fertilizer industry, and power plants located at the Atlantic coast of Morocco, northern Algeria, eastern Algeria, and Tunisia might be mixed with desert dust and before being exported to the North Atlantic in the SAL. Verver et al.

They determined that the influence of emissions from the Po Basin was strongest in the west Alps (JFJ), whereas the influence of emissions from Eastern Europe was strongest at SNB. In another study, the influences of meteorological processes on the regional transport to JFJ were subdivided into two categories: thermally driven transport, which occurs on a local scale, and transport at regional (foehn) or synoptic (front) scales (Forrer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2000</xref>). Thermally induced processes were observed mainly in spring and summer, and processes at the regional and synoptic scales were observed during the entire year. Continuous measurements of the total and backward scattering coefficients, absorption coefficient, condensation nuclei concentrations, epiphaniometer signals, total suspended particulate matter (TSP) mass concentrations, and major PM<sub>1</sub> and TSP compounds at JFJ have shown distinct seasonal cycles with a summer maximum and a winter minimum (Baltensperger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1997</xref>; Cozic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2008</xref>; Henning et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2003</xref>; Lugauer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR236">1998</xref>; Nyeki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR266">1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR267">b</xref>).

During winter, JFJ and SNB are influenced mainly by the clean FT, resulting in low concentrations of most aerosol components.

They determined that the concentrations at SNB maximized during summer, whereas an absence of seasonal variation was observed at the oceanic site. At ARO, the O<sub>3</sub> concentrations were found to depend significantly on the residence times of air masses over the polluted region of Europe during spring and summer (Pochanart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR294">2001</xref>). An increase in O<sub>3</sub> concentrations has been observed in the aged air masses, which is the result of direct photochemical accumulation of O<sub>3</sub> when the air masses pass over large-scale anthropogenically influenced regions in Europe. South foehn is a typical Alpine meteorological phenomenon characterized by south to north advection and is caused by a strong pressure gradient across the Alps that leads to a descending air stream northward (Seibert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR343">1990</xref>). Campana et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2005</xref>) observed enhanced O<sub>3</sub> concentrations during south foehn events during spring and summer at ARO. In the case of the south foehn, the continental-scale influence of pollutant emissions on O<sub>3</sub> appeared to be far less important than the direct influence of the Po Basin emissions. The main sources of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and CO are air masses with long residence times over the European continent (Kaiser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2007</xref>). Kaiser et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2007</xref>) showed the differences between the main NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> source regions, including northwest Europe and the region covering East Germany, the Czech Republic, and southeast Poland, and the main CO source regions including the central, northeastern, and eastern parts of Europe. The statistics for O<sub>3</sub> concentrations show strong seasonal effects. Near-ground air masses are poor (rich) in O<sub>3</sub> in winter (summer). The main source of high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations in winter is air masses that subside from higher elevations. During summer, the Mediterranean constitutes an important additional source of high O<sub>3</sub> concentrations, particularly for air masses that have crossed the Po Basin. The transport of polluted air masses from Europe and other continents can exert an influence on southern Europe and the Mediterranean basin. In particular, anthropogenic pollutants emitted from continental Europe are transported toward southern Europe and the Mediterranean basin during summer (e.g., Duncan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2008</xref>; Henne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2005</xref>). Based on modeled CO concentrations, Folini et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2009</xref>) quantified the regions of influence (ROIs) of 13 European rural background and high-altitude stations including SNB, CMN, ZUG/ZSF, and JFJ. The ROI definition of a measurement site is the area near the station from which surface emissions contribute substantially to the short-term variability of the measured trace gas concentrations. Folini et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2009</xref>) defined an individual site as one that roughly covers a circular area of 400 km in radius and said that large cities or other strong emission sources within 100 km from the site should be avoided. The seasonal cycle of BC at CMN was characterized by the presence of a winter minimum (December–January) and maxima in spring (April–May) and late summer (August–September), reflecting a higher efficiency of uplift during warmer months and the subsequent transport of polluted air masses from the boundary layer. In addition, a secondary minimum was observed in June, when wet deposition is expected to peak owing to maximum rainfall (Cristofanelli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2013</xref>). They indicated that CMN was affected by air masses rich in anthropogenic CO during spring and summer. In addition, Cristofanelli et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2013</xref>) identified three main regimes of the seasonal correlation among CO, O<sub>3</sub>, and BC at CMN: negative correlation between CO and O<sub>3</sub> during the period from October to December, significant positive correlation between CO and O<sub>3</sub> during the period from May to September, and almost no correlation between CO and O<sub>3</sub> and BC enhancements mainly associated with relatively old anthropogenic emissions during the period from January to April. They considered it likely that the negative correlation between O<sub>3</sub> and CO was attributed to the combined processes concurrent in enhanced O<sub>3</sub> with low CO (i.e., STE) and O<sub>3</sub> titration with NO in polluted air masses along with low photochemical activity. The seasonal cycle of O<sub>3</sub> at KSL in the Caucasus, as well as at other stations in the Alps, showed a broad spring–summer maximum. Although the aforementioned stations are under the effects of European emissions, particularly from Po Basin, KSL is influenced by semi-polluted air masses from the regions of the northern Caspian, southern Urals, and Volga, which causes photochemical O<sub>3</sub> production in these air masses, thereby resulting in seasonal O<sub>3</sub> maxima (Tarasova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR379">2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Biomass burning</title><p id="Par144">Biomass burning is a significant global source of gaseous and particulate species emissions to the troposphere. Emissions from biomass burning are known to be an important source of GHGs and chemically active gases on regional and global scales (e.g., Andreae and Merlet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>). Interannual variations in biomass burning can be dramatic, depending on natural and socioeconomic factors such as rainfall and political incentives to clear land. In some regions of the world, biomass burning occurs throughout the year, even though on the global scale it usually peaks in March and again in September (Duncan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2003</xref>). The peak in December to April during the dry season in the Northern Hemisphere is predominately associated with burning in the tropical regions of North Africa and Southeast Asia, with much smaller contributions from Central America and Mexico and northern South America. The peak in August to October during the Southern Hemisphere dry season is associated with burning in South Africa and Brazil, with smaller contributions from Indonesia and Malaysia. Although the Indonesia and Malaysia region straddles the equator, the burning season generally occurs in the latter half of the year.

Henne et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2008</xref>) attributed the boreal summer maximum of CO at MKN to advection of Southern Hemispheric air loaded with emissions from biomass burning in South Africa. They analyzed fire counts and fire radiative power (FRP) recorded by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors and concluded that the interannual variability of this summer maximum could be mostly explained by a combination of changes in transport patterns and biomass burning intensity.</p><p id="Par146">Biomass burning is a seasonally important source of emissions in Central Europe (Lanz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213">2010</xref>). Cristofanelli et al.

Cristofanelli et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2013</xref>) determined that biomass-burning effects on CMN were maximized during the warm months from July to September. Moreover, they analyzed the source regions of biomass burning events by using FLEXPART and identified transport at the local scale in the central Alps, North Africa, southern Italy, and Greece; that at the regional scale in Russia; and that at the global scale in North America and western equatorial Africa.</p><p id="Par147">CO and BC influences from Siberian boreal forest fires have been observed at HPO (Kato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">2002</xref>; Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR232">2013</xref>; Pochanart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR296">2004</xref>), and aerosol influences have been observed at FWS (Kaneyasu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">2007</xref>). It is considered likely that biomass burning contributed to the mass concentration of BC values at HPO, particularly in spring (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR232">2013</xref>). An increase in the observed mass concentration of BC values in April and May 2008 suggested substantial effects of very active biomass burning in Siberia. Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR416">2006</xref>) investigated the influence of biomass burning activities on the levels of trace gases at WLG.

Spring is the major biomass-burning season in the Indochina Peninsula (Streets et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR366">2003</xref>). Lee et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR218">2011</xref>) determined that PM<sub>2.5</sub> at LLN was highest during the biomass-burning season, particularly in March. They also concluded, based on back trajectory analysis, that the observed high PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels were attributed mainly to the biomass-burning events. Backward trajectory analysis by Lin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228">2010</xref>) showed that most air masses observed by LLN originated from India, the Indochina Peninsula, and southern coastal China, which together accounted for 85 % of the total trajectory. A different transport mechanism that favors CO transport from Indochina to the downwind Taiwan area was identified via a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) meteorological model simulation (Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2013</xref>). The results indicated the formation of a thermal forcing-induced low-pressure system in Indochina and that the high terrain located in the northern part of Southeast Asia further forced the uplift of biomass-burning emissions. Contrastingly, a sufficiently strong northeasterly monsoonal flow intruding into Indochina would hinder the development of the thermal low and would weaken the upward movement, which would, in turn, prevent the transport of biomass-burning emissions from Indochina to the Taiwan area. During the dry period of the year, the biomass burning in Sumatra normally begins around May and lasts until September or October. The mass concentration of PM<sub>10</sub> at TAR in the study of Streets et al.

Toh et al.

MBO has also experienced numerous events associated with biomass-burning emission originating from Alaska (Weiss-Penzias et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR418">2007</xref>) and the northwestern USA including California and Oregon (Finley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2009</xref>; Primbs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR299">b</xref>; Weiss-Penzias et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR418">2007</xref>). In July and August 2008, two regional biomass-burning events induced increases of CO and O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at both WHI and MBO (McKendry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR251">2011</xref>). Takahama et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR373">2011</xref>) analyzed the organic functional groups of aerosols collected during those biomass-burning periods and showed a large contribution of ketones, at 26 % on average, to the organic aerosol mass in addition to sharp peaks of ketones attributed to plant wax. Macdonald et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">2011</xref>) examined the influence of different transport and source regions on the O<sub>3</sub> and CO concentrations at WHI. They noted little difference between trans-Pacific air masses and the clean background in summer. The air masses from North America showed the greatest increases in O<sub>3</sub> and CO concentrations above the background values during years when the largest areas of western North America area burned. Finley et al.

Jaffe et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2008</xref>) showed that the area of summer burning in the western USA was significantly correlated with daytime summer O<sub>3</sub> concentrations at LAV and YEL, which indicates that the presence of fire played an important role in increasing the summer O<sub>3</sub> in the western USA. Chalbot et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2013</xref>) indicated that regional fire incidents might trigger high O<sub>3</sub> episodes. They estimated a 3 ppb increase in the MDA8 O<sub>3</sub> concentration at CHA in Arizona by such incidents within 400 km of the sites. McKendry et al.

Emission transport from North American and Siberian boreal wild fires has substantially affected the concentrations of trace gases at PMO (Helmig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2008</xref>; Honrath et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2004</xref>; Lapina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">2008</xref>; Pfister et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR291">2006</xref>; Val Martín et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR398">2006</xref>; Val Martin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR399">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR400">b</xref>). The NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/CO emission ratio is related to the relative amounts of smoldering and flaming combustion because CO concentrations typically show maxima during smoldering combustion while NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> concentrations show maxima during flaming combustion (Lobert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR233">1991</xref>). The NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/CO emission ratios from boreal fires had higher values in early summer and lower values in late summer, which is consistent with the smoldering combustion variation (Lapina et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">2008</xref>). Lapina et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">2008</xref>) suggested that this change in fuel properties affects the results for the O<sub>3</sub> production rate in model calculations because it impacts the relative properties of the species released from fires and an increase in the overall fuel consumption. During summer 2004, extensive wildfires in Alaska and western Canada released large amounts of trace gases and aerosols into the atmosphere. For example, CO emitted from mid-June to August was in the order of anthropogenic CO emissions for the entire continental USA during the same period (Pfister et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR290">2005</xref>; Turquety et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR392">2007</xref>).

This long-range transport of boreal wildfire emissions resulted in large enhancements of CO, BC, NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>, and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> (Val Martín et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR398">2006</xref>). Emissions from these wildfires frequently affected PMO downwind 6 to 15 days later. The enhancement ratios relative to CO were variable in the plumes sampled due to variations in wildfire emissions and removal processes during transport. Analyses of ΔBC/ΔCO, ΔNO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>/ΔCO, and ΔNO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/ΔCO ratios indicated that NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> and BC were, on average, efficiently exported in these plumes, and suggested that the decomposition of PAN to NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> was a significant source of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. High levels of NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> suggested the continuing formation of O<sub>3</sub> in these well-aged plumes. Pfister et al.

Other studies have reported that in January or February, many elements associated with continental crust experienced an increase in the mass of samples. The aerosol concentration of crustal elements remained elevated until June or July, suggesting that the dust season is from late winter to mid-summer (Parrington et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR282">1983</xref>; Zieman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR458">1995</xref>).

This increase is likely related to changes in their long-range transport from the arid regions of western India, possibly to upwind regions such as the Arabian deserts. Aerosols at MAB are dominated by mineral dust (Kumar and Sarin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR206">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">2010</xref>; Ram et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR306">2008</xref>; Rastogi and Sarin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR308">2005</xref>).

In the later part of the twentieth century, the signatures of major volcanic eruptions such as El Chichón in 1982 and Mt.

In winter, volcanic emissions were transported southeastward to the Pacific Ocean due to the prevailing northwesterly wind, while in summer volcanic emissions were transported southwestward to Japan, Korea, and Taiwan due to the subtropical high-pressure system (Kajino et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">2004</xref>). At FWS, Naoe et al.

For example, the number and mass concentrations, AOD, and visibility of aerosols have been reported extensively, but observations of their chemical properties are currently limited to high-altitude stations.

Many are located in the northern mid-latitudes including North America, Europe, and Asia, and several are located in Africa. In contrast, few stations are located in Siberia, in spite of the importance of its role. In the Southern Hemisphere, there are severe data limitations because only a few sites are located in South America; and none are located in Oceania regions. Recently, two new stations were established in the South Hemisphere. One is located on Mt. Mäido, Réunion Island, which is a volcanic island located in the southwestern part of the Indian Ocean (Baray et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>). The second is located in a high-altitude basin known as the Altiplano, Bolivia (Rose et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR325">2015</xref>). Sofen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR356">2016</xref>) indicated that the current monitoring network of surface O<sub>3</sub> (including low-altitude stations) is insufficient for measurements in key regions (China, India, Amazon, Africa, tropical oceans, and Southern Ocean) and suggested the establishment of 20 possible sites (10 island and 10 continental). A strategy should be implemented to facilitate observations of key species in areas in which few observatories are located. It should also be noted that continuous observational data at mountain sites are useful for checking the consistency between sondes and regular aircraft, which cannot perform continuous ambient sampling (Tanimoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR378">2015</xref>), when making globally consistent datasets for tropospheric species such as tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par165">Building an objective and homogenous classification for assessment of the spatial representativeness of specific pollutants.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par166">Remote mountainous sites are important because they are designed to provide representative data on continental to hemispheric scales and data for the lower FT. However, except for some European stations, most sites have never been assessed. In general, chemical species with strong surface sources or sinks, and with short atmospheric lifetimes due to photochemistry and deposition, show stronger spatial variability. Therefore, these species have smaller areas of representativeness than species with weak surface fluxes and long lifetimes. It is beneficial for any analysis, such as validation of satellite data, comparison of model outputs, and evaluation of long-term trends to consider the representativeness of atmospheric observational data.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par167">Building a filtering method that can be applied to the observational data at baseline sites in the same way.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par168">Filtered data are the most ideal for the analysis of long-term changes. Depending on the purpose, different filtering methods should be applied. For the estimation of “background” concentrations, the influences of local pollution (e.g., buoyant upslope flow) and long-range transport should be excluded, while for the estimation of “baseline” concentrations, only local pollution should be excluded. In most cases, unfiltered data have been used for trend analysis on regional or global scales because it is difficult to make determinations on baseline concentrations at individual stations (e.g., Logan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">2012</xref>; Parrish et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR284">2012</xref>). The specifications of each observational site should be determined before handling the data, which primarily represent the regional and inter-continental scale concentrations. For example, Logan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">2012</xref>) confirmed that local influence was not of great concern for their analysis based on the amplitudes of diurnal variation and comparison to ozone sonde data. Meanwhile, Parrish et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR284">2012</xref>) showed that the long-term trends derived from the unfiltered data were similar to those from filtered data analyzed by different methods at seven elevated sites including JFJ, ZUG/ZSF, and LAV, even though the trend for unfiltered data was different from that for filtered data at Mace Head, which receives air masses recirculated from the local continent. As the influences of local pollution levels were negligible, these two studies examined the trends for baseline concentrations. However, this does not mean that filtering is unnecessary. Calculated trends for CO at JFJ for the period from 1996 to 2007 were different between background data (−2.65 ± 0.04 ppb year<sup>−1</sup>; Zellweger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR449">2009</xref>) and unfiltered data (−3.36 ± 1.08 ppb year<sup>−1</sup>; Gilge et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par169">It is important to consider all of the above recommendations because observational data at remote sites can contribute to improvements in satellite observations, model simulations, and emission inventories. Observations at mountain sites have often been used for comparison with the outputs of global and regional chemistry-transport models when evaluating their performance levels. This tests our understanding of key processes and mechanisms in the troposphere such as the long-range transport of dust and biomass burning from the source regions, photochemistry in the FT, and the budget of reactive species. Although chemistry-transport models are useful for obtaining a better understanding of the mechanisms causing spatiotemporal variations in trace gases and aerosols, and for deriving their global/regional budget and assessing the impacts to human health and ecosystems, the current models still have limitations (e.g., Fiore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2014</xref>). Disagreements between observation and model results might lead to improvements in existing models, although such guidance remains unclear. In addition, the role of mountain-based observations in filling the gap between the views from the ground and those from space should be enhanced in the future. Satellite observations have emerged as a useful technique for the long-term monitoring of tropospheric compositions of species such as O<sub>3</sub>, CO, and NO<sub>2</sub> (e.g., Chehade et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2014</xref>; van der A et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR401">2008</xref>; Worden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR426">2013</xref>). Its capability to make reliable observations in the FT has been demonstrated over the last decades. The spatial and temporal resolution of satellite observations has been improved in recent years, and the number of observable species has increased from basic chemical species such as O<sub>3</sub> and CO to other minor but important species such as NO<sub>2</sub>, HCHO, and CH<sub>3</sub>CN (Streets et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR367">2013</xref>). It is important to expand the mountain-based platforms in a systematic manner to complement satellite observations, and thus to improve our understanding of the chemistry and dynamics in the FT.</p><p id="Par170">The greatest advantage of models and satellite observations is their global coverage. However, this fact does not necessarily indicate a lack of interest in mountain-based observations. Indeed, observations in mountainous regions have several advantages. The uncertainty is significantly lower for in situ observations at mountainous sites than that for satellites. In addition, mountain-based observations have the capability to observe multiple components simultaneously with a higher time-resolution than is possible by satellites, and in most cases, those measurements are continuous. This advantage enables the capturing of occasional events as well as climatological features, which helps us to examine the chemical and physical processes in greater detail. Moreover, direct sampling for the analysis of ultra-trace components such as isotopes is possible at mountainous sites. Therefore, even though it is difficult to construct, operate, and maintain stations on remote mountains, the assistance they provide in tackling the above issues makes the effort and expense worthwhile.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par171">Herein, we summarized the findings from past and ongoing field measurements and analyses of atmospheric constituents conducted at mountainous sites across the globe. Observations at mountain-based stations could provide representative data at continental to hemispheric scales and the lower FT. Many species in the FT have longer lifetimes than those in the PBL due to the lower temperatures and the lack of deposition in the FT. In addition, most of the transport of chemical species within the atmosphere occurs in the FT. The combination of long-range transport and longer chemical lifetimes indicate that the chemistry of the FT is important in determining the chemical compositions of regions remote from pollutant source regions. We identified observations at 31 mountain stations on the continents of Europe, North and South America, Eurasia, and Africa and islands in the Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans. These stations were selected because of their reliable observational data and because many previous studies have utilized these data. Furthermore, we adopted the stations located in regions in which few atmospheric observations have been conducted thus far, thereby covering the entire world, except for the Antarctic and the Arctic regions. Particular emphasis was placed on reactive species including tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> and its precursors such as CO, NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>, and NMHCs.</p><p id="Par172">Numerous studies have shown that the tropospheric O<sub>3</sub> maximum occurs during spring in wide regions across the mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, including the remote islands in the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans. The seasonal cycle of O<sub>3</sub> at European stations has a minimum in winter and a broad maximum in spring–summer that represents a combination of a spring maximum with a secondary maximum in summer. This broad summer maximum is caused by enhanced regional pollution in Europe. Largely influenced by the Asian monsoon, the seasonal cycle of O<sub>3</sub> in the margin of East Asia and Himalayan region has a deep minimum in summer. In contrast, surface O<sub>3</sub> over the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau and central Asia exhibits a summertime maximum. In North America, the seasonal cycle of O<sub>3</sub> shows a broad spring–summer peak or two peaks in spring and summer. The seasonal cycle of O<sub>3</sub> in Africa shows a minimum in boreal autumn and a broad maximum in boreal summer. In the Northern Hemisphere, the mean concentration of O<sub>3</sub> and the amplitude of the seasonal cycle depend on latitude, with larger values at higher latitudes. The mean concentrations are ~50 ppb in Europe and 30 to 45 ppb in Africa. The tropical sites differ from other mid-latitude sites, with small variability shown over the course of the year. The seasonal amplitudes in East Asia and South Asia are substantially larger than those found at other stations, likely due to the intense photochemical production in spring and the Asian monsoon influence in summer.</p><p id="Par173">In the Northern Hemisphere, the seasonal maximum and minimum for CO occur in late winter–early spring and in summer, respectively. The summer CO minimum is caused by the maximum occurrence of OH radicals, which are the main sink for CO in the troposphere. The CO maximum in late winter–early spring reflects the combined effects of the minimum in OH radical concentration and the enhancement of winter CO emissions. The maximum and minimum concentrations of CO and the amplitude of the CO seasonal cycle depend on latitude, with lower values found at higher altitudes. This indicates that the emission sources for CO are located at the ground surface. The means are between 120 and 180 ppb in Europe and Asia and 100 ppb in Africa. The maxima in East Asia are higher than those at other sites owing to intense springtime air pollution. The seasonal amplitude at the 15 stations falls into the range of 85 to 180 ppb, except for LLN in Taiwan. This large seasonal amplitude for CO can be attributed to the combination of a high spring maximum and summer low, at ~215 ppb, caused by the effect of the Asian monsoon and biomass burning activity in Southeast Asia.</p><p id="Par174">Unlike O<sub>3</sub> and CO, NMHCs, NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>, and NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> have only been observed continuously at very few stations. The seasonal cycles of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, and C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> in the Northern Hemisphere generally show a maximum in winter and a minimum in summer owing to reaction with the OH radical. The seasonal cycle at MKN in the equatorial region shows a different cycle with two minima and two maxima corresponding with the climate pattern in equatorial East Africa induced by the displacement of the ITCZ. Although NMHC concentration ratios are useful indicators of the degree of photochemical processing or aging (e.g., Helmig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2008</xref>), such studies have been rarely conducted at mountainous sites. Generally, the amplitudes of the seasonal cycles of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> depend on the latitude, with smaller amplitudes at the lower-latitude sites and higher amplitudes at the higher-latitude sites. The annual maximum concentrations of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> at higher-altitude stations are higher than those at lower-altitude stations within each latitudinal band.</p><p id="Par175">NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> measurements show a broad spring and summer maximum, whereas NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> shows a minimum during these seasons at SNB, ZUG, and JFJ. The seasonal cycle of NO<sub>y</sub> at HPO show a spring and early summer maximum. The NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> concentrations are low on remote islands such as IZO and MLO. At MLO, the seasonal cycle of both NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> and NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> shows a spring maximum, but their concentrations are fairly invariant over the year, which implies that the partitioning of NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> is almost steady state. NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> observations at PMO exhibit a distinct seasonal cycle from July to October that is larger than those in other months, while NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> observations exhibit a distinct seasonal cycle which is larger from June to September than from November to March, primarily due to boreal forest wildfires and more efficient export and transport from eastern North America. Despite the importance of the photochemistry of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>, continuous measurements of these species, which are precursors and by-products of O<sub>3</sub> photochemistry at high-altitude stations, are very limited.</p><p id="Par176">The observations at European stations in the 1990s show increases in tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>.

This result is consistent with satellite observations of total column CO, which show a continued decreasing trend from 2000 through 2011 in the Northern Hemisphere.</p><p id="Par178">There are few long-term measurements of NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> and NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> at high-altitude stations. In European countries, NO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> emissions declined significantly in the early 1990s due to the mandated installation of catalytic converters in vehicles and other emission reduction measures. For the period from 1998 to 2002, the trend in NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> was positive but not significant, whereas in the period 2004 to 2009, a significant decreasing tendency was observed at a rate of −0.048 ± 0.012 ppb year<sup>−1</sup>. The overall annual averages of O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub> were the highest in 2003, which was the hottest year in recorded European history due to an exceptional prolonged summer heat wave.</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>List of stations</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par179">ARO, Arosa</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par180">ASK, Assekrem</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par181">CHA, Chiricahua National Monument</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par182">CMN, Monte Cimone</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par183">FWS, Mt.
