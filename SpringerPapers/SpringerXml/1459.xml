Early multi-site SCADA systems used closed networks and propriety industrial communication protocols like Modbus, DNP3 etc to reach remote sites. But with time it has become more convenient and more cost-effective to connect them to the Internet. However, internet connections to SCADA systems build in new vulnerabilities, as SCADA systems were not designed with internet security in mind. This can become matter of national security if these systems are power plants, water treatment facilities, or other pieces of critical infrastructure. Compared to IT systems, SCADA systems have a higher requirement concerning reliability, latency and uptime, so it is not always feasible to apply IT security measures deployed in IT systems. This paper provides an overview of security issues and threats in SCADA networks. Next, attention is focused on security assessment of the SCADA. This is followed by an overview of relevant SCADA security solutions. Finally we propose our security solution approach which is embedded in bump-in-the-wire is discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>SCADA

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Critical infrastructure is basically cyber-physical systems (CPS) with embedded computing systems and communication capabilities at one side and the physical system at the other. SCADA is a communication technology scheme for collecting data from distant facilities and also controlling them. SCADA system allows an operator to make set point changes on distant process controllers, to monitor alarms and to gather measurement information from a remote location. SCADA systems are composed of three components, remote terminal units (RTU) to collect data from remote sensors and devices, Master station with human machine interface (HMI) for monitoring and controlling and communication Infrastructure for connecting the various components of the SCADA.</p><p>The benefits of using the Internet technology to carry SCADA communications come at the cost of compromised security since the data over the Internet can be an easy target for an attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. To make the situation more challenging, industrial communication protocols like DNP3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and most other SCADA protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], have no built-in security feature such as message authentication, which assures that a party to some computerized transaction is not an impostor. Various threats that these protocols face include eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attack (in which a malicious hacker not only listens to the messages between two unsuspecting parties but can also modify, delete, and replay the messages), spoof and replay (an attack that attempts to trick the system by retransmitting a legitimate message), unauthorized access either by human (intentionally or accidentally) or by specialized software. The other possibilities of attacks are due to the fact that function codes and message flags in different SCADA protocols can be manipulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This causes violation of integrity, confidentiality and improper commands for RTUs, etc. Anybody can control a SCADA device with injection of malicious packets into the network. Denial of service (DoS) attacks, deleting system files, planting a trojan to control the system, modifying any logged data in remote database system and IP Spoofing are other possible threats to SCADA systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These threats may lead to shutting down operations, data loss, gaining complete control and defaming etc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The security models developed for IT systems may not suit the security requirements of SCADA systems. SCADA systems have many characteristics that differ from IT systems, including different risks and priorities. Some of these include performance, availability, time-critical responses, resource constraints, communication, system operation, access to components. For SCADA systems, availability is top most priority followed by confidentiality and integrity. For IT systems, confidentiality is top most priority followed by integrity and availability. The key technical challenges revolve around the limitations of what can be installed and configured on the SCADA systems and the technical limitations of other components within the SCADA environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These constraints should be a basic consideration for applying a security mechanism.

Otherwise it may cause latency problems.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Related work</title><p>Lot of work has been reported in the scientific community about SCADA security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Some of them have explored cryptographic primitives while others have explored intrusion detection or a combination of these two. There have been many guidelines laid down for securing SCADA systems from agencies like NIST, NERC etc on things like secure access control, network security policy etc for critical infrastructure. Sandia National Laboratories proposed a cryptographic key management and key establishment approach for SCADA (SKE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] in 2002. This scheme uses CA for handling key management and distribution in an automatic fashion. All keys used are of 128 bit in length. RTU to RTU communication is not possible in this mechanism. Also it does not support broadcast and multicast communication. Information Security Institute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] proposed architecture for SCADA systems (SKMA) where a new entity 'key distribution center (KDC)' came into picture, which is used to maintain long term keys for every node. KDC also contains information regarding the system structure, and allows or denies the key establishment requests; while doing this role; it supports the distribution of keys. Donghyun Choi and co-authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] also proposed his approach which supports multicast and broadcast with an additional computation at run time at MTU side. The approach provides multicasting in a limited fashion. For distribution of key, the approach uses a KDC, which constructs logical key structure and uses Iolus framework. Simple public key infrastructure (SPKI) was developed starting in 1995. Simple distributed security infrastructure (SDSI) is a new design for a public key infrastructure, designed by members of LCSâs Cryptography and Information Security research group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The wireless sensor networks (WSN) have intelligent distributed control capabilities, and the capability to work under severe conditions, so some of the schemes of this area may be useful for securing SCADA systems, as PKI. It uses public key encryption only for some specific tasks as session key setup between the base station and sensors giving the network an acceptable threshold of confidentiality and authentication. PKI only implements a subset of a PKI services.</p><p>A number of key establishment protocols based on pre-distribution are explored, but they do not scale effectively to large networks. For a given level of security each protocol incurs a linearly increasing overhead in either communication cost per node or memory per node or both. These symmetric key based schemes are computationally efficient; the trade-off has to be paid for complicated key pre-distribution and key management. In particular, the public key cryptography, symmetric key encryption and the addition of SKE-based key management will likely make strong security a more realistic expectation in the future. We also expect that the hardware of SCADA will be improved so that it can be suitable for the application of cryptography.</p><p>Intrusion detection is defined as the process of monitoring the events occurring in a computer system or network and analyzing them for signs of possible incidents, which are violations or imminent threats of violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies or standard security practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Two major approaches of intrusion detection are signature based and anomaly based. The signature detection matches traffic to a known misuse pattern while the anomaly detection works on the abnormalities in the observed data. There are other methods which fall between the two approaches like probabilistic based and specification based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. One embeds probabilistic modelling while the other allowable system traffic patterns. Misuse based detection methods have reached a saturation point, most of the current research has been in writing signatures or enhancements of signature matching using state machines (regex). Generating good signatures requires extensive study and in-depth vulnerability assessment of the system which is a tedious task in itself. We have come across [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] which provide signatures for SCADA specific IDS though. Lot of research has been going on in anomaly based detections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Zhu and Sastry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] give a very detailed outlook of IDS for SCADA. Recently it has been observed that two types of approaches state based intrusion detection and its enhancements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and model based security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] is what the research community is majorly focusing on. Both the approaches require the real system to be represented and updated as per changes that take place in the real network. In state based approach, the representation is in form of tag, value pairs for each PLC/RTU which these units are sensing. The idea is to define critical state on predicates of these tag value pairs. One of most important advantage that has been suggested is to identify critical state even if licit commands are sent but their combined effect is catastrophic. In the model based approach the real system is represented as cyber-physical system. To depict such a system, researchers use available simulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] for the physical part and protocol adaptors for the cyber part. This CPS can then be used to observe effect of commands on real network by first executing them on the simulated environment and if found threatening, generating alerts.</p><p>Most of work that has been explored does not provide clarity on how bad data injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] would be tackled. As obvious signature based approaches are too dependent on regular update of signatures and anomaly based on training data for intrusion detection. In case of model based approach defining accurate models and false alarms may become challenging.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Security solution</title><p>To meet the challenges discussed in the previous section, we propose an integrated security framework for power systems. The proposed solution is a bump in the wire which consists of key distribution, encryptionâdecryption, and intrusion detection. This solution caters to data security at communication channel and an independent method of verification of the responses from power system for intrusion detection. The proposed security solution architecture is shown in the Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and implementation of our bump-in-the-wire solution in SCADA system is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.Â 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Overall security architecture</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40012_2013_24_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.Â 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Implementation of security solution</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40012_2013_24_Fig2_HTML.gif" id="MO2"/></fig> As shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> the key will be distributed at the time of installation of bump-in-the-wire between the MTU and RTU at both sides, then it will be automatically revoked periodically using our key distribution protocol (Sec-KeyD). To explain the data flow through our security solution we consider data flow from MTU to RTU. When MTU has to send some commands it will pass through bump-in-the-wire at MTU side. Bump-in-the-wire contains a protocol hardening solution i.e. Flexi-DNPSec [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], which converts DNP3 packets into new format, called as Flexi-DNPSec packets. This conversion helps to integrate our key management solution with it because DNP3 doesnt provide such facility. Now Flexi-DNPSec protocol have the key management features i.e. key generation, key distribution, storage, automatic key revocation and encryption/decryption using our key distribution and key management scheme. When data passes through bump-in-the-wire device, encryption of the coming data will take place using the same key that has been exchanged initially. Then encrypted data will traverse the network and will be captured at the RTU side and decrypted using the same key. Once the data is decrypted, it will re-converted into DNP3 packets. A copy of it will be passed to the IDS. IDS uses an extended finite state machine (EFSM) for state transition and event recognition for DNP3, based on the specifications developed. The specifications are developed for function codes, object headers, qualifiers etc part of the DNP3 protocol header to characterize the expected behavior of network under purview. In the proposed approach the specifications developed is used for validation in a given message so as to extract any anomaly in the message. In case of any anomaly detected, the IDS will respond with an alert message to its corresponding substation. The same will be communicated to MTU. For encryptionâdecryption we are using Blowfish. The detail working of components of our security solution will be discussed in subsequent sections.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Security solution components</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intrusion detection</title><p>Sekar etÂ al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] introduced a category of specification-based intrusion detection. Specification-based approach takes the manual development of a specification that captures legitimate system behaviour and detects any deviation thereof. This approach can detect unknown attacks with low false alarm rate. In a narrow sense, specification-based anomaly detection means looking for behaviour in network traffic that is peculiar in terms of the specification for the protocol the traffic is using. In this case, detection is interested in syntax violation. In a broader sense, the term could mean applying anomaly detection on the semantics of traffic as expressed using the protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. FSM and EFSM based techniques have been applied in intrusion detection in fields like sensor networks etc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The proposed Intrusion detection system (IDS) is based on the protocol anomaly based detection technique which combines both the protocol syntax and semantics. The approach uses an extended finite state machine (EFSM) for state transition and event recognition for DNP3, based on the specifications developed. The specifications are developed for function codes, object headers, qualifiers etc part of the DNP3 protocol header to characterize the expected behavior of network under purview. In the proposed approach the specifications developed is used for validation in a given message to extract any anomaly in the message.</p><p>In a conventional finite state machine, the transition is associated with a set of input Boolean conditions and a set of output Boolean functions. In an EFSM model, the transition can be expressed by an if statement consisting of a set of trigger conditions. If trigger conditions are all satisfied, the transition is fired, bringing the machine from the current state to the next state and performing the specified data operations. Thus EFSM can test memory variables and set them whereas finite state machines do not have the concept of variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. So for example a state machine for a MTU will look something like:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>S = startup, FirstUR, Idle, AwaitFirst, Assembly</p></list-item><list-item><p>I = all the messages that are going from MTU to RTU</p></list-item><list-item><p>O = all messages that are coming from RTU to MTU</p></list-item><list-item><p>V = address, function code, sequence number, object group, object variation, qualifier, range</p></list-item><list-item><p>D = all possible legal combinations of sequence number, object group, object variation, qualifier, range</p></list-item><list-item><p>T = all possible transitions supported by network under purview</p></list-item></list></p><p>The transition relation T is specified using rules of the form:

In the IDS at the MTU side, as many instances of the state machine are created as there are RTUs in the topology under purview. Once an instance is created, it is in the startup state. Then the MTU does an integrity poll for each of the RTUs switching its state from startup to firstUR for each instance of state machine and waits for an unsolicited response from the RTUs. An IDS which is monitoring all the traffic also updates each of the corresponding state machines. Once first unsolicited message is received from each RTU, IDS updates the corresponding instance of the state machine and moves to idle state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Now each message exchange can be monitored based on the EFSM between RTU and MTU for any malicious activity. The EFSM is based on the principal that for a given request Req in request, the intrusion detection checks whether it is a allowable request from the source it is coming from and also verifying corresponding reply Rep in the response message against the allowable limits for this response. This will act like a verifier and hence will be able to detect and verify the given request/response.</p><p><italic>Case study</italic> The residential property has a smart-meter, dispersed generation such as solar or wind, and an electricity storage device such as fuel cells for uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and electricity back-up operations. The smart-meter, generator, and electricity storage device are part of a single logical DNP3 device that is connected to the Internet as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The DNP3 device has Internet connections to the distribution system owner, the electricity retailer, and the residential consumer as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.Â 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Case study scenario</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40012_2013_24_Fig3_HTML.gif" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>The distribution system owner in this example requires full access to all of the DNP3 devices point types and data points to ensure reliable distribution system operation, for control, protection and monitoring operations. The electricity retailer requires access to the residential consumers consumption records for billing purposes. The residential consumer requires access to the device for monitoring their electricity consumption, which allows them to control their electricity usage and minimize their electricity costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>Based on the above scenario we can have a set of security rules (allowed function code, allowed object headers and within them the allowed index) associated with each of the stakeholders. We can also have a set of critical formulas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] to precisely define based on a topology as to what combinations of object header and their corresponding values are allowed (given a RTU/PLC what set of comp, value pairs are allowed). We feel that these rules can be incorporated in an EFSM to detect intrusions.</p><p>For example a residential consumer will have limited function codes allowed like read, confirm, select etc and within these function codes there are set of objects that this stakeholder can have access to. So for a read function code the residential consumer can access binary output point to determine if the device is on or off, likewise analog point type maybe required for meter reading/consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In addition to this a set of rules defined for what values certain components can take given a certain topology and state information of the network can also be pre-defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. For example, in a power network for a given load across a line the value of voltage, powers etc. are known and can be verified in the response. So now when an EFSM detects an event rather than just checking the sequence number, it also does a check on the vector and domain values defined for a given stakeholder and picks up any anomaly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Key management</title><p>One critical security requirement is that communication channels need to be secured. To provide confidentiality on open channel, encryption and decryption is needed. After considering security issues of confidentiality, authentication and integrity of data we can not ignore the role of key management. Strength of encryption and decryption is dependent on encryption algorithm and key which is used for encryption and decryption. Secure keys need to be established before cryptographic techniques can be used to secure communications. Managing keys at one node solves problem of storage only but distribution of keys is another major issue. The main challenges in key distribution are authentication of receiver and maintaining the secure path for key transmission. Schemes like SKE approach are available for key distribution. Using these schemes there is a need of involving third party like CA for distribution of keys but in this case security might be compromise from third party. Manual storing of keys at each node is also a big issue. For automatic storing of keys at each node we can use DiffieâHellman key exchange method, but for this, one time extra computation cost at both side and extra storage for one algorithm is needed. In DiffieâHellman key exchange, there is always a chance of man in middle attack. By using challenge response, protocol authenticity of recipient might be confirmed for distribution of key but in this case, key can be obtained by attacker by replay attack.</p><p>Considering limited memory capacity and processing power, it is necessary to store minimum number of keys and efficient algorithm without compromising with required constraint. Number of keys is proportional to desired functionality like broad casting, multi casting. The efficiency of memory space also ought to be considered because thousands of keys and data needs to be manage and maintain in a limited memory space. Many efforts have been done in recent years to secure the SCADA communication including the key management issues. We propose an efficient key distribution scheme (Sec-KeyD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] keeping in view the present constraints with following features:

Following modifications are proposed in the DNPSec protocol. Size of the DNPSec packet was fixed at 292 irrespective of the size of the DNP packet. The payload, if lesser than that, is padded with dummy data so that payload size can be of 256 bytes. And with DNPSec header and the authentication data, it comes to 292. DNPSec packet is identified from DNP3 and other packets on network by finding sync bytes 0x0564Â at byte position 8â9 of the DNPSec packet. Consequently only payload data (256 bytes) is encrypted instead of encrypting payload and original LH header. This scheme provides the same confidentiality level as the original DNPSec scheme. The original DNPSec protocol has key sequence number. When KSN reaches maximum and is re-cycled to 0, the MTU sets SK bit and send the new session key. Instead of this arrangement, we reserve the SK bits and instead use our key distribution protocol to negotiate the key and freshness number between BITWs of MTU and RTU. And, this negotiation of keys can be done after a configurable number of data exchanges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Evaluation</title><p>It is important to analyze the security risks and develop appropriate security solutions to protect SCADA systems. However, a key problem is accessibility to a SCADA test-bed. As widely accepted in academic and industrial communities, it is impractical to conduct security experiments on live systems. A test-bed which comprises of a simulated SCADA network wrapped with protocol stack/s, will enable testing different attack and security solutions. However, these tools are either proprietary, used by researchers within the organization, and the software is not released for external use or is not generic enough to support different architectures, protocols, and systems, exception being a recent work SCADASim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. There are test case archives available for power systems from University of Washington [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], Queen Mary University of London [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and others but these are of little use to people working in the cyber world without a proper tool, which can interpret these values of physical/electrical world into cyber world in terms of protocol packets.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Future work</title><p>Currently we are working on the evaluation of our security solution. As this evaluation will require SCADA traffic, we are in the stage of generating the traffic in a test environment. Soon we will come with evaluation results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>As SCADA is opening up to standards it has become vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Due to the possibility of cyber attacks and its impact on critical infrastructure it is necessary to develop a protection system mitigating such type of severe threats. Lot of work has been done by different research communities but we feel that still there are shortcomings which need to be overcome. We proposed a security framework for SCADA that covers an efficient key management and distribution for SCADA, encryptionâdecryption and an EFSM based intrusion detection to fill the gap. We are trying to generate traffic for power system to evaluate our work.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tsang</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><source>Cyberthreats, vulnerabilities and attacks on SCADA networks</source><year>2010</year><publisher-loc>Berkeley</publisher-loc><publisher-name>University of California</publisher-name></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Zhu B, Joseph A, Sastry S (2011) A taxonomy of cyber attacks on SCADA system In: Proceedings of CPSCom 2011: the 4th IEEE international conference on cyber, physical and social computing, Dalian, China, October 19â22</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Meserve</surname><given-names> J</given-names></name></person-group><source>Sources: staged cyber attack reveals vulnerability in power grid</source><year>2007</year><publisher-loc>Washington, DC </publisher-loc><publisher-name>CNN</publisher-name></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Greenberg A (2008)  Hackers Cut Citiesâ Power.  <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.Forbes.com" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.Forbes.com</ext-link>.
