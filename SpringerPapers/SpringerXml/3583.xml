As annealing temperatures were increased from 120 °C to 150 °C or more, no dissolving or intermixing phenomena at the interface between HTL and Quantum-Dot Emission Layer (QDs EML) was observed. However, when the annealing temperatures was increased from 150 °C to 210 °C, the intensity of the absorbance peaks as determined by Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) measurement was found to relatively decrease, and hole transporting properties were found to decrease in the measurement of current density - voltage (CD - V) and capacitance - voltage (C - V) characteristics of Hole Only Devices (HODs) due to thermal damage. At the annealing temperature of 150 °C, the QLEDs device was optimized with TFB films having good hardness and best hole transporting properties for solution processed

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Colloidal Quantum-Dots (QDs), which are solution-processed nanoscale crystals used as semiconducting materials, have been extensively studied for their optical properties, which depend on the inherent size of the QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. QLEDs are attracting attention as a strong candidate for next-generation display industry technology, based on their advantages of high saturation, good stability, tunable luminescent color, and easy solution process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, there are technical problems that must be solved for the commercialization of QLEDs, including Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) level matching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and the need to control the quenching of the QDs by ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Above all, QDs have the limitation that they must be formed by solution process. With these limits, it is difficult to form multi-layered QLEDs well because the underlying layer can be partially dissolved by the organic solvent in the upper layer. The energy band balance between the HTL and the QD Emission Layer (QD EML) is important for controlling the hole tranport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, but the film properties may be deteriorated by dissolution or intermixing at the interface between two adjacent layers. These factors must be solved to improve QLED efficiency and life-time. Well-known methods to avoid dissolution and intermixing at the interface are the use of orthogonal solvents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and a cross-linking<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> approach for normal structured QLEDs and Organic Light-emitting Diodes (OLEDs). However, in the method using orthogonal solvents, the selection of materials is limited because the two adjacent layers should not use an organic solvent with each other. Also, the use of cross-linkable materials can limit the choice of materials that can be used for the best available hole transporting and injection properties of QLEDs. On the other hand, it has been reported that when a high-molecular weight organic material is used as an HTL in a solution process, dissolution does not occur even if EML is continuously formed using the organic solvent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Only a simple annealing process is required after forming the film, without the need for complicated subsequent processes or additional materials. Recently, for the fabrication of solution processed QLEDs, Poly[N-vinylcarbazole] (PVK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, TFB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and Poly[triphenyldiamine] (poly-TPD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, etc., were used as HTL, but there has been no accurate analysis of the annealing conditions of HTL in QLEDs. We carefully investigated the annealing conditions needed to achieve hardness without dissolving or intermixing, and good quality without damage to high-molecular weight HTL. We selected TFB as a high-molecular weight organic material (molecular weight, Mw = ~40,000) for use as an HTL. TFB is widely used as an HTL of OLEDs and QLEDs because it has good hole mobility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and its HOMO level is located between those of Poly [3, 4‐ethylenedioxythiophene]: poly [styrene sulfonate] (PEDOT: PSS) and green QDs. In this study, the results of UV-vis and FT-IR analysis, which are commonly used for the analysis of organic materials, show that the molecular structure of TFB film was damaged at excessive annealing temperatures. In Optical Microscopy (OM) imaging performed with UV exposure and Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM) analysis to observe sufficient annealing conditions to prevent dissolution of the TFB film, it has been shown that the thickness and quality of a TFB film with sufficient annealing temperature can be maintained without being dissolved by the QD EML. By analyzing the C - V characteristics of HODs, we have shown that the annealing temperature also affects the actual hole transporting properties; it has also been proved that the hole transport characteristics of the TFB film can be improved by annealing at a suitable temperature. The current - voltage - luminance (IVL) characteristics of QLEDs fabricated by spin-coating showed the same tendency as the previous optical and electrical analysis results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the optical analysis results for the TFB film according to the annealing temperature. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(a)</xref>, the UV-vis analysis shows the absorbance of the TFB annealing temperature conditions. TFB films at each annealing temperature used for UV-vis analysis were spin-coated on glass substrates in the same conditions as those used for QLEDs fabrication; the thickness was about 30 nm. There is a peak at a wavelength of 390 nm, which is a commonly known TFB absorbance wavelength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Based on these results, it was concluded that the annealing process of the TFB film had no significant effect on the composition and thickness of the TFB film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Since the absorbance does not depend on the annealing temperature conditions, the concentration of TFB molecular crystals also was not changed. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(b)</xref> shows the absorbance spectra of TFB film, as analyzed by FT-IR. The same TFB film thickness and annealing conditions as the samples used in the UV-vis analysis were formed on the Si substrate. When an organic material is exposed to electromagnetic radiation, energy is absorbed at a specific wavelength and other wavelengths are passed through. This molecular vibration characteristic of infrared rays is useful for observing the molecular structure of an organic material and can be used to extract the absorption wavelength of a specific organic material. In this experiment, FT-IR analysis was used to observe the molecular structure of the TFB by annealing temperature change. As a result of FT-IR analysis, there was no prominent absorbance peak in the TFB film annealed at 120 °C, because the annealing temperature was not sufficiently hardening, and the evaporation of the organic solvent is not complete and the residual solvent is present. However, at the TFB film of 150 °C annealing condition, the intensity of absorbance peaks was increased at wavenumber of 815, 1113, 1288, and 1319 cm<sup>−1</sup>. To explain these absorbance peaks, the TFB molecular structure is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. In previously reported wavenumber peaks in organic materials irradiated by infrared in FT-IR analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, 815 peaks were found to be due to C-H bending out-of-plane vibrations of para-disubstituted benzene rings; 1113 peaks were due to the bending mode of C-C stretching between phenylene rings or the C-H bending mode of the side chains. The 1288 peak appears to be the C-C stretching mode between phenylene rings, finally, the 1319 peak is the vibration peak of the C-H bends. Absorbance peaks are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. This shows that the TFB is stably hardened and thus maintains a robust molecular structure form of the 150 °C annealing condition. In the case of annealed TFB film at 180 °C and 210 °C, the intensity of absorbance peaks was relatively decreased compared to the 150 °C annealing condition. This is because the high annealing temperature has damaged the molecular structure of TFB.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Optical analysis for TFB films (<bold>a</bold>) UV-vis absorption spectra and (<bold>b</bold>) FT-IR absorption spectra of TFB films of 120 °C, 150 °C, 180 °C, and 210 °C annealing conditions.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2019_46858_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Molecular structure of TFB.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2019_46858_Fig2_HTML.png"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Main vibration peaks of TFB film extracted by FT-IR analysis.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Wavenumber [cm<sup>−1</sup>]</p></th><th><p>Explain for main vibration peaks</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>815</p></td><td><p>C-H out-of-plane vibration from 1,4-disubstituted benzene rings</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1113</p></td><td><p>C-H bending mode of side chains</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1288</p></td><td><p>C-C stretching modes between phenylene rings</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1319</p></td><td><p>C-H bending</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par4">Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows atomic force microscope (AFM) images of the surface of the TFB film for each annealing condition. The surface roughness root-mean-square (RMS) value of the TFB film of the 120 °C annealing condition was 0.48 nm, and the TFB film annealed at 150 °C, 180 °C and 210 °C were 0.34 nm, 0.29 nm and 0.36 nm, respectively. The TFB film with 120 °C annealing conditions have slightly higher surface roughness RMS values than TFB film with the other annealing conditions. It has been discussed in previous studies that an organic film with smooth and pinhole-free surface is obtained by increasing the annealing temperature of the spin-coated organic material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. As the annealing temperature and time are increased, the surface roughness RMS value of the organic film becomes gradually lowered, and the specific surface roughness RMS value is maintained depending on the type of the organic materials. In our experiment, there is no significant difference in the surface roughness RMS values of the TFB film of the 150 °C, 180 °C and 210 °C annealing conditions, and there is no significant difference in the properties of the QDs film formed on the TFB film. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows an OM image with UV exposure of the QD film formed on the TFB film; also shown is an FIB-SEM image of the cross-section of the ITO/PEDOT: PSS/TFB/QD/1, 3, 5-tris (2-N-phenylbenzimidazolyl) benzene (TPBi)/lithium fluoride (LiF)/Aluminum (Al) structure for each annealing condition. The QDs EML spin-coated on TFB films at all annealing conditions were annealed at 100 °C for 30 minutes. The boiling point of toluene, used to disperse the TFB, was reported to be about 110.6 °C. There will be relatively more residual toluene in the TFB film under the 120 °C annealing condition than in the other annealing temperature conditions. Thus, in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(a)</xref>, the dark spots on the surface of the QDs EML formed on the TFB film appear to be due to dewetting phenomena of the QDs film caused by interaction between the residual toluene of the TFB film and the hexane of the QDs solution during the spin-coating process of the QDs film. In detail, due to the residual toluene remaining locally in the TFB film, the surface energy of the TFB film is not uniform and appears to be localized dewetting on the TFB film surface in the QDs EML spin-coating process. Also, The FIB-SEM image in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(a)</xref> confirms that the hardness of the TFB film under the 120 °C annealing condition is insufficient. The thicknesses of the PEDOT: PSS/TFB and QDs EML under the 120 °C annealing condition decreased by 9.1 nm and 9.6 nm, respectively, when compared with the 150 °C annealing condition. In Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, the thicknesses of the PEDOT: PSS/TFB and QDs EML depending on each TFB annealing condition are summarized. For the 120 °C annealing condition, the TFB film thickness reduction was due to dissolving phenomena originated from the hexane of the QDs solution during the spin-coating process, resulting in a paring of the TFB film and reduced thickness. The thickness reduction of the QDs EML appears to be due to intermixing between the TFB film and the QDs EML during both the spin-coating and annealing processes of the QDs EML. On the other hand, in the cases of the 150 °C, 180 °C, and 210 °C annealing conditions, dewetting was not found on surface of the QDs EML.

The dielectric constant ε is 3.5, which is a valid value for organic materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>; the vacuum permittivity ε<sub>0</sub> is 8.854 × 10<sup>−12</sup> F/m; the active pixel size of the HODs <italic>A</italic> is 2 mm × 2 mm; and the thickness of the TFB film of HODs <italic>d</italic> is 30 nm. As a result, the capacitance of the HODs is calculated and found to be 4.13 nF. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(c)</xref> shows a comparison of the CD - V characteristics of the HODs for each annealing condition of the TFB films. As a result, when the annealing temperature of the TFB film increased from 120 °C to 150 °C, the CD - V curve shifted negatively. Although previous studies have reported a decrease in current density due to increased strength of the annealing process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, in this analysis, the current density increased as the annealing temperature of the TFB film increased from 120 °C to 150 °C. The reason for this phenomenon is that 120 °C is insufficient as the annealing temperature of the TFB film, and the residual solvent in the TFB film seems to have adversely affected the hole transporting properties. On the other hand, when the annealing temperature is increased from 150 °C to 180 °C and 210 °C, the CD - V characteristics curves shifted positively. This result can be matched with the FT-IR results in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1(b)</xref>. It is expected that the hole transport characteristics of the TFB film deteriorated because high annealing temperatures of 180 °C and 210 °C damage the TFB molecules. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(d)</xref> compares the C - V characteristics of the HODs with the TFB film annealing temperature. The inset graph is a comparison of the capacitance - frequency (C - f) characteristics; we proceeded to find the frequency needed to reach the C<sub>geo</sub> of the HODs and matched it at 300 Hz, so we analyzed the C - V characteristic at that frequency. In Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>, in the low-frequency band (below 300 Hz), capacitance contribution by the shallow trap was observed under all annealing conditions. However, the difference in capacitance values at 30 Hz and 300 Hz was the smallest for the 150 °C annealing condition, and the stability of the capacitance value at the frequency band above 300 Hz was also excellent for the 150 °C annealing condition. In addition, the capacitance values of the HODs did not reach those of C<sub>geo</sub> except for the 150 °C annealing condition. This result is attributed to the insufficient hardness of the TFB film during the fabrication of the HODs (at 120 °C annealing), or to deterioration of the TFB film quality due to destruction of the molecular structure (at 180 °C and 210 °C annealing). This result also demonstrates that the TFB film has the best properties with the 150 °C annealing condition. The C - V characteristics tend to be similar to the CD - V characteristics. This result shows that the 150 °C annealing conditions of the TFB films of the HODs are better than those of the other annealing conditions. The HODs with TFB film of 120 °C annealing condition had a capacitance value that increased from the earlier voltage compared to the HODs with TFB film of 180 °C annealing condition; however, the increase of the capacitance as the voltage increased was lower than that of the HODs with TFB film of 180 °C annealing condition. As a result, at the applied voltage of 3 V, the capacitance value of the TFB film at 180 °C annealing condition follows the capacitance value of the TFB film at 120 °C annealing condition. In addition, the HODs with TFB films of 120 °C and 210 °C annealing condition were not significantly different from the capacitance values. As a result of this experiment, the hole transporting efficiency of the TFB film increases when the annealing temperature increases from 120 °C to 150 °C and decreases when the annealing temperature increases from 150 °C to 180 °C or 210 °C. In addition, the effect of annealing temperature of the ITO electrode, depending on each annealing temperature, was analyzed by AFM analysis and sheet resistance measurement. As can be seen in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>, despite changing the annealing temperature of the ITO electrode, the sheet resistance and surface roughness RMS value were not significantly different.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematics and of the HODs structure.

The flat-band energy bend diagram in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6(b)</xref> shows that the TFB matches the HOMO levels of the PEDOT: PSS with QDs EML. TPBi is widely used as an ETL in the fabrication of OLEDs and QLEDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and has been studied as a means of improving the device performance by improving the interface contact as a buffer layer of the cathode electrode, preventing series resistance and current loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Therefore, although there is a loss in HOMO level matching of EML and the cathode electrode, the performance of the QLEDs is improved by using TPBi. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, electroluminescence (EL) spectra were measured by increasing the voltage applied to the fabricated QLEDs. The peak of the EL spectrum intensity is at the wavelength of 525 nm and the FWHM value is 21 nm. As the applied voltage increases, only the intensity increases: the peak wavelength of intensity remains unchanged and the FWHM value remains constant, so that stable EL emission of the QLEDs is measured. In the photograph of the EL emission of the inset, uniform EL emission is seen in the four light emitting portions of the QLEDs fabricated on the ITO coated glass substrate. The TFB film of the QLEDs used for the EL spectrum measurement was annealed at 150 °C. Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> shows a comparison of the IVL characteristics of the QLEDs with different annealing temperature conditions for the TFB film. The IVL characteristics were measured in a normal atmosphere and at room temperature. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8(a)</xref>, the current density of the QLEDs of all annealing conditions was found to increase smoothly as the applied voltage increased, indicating that there is no leakage current affecting the IVL characteristics in any layers of the QLEDs structure. The current densities of QLEDs are quite consistent with the current densities of HODs with the function of the annealing temperature of the TFB film. The QLEDs with TFB film of 120 °C annealing condition was considered to be degraded not only by the lack of the hardening of TFB but also by the dewetting of the QDs EML. The QLEDs with the TFB film of 150 °C annealing condition had the highest current density because the hole transporting efficiency was increased by achieving the prevention of dissolution and intermixing phenomena by the optimized molecular structure of the TFB film. This is due to the fact that the current is well flowing because it has both achieved sufficiently hardening and a uniform QDs EML, which is also supported by the fact that the highest luminance was also achieved at QLEDs. In the case of the QLEDs with TFB annealed at 180 °C and 210 °C, the molecular structures of the TFB such as C-H bend or C-N bend were damaged due to the excessively high annealing temperature and the hole transporting efficiency of the TFB was lowered, resulting in a decrease in current density. This result is well suited to the results of the capacitance analysis in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The luminance was also highest at the annealing condition of 150 °C. Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8(b)</xref> shows the current efficiency and external quantum efficiency (EQE) versus the luminance, and the QLEDs with TFB film of 150 °C annealing condition have the best performance.

Using UV-vis and FT-IR analyses, it was observed that the molecular structure of the TFB film of 150 °C annealing condition was not damaged and no dissolution was caused by the upper QD EML. Such a TFB film characteristic contributes to preventing degradation of electrical characteristics as an HTL, and thus it is possible to obtain an optimized hole transporting properties result. Finally, using solution-process HTL, we fabricated QLEDs using TFB film of optimized annealing condition; the IVL characteristics were measured to verify that the annealing temperature of the TFB film was an important factor in the performance of the QLEDs. Based on our experimental results, we conclude that excessive increase of annealing temperature of HTL has a non-negligible influence on the QLEDs characteristics. In addition, we expect to be able to study organic materials in more depth by combining optical and electrical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par8">The indium-tin-oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate was sonicated for 1 hour in acetone and for 30 minutes in isopropyl alcohol (IPA).
