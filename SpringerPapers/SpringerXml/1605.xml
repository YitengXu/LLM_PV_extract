However, whether forest communities would be threatened by projected macroclimate change or unaffected due to the controlling effect of local site conditions is still a matter for debate. After all, forest canopy buffer climate extremes and promote microclimatic conditions, which matters for functional plant response, and act as refugia for understory species in a changing climate. Yet precisely how microclimatic conditions change in response to climate warming will depend on the extent to which vegetation structure and local topography shape air and soil temperature. In this study, we posited that forest microclimatic buffering is sensitive to local topographic conditions and canopy cover, and using meteorological stations equipped with data-loggers we measured this effect during 1 year across a climate gradient (considering aspect as a surrogate of local topography) in a Mediterranean beech treeline growing in contrasting aspects in southern Italy. During the growing season, the below-canopy near-ground temperatures were, on average, 2.4 and 1.0 °C cooler than open-field temperatures for south and north-west aspects, respectively. Overall, the temperature offset became more negative (that is, lower under-canopy temperatures at the treeline) as the open-field temperature increased, and more positive (that is, higher under-canopy temperatures at the treeline) as the open-field temperature decreased. The buffering effect was particularly evident for the treeline on the south-facing slope, where cooling of near-ground temperature was as high as 8.6 °C for the maximum temperature (in August the offset peaked at 10 °C) and as high as 2.5 °C for the average temperature. In addition, compared to the south-facing slope, the northern site exhibited less decoupling from free-air environment conditions and low variability in microclimate trends that closely track the free-air biophysical environment. Although such a decoupling effect cannot wholly isolate forest climatic conditions from macroclimate regional variability in the south-facing treeline, it has the potential to partly offset the regional macroclimatic warming experienced in the forest understory due to anthropogenic climate change.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>8122</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2021_Article_87661.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Forest stands undergo spatio-temporal variations because of continuous feedbacks with local biotic and abiotic factors including disturbances. Such interactions allow exchanges of energy and matter between the canopy and the surrounding atmosphere, and play an important role in the modification of the canopy cover, stand composition, and eco-physiological behavior of trees<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. On a global scale, there is a general consensus that macro-climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation exert a major role in controlling growth, geographical distribution as well as the health of forests. Specifically, temperature sets rather narrowly physiological growth limits to trees particularly at their altitudinal and latitudinal limit of distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. For instance, in a global comparison of rooting-zone temperatures at high elevation, Körner and Paulsen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> proposed a thermal threshold of 6.7 °C during the growing season as the thermal limitation to plant tissue formation for tree species living at the upper forest boundary. Global and regional coarse-scale climate layers such as WorldClim<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, and CRU TS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> are primary predictors in the ecological biogeography to understand important implications for the functioning of forest biomes, forecast potential species range distribution and land-use variations in ongoing climate change. Empirical evidence suggests that anthropogenic climate change might drive temperate forests to critical tipping points and facilitate thermophilization of biodiversity driven by an increase of relatively warm-adapted species and loss of cold-adapted taxa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, whether understory forest communities would be threatened by projected macroclimate change or unaffected due to the controlling effect of local site conditions is still a matter for debate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.
</p><p id="Par3">To date, at the finer scale, we have a good understanding of the basic processes and mechanisms that regulate surface energy balance and temperature regimes in alpine and subalpine environments (see for instance Dozier and Outcalt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>), and in this context empirical, correlative case studies are most useful for testing and exploring the limits of current theory, or in conjunction with observations of other processes of interest (e.g., plant population, community or ecosystem processes). Even within areas with moderate topography, ecologically significant gradients in soil moisture and near-surface air temperature can occur between slopes of different inclination and orientation, as proven by Rorison et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> who recorded a 2.5–3 °C mean annual temperature difference between north and south-facing slopes. Along roughly equivalent lines, Ackerly et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, focusing on a small montane landscape in California, assessed that thermal variability across this topographically complex area may span from 3 to 8 °C. Tree canopy also has substantial effects on rainfall interception, incoming or outgoing short-longwave solar radiation, and wind speed, resulting in a reduced lateral transfer of humidity and heat, and buffering against heat loss overnight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Branches, leaves, and needles reflect and absorb part of the incoming solar radiation during the day, allowing less energy to reach the ground<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The degree of absorption is largely determined by stand age and structure, tree density, species composition, and leaf distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Interaction among the above-mentioned site-specific factors has been recognized to influence the dynamics of soil–plant–water interactions at the local scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, creating a microclimate, by means of climate buffering and surrounding atmospheric decoupling over time, whose characteristics depend on either the general climate itself or the physiognomic characteristics of the vegetation cover. Such a microclimatic variability may constitute a potential important buffer in ecosystem response to macroclimatic climate change-driven variability by (i) increasing the probability of understory plants, including seedlings and regeneration of the dominant tree species, persisting locally, and (ii) providing microrefugia where understory species are capable of persisting locally despite unfavorable regional climatic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Quantitative data about spatio-temporal relationships between the microclimate in the open areas showed the largest divergences at noon and in the early afternoon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. For instance, in a comparison between open-field and understory for different forest types of the Alps, Renaud et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> found the greatest thermal differences for beech and beech−silver fir forests with summer values 6 °C to 8 °C lower below the canopy compared to the open field. In a global analysis of 714 paired temperature data points, De Frenne et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> confirmed that tree canopies buffer forest floors against both maximum and minimum open-field temperatures. On average, mean and maximum understory temperatures were 1.7 °C and 4.1 °C cooler than macroclimate temperatures, respectively. Conversely, the minimum temperatures of the forest understory were 1.1 °C warmer than the temperature in the open field.</p><p id="Par6">Understanding whether and to what extent the buffering capacity of forests may vary over time and across topographical features requires further insight into temperature variations over seasons, and their relations to tree phenology and stand characteristics, particularly in environments where trees grow at the edge, the treelines. In such areas, the microclimate experienced during seasons is limiting for plants when their physiological tolerance is exceeded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Here, small fluctuations of environmental parameters may lead to changes in the specific architectural and functional components of plants (e.g. krummholz <italic>sensu</italic> Harsch and Bader<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>), patterns of tree establishment and mortality, which in turn alter tree spatial distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In this work, we assessed how the spatio-temporal variability of macroclimate associated with canopy cover influenced the dynamics of soil surface microclimate, i.e., the near-ground temperature and soil water content. To this end, we selected the highest deciduous <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> treeline in a Mediterranean montane area (Bonanomi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>) as monitoring site, which represents one of the glacial refuge areas of the microthermal beech forest near to the southernmost distribution limit of the species. Our main goal was to explore the variability in near-ground microclimate imposed by contrasting topographic conditions, phenology, and canopy cover at the treeline. We described the effects of canopy cover on the near-ground air and soil temperature and soil moisture by comparing open areas and closed forest stands. We raised the hypothesis that at the treeline: (i) the forest understory is thermally buffered against macroclimatic temperatures by tree canopy cover; (ii) the influence of tree canopy on understory microclimate is greater in summer than winter; and (iii) the thermal divergence between understory and the open field follows a rather different temporal pattern according to local macroclimate and slope orientation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study site</title><p id="Par7">The study was conducted on Mt. Serra del Prete (39°54′ N, 16°08′ E; elevation: 2181 m a.s.l.) in Italy’s southern Apennines, close to the southern distribution limit of European beech (<italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> L.). The climate of the area (data from the Campotenese meteorological station, 973 m a.s.l.) is characterized by 17.8 °C of summer temperature (average of June-July–August for 2002–2020 period) and 1.8 °C in winter (average December–January–February temperature for 2002–2020 period). The mean annual temperature is 10.1 °C and snow cover persists from November to March. Annual precipitation is 1433 mm (for 1960–1990 period), irregularly distributed throughout the year, with only 7.6% falling during the summer months. On the western mountain-side, fog and low clouds carried by perturbations from the nearby Tyrrhenian Sea mitigate soil water depletion during the dry summers. The soil originates from a fissured grayish limestone with Haplic Calcisol in the forest and shallow Rendzic Leptosol and large outcropping rocks under the grassland above the treeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The stands, dominated by single-stem and single-layer beeches, were managed until 1960 up to 1900 and 1700 m a.s.l. at the north and south aspects, respectively which indicates no anthropogenic pressure at the study sites in the last decades. Above these elevations, the regeneration strategy switches from seed to layering (i.e., the formation of adventitious roots), resulting in changes in structure from single- to multi-stem, more pronounced in the north-western than southern aspect. Starting from roughly 1500 m a.s.l. in this area the forest type switch from macrotherm, where understory vegetation covers 65% and <italic>Sanicula europaea</italic> L. is the dominant species, to microtherm, where understory vegetation cover ranges from 20 to 70%.

Near-ground microclimate measurements were performed below-canopy on the north-west (2043 m a.s.l.) and south (1835 m a.s.l.) aspect. Each selected treeline has an open field near-ground microclimate measurement reference in order to document the buffering effect of the canopy cover on near-ground microclimate. Air temperature and relative humidity at 10 cm above ground and soil temperature and moisture at 10 cm depth were monitored below the canopy and in nearby grassland (open field) at 30 m distance from the from the forest edge.

For instance, Keitel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> found a strong link between stomatal conductance and air temperature, resulting in a relationship between air temperature and transpiration of beeches.

This offset became more negative (that is, lower under-canopy temperatures at the treeline) as the open-field temperature increased, and more positive (that is, higher under-canopy temperatures at the treeline) as the open-site temperature decreased. In this context, large differences emerged in the relationship between temperature offset and macroclimate between NW and S-facing slopes i.e., for 1 °C macroclimate warming/cooling (from the mean temperature value) the maximum temperature difference in microclimate warming/cooling between southern and north-western treelines increased. Roughly speaking, the forest canopy treeline on the south-facing slope has a substantial cooling effect in summer and heating in winter, compared to the northwest slope. The results supported by this study closely agree with empirical research showing the existence of a more pronounced thermal gradient on south or southwest-facing edges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, albeit with some exceptions (e.g., Treml and Banaš<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>). It is worth noting that the maximum temperature offset values recorded for the growing season between below-canopy versus open-field temperature exceed 15 °C for the south-facing beech treeline. This very high value far exceeds the values for other forest types across biomes reported by De Frenne et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, testifying to the high buffering capacity of Mediterranean beech stands under such latitudinal and topographical conditions. Furthermore, for the north-western treeline we cannot exclude that the fair non-linearity of the relationships between the average near-ground extreme high/low open-field temperatures and below-canopy temperature offset during the growing season may be attributed to the effect of plant stature and canopy structure (see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) affecting a nonlinear light absorption along the vertical canopy profile<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Indeed, the higher plant area index (PAI) coupled with the aerodynamic crowns closer arranged to the ground at the north-western than southern treeline, is likely to have played a crucial role in reducing incoming solar radiation to the ground and hence smoothing temperatures, as documented for instance by Frey et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. This would not minimize the role of landscape topography or other background environmental constraints for the forest microclimate at high elevation, but we acknowledge that the microscale variation in canopy cover, coupled with the unbalanced microclimate measurements—which ignores possible within-site spatial variation in near-surface air temperatures—might be underestimated in our results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">The rather peculiar pattern of decoupling of below-canopy temperature vs. open-field suggests that the south-facing beech treeline was likely to be more decoupled from the regional free air conditions than the north-western beech treeline, particularly during full sunshine hours. This result might sound rather counterintuitive since the lower stature and height above ground of the northern exposed trees should benefit from a strong aerodynamic decoupling to the free atmosphere, as outlined above. However, we point out that this is consistent either with the difference in the solar radiation balance on opposite aspects or with the difference in altitude between treelines, where the natural disturbances coupled with human influences are the most obvious reasons for the southern treeline position below the target elevation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">Although such a decoupling effect cannot completely isolate forest climatic conditions from macroclimate fluctuations, it has the potential to partly offset the regional macroclimatic warming experienced in the forest understory due to anthropogenic climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. As such, closed forest canopies might provide a line of defense against the impacts of current and future warming on the ecological processes that influence high elevation Mediterranean forest ecosystems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (for example, regeneration, demography and community reshuffling, litter decomposition, and soil water and nutrient cycling, among the others). This vegetation–microclimate feedbacks would then have major implications for the ability of Mediterranean beech at the subalpine belt to (i) (self-)sustain and facilitate tree regeneration because, compared with the adjacent grassland areas, it significantly reduces the probability of freezing‐induced damages in seedlings growing beneath shelter tree canopies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>; (ii) improve the stability of the ‘cooler’ soil C pool via lower levels of heterotrophic respiration in woodland, which in turn affects C turnover<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>; and (iii) act as microrefugia for specific understory cold-adapted taxa against a rapid thermophilization of temperate forests that affects floristic turnover in favor of relatively warm-adapted species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. To this, De Frenne et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> reported that the significant understory community turnover of one-third of the species present across temperate regions was consistent at higher altitudes with the warming climate (estimated thermophilization rate 0.041 °C decade<sup>−1</sup>), which led to novel species assemblages. However, in the Mediterranean bio-climate, the mechanism by which southern exposures might support microrefugia is still not well addressed since temperature effects due to aspect must also be balanced against water loss at such sites.</p><p id="Par26">As offsetting was strongest for maximum temperatures, we might expect also extreme events in the Mediterranean basin such as heat waves to be more strongly attenuated than gradual temperature changes. Canopy-air temperature interaction phenomena also become particularly important during late spring frosts, which may severely affect the photochemical efficiency of young leaves, thereby influencing development of seedlings and shoots for <italic>F. sylvatica</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">Our results showed that soil temperature is also controlled by canopy cover as previously detailed for the treeline ecotone in Nepal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. The denser the canopy cover (i.e., north-western treeline stand, see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), the smaller the difference between below-canopy and open-field soil temperatures. Albeit with less daytime variability, our results show that the average soil temperature is strongly coupled with the air temperature (see Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>), with a strong cooling effect provided by the canopy in summer. Consistent with our findings, this effect has been empirically estimated to be about 4–5 °C (difference compared to the open field) also for grassland communities in summer up to 80–100 cm soil depth by Liechty et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. On the south-facing slope, the amplitude of the average daily soil temperature was subject to huge variations (up to 8 °C) as a consequence of frequent snowmelt cycles. Here snowpack becomes isothermal earlier in the spring when radiation differences between slope facets are highly dependent on solar angles, thus increasing the role of aspect differences between sites. The negative direct/indirect consequences would be a dramatic effect on the growth rate (e.g., Peterson and Peterson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>) or frost-induced earlier growing-season desiccation which may have a crucial effect on seedling establishment, mostly at the initial life stage.</p><p id="Par28">At our treelines, the soil moisture showed high spatio-temporal variability, affected either directly or indirectly by both precipitation and temperature feedbacks. Such drying–rewetting cycles of soils would affect not only the microbial biomass and the mineralization of soil organic carbon (i.e., the “Birch effect” in Jarvis et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>) but would also impose several constraints on seedling survival, mostly at their initial life stage when shallow root systems and reduced soil water availability are critical factors for their performance under common seasonal droughts. At southern exposed treelines the soil moisture pattern between open-field and below-canopy conditions was in phase during most of the growing season suggested that the soil moisture is modulated by the atmosphere VPD rather than by the different physiognomy of the cover. We argue that the peculiar pattern of soil moisture at the north-western treeline (i.e., higher in the open field compared to below-canopy in nonwinter months) may have three non-mutually exclusive explanations. First, the north-western treeline stand with a dense canopy would intercept and transpire more water because of the coupling with the macroclimate and therefore deplete soil moisture faster than areas with a sparse canopy or none at all<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Throughfall can be also intercepted and retained by the well-packed undecomposed litter layer decreasing the percolation into the upper soil layer. Additionally, this could be attributed to the different organic characteristics of soils: in the open field, the prairie soil appears more soaked compared to the forest soil where the humus layers, characteristic of understory beech forest, absorb from two to four times their weight of water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par29">This study compared the below-canopy microclimate to the local climate in order to explore the variability in the near-ground microclimate imposed by contrasting topographic conditions, phenology, and canopy cover in the highest deciduous <italic>Fagus sylvatica</italic> Mediterranean treeline. Our findings provide strong support for the notion that local landscape structure, as delineated by topographic exposure, and canopy cover create microclimates at the forest near-ground, which partly outweigh macroclimate variability. In particular, we found that (i) during the growing season, below-canopy near-ground temperatures were, on average, cooler than those in the open field on both aspects (S and NW) investigated, and (ii) compared to the south-facing slope, the northern site exhibited less decoupling from free-air environment conditions and low variability in microclimate trends that closely track the free-air biophysical environment. The unbalanced microclimate measurements available for this study, coupled with the high heterogeneous environment, seem to preclude a comprehensive assessment of the potential effects of ongoing climate change on the local microclimate condition at the monitoring site. However, the results outlined above provide evidence that topographically heterogeneous subalpine areas are more decoupled, and thus more climatically stable, than open fields. This would lead not only to cooler and milder local understory conditions than open-field conditions during summer/day- and winter/night-time, but also, most importantly, to weak coupling between understory and regional open-field inter-annual climatic fluctuations. Our results suggest that current microclimates have the potential to offset climate warming at the local scale and reduce the disequilibrium between ecosystem responses and anthropogenic climate change by (i) facilitating forest natural regeneration at the subalpine belt, (ii) promoting the stability of the carbon pool via reduction of the respiration costs, and (iii) allowing understory species to persist in situ, thereby preventing thermophilization of plant communities. We argue that while such a decoupling effect cannot wholly isolate understory climatic conditions from regional macroclimate, it has the potential to partly offset the climatic warming experienced in the Mediterranean forest understory due to anthropogenic climate change.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>AR was supported and co-founded by the project “Advanced EO Technologies for studying Climate Change impacts on the environment—OT4CLIMA” which was funded by the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research (D.D. 2261 del 6.9.2018, PON R&amp;I 2014-2020 e FSC).
