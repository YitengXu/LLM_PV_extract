Four defects were observed, i.e., electron traps of ~0.2 eV at 140 K (E1 trap) and 0.47 eV at 300 K (E2 trap) and hole traps of ~0.1 eV at 100 K (H1 trap) and ~0.4 eV at 250 K (H2 trap). The open circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>) deteriorated when the trap densities of E2 were increased. The energy band diagrams of CIGSS were also obtained using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and DLTS data. These results showed that the valence band was lowered at higher S content. In addition, it was found that the E2 defect influenced the V<sub>OC</sub> and could be interpreted as an extended defect. Defect depth profile images provided clear insight into the identification of defect state and density as a function of depth around the space charge region.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep30554.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep30554" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep30554</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Recently, there have been considerable advancements in performance and cost-effectiveness of thin-film solar cells composed of copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) cells. Commercialized versions of these cells exhibit power conversion efficiencies close to 14%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Moreover, the highest efficiencies obtained for CIGS solar cells on glass substrates or polymer films have exceeded 20%. Furthermore, the efficiency of CIGS solar cells is still being increased by pioneering research groups and companies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">However, despite the great progress in efficiency and optimization of the manufacture of CIGSS solar devices, material properties and device physics have generally been improved through the use of repetition and empirical experiments. The properties of the defects created in CIGSS during growth and their influence on device performance are still only partially understood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Studies investigating defects in CIGSS have been conducted by several research groups in attempt to determine the relationship between device efficiency and defect type/energy. Attempts to determine the influence of interface state on open circuit voltage (V<sub>OC</sub>) have been conducted via low-temperature capacitance measurements, external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements, and other defect-recognition measurement techniques. The effects of Ga/(Ga + In) ratio (GGI) and/or S/(S + Se) ratio (SSSe) have been studied, and a correlation between presence of defects and decrease in V<sub>OC</sub> has been reported. When the GGI is higher than 0.3, additional Ga influences not only the band gap, but also the transport mechanism and the defects in the absorber material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. By increasing the donor formation energies, Ga favors the formation of acceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The metastability of CIGSS solar cells under illumination or in dark storage is a representative characteristic related to defects in the surface and bulk of the absorber layer. For example, several hours of light exposure results in an increase in the photoconductivity of CIGSS films; these films return to the initial state upon annealing at 80 °C in the dark<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Light-soaking treatments can also be used to re-establish cell efficiency after thermal treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, this correlation is not clearly understood.</p><p id="Par4">Researchers have investigated the properties of defects in the space charge region (SCR) by utilizing various capacitance measurement methods such as admittance spectroscopy (AS), transient photocapacitance spectroscopy (TPS), and capacitance-voltage (CV) measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, these methods can only explain qualitative characteristics and are unable to quantify the defect density or determine the type of defects present (i.e., acceptors or donors). Since the performance of thin-film photovoltaic cells (e.g., cadmium telluride (CdTe), hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), and CIGSS) is generally governed by the quality of the interface and the SCR in the absorber layer, certain research groups have employed deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) in order to investigate the junction characteristics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Since the DLTS results are obtained from various reverse biases and filling pulses in analysis of CIGS solar cells, it is better to interpret the DLTS data of the defect depth profile by combining the composition analysis method (i.e., AES, EDX) and bandgap analysis method (i.e., XPS).</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we attempted to visualize the presence of defects in the absorber layer; particular attention was paid to defects around the depletion edge. We were able to measure the defect distribution shape, energy, and depth profile of the surface by analyzing the pulse width modulation, pulse height, and reverse bias at various temperature conditions via DLTS measurements. The results of this study contribute to the physical explanation of the role of Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)<sub>2</sub> defects and describe the way in which defects are distributed around the space charge region in the CIGSS absorber layer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p id="Par6">The CIGSS absorber layer was formed on a Molybdenum (Mo)-coated glass substrate. For a monolithically integrated module, we scribed the Mo layer using a high-power laser (P1). The width between each P1-scribed area was optimized with regard to the desired current density and the thickness/quality of the transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layer. Precursor layers were deposited on the Mo back electrode layer via direct-current (DC) sputtering. The substrate size was 902 × 1602 mm<sup>2</sup>. CIGSS absorber layers with a thickness of approximately 1.5–1.7 μm were formed by reacting the Cu-Ga/In precursors with H<sub>2</sub>Se and H<sub>2</sub>S gases diluted with Ar gas. The Cu-Ga and In precursors were sequentially deposited on the Mo back electrode via DC sputtering. The final Cu/(Ga + In) ratio was optimized to 0.88~0.92, a Cu-poor condition. Selenization and sulfurization were performed using the followed procedures. The chamber was filled with H<sub>2</sub>Se/Ar gas and heated to 400 °C and 450 °C for the samples named PK and PJ, respectively. The first step (i.e., the selenization process) was then executed for 25–35 min.</p><p id="Par7">The PK sample was placed in an inert gas condition during a temperature increase from 400 to 550 °C, and then sulfurization was performed after filling the chamber with sulfur gas. For the PJ sample, the chamber was filled with sulfur gas right after the selenization process. Therefore, the PJ sample was in a sulfur gas condition during the temperature increase from 450 °C to 550 °C. The second step was performed at 550–580 °C for 60–90 min in H<sub>2</sub>S/Ar gas conditions. The chamber was then allowed to cool to 300–350 °C in H<sub>2</sub>S/Ar conditions and then purged with Ar gas. The reactions were conducted in a specially designed reaction chamber that was able to endure the highly toxic H<sub>2</sub>Se gas environment. The buffer layer, used to reduce shunt paths and increase the interface quality, was grown on the absorber layer using a chemical bath deposition (CBD) process. The CBD solution used to deposit the Zn(OH, O, S)-based buffer layer on the CIGSS absorber layer was formed by dissolving ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>, and thiourea (CH<sub>4</sub>N<sub>2</sub>S) in deionized (DI) water. The samples were pre-rinsed with DI water at room temperature. The CBD process was performed at 60 °C, and the resulting buffer layer thickness was between 3 and 5 nm. The series connections between the unit cells that were separated by the P1 scribing were formed by mechanical scribing (P2). The gap between the P1- and P2-scribed regions was minimized in order to reduce the dead area.</p><p id="Par8">B-doped ZnO (BZO) was used as the TCO layer and was fabricated via low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD). The thickness and sheet resistance of the TCO layer were 950 nm and 11–13 Ω/□, respectively. The final step for separating the unit cells was conducted using a mechanical scribing process (P3).</p><p id="Par9">The prepared CIGSS samples were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), junction electron beam-induced current (JEBIC), AES, reflection electron energy loss spectra (R-EELS), and DLTS. For in-depth compositional analysis of the CIGSS layers, the sputter depth profile was measured using AES during argon ion beam sputtering at 3.0 keV. The sputter rate of the CIGSS samples was 0.7 nm/min. This approach is useful for quantitative analysis because it presents no matrix effects; however, standard samples are required for accurate quantitative analyses. We quantified the elemental contents of Cu, In, Ga, Se, and S using the inductively coupled plasma (ICP)-AES results. Depletion width and carrier diffusion length were characterized using JEBIC performed using an FEI Sirion scanning electron microscope (SEM) and a point electronic JEBIC system. An E-beam energy of 2 kV and a fixed current of 388 pA were used to excite a constant amount of carriers. The electrons generated using the SEM system bombarded the cleaved facet of the CIGSS device to generate electron-hole pairs (EHPs). The EHPs were collected at both electrodes as a current, and the carrier diffusion length was characterized using the SEM image and current depth profile. The experimental methods, such as current-voltage-temperature (IVT), capacitance-voltage (CV), drive-level capacitance profiling (DLCP), and external quantum efficiency (EQE), are described in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">Supplementary Information</xref>.</p><p id="Par10">In order to characterize the deep-level defects and visualize the CIGSS solar cell thin films, a DLTS experiment was performed with a PhysTech FT1030 DLTS system. The capacitance was measured using a modified 1 MHz Boonton 72B capacitance meter. Temperature scans were performed between 20 and 300 K, at a heating rate of 2 K/min. Samples were placed in the He-contact gas of a liquid helium cryostat. The pulse height, filling pulse width, and pulse period width were 0.2 V, 10 ms, and 10 ms, respectively. In order to capture the cross-section and defect density profile, we used different pulse widths ranging from 10<sup>−3</sup> to 0.5 sec. The activation energy, capture cross-section, and concentration of traps were calculated using an Arrhenius plot.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p id="Par11"><xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the summary of the device specifications for the two samples (PJ and PK). The parameters were extracted from current-voltage (IV) and capacitance measurements, and the V<sub>OC</sub> loss was calculated using the relation between Eg and V<sub>OC</sub>.

JEBIC measurements were used to examine the carrier behaviors in the absorber area. JEBIC is a technique used to measure the currents that flow in a semiconductor when it is exposed to an electron beam. When an electron beam strikes a semiconductor, electron-hole pairs are created. If the electrons successfully diffuse into a space charge region, the electrons and holes will be collected by both electrodes, and a current will be created. Using the signal from a picoammeter as the imaging signal, a JEBIC image is formed on the display of an SEM. If the JEBIC signal of the SCR shows particularly high intensity, the carriers can be successfully separated and transferred to either side of the junction before recombination. However, in the quasi-neutral region (QNR), which exhibits a relatively low JEBIC intensity, the generated carriers are recombined through bulk defects via Shockley-Reed-Hall (SRH) paths. The PK and PJ samples presented significantly different characteristics in terms of JEBIC data. The PJ sample exhibited high intensity at the SCR region, and the intensity was drastically decreased at the QNR. Generated charges were collected up to 700 nm from the PJ sample. However, the PK sample exhibited relatively low intensity at the SCR, but its JEBIC profile was prolonged to the end of the absorber layer (1.5 μm). We assert that the long diffusion length of the generated carriers in the PK sample was caused by a large grain effect. Because of the presence of large grains, the generated carriers in the PK sample could conduct the carriers from the end of the absorber layer to the SCR, instead of through grain-to-grain hopping.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>JEBIC images of the (<bold>a</bold>) PJ and (<bold>b</bold>) PK samples.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep30554_Fig4_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par28"><xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5(a,b)</xref> show the DLTS spectra of the PJ and PK samples, respectively, at various reverse and forward bias voltages at a pulse height fixed at 0.2 V.

This could occur at grain boundaries, resulting in extended defects consisting of several (Na-Na)Cu dumbbells with +1 charge. In addition, in the PJ sample, the grain in the top region of the CIGSS is considerably smaller than that in the PK sample; the grain boundary is thus thicker than that in the PK sample, as shown in the SEM image of <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Conversely, the grain size in the PK sample is very large, and the grain boundary in the entire CIGS is very small. The grain boundary in the PJ sample is more than that of the PK sample. This suggests that the observed extended electron defects were impacted by the grain boundary area.</p><p id="Par44">In order to capture images of defects, we used Avizo software, which is a 3D analysis software for scientific and industrial data, where the x-axis is the temperature related to the activation energy (from 20 K to 300 K), the y-axis is the filling pulse width related to the capture cross-section and defect density (from 10<sup>−3</sup> s to 0.5 sec), the z-axis is the bias voltage related to the depletion depth (from −1.0 V to 0.6 V), and the color is defect density (from −2.1 × 10<sup>14</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> to 8.0 × 10<sup>14</sup>cm<sup>−3</sup>). <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7(a,b)</xref> show defect images of electron traps and hole traps, respectively, in the PJ sample.

We note that the E2 peak intensity increased toward the ZnS/CIGSS interface, and that the Fermi level was pinned to the E2 peak. As a result, V<sub>OC</sub> loss occurred. Also, the E2 defect can be interpreted as a grain boundary-related defect. In the PK sample, H1, H2, and E1 peaks were observed, but no E2 peak was observed. There was also an H2 peak at the ZnS/CIGSS interface; this defect might have been a bulk acceptor defect.
