id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Biomarker proteins are an important indicator of the presence of a specific disease condition in the physiological system. Hence, sensors for biomarker protein detection are being widely studied today. Techniques like Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISAs) have been traditionally used to determine biomarker proteins like Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α). TNF-α has been determined to be an important biomarker for infectious conditions like sepsis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> while Glycated albumin (GA) has been observed to be a more versatile biomarker of diabetes mellitus for all kinds of patients including the ones with blood based disorders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Therefore, the objective of this study is to detect these biomarkers in an intracellular environment in order to facilitate early detection of these diseases; this is possible due to the pioneering work on the use of DSS as an endocytosis-inducing peptide. Ghosh et.al have summarized previously published detection techniques for TNF-α and GA and compared the advantages of their FRET based DNA aptasensors with those of the published sensing platforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.



</p><p id="Par3">DNA aptamers are short oligonucleotides, which have the capability of binding to another molecule. Aptamer based sensors have been evaluated to have excellent recognition capacity towards various types of target molecules. These antigens include metal ions like lead<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, mercury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, potassium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> as well as biomolecules like thrombin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, interferon-γ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, AMP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> etc.</p><p id="Par4">Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a process, which facilitates transfer of energy from a ‘donor’ nanostructure to an ‘acceptor’ nanostructure. The efficiency of the FRET process is proportional to 1/{1 + (d/d<sub>o</sub>)<sup>6</sup>} where d is the distance between the donor and the acceptor and d<sub>o</sub> is generally approximately 5 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The 1/{1 + (d/d<sub>o</sub>)<sup>6</sup>} dependence results from a dipole–dipole interactions between the donor and the acceptor. For a typical case, the FRET effect is relatively strong when d is less than about 5 nm and is relatively weak when d is greater than about 5 nm. In this study, the donor is a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) and the acceptor is a gold (Au) nanoparticle. When the QD and the Au nanoparticle are closer than about 5 nm there is strong transfer of energy from the QD to the Au nanoparticle and there is consequently less energy available in the quantum dot to emit as photons. Accordingly, when the QD and the Au nanoparticle are closer together the light emitted by the QD decreases significantly. The quantum dot donor and a gold nanoparticle acceptor are bound to opposite ends of a DNA aptamer. The DNA aptamer acts as the primary sensing element since it changes its conformational shape—and therefore its length—when the DNA aptamer binds selectively to the analyte. The change in the conformational shape of the aptamer causes a change in d and, therefore, causes a change in the intensity of the light emitted by the QD. It is this change in the intensity of the light emitted by the QD that indicates that the QD and the Au nanoparticle have changed their separation, d, as a result of the conformation-changing binding event between the aptamer and the analyte. Hence, the presence of the analyte is detected based the change in the intensity of the light emitted by the QD. Such a QD-aptamer—Au-nanoparticle complex is an example of a molecular beacon, in this study, it is the FRET-based molecular beacons that are used to detect the presence of the analyte.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization of DSS peptide structure</title><p id="Par5">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> represents the Raman spectra of the DSS peptide from 300 to 3,100 cm<sup>−1</sup> while Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> summarizes the peak assignments for the spectra obtained for the peptide. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, there are three peaks (410 cm<sup>−1</sup>, 433 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 600 cm<sup>−1</sup>), which were unidentified and hence does not have any possible characteristics.

Additionally, the peak at 1564 cm<sup>−1</sup> might also be contributed by COO<sup>−</sup> stretching in aspartic acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The peak at 1671 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which corresponds to the Amide 1 region of the peptide, also indicates the presence of antiparallel beta sheet structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

The primary sensing element, which binds to the target molecule is a nucleic acid based aptamer. Gold nanoparticles have been employed as quenchers here due to their wide absorption spectrum. The DSS peptide denotes the sequence DSSDSSDSSDSSDSSDSSKKKK, which has been shown previously to induce endocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and which we have used here to cause endocytosis of the molecular beacon into the cell. The synthesis procedure and the possible structure of the DSS-molecular beacon conjugate has been summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d. As can be observed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a, the photoluminescence intensity exhibited by the DSS-molecular beacon conjugate decreases with an increase in TNF-α concentration. The molecular beacon is composed of a DSS conjugated quantum dot linked to a gold nanoparticle via a short DNA aptamer, which binds to TNF-α. The DNA aptamer changes its conformation once the target analyte is added to the sensor solution; this results in bringing the quantum dot (donor) closer to the gold nanoparticle (quencher). This causes an intersystem energy transfer from the donor to the quencher, known as FRET. Therefore, an increase in quenching is observed with an increase in target protein concentration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Decrease in photoluminescence intensity with increase in TNF-α in DSS-molecular beacon conjugate (<bold>a</bold>).

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, the quenching exhibited by the sensor towards TNF-α was higher than that exhibited by the control proteins. Control proteins such as GA and CRP were tested at a concentration of 1 μM while Thrombin and VEGF were tested at 65 nM concentration. The quenching exhibited by the sensor towards these control proteins was compared to that exhibited by 17 nM TNF-α. Based on the observations in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, the control proteins demonstrated an increase in the PL intensity while in case of the target protein, and there was a significant decrease in PL intensity. Since the quenching behavior of the sensor was significantly different for TNF-α and the control proteins, it was concluded that there would be no cross reactivity at other concentrations of the control proteins. These results have been compared with the control testing data reported by Ghosh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, where they tested the specificity of the TNF-α detecting molecular beacon. This molecular beacon did not have the DSS peptide attached to it. We, Ghosh et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, found and published that the beacon was highly specific to the target protein when compared to control proteins such as C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, transferrin and thrombin.

The total fluorescence intensities and the mean gray values obtained from Image J and also utilized for plotting Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>g have been summarized in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>. The reduction in fluorescence intensity indicated the phenomena of quenching taking place inside the cells in the presence of a higher concentration of TNF-α. Therefore, it was concluded that the DNA aptamer based molecular beacons were undergoing FRET and were successfully detecting TNF-α in the presence of bacterial infection. This observation was attributed to the detection strategy of the molecular beacon shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d. Hence, the reduction in the fluorescence intensity shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a–f is in agreement to the calibration photoluminescence curve and quenching curve shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a,b.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The phenomenon of FRET has been illustrated here.

Hence, FRET was observed only in the presence of inflammation, which induces increased production of intracellular TNF-α. Ghosh et al. have already showed that the original molecular beacon was specific to TNF-α when compared to other biomarker proteins like CRP, Transferrin etc. except for demonstrating a significant cross reactivity towards thrombin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

The DSS peptide is a cell penetrating peptide capable of dragging a cargo inside the cell towards the nucleus. The molecular beacon consists of a DNA aptamer as the primary sensing element and operates on the principle of FRET. This peptide-molecular beacon nanoconstruct can successfully detect TNF-α inside the macrophage cells. The novelty of this sensor lies in its design. The DSS peptide can be conjugated to various kinds of biomolecules like drugs. Hence, the nanoconstruct reported in this paper can be potentially used in future drug delivery applications. This will also open up new avenues in the field of theranostics. Besides, it also enjoys the flexibility of being able to detect other biomarker proteins by just replacing the sensing element (DNA aptamer).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Aptamer structure and solution preparation</title><p id="Par12">The GA binding ssDNA aptamer and the TNF-α binding ssDNA aptamer used in this study was purchased from Biosearch Technologies (Petaluma, CA, USA).

A 100 μl QD solution was synthesized by mixing 87 μl of 10 mM borate buffer (pH 7.4) and 13 μl of carboxylated CdSe/ZnS QD (0.1 nmoles). The carboxylated CdSe/ZnS QDs (diameter: 20 nm) used in this protocol as well the other protocols, stated in the paper were obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Qdot 655 ITK—8 μM solution—2 nmoles in 50 mM borate buffer)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and the datasheets show a sharp emission spectrum centered at 655 nm with a half-width of 35 nm. Such a narrow emission spectrum is a general feature of high quality QDs since the dominant quantum mechanical emission probability is from the bottom of the conduction band to the top of the valence band. The gold nanoparticles used in these experiments have a wide absorption spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> with the ability to absorb light between 300 and 800 nm.
