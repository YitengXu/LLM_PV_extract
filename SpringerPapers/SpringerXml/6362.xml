PSII quantum yield assays revealed that the photosynthetic efficiency remained constant at stages 1, 2 and 3 and then declined in both organs. However, the decline occurred more dramatically in the flag leaf than in the exposed peduncle. An enzyme assay showed that at stages 1 and 2 the PEPCase activity was lower in the exposed peduncle than in the flag leaf; but at stages 3, 4 and 5 the value was higher in the exposed peduncle, with a particularly significant difference observed at stage 5.

In addition to their leaves, higher plants can potentially use almost any vegetative or reproductive structure to perform photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation for growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In wheat, there are a number of non-foliar organs that are photosynthetically active, including all parts of the ear and the exposed part of the peduncle, all of which can assimilate CO<sub>2</sub> when they are exposed to light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In an investigation into the effects of defoliation of spring wheat on grain yield, Rosyara et al. (2005) found that the yield reduction was lower than expected when the upper two leaves were removed for all genotypes examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. They proposed that the photosynthetic behaviour of other sources played a compensatory role in stabilising the yield. An accumulating body of evidence suggests that non-foliar green organs may contribute as much as 40-50% of the photosynthates required by developing wheat grains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The peduncle, which is located at the first internode directly below the spike, has a diversity of critical roles in crop productivity. Development of the vascular system in the peduncle is essential for transporting assimilates to the filling grain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Elongation of the exposed part of the peduncle lessens the risk of leaf-borne pathogen infections in the ear by increasing the distance between the upper leaves and the ear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Under drought stress or high temperatures, this organ (and in particular the exposed part) maintains significantly higher water potential than the flag leaf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The upper part of the peduncle develops leaf-like autotrophic carbohydrate metabolism when it is exposed to high irradiance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], accounting for a high proportion of the photosynthesis of the stem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Wang et al. (2001) suggested that photosynthesis in the exposed peduncle and flag leaf sheath contribute about 9-12% of grain dry mass, depending on the wheat cultivar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although the exposed peduncle has been identified as one of the photosynthetically active organs in wheat, the structure of the chloroplasts and the functional events related to photosynthesis and the translocation of photosynthates during the period of grain-filling have not precisely characterised. Evidence from ultrastructural observations and photochemical assays is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which the exposed peduncle produces photoassimilates for grain development.</p><p>The thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts accommodate all of the molecular complexes that perform the light-driven reactions of photosynthesis and provide a medium for energy transduction. PSII is one of the key complexes clustered in the appressed regions of the granum stacks in the thylakoid membrane system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The integrity and organisation of the thylakoid membranes in chloroplasts are essential for photosynthesis. Little information is available on the chloroplast ultrastructure of exposed peduncles or their temporal variations in photochemical efficiency during grain-filling. PEPCase functions as a primary carboxylase in the cytoplasm, fixing ambient CO<sub>2</sub>, re-fixing respiratorily released CO<sub>2</sub> and then producing the carbon skeleton for the tricarboxylic acid cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Monitoring the temporal changes in PEPCase activity is therefore crucial for evaluating photosynthetic assimilatory capacity in plants.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the photosynthetic features of the exposed part of the wheat peduncle and its photosynthetic contribution to grain-filling. The flag leaf was used as a reference since it is the main source of photosynthate for the developing grain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Particular attention has been given to the anatomical, ultrastructural and photo-physiological characteristics of the exposed peduncle that contribute to its photosynthetic performance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Growth and anatomy of the exposed peduncle</title><p>At stage 1, the peduncle length was 19.6 ± 2.3 cm (n = 30), and 7.8 ± 0.8 cm (n = 30) of this length was exposed above the flag leaf sheath. The peduncle continued to grow at a mean rate of about 14 mm d<sup>-1</sup> until the eighth day after anthesis. At this time, the peduncle reached a final length of 30.6 ± 4.1 cm (n = 30), of which 12.4 ± 2.2 cm (n = 30) was exposed. At maturity, the diameter of the exposed peduncle was 3.14 ± 0.32 mm (n = 30) at the basal end and 2.72 ± 0.25 mm (n = 30) at the upper end (base of the panicle).</p><p>Cross-sections of the exposed wheat peduncles showed the epidermis, sclerenchyma, chlorenchyma strands, ground parenchyma, and the vascular strands (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). The chlorenchyma strands were composed of cells rich in chloroplasts at the early stages (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>). The number of chloroplasts in the chlorenchyma cells was reduced at stage 4 (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1D</xref>).

At stages 1 and 2, the cells of the flag leaves had well-differentiated chloroplasts, containing fully developed grana with numerous layers and well-developed stroma lamellae with several starch granules (Figures <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>). At stage 3, the shape of the chloroplasts changed from lens-like to ellipsoid or round. Although the number of grana did not seem reduced in most chloroplasts, the thylakoid membranes began to dilate slightly; this process was accompanied by an irregular arrangement of the thylakoid stacks, an apparently declining amount of starch, and a marked increase in the number of plastoglobuli (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All of these changes indicate the onset of total chloroplast degradation and leaf senescence (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). At stage 4, the chloroplasts were smaller but structurally swollen, and their ultrastructure was characterised by a disintegrating envelope, disrupted and irregularly-shaped thylakoids and irregularly-arranged thylakoid grana with fewer stacks. A concurrent decline in the number of chloroplasts was also evident (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2D</xref>; Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

At stage 2, no notable changes were observed in the ultrastructure or the shape of the chloroplasts (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2I</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2J</xref>). At stage 3, even though the number of chloroplasts decreased and nuclei in some cells disappeared, the chloroplasts contained a large number of thylakoids and the matrix of the chloroplasts was still dense. At this stage, the number of plastoglobuli increased noticeably and numerous small vesicles or membrane-like fragments were observed in the cytoplasm (Figures <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2K</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2L</xref>). At stage 4, the chloroplasts became spherical, and an apparent increase in the plastoglobulus content was observed. Although the nucleus disappeared in almost all of the cells, the membranes constituting the thylakoids were still very distinct and plentiful. The most striking changes occurred in the structure of the thylakoids, i.e., loss of the parallel arrangement of the grana lamellae became evident in some chloroplasts, and some of the thylakoids became swollen (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2M</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2N</xref>). At stage 5, the number of chloroplasts decreased noticeably (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>); the envelope and the thylakoids of the grana were indistinctly discriminated one from another. However, the grana lamellae were still abundant in comparison to the complete disruption of the thylakoid membrane system in the flag leaves (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2O</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2P</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Chlorophyll fluorescence</title><p>The chlorophyll fluorescence parameters varied similarly in flag leaves and exposed peduncles during grain-filling.

Stomata are involved in two of the most important plant processes, photosynthesis and transpiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A higher stomatal density would ensure a higher photosynthetic efficiency even at sub-optimal CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The higher stomatal density in exposed peduncles may therefore make an important contribution to the photosynthetic efficiency of the plant by increasing the surface area for gas exchange and improving the photosynthetic conversion of solar energy. In addition, the higher stomatal density in exposed peduncles might improve plant viability in hot environments (such as in China) at the late stages of grain-filling because of the cooling effect of stomatal transpiration on the peduncle and the canopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Recently, chloroplasts that are present in non-foliar organs have been found to be of have been found to be functionally important for photosynthesis and consequently also for grain yield in wheat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. High photosynthetic activity is characterised by well-developed chloroplasts with a high proportion of grana [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Because the integrity of cellular organelles and well-preserved membrane systems are essential for photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], a close relationship is expected to exist between chloroplast ultrastructure and the photosynthetic capacity during grain growth. In our study, we found that the chloroplasts in flag leaves had well-organised thylakoids and a well-organised structure at stages 1 and 2. At subsequent growth stages, the thylakoid membranes degraded and the starch granule population declined concomitantly with an increase in plastoglobuli, indicating that leaf senescence had commenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In exposed peduncles, the chlorenchyma cells contained a large number of chloroplasts, each developing numerous grana with a high proportion of granal stacks at stages 1, 2 and 3. Given that the chloroplasts in the exposed peduncles remained more structurally conserved at stages 4 and 5 (as compared with the ruptured ones in the flag leaves), it is reasonable to propose that exposed peduncles remain functionally active during grain-filling. The exposed peduncle makes additional contributions to assimilate production, especially when the flag leaf senesces quickly and its photosynthetic activity declines. As one of the photosynthetically active organs, the exposed peduncle also has the advantage of being located nearer to the grains than the flag leaf. Thus, the photosynthetic assimilates are directly transferred to the grain along a short path.</p><p><italic>F</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and Φ<sub>PSII</sub> are important indicators of photosynthetic capacity. PSII efficiency has also been shown to be an effective indicator of leaf senescence in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In this study, the results for <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and Φ<sub>PSII</sub> demonstrated that the rates remained relatively constant in both organs; no significant differences were observed between these two organs at stages 1, 2 and 3, indicating that the exposed part of the peduncle had efficient light utilisation by PSII. However, the rates in the exposed peduncles declined relatively slowly thereafter, in contrast to the dramatic decreases in the flag leaves. As a result, the rates were higher in the exposed peduncles than in the flag leaves at stages 4 and 5. It has been demonstrated that natural and/or stress-induced senescence causes a loss of photosynthetic capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The slower decline in PSII efficiency thus suggests that the exposed peduncle senesces more slowly than the flag leaf and can continue to function longer during grain-filling, and this may be important for maintaining grain growth at late stages. Because PSII is mostly located in the granal thylakoids of the chloroplast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the reduction in PSII efficiency might be correlated with reduced thylakoid integrity. This hypothesis has been confirmed by TEM observation of the ultrastructure of chloroplasts as described above.</p><p>Of particular interest is the observation that the values of <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> and Φ<sub>PSII</sub> remained high in both exposed peduncle and flag leaf even at stage 3. It is tempting to suggest that the higher than expected PSII efficiency is associated with greater source strength at the mid-grain-filling stage.</p><p>During grain-filling, PEPCase is more important for maintaining carbon assimilation activity in the non-foliar organs than ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBP carboxylase, EC 4.1.1.39) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The PEPCase activity in non-foliar organs has therefore been considered an important biochemical characteristic of wheat plants with high photosynthetic efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In our study, we found that the variation in PEPCase activity over time differed between the flag leaf and the exposed peduncle. At stages 1 and 2, the activity of this enzyme was lower in the exposed peduncle, whereas the activity was higher at late stages, especially stages 4 and 5. Because PEPCase supplies substrates for carbohydrate synthesis and its activity in the exposed peduncle is high during late grain-filling, the exposed peduncle may play an important role in assimilate production, especially at the late stage of grain growth. Given that PEPCase activity is closely associated with the variation in photosynthetic heat tolerance among organs of the same plant and that high temperature stress occurs frequently during late grain-filling in northern China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], it is reasonable to postulate that the higher PEPCase activity in the exposed peduncle may lend it better photosynthetic thermotolerance than the flag leaf. This would confer an ecological advantage to wheat plants under warmer conditions.</p><p>Using organ-darkening treatments, the relative contributions of the green organs to yield grain can be estimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the present study, no difference in grain mass was found between darkened and non-darkened plants at stages 1 and 2. The photosynthates produced prior to the treatment were sufficient to meet the relatively lower requirement of the weaker sink strength in the early stages of grain development. At late developmental stages, we observed significant reductions in grain growth in dark-treated wheat (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The difference in grain mass between the exposed peduncle darkening treatment and the control could be due to the reduced availability of photoassimilates from the exposed peduncle. We therefore hypothesise that assimilates from the exposed green part of the peduncle make an important contribution to grain growth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that the exposed peduncle possesses anatomical, ultrastructural and physiological advantages over the flag leaf for performing photosynthesis. These advantages are especially obvious in the later stages of grain-filling. The higher stomatal density and the higher activity of heat-tolerant PEPCase revealed that the exposed peduncle has a superior ability to adapt to the ecological environment at the later stages of grain-filling. Based on the data presented here, we conclude that the exposed peduncle has a strong photosynthetic capacity and provides assimilates for the development of grain mass during grain-filling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Plant materials</title><p>Winter wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.)
