Conventional anticancer approaches are associated with different limitations. Therefore, innovative methodologies are being investigated, and several researchers propose the use of remotely activated nanoparticles to trigger cancer cell death. The idea is to conjugate two different components, i.e., an external physical input and nanoparticles. Both are given in a harmless dose that once combined together act synergistically to therapeutically treat the cell or tissue of interest, thus also limiting the negative outcomes for the surrounding tissues. Tuning both the properties of the nanomaterial and the involved triggering stimulus, it is possible furthermore to achieve not only a therapeutic effect, but also a powerful platform for imaging at the same time, obtaining a nano-theranostic application. In the present review, we highlight the role of nanoparticles as therapeutic or theranostic tools, thus excluding the cases where a molecular drug is activated. We thus present many examples where the highly cytotoxic power only derives from the active interaction between different physical inputs and nanoparticles. We perform a special focus on mechanical waves responding nanoparticles, in which remotely activated nanoparticles directly become therapeutic agents without the need of the administration of chemotherapeutics or sonosensitizing drugs. <fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40820_2020_537_Figa_HTML.png" position="anchor"

Only in 2018 indeed, according to the statistics from the World Health Organization, 18.1 million new cancer cases and 9.6 million cancer-related deaths have been recorded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Cancer cells are characterized by an uncontrolled growth and can invade other tissues even escaping the control of the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Thus, the development of efficient techniques for the diagnosis and the early-stage treatment of this disease is essential, particularly in view of the continuous annual growth of new cancer cases in the coming years.</p><p id="Par37">In the last years, the recently developed nanomedicine field has started to propose different solutions. Actually, nanomedicine is the application of nanomaterials, i.e., particles with a size range of 1–100 nm, for diagnosis, monitoring, prevention and treatment of diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Additionally, the concept of “theranostic”, nanomaterials with both diagnostic and therapeutic properties, is emerging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely employed in anticancer therapy, in particular for the delivery of cargo molecules, i.e., imaging agents, genes or chemotherapy drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], or alone, exploiting their intrinsic toxicity, e.g., related to the release of toxic species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. NPs moreover could be decorated with chemical or biological coatings to improve their stealth properties and reduce their aggregation in biological fluids. In addition, they could be conjugated with targeting ligands to maximize their delivery to the desired target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. NPs could spontaneously accumulate into cancers thanks to the enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR), because they can easily cross the tumor vasculature, characterized by the presence of large pores (&lt; 2 μm) and the poor lymphatic drainage allows their retention, thus facilitating their therapeutic effect even in the absence of targeting ligands on their surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, it was highlighted that a careful attention about NPs chemical, physical, and biological behavior has to be paid, as NPs could be responsible of numerous side effects. Therefore, also the sole NPs could be associated with negative outcomes as conventional cancer treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">In the last years, several researchers have proposed a new anticancer therapeutic approach based on the conjugation of two different components, i.e., an external physical stimulation and a NP, which can be remotely activated by the stimulation. Both the stimulation and the NP themselves are administered individually at a harmless dose, however when administered simultaneously, their synergy results in the cancer cell death, also limiting the negative outcomes for the surrounding tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Several physical stimulations have been employed so far for this purpose, such as radiations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], radiofrequencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], microwaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and mechanical waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Some of them otherwise are already used alone for anticancer therapy, e.g., radiation therapy. However, their action is often not focused on the tumor area and therefore also the surrounding healthy tissues could be seriously damaged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The mechanisms of action of the proposed synergy between the physical input and the nanoparticles have only sometimes been explained, while in other cases it is under debate or unclear. In general, the NP addition could amplify the effects of the physical stimulation, thus lowering the dose needed to obtain cell death by helping to focus its effects on the target site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], or by absorbing the stimulus and releasing another form of energy to the surrounding medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In other cases otherwise, the physical stimulation could trigger or improve the intrinsic cytotoxicity of the NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Some significant reviews about externally triggered nanomedicines have already been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, differently for these previous works, in the present review we focus on the active synergy between stimulations and NPs to achieve cancer cell death without the need for other adjuvants, e.g., drugs and sensitizers. Therefore, we highlight in this review only the effects produced by the active interaction between the stimulus and NPs that triggers the cytotoxicity in cancer cells. In particular, we exclude cases where the therapeutic action is not related to the activation of the NPs, whose role is often only to deliver the triggerable agent, i.e., drugs or other molecules, or for imaging purposes. We present several possible physical inputs as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, i.e., radiation, radiofrequency (RF), microwave (MW), light in photothermal therapy (PTT), and photodynamic therapy (PDT). We particularly focus on the most recent advancements related to mechanical waves, i.e., ultrasound (US) and shock waves (SW). Actually, the mechanical stimulation was often neglected in combination with the sole NPs without the addition of conventional sonosensitizers, while here it is the highlight of the present review. Additionally, the possibility to combine different and various physical stimulations to achieve an enhanced therapeutic effect is described. For each stimulus, its possible synergy with different types of nanomaterials is reported, proposing examples on the most recent results, discussing the possible mechanisms of action and finally providing a list of the clinical trials involving remotely activated NPs.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Overview of remotely activated NPs presented in this review.

It is based on the application of ionizing radiations, as gamma and X-rays, precisely focused on the tumor area. It is able to achieve cancer cell death by directly inducing DNA damages and through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from the oxidation of water and oxygen molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. ROS moreover displays a multifaceted role, because they are involved in several physiological processes and their level is kept under strict control. However, an excessive ROS production is cause of oxidative stress, affecting cellular components such as membranes and DNA, and altering cell signaling causing necrosis or apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Nevertheless, radiation therapy is associated with several drawbacks, such as the injury of the tissues in close proximity to the tumor and the development of resistances. Additionally, the treatment of hypoxic microenvironments, as several solid tumors, is challenging, because an increased radiation dose is necessary in this case to achieve cancer cell death and it could trigger severe outcomes for healthy tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For these reasons, several researchers proposed strategies to both improve the toxic effects of radiation and reduce the side effects, as summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The use of NP-assisted radiation therapy is a promising anticancer approach, and different materials were proposed for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic view on how the NPs can improve the efficacy of the radiation therapy in cancer cells</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40820_2020_537_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par41">A first possibility is to associate the radiation exposure with NPs able to enhance the radiation toxicity. High <italic>Z</italic> atomic number materials, as metal NPs, absorb and scatter indeed the radiation, generating also photoelectrons, Compton electrons, Auger electrons, and fluorescence photons. They have the advantages to reduce the damages to the neighbor tissues and enhance the radiation-associated injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Gold, silver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], gadolinium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], bismuth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and platinum NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] have been employed alone, or combined with chemotherapeutic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] or radionuclides and other radiosensitizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] to improve the radiation-mediated cellular damages. Otherwise, the addition of these elements to other nanomaterials, such as titanium dioxide (titania), confers them the capability to become responsive also to the radiation therapy enlarging their possible application as radiation-responsive NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. An example is represented by the X-ray photodynamic therapy explained below. The principal achievements regarding the use of these materials have been accurately summarized in several reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Hafnium oxide NPs in particular have already been approved for the European market and are involved in several clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These NPs have demonstrated good radiation-enhancing properties not associated with injuries to the surrounding healthy tissue. Additionally, they have the remarkable property to amplify the radiation effects in a versatile way, leading to the potential use of these NPs for the treatment of various cancers. Actually, several other clinical trials on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, liver cancer, prostate cancer, rectal cancer, and others are evaluating the efficacy of hafnium oxide NPs-assisted radiation therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Also superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs have been proposed to improve the radiation-associated injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Hauser tested iron oxide NPs on A549 lung cells carcinoma. Such NPs could react with hydrogen peroxide, generated as a consequence of the irradiation, releasing hydroxyl radical, improving the oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">Also several non-metals have been employed to improve radiation therapy efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Selenium NPs were employed to enhance the radiation toxic effects on breast cancer cells by Chen et al. They observed that the combination of selenium NPs and the radiation therapy resulted in a decreased cell viability, a G2/M phase arrest and, in particular, an improvement in the ROS level with autophagy induction. These results were related to selenium ions release upon the radiation treatment and the subsequent enhanced ROS production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">NPs toxic features could also be exploited to sensitize cancer cells to radiation therapy. In this case, it is of a paramount importance that NPs satisfy this task without damaging the healthy cells. Zinc oxide NPs have demonstrated to be an optimal candidate for this purpose, because they are able to cause a tumor-selective cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. An example is the study of Meyer et al., where authors evaluated the cytotoxicity of zinc oxide NPs W/O irradiation on cancer cells and primary fibroblasts, highlighting the radiosensitizing properties of NPs only in cancer cells, perhaps related to the increased oxidative stress and cell cycle arrest caused by the addition of the NPs. However, the exact mechanism of action has still to be elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">NPs could also be employed to deliver drugs able to protect the healthy tissues from the radiation toxic effects, limiting thus their negative outcomes, e.g., antioxidants that reduce the ROS damages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], or to directly protect healthy cells thanks to their radioprotective intrinsic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In this last case, cerium oxide NPs have demonstrated to both improve the radiation sensitivity and to possess radioprotective properties. Indeed, they have an antioxidant role in healthy cells, in which they act as ROS scavengers reducing DNA injuries, while in the acid tumor microenvironment they change behavior and contribute to decrease cell viability in combination with radiation therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">Another option is to target the radiation resistances of cancer cells, perturbing the relevant pathways with drugs delivered by NPs or using NPs that are able to affect these mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Some groups suggest the use of nanomaterials able to alter the features of the tumor microenvironment that protect cancer cells from radiations, e.g., hypoxia. In this context, Abbasi’s group proposed the use of hybrid manganese dioxide NPs as radiosensitizers. They exploited in particular the reaction of NPs with the tumor metabolite H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> that results in oxygen generation. The reduced hypoxia was associated with a decrease in the radiation resistances and thus an improved antitumor effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">Anyway, the use of conventional radiation therapy remains challenging for the treatments of pediatric cancers or tumors located near sensitive organs. Therefore, charged particle beams have been recently proposed as an alternative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This approach is associated with reduced side effects for the neighbor healthy tissues, because energy is released only in the final track of the ion beam, and toxic effects could thus be limited to the region of interest tuning the initial energy of the beam. In addition, the administration of ion beams is associated to a more marked cytotoxicity, because of their increased ionizing properties. However, side effects in the regions in close proximity to the tumors could take place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

Besides, tumor cells can develop thermoresistance if the thermal treatment is repeated several times, thus decreasing its efficacy. For these reasons, hyperthermia is rarely involved in clinic alone, but it is proposed as coadjutant of other therapies, or with the addition of NPs that could contribute to focalize the heating within the tumor and limit the side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Radiofrequency (RF) thermal ablation represents one of the hyperthermia-assisted anticancer approaches. In this particular technique indeed, hyperthermia is achieved by the application of an electrode that generates electrical currents into the tumor, improving the temperature through resistive heating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The heat indeed is caused by the interactions between the electrons of the alternating current and the ions in the biological fluids (Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>−</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The stimulation is given through a needle that physically reaches the tumor and generates the high-frequency alternated currents necessary to produce heat. As a consequence, the temperature raises to around 50 °C and causes cell coagulative necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Since the heating is influenced by thermal conductance of the tissue, when the area of interest is carbonized, the ionic vibrations are limited, and thus the temperature rise is reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. However, it has been pointed out that the effective area of thermal ablation is very narrow, limiting the efficacy of this approach only for small tumors (&lt; 3 cm diameter). Additionally, if the temperature reaches values over 100 °C, the consequent water evaporation and tissue dehydration cause a decrease in the electrical conductivity, reducing thus the thermal increase in the dehydrated areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">The addition of several classes of NPs can contribute to maximize the therapeutic outcomes, supporting the temperature increase and limiting the damages for the healthy tissues. The use of NPs can furthermore help to improve the temperature only in the area of interest, actually where the NPs are localized. In this case, the needle insertion is not required, because only the tumor area is selectively heated by the specific response of the NPs, internalized into the cells or present in the tumor microenvironment. Several classes of magnetic and non-magnetic NPs have been employed in synergy to a RF application, exploiting their ability to improve the temperature for anticancer purposes. Typically, the application of an external source generates RF waves with a frequency range of 10 kHz–900 MHz. The mechanism under which this heating takes place is multifaceted and depends on both the RF source and the nanomaterials used. Actually, two types of sources are generally recognized: (1) inductively coupled device that produces an alternating magnetic field (MF) inside a solenoid and (2) capacitively coupled device that produces an alternating electric field between parallel-plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Magnetic NPs, e.g., iron oxide NPs, could be stimulated by the MF, whereas non-magnetic ones, e.g., gold NPs, seem to be more responsive to electric fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. For these reasons, magnetic and non-magnetic NP-mediated RF-hyperthermia are sometimes identified as two different approaches, e.g., as proposed by Beik, nanomagnetic hyperthermia (NMH) and nano-radio-frequency ablation (NaRFA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">Here we distinguish between magnetic and non-magnetic NPs presenting a brief overview of both the mechanisms with some examples.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Magnetic NPs</title><p id="Par54">The tumor heating with the combination of MF and magnetic NPs is emerging as promising anticancer approach, named sometimes magnetic fluid hyperthermia (MFH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], nanomagnetic hyperthermia (NMH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] or magnetic hyperthermia therapy (MHT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. It was indeed observed that the synergy between these two components is able to heat the tumor more efficiently than other techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The effectiveness of this approach is related to the specific absorption rate (SAR) value.

The first one, hysteresis loss, verifies when all the different magnetic moments possessed by the NPs continuously align following the alternating MF applied and energy is released improving the temperature of the environment. Otherwise, when the size of the NPs is below 128 nm, a single magnetic domain remains, giving them superparamagnetic properties, and in this case Néel or Brownian relaxations prevail. Néel relaxation refers to the fast realignment of the magnetic moments under a MF that, contrasting with the NP crystalline structure, generates heat.

The outcome of the synergy of magnetic NPs and MF is influenced by the features of both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It was demonstrated that NPs with different sizes could heat differently under a MF input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], but other factors, as the morphology and anisotropy of the NPs and the presence of a coating agent, as well as the viscosity of the medium, influence the heating efficacy and thus have not to be underestimated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">Iron oxide NPs, classified as magnetite, maghemite or haematite according with their structure, are the most employed nanomaterial stimulated with MFs, especially magnetite and maghemite NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].

Hemery and co-workers compared the cytotoxic power of iron oxide NPs with a different morphology, actually monocore NPs, thus nanospheres, versus multicore NPs, whit a nanoflower shape, discovering that multicore NPs caused an increased cell death in synergy with an alternating MF with respect to the monocore ones. This is explained by the higher SAR of the multicore NPs, and additionally showed a higher internalization into glioblastoma cells, causing thus a higher heat generation under a MF stimulation. Additionally, these NPs could cause mechanical stress, i.e., membrane deformation, and release a high amount of Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions, that could cause in turn oxidative stress through Fenton reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">Cobalt and nickel also exhibit the same properties of iron oxide, but they are not essential elements for the body, and thus they accumulate and cause toxicity.

Jadhav presented a remarkable study about the doping of manganese zinc ferrite NPs with the rare-earth gadolinium. They indeed substituted gadolinium metal cations in spinel ferrites, altering the magnetic and electric properties of the NPs. They evaluated the influence of the chemical properties of the doped NPs related to the gadolinium concentration, discovering that this influences the structural, colloidal and magnetic properties of the NPs. However, these NPs possessed improved magnetic properties and heating performances. The NPs resulted to be non-toxic for human lung carcinoma cells alone, but highly cytotoxic in synergy with the MF stimulation, electing such doped NPs as promising anticancer agent for magnetic hyperthermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">An important problem related with the use of these nanomaterials is the possible magnetic interactions occurring between the NPs that causes agglomerations, alters their responses to the MF, and limits their use for in vivo investigations. This evidence could be solved with the shielding of the NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. However, it was highlighted that the coating could alter the NP intrinsic magnetic properties, and thus it is of a paramount importance to prevent their loss to achieve successful results. The main purposes of these modifications are to increase the NPs biocompatibility and colloidal stability, enhancing at the same time their properties, e.g., their efficiency of heating.

The coating with gold is particularly attractive because the gold layer improves the chemical stability and biocompatibility of the magnetic NPs.

Among others, gold NPs are particularly employed for this purpose. These NPs indeed have demonstrated to improve the temperature and the cell death when associated with a RF input, but the exact mechanism is under debate, and three possibilities have been presented.</p><p id="Par63">The first mechanism proposed is the Joule or inductive heating. Actually, gold NPs could act as conductors under the RF stimulation. Therefore, the electric field penetrates into the NPs, but there is a resistive dissipation within the NPs that causes the temperature increase by heat dissipation. However, experimental observations demonstrated that this explanation is not correct, and thus the Joule heating has been rejected as possible mechanism to explain this synergy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Nonetheless, magnetic heating and electrophoretic heating have been proposed in the last years as the most probable alternatives to explain RF heating of gold NPs. Magnetic heating refers to the capability of magnetic NPs to generate heat under a magnetic stimulation. In the case of gold nanomaterials, they could become magnetic after a chemical oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Electrophoretic heating instead is due to the movement of charged species on the gold NPs surface because of the variations of the electric field: this effect causes the oscillation of the NPs and generates heat through mechanical friction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The predominance of a mechanism over the other is probably associated to the features of the experimental setup, regarding both the RF source and the NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Cardinal et al. reported the combination of gold NPs with a non-invasive RF generator to ablate tumors and avoid the side effects associated to the conventional invasive probes employed in the RF tumor ablation therapy. In vitro cell tests demonstrated that these NPs, upon the exposure to the RF field, improved the temperature achieving cell death. Additionally, the in vivo study confirmed the promising results obtained in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. The NPs size, shape, concentration, and aggregation may affect the RF heating. In this context, Amini et al. compared the influence of the surface chemistry to tailor the behavior of gold NPs and nanorods under a RF stimulation. Comparing pristine with respect to cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), citrate, and PEG-coated gold nanostructures heated under the RF irradiation, they observed a different rate of temperature increase due to the presence of the different shapes and coatings. Additionally, PEGylated NPs and nanorods coincubation with human pancreatic carcinoma cell line resulted in a decreased cell viability after the RF exposure, confirming the synergism between gold nanostructures and RF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">Also carbon-based nanomaterials have been proposed to enhance the heating consequences of a RF irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Gannon et al. highlighted the ability of single-walled carbon nanotubes to produce heat under a RF stimulation. Three cancer cell lines, HepG2, Hep3B, and Panc-1, were incubated with different concentrations of nanotubes functionalized with the Kentera biocompatible polymer, actually a polyphenylene ethynylene-based polymer, and exposed to a RF stimulation. A 100% cytotoxicity was obtained for all the three cell lines when incubated with the higher concentration of nanotubes (500 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) after 2 min of RF exposure due to the temperature rise caused by the addition of the nanotubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Bijukumar otherwise tested graphene for RF-hyperthermia in three-dimensional (3D) culture of liver cancer and in an in vivo model. The NPs were furthermore conjugated with the transferrin ligand to improve the uptake by liver cancer cells improving thus the hyperthermia effects as observed in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. However, carbon is often associated with other materials with magnetic properties, as iron oxide and cobalt, to obtain hybrid NPs with an optimal response to the magnetic component of the RF stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Furthermore, there are several examples of hybrid carbon structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].

Silicon NPs possess good properties of biocompatibility and biodegradability. Additionally, their intrinsic capability to amplify the effects of different physical stimulations allows their use for several therapeutic approaches. Silicon NPs indeed demonstrated to possess a higher heating rate than gold NPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Gongalsky et al. evaluated porous silicon nanowires (PSi NWs) combined with a RF stimulation (40 W) as anticancer approach.

Observing the cell viability upon the incubation with different non-toxic concentrations of PSi NWs, for 4 or 24 h, and treated with RF for 0, 5, 10, 20, and 30 min (panels c and d), it was highlighted that the decrease in cell viability was significantly exasperated after 24 h of incubation, where also 10 min of RF exposure became sufficient to achieve cell death. The authors explained the cell mortality with the degradation of PSi NWs outside the cells, the result in the formation of silicic acid ions. Such ions induce the heating when exposed to the RF field, probably because the ions oscillation cause energy dissipation and Joule heating of the solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Confocal images of HepG2 cells incubated with PSi NWs 4 h and <bold>b</bold> 24 h. <bold>c</bold> HepG2 cells viability upon the incubation with different concentrations of PSi NWs for 4 h and the further RF irradiation. <bold>d</bold> HepG2 cells viability upon the incubation with different concentrations of PSi NWs for 24 h and the further RF irradiation.

According to the authors, the MW stimulation generated a plasma in the microbubbles of the solution, with the release of UV light able to induce the formation of free radicals from the NPs. The presence of the NPs also increased the number of microbubbles that could respond to the MW stimulation producing UV light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>].

Grebinyk et al. evaluated the accumulation and localization inside human leukemic cells of C<sub>60</sub> fullerene NPs and their photosensitizing properties induced by UV, violet, green, and red high-power single-chip LEDs light irradiation. The results evidenced the NPs localization in mitochondria of human leukemic cells. The highest cytotoxicity was recorded when NPs where combined with a UV irradiation, whereas no toxic effects were reported when the NPs were associated with an irradiation of green or red light, because of the lower absorption of the NPs in these regions.

The irradiation with a light characterized by an energy higher than their band gap (3.3 eV) indeed induces an electron transfer from the valence band to the conduction band, with the creation of an electron–hole pair. The electrons can reduce oxygen molecules thus forming superoxide radical anion, while the holes can oxidize water molecules and hydroxide ions, generating hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen peroxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In this context, our group demonstrated through electron paramagnetic resonance studies that pristine zinc oxide NPs (ZnO NPs) were not able to induce ROS generation without an external stimulation.

When zinc oxide is combined with copper, e.g., and irradiated with visible light, it was observed that a reaction occurs between the electrons present in the valence band of zinc oxide and the copper, with the conversion of Cu<sup>2+</sup> to Cu<sup>+</sup>. This last generated species and the positive holes on the NPs surface both react with oxygen, hydroxyl groups and water with a consequent ROS formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>].

These radiations indeed possess a deeper tissue penetration, in contrast with the UV generally employed to induce the production of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. In the case of NIR, this is achieved conjugating the NPs responsive to PDT, i.e., titania and zinc oxide NPs, with the so-called up-conversion NPs, that are usually comprised of host lattices of ceramic materials, embedded with transition metal, actinide or lanthanide ions and are able to absorb NIR light and excite the NPs releasing visible light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>].

Otherwise, non-thermal effects depend on the acoustic cavitation and its consequences. This phenomenon is related to rarefaction and compression cycles caused by the US field, in which gas pockets, already present in the body, grow and form microbubbles that expand and shrink. In the so-called stable or non-inertial cavitation, the microbubbles oscillate for several acoustic cycles, heating the irradiated area and causing mechanical stress through the generation of microstreamings, radiation forces, and shear stress. On the contrary, in the inertial cavitation the microbubbles collapse generating very high pressures and temperatures, inducing also the formation of several ROS trough the sonolysis of water molecules or perturbing molecules in close proximity to imploding bubbles.

Ebrahimi et al. investigated the sonodynamic properties of iron oxide nanoparticles in a breast carcinoma cell line. They showed an increased cytotoxic effect when they improved the concentration of NPs subjected to a US exposure. This was perhaps due to iron ions release, because they can react with hydrogen peroxide, forming hydroxyl and hydroperoxyl radicals through Fenton reaction, increasing ROS burst and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>].</p><p id="Par107">Gong et al. otherwise suggested the use of oxygen-deficient MnWO<sub>X</sub> NPs as sonosensitizers. With these NPs indeed a highly effective SDT treatment of tumors was achieved. The oxygen-deficient structure could provide electron trapping sites to prevent electron–hole recombination, causing the production of a large amount of ROS. Additionally, NPs showed a unique capability of glutathione depletion, which increases SDT-triggered cancer cell killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>].</p><p id="Par108">Silicon has been employed to build active NPs under US. Osminkina et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>] synthetized dextran-coated silicon NPs and investigated their potential application as sonosensitizer in vitro and in vivo. The observed enhanced cell death was explained with SDT-associated hyperthermia and mechanical damages caused by the internal motion of the NPs that results in apoptosis, actually the previously mentioned “nanoscalpel effect”. Furthermore, investigating the interactions between silicon NPs and US, Sviridov et al. highlighted two main mechanisms. (1) an enhanced scattering and viscous dissipation of the US energy in the medium with NPs, resulting in the heating of the medium; (2) an augmented acoustic cavitation-associated heating, more pronounced in the case of NPs with hydrophobic inner walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>].</p><p id="Par109">The use of carbon-based nanomaterials as sonosensitizers is also reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>]. In this context, Kharin and group proposed a new theranostic agent consisting of fluorescent carbon NPs. They observed the preferential accumulation of these NPs in both the nuclei of healthy and cancer cells after the internalization. Furthermore, the subsequent treatment with US resulted in a mechanical injury and cell death for both the cell lines considered, highlighting the importance of the tumor targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>].</p><p id="Par110">Another possibility is to employ materials with piezoelectric properties to electrically stimulate cancer cells exposed to US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>]. For this purpose, Marino et al. used biocompatible piezoelectric barium titanate NPs functionalized with epidermal growth factor in order to target breast cancer cells. US treatments were performed 1 h once a day for 4 days to cells W/O NPs. Later, they evaluated cell metabolism, cell cycle, and the morphology of the mitotic spindles. They recorded a drop of the metabolic activity, a stop of cell proliferation, and mitotic aberrations in cells treated with both nanoparticles and US, confirming the existence of a synergistic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>].

Part of the SW therapeutic outcomes lies on the so-called mechanotransduction effect. This is composed by the molecular mechanisms that regulate the responses at the mechanical stimulations, and influences processes such as migration, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>]. SW have also been proposed alone to inhibit the growth of cancer cells. Foglietta et al. reported that when mesenchymal stem cells and cancer cells (glioblastoma or osteosarcoma) co-cultures are irradiated with SW, the consequence is a selective cancer cell death related to the ROS production by mesenchymal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>]. Otherwise, SW could be employed to permeabilize temporarily cell membrane and improve the uptake of drugs and chemotherapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>], as well for the delivery of nucleic acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>].</p><p id="Par113">Additionally, some researchers proposed to use SW in SDT investigations. This proposal was made because, despite the promising anticancer results obtained with the SDT in different cell lines and tumor models, an important limitation is represented by the understanding of its operating principle, even if it is believed that the main mechanism lies in the inertial cavitation. The use of high-energy SW to activate the sonosensitizer allows to minimize the thermal effects related to US and to precisely observe the non-thermal ones and their consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>]. Some authors thus employed SW in synergy with canonical photosensitizers in order to achieve cancer cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>]. In this case, NPs could be exploited to deliver the sonosensitizer and improve its internalization in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>]. Varchi et al. synthetized poly-methyl methacrylate NPs (PMMANPs) carrying the meso-tetrakis (4-sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin (TPPS), observing an enhancement of the sonosensitizing action of the TPPS when loaded into the PMMANPs in terms of reduction in tumor volume in a breast cancer model, and additionally recorded an improved expression of genes related to oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>].</p><p id="Par114">Some NPs could be also employed as sonosensitizers to study the synergy with SW, but from our knowledge, only our recent study with zinc oxide nanocrystals (ZnO NCs) and SW with different positive peak pressure (PPP) successfully conjugated NPs with SW. We indeed compared the effects of a single toward multiple SW stimulations in cervical adenocarcinoma cells co-incubated with ZnO NCs. We discovered that only multiple stimulations (three treatments/day) were able to trigger the synergy with ZnO NCs and thus induced cancer cells to death (Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>). The observed cell death is probably related to a multifaceted mechanism potentially involving some of the pathways proposed above, as the amplification of US effects, a partial NPs dissolution with the release of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions, which imbalance is responsible of different alterations in cell behavior, and perhaps to a situation of mechanical stress caused by the motion of the internalized NPs under the SW stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison between single toward multiple SW treatments on cancer cells co-incubated with ZnO NCs.

There are nanomaterials responsive to more stimulations, as gold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>]. Otherwise, hybrid NPs comprising materials with different properties could be employed, and each component could interact with a single input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. This has indeed the remarkable advantage to increase the therapeutic outcomes further reducing side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>], and several possible strategies are reported in the literature.</p><p id="Par116">A first possibility is to employ nanomaterials with the intriguing property to improve the radiation therapy efficacy and also able to generate hyperthermia in association with a second stimulus. Hyperthermia indeed is able to radiosensitize cancer cells inhibiting DNA repair and, at the same time, increasing the oxygenation of the tissues acting on the blood flow. In this way, the radiation dose required to obtain the complete tumor ablation is reduced, limiting thus the side effects associated to this therapeutic approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref>]. MF-responsive NPs could be employed for this purpose, and furthermore, they could be magnetically delivered to a target area and used for imaging. Magnetic NPs, as iron oxide ones, and hybrid NPs have been proposed in this context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Anyway, in this particular combination usually only one of the stimulations activates the NPs to trigger cytotoxicity. In this example, Jiang et al. adopted gadolinium-doped iron oxide NPs that in synergy with a magnetic stimulation generate both thermal ablation and mild hyperthermia in a mouse model. This effect improved the efficacy of the subsequent radiation therapy through the reduction in the radiation resistance, decreasing the fraction of hypoxic cells, and perturbing the tumor vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>]. In another case on the contrary hybrid NPs acted in synergism with the radiation therapy, while the magnetic stimulation was employed only for imaging purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">177</xref>].</p><p id="Par117">Otherwise, the combination of radiation therapy with PTT has been widely explored. A first possibility is to employ a multi-responsive nanomaterial, as gold. Gold nanostructures indeed generate heat when excited by light and additionally their radiosensitizing effect is reported in the literature as abovementioned. Various morphologies of gold nanostructures have been therefore employed for a double stimulation with light and radiation therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">178</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">179</xref>]. More in general, several metal NPs could potentially be involved in the same exploration, as bismuth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref>] and platinum NPs, which anticancer efficacy in combination with radiation therapy and PTT has been recently demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">181</xref>]. Also hybrid NPs, such as copper sulfide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">182</xref>] or composed by gold and iron oxide, have been largely employed in the combined PTT-radiation therapy approach. Furthermore, some of these nanohybrids could be potentially activated also by a magnetic stimulation, opening the possibility to insert a third physical input, even if for imaging purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref>]. In this context, Mohavedi et al. recently deepened the mechanism of this synergy, demonstrating that gold-coated iron oxide core–shell NPs are accumulated in mitochondria after the internalization in KB cancer cells. The double stimulation by light and radiation therapy causes a massive cell injury, observable through transmission electron microscopy, and activates the expression of apoptotic genes. Also the overexpression of the HSP70 gene, associated to cell heating, inflammation, radiation and others stress stimuli, has been recorded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">184</xref>].</p><p id="Par118">Considering instead the possibility to combine radiation therapy with PDT, another opportunity is to conjugate a photosensitizer with a radiation-responding material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">185</xref>]. From the best of our knowledge, however, only conventional photosensitizers have been involved in these studies. NPs indeed are sometimes employed merely as carrier, without playing an active role in synergy with the stimulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">185</xref>].</p><p id="Par119">Radiation therapy is often associated to US for imaging purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">186</xref>], and furthermore US irradiation alone can radiosensitize cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">187</xref>]. Shanei et al. moreover proposed to add gold NPs that are able to interact synergistically with both X-ray and US triggering cancer cell death. The authors indeed measured the sono-radiosensitivity effect of different concentrations of gold NPs on HeLa cells, tuning the parameters of both US and X-rays. They found that all the considered concentrations improved cell mortality when remotely activated by the two inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>].</p><p id="Par120">Leaving the radiation therapy, there are moreover some interesting proposals where nanomaterials are remotely activated by a MF and another physical stimulation. It is reported in the literature that the combination of magnetic hyperthermia and PTT has a tremendous impact on cancer cells, because their interaction is very effective, overcoming furthermore the limitations and the drawbacks associated with the single magnetic hyperthermia or PTT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">188</xref>]. In this context, some studies with NPs have been presented, involving both NPs made by a single material and hybrid NPs in which each component is remotely activated by a different input, even if in some cases the magnetic stimulation has only imaging purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Espinosa et al. demonstrated that iron oxide nanocubes remotely triggered by MF and a light input provoked a more marked temperature increase than when the nanocubes were irradiated by only one of the stimulations. This synergistic or cumulative effect allowed the complete cancer cell death in vitro and tumor ablation in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">189</xref>]. Ma et al. additionally proposed the use of hybrid NPs formed by iron oxide and palladium. These NPs indeed possess magnetic properties, due to the iron oxide component, the capability to generate ROS in the presence of hydrogen peroxide through to Fenton reactions, and PTT responsiveness due to the palladium. Actually, palladium possesses a strong SPR band in the NIR region and moreover could generate ROS in acidic conditions. The authors recorded a high-temperature increase with the double-activation of the NPs, and additionally an improved ROS generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">190</xref>].</p><p id="Par121">PDT has also been proposed in combination with a magnetic stimulation. The aim of the MF input could be also in this case for imaging and for the magnetic guidance of the NPs; however, sometimes MF can also contribute to cell death. The nanosystem involved in this case is generally composed by NPs with magnetic properties conjugated with a photosensitizer, maximizing the therapeutic outcomes under a double magnetic-light stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">188</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">191</xref>]. Curcio et al. synthetized hybrid NPs constituted by a nanoflower-like iron oxide structure and a copper sulfide shell. The iron oxide core indeed increased the temperature under a MF, while the copper shell made them responsive to light for both PTT and PDT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">192</xref>].</p><p id="Par122">Magnetic hyperthermia could be also combined with US, and there are some examples in the literature of this dual-stimulation. Jozefczak et al. demonstrated that the temperature of a tissue mimicking phantom showed a more marked increase when iron oxide NPs were irradiated by both MF and US, rather than the single stimulation. This effect was explained as the NPs improved the absorption of US energy and were also capable to produce heating under the MF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">193</xref>]. Despite of this, the MF role is often limited to imaging and targeting when combined with US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref>].</p><p id="Par123">In contrast with all the modalities for a remote triggering of the NPs presented above, MW have been very rarely involved in a dual-stimulation mode of NPs, and from our knowledge, no cases of MW-PTT and MW-PTT involving NPs as therapeutic agent are reported. US otherwise have been sometimes employed in combination with MW to improve tumor ablation. The localized impairment of tumor vasculature following the acoustic cavitation indeed could improve the efficacy of the MW-associated hyperthermia decreasing the heat loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">195</xref>]. Otherwise, US could be involved for imaging purposes, e.g., to monitor the MW thermal ablation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">196</xref>], thus potentially the addition of NPs could drastically improve the therapeutic effects. Gebreel et al. demonstrated the enhanced cytotoxicity of iron oxide NPs stimulated by both US and MW in tumor-bearing mice, with a 97.89% reduction in the tumor volume following the dual-mode stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">197</xref>].</p><p id="Par124">Besides, since both PDT and PTT possess a high therapeutic efficacy and low side effects, several researches have attempted their combination to maximize cancer cell death. In this case, hybrid complexes formed by a PTT-responsive NP and a conventional photosensitizer have been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">198</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">199</xref>], as the use of sole NPs opportunely build to improve both PTT and PDT outcomes. A possibility is to employ NPs synthetized with a single material responsive to both the stimuli, as gold. Actually, gold has the capability to generate ROS under certain conditions of irradiation, perhaps though a plasmon-activated pathway or an indirect modality. Unfortunately, this mechanism is not well explored, as the majority of the studies in the literature presents gold NPs as carrier of photosensitizer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">200</xref>], instead of the sole gold NPs in synergy with light for a dual PDT–PTT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>]. Also black titania nanostructures could be employed for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]. An alternative is to design hybrid NPs with improved photosensitive properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>]. In this latter case, Lee et al. synthetized a nanocomplex constituted by defective titania NPs that generates ROS when exposed to NIR, and gold nanorods, as PTT-enhancers. When HeLa cells, previously incubated with the nanocomplexes, were subjected to both PDT and PTT, a significantly reduced cell viability was observed and associated to ROS burst, produced by titania NPs, and temperature increase, due to the irradiation of the nanorods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">202</xref>].</p><p id="Par125">Moreover, focusing of light-US dual-activated NPs, there are several examples of NPs for a combined SDT–PTT. Sazgarnia et al. proposed gold NPs excited by light and US. In this context, indeed gold NPs could decrease the cavitation threshold delivering gas pockets on their structure and additionally, when irradiated by NIR light, they induce a temperature increase. The temperature rise moreover causes the vaporization of the surrounding medium, providing vapor bubbles which are active under the US field. The administration of the NPs and the irradiation with both inputs resulted to inhibit more efficiently the tumor growth and improves the cumulative survival fraction in colon carcinoma bearing mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">203</xref>]. Han et al. exploited otherwise NPs composed by black TiO<sub>2</sub>@TiO<sub>2−<italic>x</italic></sub> core/shell nanostructures composed by titania nanocrystals with an oxygen-deficient surface layer for a combined PTT-SDT anticancer therapy. The oxygen deficiency indeed facilitates the electron-holes separations under US, improving the regeneration of ROS, and furthermore this nanosystem is responsive to NIR, triggering hyperthermia. NPs were non-toxic for cancer cells in vitro (Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>b), but only when activated by both laser light and US, as confirmed by the flow cytometry assessment of apoptosis and fluorescence microscopy analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>c–e, respectively). Furthermore, ROS production resulted to be maximized when the NPs acted synergistically with both the inputs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>f). The proposed treatment was additionally able to completely eradicate the tumor in a mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>]. There are besides several examples of hybrid titania NPs for an enhanced PTT-SDT anticancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">204</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">205</xref>]. Otherwise when PDT is combined with SDT, from the best of our knowledge, one of the components is always a conventional photosensitizer, i.e., a porphyrin, not involving the NPs as sole therapeutic agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>].<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Combined effect of NPs with light and US. <bold>a</bold> Scheme illustrating the synergy proposed. <bold>b</bold> Cell viability after incubation with the proposed nanosystem (B-TiO<sub>2−<italic>x</italic></sub>-PEG). <bold>c</bold> Cell viability after different treatments. ***<italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001. <bold>d</bold> Flow cytometry apoptosis assay after different treatments, staining with Annexin-FITC and PI. <bold>e</bold> Confocal laser scanning microscopy images of after different treatments, PI (red fluorescence), calcein-AM (green fluorescence).

The nanosystem proposed indeed is able to accumulate in the tumor area, where causes thermal ablation upon a NIR irradiation. They have demonstrated to possess a low long-term toxicity, and their activation through an MRI/US guided laser irradiation is under evaluation (NCT04240639) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">210</xref>].</p><p id="Par134">Iron oxide NPs (Magnablate) have also been proposed to achieve thermal ablation under a MF stimulation in prostate cancer. These magnetic NPs can precisely accumulate into the target region through a direct injection and generate heat when a MF is applied. Additionally, the eventual extravasation of the NPs has to be non-toxic for the neighboring tissues. The aim of the clinical trial NCT02033447 is to test the localization of the NPs in patients prior to the surgical removal of the prostate without heating. However, the results of such trial are still unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">208</xref>].</p><p id="Par135">There are other proposals involving nanosystems remotely activated by an external input, e.g., thermoresponsive liposomes, but the therapeutic agent is represented by a drug and has been revised elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">208</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par136">Cancer nanomedicine represents a promising strategy to achieve the complete tumor remission overcoming the limitations of the conventional anticancer approaches. To further improve the therapeutic outcomes, an innovative strategy consists in the adoption of NPs remotely activated through an external physical stimulation to trigger cancer cell death. Both the components involved, actually the NPs and the stimulation, are administrated in a non-toxic dose, and only in the tumor area they work synergistically maximizing the therapeutic efficacy and reducing the side effects for the adjacent healthy tissues.</p><p id="Par137">Several possible combinations have nowadays been proposed, employing NPs constituted by a single material or hybrid tools, activated by one or more external physical inputs for therapy and/or diagnosis. This synergism is able to trigger NPs toxicity, and moreover NPs could contribute in several ways to improve the efficacy of the physical input, releasing other forms of energy (e.g., heat), and often contributing to improve its focalization. NPs besides protect healthy tissues, helping to focalize the therapeutic action only in the tumor area, where they actively contribute to maximize tumor ablation, and sometimes directly protecting the tissues surrounding the area of interest.</p><p id="Par138">Anyway, as presented in the previous section about the clinical trials involving remotely activated NPs, only few of the proposals have reached the clinical phase. It has to be pointed out that we have considered only the cases where the therapeutic agent is represented by a NP triggering cell toxicity in synergy with a physical stimulation, thus without the involvement of other factors (i.e., drugs). Additionally, from Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> it is clear that the clinical trials actually available are related to only one stimulation per NP type.</p><p id="Par139">This issue could be overcome by paying close attention to the following challenges that need to be approached in a multidisciplinary way. (1) The NP synthesis is strictly important to determine NPs features, it has to be scalable for the industrial production and reproducible. (2) A careful control over the physical, chemical properties of the NPs, as well as the evaluation of their behavior in different biological fluids is necessary, because these factors can dramatically tailor the therapeutic outcome. (3) It is mandatory to evaluate the NPs selectivity toward cancer cells with respect to the healthy ones. (4) The working mechanism of the synergy is a key parameter to understand how the therapy works and it could be ameliorated. (5) The passage from in vitro to in vivo is crucial to evaluate NPs fate in the body and the effectiveness of the therapy, and even the models should be carefully chosen with a scrupulous study-design.</p><p id="Par140">Besides, the passage from research to clinic and industry appears to be nowadays still challenging and limited to few cases, even if there is a large number of possible combinations between physical stimulations and NPs that demonstrated an increased cytotoxic potential in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, many future efforts are needed to bring the excellent results of the research reported so far to a real application.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (Grant Agreement No 678151 – Project Acronym “TROJANANOHORSE” – ERC starting Grant), and also from the Politecnico di Torino and the Moschini Spa Company through a seed funding of Proof-of-Concept Grant No.16417.</p></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>International Agency for Research in Cancer</collab></person-group><source>Latest Global Cancer Data</source><year>2018</year><publisher-loc>Geneva</publisher-loc><publisher-name>World Health Organization</publisher-name></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hanahan</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinberg</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation</article-title><source>Cell</source><year>2011</year><volume>144</volume><fpage>646</fpage><lpage>674</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.cell.2011.02.013</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tran</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>DeGiovanni</surname><given-names>P-J</given-names></name><name><surname>Piel</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Rai</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Cancer nanomedicine: a review of recent success in drug delivery</article-title><source>Clin.
