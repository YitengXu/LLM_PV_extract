This study assesses how reducing the extraction and use of fossil fuels could affect the supply of (i) elements jointly produced with fossil fuels and (ii) elements jointly produced with a host that is currently mainly used in fossil fuel supply chains. Several critical resources are identified for which supply potential from current sources is likely to decline. Some of these, e.g. germanium and vanadium, have uses in low-carbon energy systems. Renewable energy transitions can thus simultaneously increase demand and reduce supply of critical elements. The problem is greatest for technology groups in which by-products are more difficult to recycle than the host. Photovoltaic cell technology stands out as one such group. Phasing out fossil fuels has the potential to reduce both the supply potential (i.e. primary flow) and recoverable resources (i.e. stock) of materials involved in such technology groups. Further studies could examine possibilities to increase recovery rates, extract jointly produced resources independently of hosts and how the geographical distribution of by-product supply sources might change if fossil fuel extraction is scaled back.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>By-product</kwd><kwd>Climate change mitigation</kwd><kwd>Critical

reduction of the use of fossil fuels and the increased use of renewable energy (GEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2012</xref>; IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2017</xref>). Previous research has examined how the production of renewable energy affects demand for metals perceived as critical (Tokimatsu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2018</xref>), metal supply bottlenecks that can constrain a low-carbon energy transition (Valero et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2018</xref>), to what extent recycling, improved material efficiency and substitutes can reduce demand for virgin resources (Månberger and Stenqvist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2018</xref>) and the geographical distribution of metals used in renewable energy systems (Church and Crawford <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Both supply- and demand-side factors contribute to making some metals critical (Graedel and Reck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2016</xref>; Schrijvers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2020</xref>), for example: whether production sites or reserves of the material are geographically concentrated; whether the metal is produced jointly with a host resource; whether substitutes are inferior or non-existent; or whether one or several applications of the metal have high economic, social, or military significance. Previous research has shown that energy transitions induced by climate mitigation objectives will increase total metal demand, since renewable energy is more material intensive than fossil energy (Watari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">By-products are recovered from host resources after these have been extracted. They are often not profitable to extract on their own. As a result of joint resource production, host resource supply (and thus host demand for it) will affect the supply potential of by-product resources that are recovered from the host. Nassar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2015</xref>) identified ten host resources (silicon, platinum, gold, aluminium, titanium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, and lead) on which supplies of by-products, such as indium, germanium, and gallium, depend. Although the production of these two groups of metals is connected, they are not subject to identical market pressures. By-products typically fetch a higher market price than the host (or “carrier”) per weight, but the total economic value for the producer is much higher for the host due to the higher volume (Fu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>). As a result, the supply of by-product metals is less responsive to price increases than is the supply of host metals, i.e. lower price elasticity (Jordan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2018</xref>; Redlinger and Eggert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2016</xref>). For example, Fu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>) estimated the long-term supply elasticity for three by-products (indium, germanium, and selenium) to be between 0.02 and 0.1. The authors caution that these estimates are uncertain for several reasons: the difficulty of anticipating market prices; strategic stockpiling by states; and states paying above the market price for resources in exchange for guaranteed long-term supply contracts. It should be noted that a continuum exists for the relative value of the host and the resource that is jointly produced with it (Fizaine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2013</xref>). The economic literature refers to jointly produced resources as <italic>co-products</italic> when the relative values of the resources are similar, and as <italic>by-product</italic>s when the difference is large. One example of a by-product is gallium, which is recovered from aluminium (bauxite). Its market price would have to increase more than 20-fold for gallium to have a similar value as the aluminium it is recovered from (Frenzel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">In short, host resource supply influences the supply potential for by-products when the by-product is not economic to produce on its own. Watari et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2020</xref>) identified that research of future resource supply chains are often inconsistent, because the linkages between host and by-products are not factored in when material flows are analysed. In theory, the supply of a given by-product will fall short of demand if (i) demand for the by-product grows more rapidly than demand for the host; or (ii) primary supply of the host declines. Previous studies have focused on the former relation and argued that an increase in the production of wind power (Nassar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>) and solar photovoltaics (Elshkaki and Graedel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>) may strain the supply of necessary by-product materials. However, for at least some resources, it may not be necessary to increase production of the host material in order to increase by-product production. As it stands, not all metal refineries are equipped with by-product recovery technologies; if they were fitted with these, more by-product could be produced relative to the volume of host product (Fizaine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2013</xref>; Frenzel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>). Supply for indium could be tripled in this way, while supply for gallium and germanium could potentially be increased tenfold (Frenzel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Future by-product supply potential is sensitive to how the primary supply of the host will develop, but research on this topic is scarce. Some studies have noted that technological disruptions that reduce host demand will affect the supply of both host and co- or by-product resources (Løvik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2016</xref>; Sprecher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2017</xref>). However, no study to date has examined whether and how mitigating climate change might reduce the demand and supply of non-fossil resources, and which resources could be affected. These are the focal issues of the present study. Of particular interest are resources for which climate change mitigation is likely to both reduce supply and increase demand.</p><p id="Par7">This study’s main novel contribution is that it identifies which jointly produced resources may be subject to a decline in supply (flow) and/or availability (stock) if fossil fuel use is reduced in the future (Sects. <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Resources Produced Jointly with Fossil Resources</xref> and <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Jointly Produced Elements from Elements Used in the Fossil Energy System</xref>). This study also identifies end-use sectors that are exposed to the risk of reduced supply of elements jointly produced from the fossil fuel supply chain (Sect. <xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">Discussion</xref>). Metals used in current solar photovoltaics can become scarcer as a result of climate mitigation measures, which simultaneously reduce supply and increase demand for these metals. Overall, this study contributes to the literature on joint resource production, critical materials, and to the growing research field of the materiality of energy transitions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p id="Par8">This paper starts by assessing four elements (germanium, helium, sulphur, and vanadium) future supply potential (Sect. <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Resources Produced Jointly with Fossil Resources</xref>). These elements are being supplied, entirely or in part, by a process or processes in the fossil fuel supply chain. In other words, these elements are jointly produced with fossil fuels. This study then identifies elements for which a majority of the demand is attributed to the extraction or use of fossil energy, using data on different elements’ primary applications found in the literature (Fortier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>; Schulz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2017</xref>; UNEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2011</xref>; USGS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2019</xref>). Three steps in the fossil fuel supply chain are analysed: extraction, refining, and final use (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Three individual elements (barite, lead, and rhenium) and one group (the platinum-group elements, PGE) are identified as being used primarily in fossil supply chains (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Elements Primarily Used in Fossil Energy Systems Today</xref>). Some of these elements are hosts to other elements, which means that their production affects the supply of elements that are jointly produced with them. Section <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Jointly Produced Elements from Elements Used in the Fossil Energy System</xref> explores which elements are jointly produced with hosts that are primarily used in in the fossil energy system.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Illustration of three steps in the fossil fuel supply chain (second line), elements recovered from these steps (top line, Sect. <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Resources Produced Jointly with Fossil Resources</xref> in the article), elements used in the different steps (third line, Sect. <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Elements Primarily Used in Fossil Energy Systems Today</xref>), and elements jointly produced with these (bottom line, Sect. <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Jointly Produced Elements from Elements Used in the Fossil Energy System</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41247_2021_88_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">This paper divides jointly produced elements into two groups: co-products, which have similar values for the producer and are often separated at an early stage (e.g. during concentration), and by-products, which tend to be produced in smaller quantities and require more processing to separate (e.g. at the refining, smelting, or post-combustion stages). The distinction is, therefore, a matter of the relevant ores’ geological properties, the techniques used to extract and refine metals from them and relative market prices.</p><p id="Par10">The supply potentials of Germanium, Helium, and Sulphur recovered from fossil fuels were calculated following Frenzel et al.

The remainder of the primary germanium production is recovered from the leaching of zinc. However, coal makes up the vast majority (89–94% depending on cut-off grade) of potential supply (Frenzel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>). Based on estimates for cut-off grades, recovery rates, and germanium content from Frenzel et al.

For the higher cut-off grade (200 ppm), the supply-to-use fraction drops to 5 in the SD scenario, enabling primary supply to grow by 11%/year. It should be remembered that such growth rates are theoretical. The historic long-term supply elasticity for germanium is estimated to be 0.02 (Fu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>) indicating a slow supply response to higher prices.

Helium is the second most common element in the universe and is available in the earth’s atmosphere, but low-cost production requires a higher concentration, which is found in some conventional natural gas fields. Alongside methane, these fields trap helium released by decaying thorium and other radioactive materials. Shale formations do not trap helium and are, therefore, not a viable helium source (Nuttall et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2012</xref>). Maximum potential helium production is, therefore, assumed to be a function of conventional gas production.

Since this is not currently done, production cost curves remain uncertain. A handful of geological spots in North America and Tanzania have been identified, which may contain sufficiently high helium concentration to enable primary extraction, but production at these locations is not commercial (Danabalan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2017</xref>; Edison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2017</xref>). Another possibility is air separation, but the energy cost of doing so makes this uneconomical at the moment. Some estimates indicate that air-separated helium would cost 60–100 times more than crude helium (similar to the cost of liquid neon separated from air), but such estimates are sensitive to assumptions about energy cost and the allocation of capital cost (Clarke and Clare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>). Clarke and Clare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>) estimate that helium could be separated from air at a little less than triple the cost of extracting it from crude helium if existing cryogenic plants were refitted.

Mines that only extract lead are uncommon, because the ores usually consists of minerals rich in lead and zinc (and sometimes silver). Only in a small proportion of the mineral deposits containing lead, does the lead contribute more than 50% of their value (see supplement). Mining operations, therefore, typically extract both lead and zinc. Which of the two supplies the greater share of their revenue depends on local geological conditions, minerals targeted by the mine, and current market prices?</p><p id="Par43">The metals contained in the minerals can either be separated at an early stage (separating at the concentrate stage provides co-products) or later, during the smelting and refining process (providing by-products).

If demand for primary lead declines, for example, then the production of metals separated during the smelting of primary lead will likely decline, whereas metals separated at an earlier stage may still be profitable to produce. The following two sections therefore analyse metals separated during lead refining and those found in minerals associated with lead ores, respectively. Reduced lead mining would directly reduce the supply of metals in the former category; it could also indirectly affect the supply of lead-co-products, if extraction of some mineral deposits becomes insufficiently profitable. It should be noted that some metals (e.g. silver and zinc) belong to both of these categories, but a majority of lead’s co- and by-products are in either one or the other.

This can be seen in the data on the share of revenues that PGE mines make from different metals (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Cumulative share of value from platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium, Iridium, gold, nickel, copper, cobalt, and chromium, in mining output from mines that produce PGE.

Nickel is the most important by-product by economic value, but PGE-rich mines only represent 2% of global primary nickel production. In the larger group, where mines obtain ≥ 20% of their revenue from PGEs, nickel-rich mines are present that instead produce PGEs as a by-product. In other words, lower PGE demand would primarily affect supply of the different PGEs, as nickel mines exist that produce PGEs as by-products. However, mines that extract PGEs produce different compositions of the respective PGEs compared to nickel mines. Platinum and palladium make up almost 90% of the PGE market by value (Cowley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>). A decreased demand that reduced primary supply of these two metals would also reduce supply of rhodium, ruthenium, and iridium, as these three metals are primarily produced in PGE mines and not as by-products in nickel mines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Uncertainties with Estimating Future Stocks, Potential Flows, and Recovered Flows</title><p id="Par54">The size of future stocks and flows are uncertain and have been disputed for long due to diverging assumptions on, e.g. future technological advancements. Lately, new issues have been identified that may constrain mining activities in the future, e.g. impacts of climate change (Northey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2017</xref>; Odell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2018</xref>) and increased risk of social instability due to environmental degradation (Lebre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>). This study has identified a new source of uncertainty, namely how mitigating climate change can reduce the use of host resources and thereby reduce primary supply of by-products.</p><p id="Par55">Sections <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Resources Produced Jointly with Fossil Resources</xref> and <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Jointly Produced Elements from Elements Used in the Fossil Energy System</xref> identify that potential supply (i.e. flow) and availability (i.e. stock measured as reserves, or estimated ultimately recoverable resources) of by- and co-product elements could diminish if mining practices change due to carbon mitigation practices. It should be noted that Sect. <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Resources Produced Jointly with Fossil Resources</xref> only studies two fossil fuel supply scenarios and that many other trajectories are possible, for example if affordability of fossil fuels change (Garcia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par56">Supply potential, i.e. the total amount of recoverable by-products contained in extracted minerals, is much higher than the current amount of primary product, because not all by-products are recovered. Estimates of current supply shares from different hosts are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Previous studies have argued that surplus flow provides flexibility to increase by-product supply from today’s level without expanding host extraction, and that by-products are, therefore, not as scarce as they are commonly perceived to be (Frenzel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>; Jordan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2018</xref>). However, this argument is based on the assumption that primary host supplies do not decline. This study has found that the supply potential for some resources could decline as a result of mitigating climate change. One example is germanium, where 40% of current primary production is recovered from coal, but where coal accounts for nearly all (94%) of the supply potential.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Summary of host resources for which demand may diminish as a result of reduced use of fossil fuels; by-products directly affected; and co-products for which supply could be reduced indirectly.

One example is Germanium that a lower cut-off grade increased the supply potential almost five times (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This study did not consider to what extent the cut-off grade depends on prices and how price changes affect cut-off grades. This could be studied in more detail. Furthermore, this study assumed that the by-product content will not affect if a host is extracted or not. This has generally been the case with sulphur as an exemption (low sulphur deposits are preferred). Future research could analyse how and under what circumstances by-product content can affect profitability of extracting individual deposits and how this can affect by-product supply potentials. For example, sour natural gas could become more valuable if sulphur becomes scarce.</p><p id="Par58">Some host resources currently used in the fossil fuel supply chain can also be used in low-carbon energy systems. How reduced demand from the fossil fuel sector compares to increased demand from the energy transition is unclear. Platinum is a case in point. Platinum demand has declined recently in tandem with sales of internal combustion vehicles, which use platinum for exhaust catalysts. Demand for primary platinum is declining more rapidly than total demand, due to a high recycling rate of platinum catalysts and available stock in society. Platinum for fuel cell vehicles provides a possible new demand source, but battery electric vehicles have so far been more popular. The combinations of uncertain and time-divergent demand and high recycling rate of current use could be subject to more detailed studies in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Demand Increase for Identified By-Products and Available Substitutes</title><p id="Par59">The elements identified in this study as being at risk of reduced supply and/or price rises as a result of lower fossil fuel supply are used in a wide variety of applications (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Previous studies have shown that demand for critical resources is expected to increase as renewable energy replaces fossil fuels (Arrobas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>; Watari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2020</xref>). This study has found that several of these critical resources are at risk of reduced supply potential or price increases if fossil fuels are phased out, e.g. bismuth, germanium, gallium, indium, and vanadium. Bismuth can be used to increase solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2015</xref>) and in catalysts to produce electrofuels from CO<sub>2</sub> (Medina-Ramos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2014</xref>). Germanium has optical properties and, similarly to gallium and indium, can be used in thin-film solar panels. Crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells do not use these metals but instead contain silver, which is also affected. That low-carbon energy transitions can simultaneously increase demand and reduce supply for critical resources has not been identified before. However, previous criticality research has highlighted that technological shifts that reduce host supply and increase by-product demand are more problematic that than those that only affect supply or demand (Nakamura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2008</xref>). Future research could explore which other potential developments would reduce demand for host metals and how by-product supply would be affected, e.g. circular host material flows or degrowth.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>List of elements at risk of reduced supply potential and/or higher price as a result of phasing out fossil fuels; their relation to fossil fuels supply chains; examples of their end-use applications; and their status as critical according to the US and the EU</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Element(s)</p></th><th align="left"><p>Examples of applications<sup>a</sup></p></th><th align="left"><p>Critical according to US<sup>b</sup></p></th><th align="left"><p>Critical according to EU<sup>c</sup></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Antimony</p></td><td align="left"><p>Flame retardant, lead-acid batteries, armour-piercing bullets, camouflage paint (IR reflector)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Bismuth</p></td><td align="left"><p>Solders, alloy constituent, pharmaceuticals</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Gallium</p></td><td align="left"><p>Radar, mobile phones, LED, thin-film solar PV</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Germanium</p></td><td align="left"><p>Fibre optics, infrared lenses, thin-film solar PV</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Helium</p></td><td align="left"><p>MRI, lab equipment, arc welding</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Indium</p></td><td align="left"><p>Flat panel displays, LED, solar PV</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Rare earths</p></td><td align="left"><p>Permanent magnets (generators, engines), fibre optics</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Silver</p></td><td align="left"><p>Electronics, crystalline silicon solar PV, mirrors, jewellery</p></td><td align="left"><p>No</p></td><td align="left"><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Sulphur</p></td><td align="left"><p>Fertilizers, petroleum refining, ore processing</p></td><td align="left"><p>No</p></td><td align="left"><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Vanadium</p></td><td align="left"><p>Super alloys, high-strength steel, flow batteries</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td><td align="left"><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Zinc</p></td><td align="left"><p>Coating steel (galvanizing)</p></td><td align="left"><p>No</p></td><td align="left"><p>No</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Germanium and indium are zinc by-products.

The inferiority of substitutes is one reason some elements are perceived as critical (Schrijvers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2020</xref>). An element is considered a substitute for another if it can be used in the other element’s place without modifying the technology. A more complex substitution method is using another technology (e.g. replacing permanent magnets with electromagnets) or set of technologies. Supply that is independent of fossil fuels can also provide a supply-side option for mitigating supply–demand imbalance. Some resources are used in applications where no substitute exists, e.g. helium for reaching very low temperatures and sulphur in fertilizers. These applications will require other responses than substitution, such as increased efficiency, stockholding programs to manage short-term disruptions, and, in the long-term, increased recycling rates.</p><p id="Par61">Several of the identified elements are used in electro-optic devices, e.g. fibre optics, LED, lasers, solar photovoltaics, and flat panel displays. For solar photovoltaics, these elements are used in thin-film panels. Readily available element-level substitutes are rare, as several elements with similar properties are by-products, and their respective hosts’ supplies will decline as fossil fuel supply declines. This is similar to the situation that previous research has identified for the PGE group, i.e. high element-for-element substitution within the group, but limited possibilities for substituting elements from outside the group (Nassar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>). However, graphene and carbon nanomaterials can theoretically be used as substitutes in many electro-optic devices (Arvidsson and Sandén <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>). At the technological level, crystalline silicon solar photovoltaics are a readily available substitute for thin-film photovoltaics, but these use silver, for which supply is also at risk. Silver could in principle be substituted but at the cost of lower performance. New generations of solar PVs can be designed without the use of the identified at-risk elements (e.g. perovskites and dye-sensitized solar cells (Månberger and Stenqvist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2018</xref>)), but these are not yet commercialized and their outlook and market entrance remains uncertain.</p><p id="Par62">Vanadium is not used in renewable energy production per se but can be used in stationary storage (vanadium redox flow batteries, VRFBs), which enables the integration of variable renewable power sources. VRFBs have not only lower energy density but also lower cost and longer lifespan than lithium-ion batteries. They also provide flexibility in design, since energy storage and installed power are functions of tank size and membrane, respectively. Stantec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2018</xref>) forecasts vanadium demand for VFRB to reach 40–80kt/y in 2030 (i.e. about 50–100% of current primary supply) as a result of transitioning to variable renewable energy sources.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref> The main use for vanadium currently is in alloys, and other metals, such as manganese and molybdenum, can to some extent be used instead or in combination (USGS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2019</xref>). This possibility, along with the fact that the vast majority of primary vanadium is produced independently of fossil fuels, indicates that the vanadium market is less exposed and sensitive to reduced supply from fossil fuels than the elements with electro-optic properties discussed above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Dynamic Assessments of Criticality and Geopolitics</title><p id="Par64">Elements are not critical in themselves, and history has shown that what is perceived as critical differs between actors and changes over time (Vikström <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2016</xref>). All but three elements included in this study are categorized as critical by the USA (US_DoI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2018</xref>) and the EU (EU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>). Sulphur is not classified as critical but this perception may change somewhat if fossil fuel use declines, since one of its major use is for macronutrient in fertilizers for which no substitute exists. Other supply sources exists but their geographical origin can differ from current fossil sources. New international trade flows and dependencies could thus develop.</p><p id="Par65">Import dependence is one factor contributing to perceptions of criticality. The high geographical concentration of mineral reserves, refineries, and manufactures in few countries is by some seen as a cause of concern for import dependent countries, see e.g. (Smith Stegen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2015</xref>). The geographical distribution of fossil resources differs from the distribution of renewable energy resources and from the minerals used to build renewable energy infrastructure (Månberger and Johansson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2019</xref>; Overland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2019</xref>). As a result, the transition to sustainable energy does not only affect the environment; it also has far-reaching implications for geopolitics and governance (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par66">It is unclear how the geographical distribution of by-product supply might be affected by the reduced use of fossil fuels. In some cases, it is possible for mining operations to respond to relative price changes by targeting ores within the deposit that contain a higher share of a co- or by-product and a lower share of the host (Farrow and Krautkraemer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1989</xref>). This supply response does not fundamentally alter the source of the supply. However, in other cases, entire ore deposits may become economical or uneconomical to mine, which would alter where supply comes from. Antimony, currently partly recovered from lead, provides a case in point. China holds about one third of global antimony reserves (USGS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2019</xref>). A majority of it is pure stibnite (Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>), and some deposits have sufficiently high average antimony content to enable primary antimony mining (Jiada <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1993</xref>). These sources could to some extent compensate for a reduction in supply recovered from lead, but China’s dominant position as supplier could increase further, as only a few high-grade ore deposits of sufficient size to enable mining have been identified in other countries (Seal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2017</xref>). Future research could study whether and how the geographical distribution of supply for other by-products could be affected, using the geographical distribution of reserves with high by-product ore grades. Methodological inspiration can be found in the literature on the geographic distribution of “unburnable” fossil fuels (McGlade and Ekins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>). Such studies would be of relevance to the geopolitics of energy transitions, insofar as transition would create relative winners and losers depending on distribution of resource endowments and alter current dependencies (Vakulchuk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2020</xref>). That literature has, so far, focused on direct changes in resource demand (e.g. fossil fuels and hydropower) and overlooked indirect effects originating from changed use of non-fuel minerals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par67">Previous research has shown that low-carbon energy transitions can increase scarcity of critical elements used in technologies to convert or store energy because of demand increase. This study shows that low-carbon energy transitions can also increase scarcity for elements that are (i) produced jointly with a resource that is mainly used within the fossil fuel supply chain, and (ii) recovered from fossil fuels when they are extracted, refined, or combusted.</p><p id="Par68">Different options exist to mitigate the contracting supply potential of critical elements, including substituting with other elements; increasing the recovery rate to capture a larger share of the supply potential; and production from sources independent of fossil fuels. In general, recycling rates are low for the identified elements and the existing stock in society embedded in products that have reached their end of life is an additional supply source. These options’ potential to mitigate increased resource scarcity differs for different elements, and future studies would be required to assess these in more detail.</p><p id="Par69">This study identifies a group of four elements (indium, germanium, gallium, and to a lesser extent antimony) that are used for their electro-optical properties and that are problematic to substitute because each of these elements’ main substitutes is found within the group. Previous studies have forecast that a low-carbon energy transition will increase demand for several of these elements because they are used in some solar PVs. Resource scarcity could, thus, increase because demand would increase at the same time as supply potential decreased. The problem is greatest for by-products that express dissipative losses in their lifecycles.</p><p id="Par70">The main finding of this study points to a crucial policy trade-off that has so far been overlooked: it can be more difficult to meet low-carbon energy systems’ demands for critical raw materials if fossil fuel use declines. This finding has theoretical implications as it illustrates the need to study supply chains of jointly produced resources as systems, rather than focusing only on individual resources. Further studies are warranted to explore other developments that may also reduce primary host supply potential such as circular economy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This publication is a deliverable of MISTRA GEOPOLITICS, which is funded by the MISTRA – The Swedish Foundation for Strategic Environmental Research.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Open access funding provided by Lund University.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par71">The author declares no competing interests.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Anderson CD (2019) Antimony production and commodites.
