Compared to non-engineered algae and cyanobacteria, the photon conversion efficiency can be significantly increased. Furthermore, simplified harvesting processes are feasible since the novel microorganisms are excreting the biofuels or their precursors continuously and directly into the cultivation media. Along with higher productivity and direct product harvesting, it is expected that environmental benefits can be achieved, especially for climate protection. A life cycle assessment (LCA) for biobutanol production with the genetically engineered cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC6803 is performed to test this hypothesis. A prospective and upscaled approach was applied to assess the environmental impacts at large-scale production (20 ha plant) for better comparability with conventional butanol production. The LCA results show that the engineering of microorganisms can improve the environmental impact, mainly due to the higher productivity compared to non-engineered cyanobacteria. However, the nevertheless high electricity demand required for the cultivation and harvesting process overcompensates this benefit. According to the scenario calculations, a more favourable climate gas balance can be achieved if renewable electricity is used. Then, greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to 3.1 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq/kg biobutanol, corresponding to 20% more than the fossil reference: (2.45 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq./kg 1-butanol). The results indicate the importance of genetic engineering and the energy transition towards renewable electricity supply to take full advantage of the environmental potential of microorganisms as future green cell factories for sustainable biofuel production. Besides, the necessity of developing different scenarios for perspective and upscaled LCA for a fairer comparison with mature reference technologies is demonstrated.</p></abstract><kwd-group

to replace fossil energy consumption with renewable energy to combat climate change. The focus is on the transportation sector, as the savings potential realised here is insufficient to achieve the ambitious political goals for climate-neutral transportation by 2050. By the year 2020, 10% of the energy used in the transport sector of every EU country should come from renewable energy sources such as biofuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. As biofuels create less greenhouse gas emissions than fossil fuels, this will help the EU meet its long-term target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 85–90% (compared to 1990) by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Technological innovations such as fuel production with genetically engineered microalgae and cyanobacteria had to be evaluated at the earliest possible stage of development, especially concerning their climate and environmental compatibility to inform, advise and guide decision-makers in research, politics and industry. While first risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and acceptance studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], as well as a techno-economic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] have already addressed this issue, the probable environmental implications of this technology have so far not been analysed or quantified in LCA studies in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which underlines the novelty of the present work.</p><p id="Par3">Biofuels from microalgae are innovative and comply with the EU sustainability criteria for biofuels and bioliquids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. They are cultivated in closed technical systems on industrial or marginal land and can be grown with seawater and nutrients from organic waste streams, such as from biogas plants. Microalgae and cyanobacteria have been investigated according to their feedstock potential for producing sustainable biofuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, studies show that algae biofuel production is not yet environmental and economically feasible, and further R&amp;D efforts are needed to increase productivity and efficiency and reduce production costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Microalgae can be used to produce different fuels: biodiesel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], biomethane and biobutanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] or hydrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For large-scale energy production, open ponds are considered to be the most appropriate approach. However, this technology is not innovative and can offset some of the environmental advantages of microalgae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. That is why there are combined and interdisciplinary approaches towards innovative processes for producing third-generation algal biofuels.</p><p id="Par5">One of these approaches is the genetic engineering of microalgae and cyanobacteria to speed up strain selection and optimisation and increase productivity significantly. Beyond that, biologists and process engineers aim to produce algal fuel precursors or fuels that can pass the cell wall (such as biobutanol). Then, the fuel is excreted into the culture media from which it can be harvested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In that way, the microalgae or cyanobacteria do not need to be destroyed for harvesting the biofuel precursors but can continue growing. This way, the biofuel production remains under steady conditions, and fewer resources are required for recultivating the microorganisms. This so-called “milking”-process facilitates and reduces the energy demand for the ongoing recultivation of the microalgae and the harvesting step, the dewatering as well as fractionation of the algae biomass.</p><p id="Par6">This paper assesses the environmental impacts of 1-butanol (referred to here as biobutanol) by the genetically engineered cyanobacteria <italic>Synechocystis PCC6803</italic>. Biobutanol has many advantages over other alternatives, including its low vapour pressure, high energy density and ability to replace gasoline directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The higher energy density of butanol than ethanol allows for better fuel efficiency in vehicles, giving the consumer better gas mileage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Besides, the physical properties of butanol allow for direct use (fuel blend with gasoline in higher proportion than ethanol) in conventional engines without significant engine modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC6803 was selected since it has the highest productivity among different microalgae and cyanobacteria tested at lab and pilot scale. The release of the fuel precursor into the culture medium could reduce the energy demand related to harvesting and biomass fractionation. Consequently, promising outcomes are expected concerning the energy balance compared to conventional microalgae fuel production, which often comes with low energy return on investment (EROI). A review by Ketzer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] provided insights into 16 different studies with similar frame conditions. Even though a high variability could be observed, evidence for negative net energy balance for microalgae biomass fuel production was found.</p><p id="Par8">Carmona-Garcia et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] have highlighted the considerable advantages of biobutanol production using microorganisms against the catalytic route. Considering conventional acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation, several critical aspects, e.g. recovery and purification methods, influencing the energy return on investment (EROI) similar to in the presented biobutanol production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Nevertheless, Garcia et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] highlight the potential of improving the overall efficiency of the fermentation by adequate pretreatment of the raw material, altering the fermentation process itself, product recovery and purification processes. They recommended efforts on genetic engineering, materials science and process and bioprocess engineering to overcome the efficiency obstacle in biobutanol production.</p><p id="Par9">The life cycle assessment (LCA) approach is a powerful tool to investigate a product according to its environmental impacts along the entire life span. By applying LCA, this paper gives insights into the opportunities and challenges of biobutanol production and shows the ecological bottlenecks and hotspots of the production process. For a fair comparison with fossil-based 1-butanol production, an upscaling procedure to model and assess algal fuel production with genetically engineered (GE) cyanobacteria at a large scale was developed and applied. Since political framing and future developments can significantly impact the environmental performance of algal technologies, the LCA was conducted against the background of different scenarios.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Goal and Scope</title><p id="Par10">The LCA methodology was chosen not only considering its relevance as a scientific assessment but also the current significant impact of LCA in other issues, such as policy development, system, component design, authorisation and permissions, and consensus-building [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Hence, the goal of this LCA is to provide a consistent understanding of the biobutanol production process related to environmental issues. This LCA model was developed together with biologists, technical and process engineers. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the system boundaries and the considered process flow. One of the main characteristics of this novel technology is the possibility to produce fuel precursors that are being excreted into the culture media from which they are harvested afterwards without destroying the cell wall (so-called “milking process”).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>LCA system boundaries and process flow of biobutanol production with the cyanobacteria Synechocystis PCC6803 (PBR, photobioreactor; HTL, hydrothermal liquefaction; Perv., pervaporation; DM, dry matter; N, nitrogen; P, phosphorus)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12155_2021_10323_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par11">Emerging technologies have considerable potential for improvements, e.g. by applying economies of scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], as already successfully shown for other biofuel technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The first step of biobutanol production is continuous cultivation of <italic>Synechocystis PCC6803</italic> and its upscaling by considering three consecutive photobioreactors (PBR): pre-inoculation (PBR 1), inoculation (PBR 2) and production (PBR 3). After harvesting, the product is filtered and separated into two phases: a biobutanol-rich medium (ca. 65 vol.%) and the biomass slurry (ca. 35 vol. %). The biobutanol-rich medium is recovered by a pervaporation and distillation process. The biomass slurry (with 20% dry matter (DM) content) is valorised by hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), separation and centrifugation processes and converted into four product streams. All these processes were considered in the LCA.</p><p id="Par12">Microalgae biofuel technology is still at an early stage of development compared to other biofuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. According to the literature, a significant pending issue for algal biofuel LCA prevails on the input data and its characteristics, detail, and quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Consequently, for comprehensive data acquisition from lab- and pilot-scale installations, a systematic and elaborated questionnaire was developed to collect the required data and information on process design, technology and equipment to model and calculate the LCA from well-to-tank. Intense and close personal exchange, virtual meetings and email correspondence complemented the discussion on the constructed data framework and proposed assumptions to bridge the data gaps. By this, as much information and original data for the LCA inventory as possible were gathered, analysed and adapted. Based on this inventory completed by data from other projects, literature and the Ecoinvent database 3.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for a pilot-scale system (pre-study) was conducted. The production process was modelled with the open-source software OpenLCA 1.9.</p><p id="Par13">The ecoinvent database comprises raw material extraction as well as the assembly to pre-products, e.g. borosilicate tubes. According to Tillmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], practical aspects limit the LCA system’s extent and complexity. Among these aspects, the availability of data is crucial. For that reason, inputs, such as raw materials, for preparing the production site, machine abrasion and disposal, are defined to be outside this system’s boundaries (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Data acquisition for these steps would have been challenging and not the core of the LCA goal to assess the “butanol milking process” at low TRl level. In addition, transport, storage and end-of-life options are expected to play only a minor role within the overall impacts.</p><p id="Par14">The functional unit is defined as the production of 1 kg of “engine-ready” biobutanol, which can be used directly as fuel for a combustion engine. To evaluate a specific process, it must refer to conventional fossil-based production pathways. Here, the ecoinvent database process named “Butanol production from hydroformylation of propylene” was selected to compare the results to biobutanol produced by the cyanobacteria. For quantifying the life cycle impacts, the recommendations of the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) Handbook 2011 were followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This impact assessment method was developed by the European Commission and is implemented in the OpenLCA software. There are 16 midpoint categories, classified into three types and ranked according to their reliability. Thereof, six categories were selected, considered the most relevant ones for the process analysed (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Selected ILCD midpoint impact categories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="4"><p>ILCD midpoint application</p></th></tr><tr><th align="left"><p>Impact category</p></th><th align="left"><p>Default LCIA method</p></th><th align="left"><p>Indicator</p></th><th align="left"><p>Classification</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Climate change</p></td><td align="left"><p>ILCD 2011: baseline model of 100 years of IPCC</p></td><td align="left"><p>Radiative forcing as Global Warming Potential (GWP 100)</p></td><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>I</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Particulate matter/respiratory inorganics</p></td><td align="left"><p>RiskPoll model (Rabl and Spadaro, 2004) and Greco et al. 2007</p></td><td align="left"><p>Intake fraction for fine particles (kg PM<sub>2.5</sub>-eq/kg)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Resource depletion, mineral, fossil, and renewable (depletion of renewable resources is included in the analysis, but none of the analysed methods is mature for the recommendation)</p></td><td align="left"><p>CML 2002</p><p>(Guinée et al. 2002)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Scarcity</p></td><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>II</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Eutrophication, aquatic</p></td><td align="left"><p>EUTREND model</p><p>(Struijts et al. 2009b) as implemented in ReCiPE</p></td><td align="left"><p>Fraction of nutrients reaching freshwater end compartment (P) or marine end compartment (N)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Land use</p></td><td align="left"><p>Model-based on Soil Organic Matter (SOM)</p><p>(Milà i Canals et al. 2007b)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Soil organic matter</p></td><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>III</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Resource depletion, water</p></td><td align="left"><p>Model for water consumption as in Swiss Ecoscarcity</p><p>(Frischknecht et al. 2008)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Water use related to the local scarcity of water</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par15">Midpoint categories classified as “I” deliver recommended and satisfactory results. Among these, well-known and commonly used categories like climate change and particulate matter formation were chosen. Freshwater eutrophication and mineral resource depletion were chosen from category “II” because of the expected impact of materials’ and fertilisers’ upstream production inputs used in a large-scale production system. Since this category is recommended but needs to be improved, the reliability of the results is not as high as those of the category “I”.

The most suitable and cost-effective microalgal harvesting method is a constant matter of research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recently, four of the most promising butanol separation technologies (distillation, pervaporation, gas stripping and ionic liquid extraction) were assessed, concluding that, at present, it is necessary to make a compromise between energy requirement and operating costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Based on these findings for the prospective upscaled LCA model, the pervaporation technique to separate the biobutanol from the cyanobacteria culture broth was selected. Following the cultivation process in the UHT-PBR, the product flow was separated using a polypropylene microfilter (Boatman, T., personal communication, January 7, 2019) into two phases: a biobutanol-rich medium (ca. 65 vol.%) and the biomass slurry (ca. 35 vol. %) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Consequently, the pervaporation system was implemented with a temperature of 60 °C, including energy savings of 42.9% related to energy integration (compared to a system without energy recovery) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

For this, electricity input savings in large-scale production of 15% were considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The energy demand for the pervaporation pump was scaled up linearly without any economies of scale due to a lack of information on flow rates.</p><p id="Par21">Based on the data from the pilot scale, the biobutanol concentration was determined to be 2.65 g/l.

However, the pervaporation model showed that a minimal biobutanol concentration of 10 g/l has to be achieved to reach a break-even point in energy input and output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Based on the productivity and concentration of biobutanol in the PBRs, a partial daily harvest has been calculated with a fixed volume of 30% of the total culture to maintain a stable biological system. The energy requirements for pervaporation were considered in the LCA model, assuming a yearly operation of 360 days and a daily full-time 24-h operation (Table S 5). Simultaneously to the harvesting process, a fresh medium with fertiliser was added to achieve constant cultivation conditions. Following the process simulations by Wagner et al.

A process scheme can be depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The pervaporation process is used to increase the biobutanol levels above the spontaneous butanol-water phase separation point. After this, it is possible to separate and recycle the aqueous phase back to the separation system and recover the biobutanol from the organic phase through distillation. Each pervaporation unit requires a heater, a condenser and a vacuum pump to reduce the outlet pressure.

Only the “occupation of industrial area” without any land transforming processes within the infrastructure inventory is considered, as it is referred to as an industrial-scale production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].<fig id="Fig4"><label> Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>LCA results for biobutanol production with <italic>Synechocystis PCC6803</italic> in UHT-PBR (scenario upscale).

Operational materials dominate the impact category of water depletion (52%). Here, freshwater inputs for cooling as well as for medium preparation are considered.

A reduction from 38.99 to 37.72 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq can be observed for climate change. The absolute share of nutrients decreased from 4.7 (upscale) to 1.7 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq. Since a credit along the production process for the bio-crude oil produced is applied, the definite value on CO<sub>2</sub> eq for the electricity consumption is reduced from 35.9 (upscale) to 35.8 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq. However, this saving is counterbalanced by the energy-intense HTL process itself. The main pattern of contributors to the impacts remains the same. With a reduced contribution of fertiliser, the impact in mineral resource depletion from resources for nutrient production decreases from 16.9 to 4.6% (related to nutrient production). Although more energy is needed absolutely, the savings concerning nutrients improve the overall results. Thus, the application of HTL proved to be beneficial in environmental terms.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>LCA results for biobutanol production with <italic>Synechocysti</italic>s <italic>PCC6803</italic> in UHT-PBR (scenario upscale + HTL).

In this scenario, the climate change impact decreased to an absolute value of 3.08 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq. Besides, the infrastructure implications became more evident in most impact categories and dominated the results while the pattern of contribution changed. For most impact categories, the results improved. Nevertheless, the value of water depletion increased significantly (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). The absolute values of depleted water increased from 0.11 to 0.23 m<sup>3</sup> per kg of biobutanol. However, the ILCD methodology of accounting for water used in hydropower turbines is considered misleading. The characterisation factor for “Water, turbine use, unspecified natural origin, NO” is 5.35 × 10<sup>−4</sup> m<sup>3</sup> water eq/m<sup>3</sup>, which drives the water depletion impact category in the foreground system to about 48%. The background system, which was not affected by the exchange of the electricity mix, remained the same in terms of absolute values. There is a comprehensive discussion in the literature about the methods’ reliability and appropriate dedication of water flows to impact categories, e.g. how the water used in turbines is considered. Bakken et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] suggest setting turbine water to zero in the assessment since there is no water consumption within the spatial boundaries.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>LCA results for biobutanol production with <italic>Synechocystis PCC6803</italic> in UHT-PBR (scenario upscale + HTL + NO).

The objective of this work was to test the hypothesis that engineered microorganisms can outperform natural strains and contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the transportation sector. In this context, LCA is applied as an established tool for environmental sustainability assessment. Combining LCA with an exergetic analysis provides a more holistic approach to sustainability features. The exergy concept was applied because exergy quantifies the ability to cause change and is not conserved, unlike energy, which exposes the inefficient processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. During the exergy analysis, the exergy consumption and the exergy efficiency of the different subprocesses (process level) and the entire foreground production system (gate-to-gate) were determined. Furthermore, a cradle-to-gate life cycle analysis (LCA) has been performed because of the increasing awareness of the possible impact of the whole chain of products, processes and services.</p><p id="Par39">The other objective was to demonstrate the importance of assessing the environmental impacts at an early stage of technology development since biologists and microorganism process engineers make the most significant design decisions at the lab and pilot scale. However, current life cycle–based LCA tools and databases are not adapted to these needs. Moreover, microalgae and cyanobacteria cultivation and the linked upstream and downstream technologies are still under development and are characterised by a low TRL level. Thus, only a few data from lab- and pilot-scale experiments are available for conducting an LCA. Therefore, LCA simplification strategies for prospective and upscaled assessments are needed. Dealing with the uncertainties of modelling upscaled production systems and deriving data for such large-scale systems is a great challenge and a crucial task, as assumptions made in this process will significantly impact the environmental impacts of algal biomass and biofuel production. This task must be carried out with special care and responsibility because recommendations for the political frame conditions and the bio-technical process design will be derived.</p><p id="Par40">The results of this work revealed the importance of LCA for the environmental assessment of new technologies at an early stage of development to know how to improve the technology from the biological and technical point of view. The first challenge was to build up a confidential and trusting working relationship with technology developers and pilot-scale plant operators to convince project partners to collect and share specific LCA relevant data. Technology developers, engineers and plant operators often underestimate and insufficiently consider the time and effort required to prepare and provide LCA input data in their work plans and budgets. They are not always aware of providing sophisticated, reflective, detailed and accurate data for the LCA (e.g. input substrates, chemicals and energy). Thus, as given, data is often not suitable (i.e. equipment in place was used as-is and not optimised at all) to be applied as such in the LCA. The given data are not always applicable to prepare proxies.</p><p id="Par41">The second challenge was reducing inaccuracy, increasing the reliability of data used in the LCA and closing the data gaps apparent after the experimental data collection. It proved to be very difficult to apply the LCA as a sustainability assessment tool. A combination of exergetic analysis and LCA might be a more holistic approach and benefit the sustainability features and long-term viability of biofuel and bioproducts production systems (biorefineries). Aghbashlo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] showed the exergy efficiency of a lignocellulosic biorefinery annexed to a sugar mill for simultaneous lactic acid and electricity production using sugarcane bagasse and brown leaves as feedstock by 44.7%. The exergy concept can show the bottlenecks in thermodynamic inefficiency, cost loss and environmental impact as exergy is not conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. By applying advanced sustainability assessment methods, an in-depth investigation of the possible effects of the complete product chain, processes and services, can be carried out. Recent publications on exergetic analyses, e.g. Fallahi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] showed the exergy efficiency of producing a biobased platform chemical, indicating the need to emphasise interactions among subsystems of processes and their potential improvements. However, Soltanian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] states that most published work (on lignocellulosic biofuel- biorefineries) focuses on quantifying thermodynamic imperfections and determining exergetic efficiencies of the simulation. Therefore, exergo-economic and exergo-environmental approaches can provide more significant benefit and should focus on future biofuel production investigations.</p><p id="Par42">LCA on technologies at relatively low TRL is complex and challenging due to lacking data and information. Although empirical data is preferably used, data from literature and inventory data (e.g. Gabi or Ecoinvent that is not always up-to-date) need to be applied to complete the LCA data. Thus, modelling took place with a mixture of different data types. For the prospective evaluation of the future technology potential of engineered microorganisms, an interdisciplinary team is needed to agree on the scenario design and the assumptions for the upscaling process. Therefore, we developed a shared understanding and vocabulary was developed to find solutions on how to do upscaling. It has to be noted that prospective LCA can only be made on the current state of the art and observed learning curves for technologies and processes. The limit of this work is that upscaling was performed mainly with a linear approach regarding process design, materials, and equipment, as a proxy for the modular process design of microorganism cultivation in photobioreactors. This limit could be overcome by applying nonlinear upscaling, applying engineering software such as SuperProDesigners or Aspen.</p><p id="Par43">The LCA scenario results show that the primary hotspot of biobutanol production with genetically engineered cyanobacteria is the electricity demand. The energy transition helps the process to become more environmentally friendly. As the system was based on theoretical estimations, no specific recommendations for process improvements can be given. Nevertheless, we consider biobutanol production with cyanobacteria <italic>Synechocystis PCC6803</italic> as innovative technology, which could be ecologically competitive to the fossil reference if the political conditions of a circular bioeconomy and a successful energy transition in Europe can be achieved. Therefore, it seems promising to continue and strengthen R&amp;D on engineered production processes to supply sustainable biofuels as an alternative for bioelectric transportation, particularly air transportation. Without a successful energy transition, it will be challenging to achieve sustainable biobutanol production with microalgae relying on the state of the art technologies.</p><p id="Par44">Moreover, there is an urgent need to significantly reduce the electricity demand for algae cultivation and product harvest. However, the modular structure of the biobutanol production process based on single photobioreactors limits the possibilities to achieve significant improvements in environmental impacts by economies of scale only. The LCA results indicate that integrating the HTL process to recycle the nutrients can reduce the environmental impacts. Still, large-scale implementation of the HTL process needs to be approved to ensure that no disturbances or disadvantages in the cultivation process occur due to nutrient recycling. Combining different production steps with relatively low TRL is a challenge for upscaling due to the lack of knowledge and data. Therefore, this work is an essential first step to give orientation knowledge on the environmental impacts of future biobutanol production with algae.</p><p id="Par45">The third challenge of the LCA work is the responsibility of dissemination and communication of the LCA results. For technology developers, it is essential to identify hotspots and leverage points to improve process design based on LCA insights at large-scale production and societally possible scenarios. Beyond that, LCA results have an impact on research and development targets and funds. Therefore, biologists and process engineers strongly motivate LCA experts to work with the best available data to produce “good” results required from society to develop further and implement engineered microorganisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The comparison with other studies addressing this technology, e.g. Nilsson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], is challenging because these are theoretical studies based only on literature assumptions to construct a hypothetical production scheme with different reactors and conditions. Nevertheless, it can be noted that one of the productivities used by Nilsson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] is in the same range of the biobutanol productivity presented in this work (600 mg/L/day), but significantly higher in comparison with previous literature.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions and Future Directions</title><p id="Par46">The responsibility of LCA experts is relatively high as they are considered environmental judges on new technologies by measuring and evaluating the perspectives of replacing an established technology or process with a new one. However, LCA researchers are experts in their field and do not always have the sufficient process engineering knowledge required for sophisticated upscaling and designing large-scale plants. Besides, there is no agreed procedure for upscaling approaches of new technologies at low TRL level, the increase of robustness of assumptions, or the application of learning curves. Moreover, no common understanding of dealing with the high level of uncertainty associated with upscaling in LCA exists, except to provide the utmost transparency of modelling and assumptions made. Thus, assessing the environmental sustainability of biobutanol production with genetically engineered microorganisms in photobioreactors at an early stage of technology development is challenging. This is all the more true as there is no data basis for this assessment.</p><p id="Par47">Therefore, this study is considered the first LCA of biobutanol production through genetically modified cyanobacteria with lab- and pilot-scale data. In this work, the highest productivity analysed in the lab was used for the LCA. Although critics could argue that this is a somewhat optimistic evaluation, it is justifiable to identify which conditions optimise the environmental impacts. The results show that biofuels produced with genetically engineered microorganisms are a promising option for future sustainable transportation, mainly where vehicles with renewable electricity or hydrogen are not feasible. In future studies, the relevant parameters, such as upscaled system configuration and management of input and output flows, need to be addressed carefully and further investigated by applying engineering software such as SuperProDesigners or Aspen. In addition, climatic conditions and previous land use of production sites and circular and biogenic sources of CO<sub>2</sub>, fertiliser and water (e.g. biogas plants) must also be considered since this could further improve the environmental sustainability of biobutanol production.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the PHOTOFUEL project partners for providing original data from the lab and pilot scale and discussing upscaled data to assess the environmental impact of biobutanol production with engineered cyanobacteria.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.
