However, several new energy-management change drivers have emerged to uproot this status quo. These drivers include a rising demand for electricity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], the emergence of renewable energy resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], the emergence of electrified transportation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], deregulation of power markets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and innovations in smart grid technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Responding to these drivers requires new and integrated technical solutions for energy management.</p><p id="Par3">The internet of things (IoT) for energy applications, herein called the “energy internet of things” (eIoT), has been proposed as one such energy-management solution, illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1.1</xref>. eIoT is a leading and overarching perspective where all devices that consume electricity are internet-enabled and consequently can coordinate their energy consumption with the rest of the grid in real time or near real time. eIoT technologies must, therefore, be adopted within the context of these emerging energy-management change drivers.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1.1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A closed-loop framework for electrical power system management</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/473131_1_En_1_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec1"><title>Energy-Management Change Drivers</title><p id="Par4">Several change drivers are causing a fundamental shift in energy-management practices in the electric power grid.

The International Energy Agency’s (IEA) 2016 World Energy Outlook Report projects the growth of Total Primary Energy Demand from 1161 million tons of oil equivalent (Mtoe) in 2014 to between 1705–2017 Mtoe in 2025 and 2528–4049 Mtoe in 2040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. During that time, global electricity consumption is projected to increase by around 2% per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Demand for electricity in industrializing economies outpaces renewable electricity generation so that displacement does not occur, but energy generation from all available sources continues to grow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Meanwhile, in developed countries, electricity demand will continue to grow. Although in recent years electricity demand has been nearly flat in many developed countries, electric load growth is expected to return in order to support fuel-switching and other decarbonization trends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">1.2</xref> shows that most of the energy growth will occur in developing countries that are outside the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Furthermore, during that time, renewable generation growth will increase more quickly than demand and is expected to replace fossil-fuel generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. As a result, any advancement made to accommodate renewable energy in countries with existing infrastructure will have a profound impact on the world’s decarbonization efforts.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 1.2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>World energy growth between 2015 and 2040 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/473131_1_En_1_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The Emergence of Renewable Energy Resources</title><p id="Par12">The growth and widespread adoption of renewable energy resources is expected to significantly alter the generation mix. This widespread adoption is encouraged by advanced research, state-of-the-art technologies, and favorable legislation that continue to improve renewable energy resources. These factors have advanced wind and solar technologies, and have pushed them to become more efficient and cost-effective as compared to thermal generation. Research in new wind turbine designs has resulted in improved turbine efficiency and wind power output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. With these improvements, the cost of wind generation is set to decrease significantly. In fact, the IEA projects that the average costs for wind generation will decline by 15% for onshore wind and by one third for offshore wind between 2017 and 2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Further research in solar cell technologies has also led to much higher conversion efficiencies for solar cells. For example, the efficiencies of commercial mono- and poly-crystalline solar modules increased from 12–14% in 2006 to 16–18% in 2016, while that of high-efficiency N-type modules reached an efficiency of over 21<italic>%</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In addition, generation costs for utility photovoltaic (PV) solar are expected to fall by one-quarter over the period 2017–2022 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Similarly, the growing amount of new legislation and regulations favoring generation and supply of clean energy has forced the evolution of the electricity supply infrastructure and operations to support renewable energy sources. Favorable policies have not only helped lower the cost of investment in these technologies but they have also created competitive market environments for solar and wind projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Two developed countries and the European Union (EU), in particular, display how renewable energy policy is setting a precedent for countries where the energy infrastructure has yet to reach maturation. Favorable legislation in China and the United States (USA) has played a key role in promoting the widespread adoption of renewable energy resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. These legislations and a commitment towards decarbonization have encouraged investments in renewable energy resources for both small-scale consumers and large-scale energy developers.</p><p id="Par15">Legislation initiatives in China have made a strong impact on the growth of the country’s renewable energy capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. China is projected to add up to 1300 gigawatts (GW) of generation by 2040, which more than doubles its combined growth of fossil fuel and nuclear power capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In part to cut back air pollution, China has set 5-year plans to reach 2020 renewable energy targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. As of 2017, China had surpassed its solar PV target and is estimated to meet its wind target by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. These targets have helped China achieve over 40% of global renewable capacity growth by 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. By the end of 2015, China’s cumulative installed wind capacity was 180.4 GW with 30.5 GW alone being installed in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Despite these installations, China still faces many challenges towards the growth of renewable energy resources such as the uneven distribution of capacity and unmatched economic growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. China remains the world’s largest solar cell producer and consumer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>], a position it has held since 2009. As of December of 2015, China’s installed PV capacity was 43.18 GW accounting for 14.9% of the global solar PV capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Solar PV installations are expected to continue growing with one study predicting the total installed capacity of 200 GW by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Developments in wind and solar in China are supported by either a national feed-in tariff (FIT) program or direct subsidies that are meant to encourage the deployment of these resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Overall, China’s central government has guided participation by developers and financial stakeholders to foster large-scale investment in renewable energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Soon, due to an increase in energy subsidies and integration costs, China is expected to adjust its policies to a quota system with green certificates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Going forward, however, it is still unclear how this shift in legislation will affect the country’s overall renewable energy growth and decarbonization efforts. That said, there are still many challenges facing the growth of renewable energy resources, such as uneven distribution of capacity and unmatched economic growth. For example, inner Mongolia has 28% of the over installed wind capacity despite having a low demand of just 6.78% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. While areas like Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong province that have a higher population density and contribute 20.5% of the consumer load only have 4.7% of the installed capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. These disparities in capacity distribution present operational challenges that may influence future renewable legislation in China.</p><p id="Par17">The USA experienced fast growth in wind and solar technologies primarily due to: (1) renewable energy portfolio standards (RPS), (2) state-level policies supporting distributed solar PV and electric vehicles (EVs), and (3) federal tax credits for wind and solar industries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. As of 2015, the tax credit for wind producers was 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, and solar power developers still receive tax credits for 30% of the value of their investment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Both tax credits are set to expire in 2020, but a 2016 tax bill proposition began phasing out wind credits starting in 2017 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] and completely terminated solar credits. As per the new tax bill, on the production tax credit (PTC) is gradually phased down for wind and is expired for other technologies such as solar, biomass, and geothermal, for projects beginning construction after December 2016. The PTC will be subject to a 20% step-down in 2017, 40% in 2018, and 60% in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. A similar phase-out schedule applies to the wind energy investment tax credit (ITC), where the allowable tax credit is 30% of expenditures in 2016, 24% in 2017, 18% in 2018, and 12% in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Although the future of federal tax credits is uncertain, the USA is the second-largest growth market for renewable energy generation sources after China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Most of these changes are happening at the state level with states such as California and New York taking a lead on decarbonization efforts. For several states, the goal is to reach 40% decarbonization (50% for California) by 2030 and 80% by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Decarbonization efforts have focused largely on increasing the renewable energy capacity and energy efficiency improvements, but, lately, these efforts are shifting to include electrified transportation and electric indoor heating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Recently, new regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has allowed the participation of distributed energy resources in electricity wholesale markets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. This regulation will not only improve the deployment of DERs but will also enable the creation of market structures that are more inclusive for DERs.</p><p id="Par19">In the EU, there is a strong interest in wind energy. However, investment has lagged behind due to the lack of support for investments by non-member states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Progress in the deployment of wind technologies is contingent upon the creation of a favorable policy framework that helps bridge this gap in investment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. In 2009, the 2009/28/EC Directive to promote the use of renewable energy was adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. The directive promoted the development of renewable energy sources as one of the main objectives of the EU energy policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. It also set mandatory national targets that would ensure at least a 20% renewable energy share in total energy consumption by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. By June 2010, each member state was required to have a national plan that defined the technology mix scenario, the trajectory to be followed, and the measures and reforms necessary to overcome barriers and to enable the development of renewable energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Wind energy was a main component in these national energy plans with an estimated 209.6 GW of wind capacity to be installed by 2020 within the EU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. This accounted for 43.1% of the expected renewable energy technologies installed by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Nevertheless, the EU remains on track to meet their goal of reaching 20% renewable generation by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">A recent report by the renewable energy agency shows that the EU has been able to cut its associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by fossil-fuel generation by about one-tenth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The share of the renewable energy in the total energy consumed in the EU was reported to be 17% in 2016 from the 16.7% reported in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. These numbers show that the EU is likely to still meet its 2020 decarbonization target. However, the stability of the policy framework still remains a potential barrier to meeting this goal for wind energy investors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. In future frameworks, policies must address cooperation among nations within and outside of the EU membership [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Furthermore, cooperation between countries in renewable energy development projects is imperative for the EU in terms of technical exchanges, economic ties, and political relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The Emergence of Electrified Transportation</title><p id="Par21">Third, the new load from electric vehicles requires fundamental upgrades to the electricity infrastructure. New advancements in EV batteries and fast charging technology have led to reduced costs of electric vehicles.

In grid operations, balancing and frequency control are affected by renewable energy generation (for example, wind and solar PV). Due to the variability of renewable energy generation, grid operators must now dispatch to a real-time load profile that is significantly different from the daily load profile. Consequently, the grid operators may have to adjust their balancing operations to accommodate this new requirement on the system. For example, high penetration rates of solar PV bring about what is often called a “duck curve” (shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1.6</xref>), which exhibits a very sharp ramp during the early evening hours when solar PV generation is fading away [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 1.6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The California ISO duck curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/473131_1_En_1_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par33">During this time, dispatchable generation must respond quickly to the evening load peak in the absence of solar PV generation.
