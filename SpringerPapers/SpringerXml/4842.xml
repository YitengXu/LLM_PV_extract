However, massive defects are prone to be reproduced during the quantum dot (QD) film assembly, which would sorely affect carrier injection, transportation and recombination, and finally degrade QLED performances. Here, we propose a bilateral passivation strategy through passivating both top and bottom interfaces of QD film with organic molecules, which has drastically enhanced the efficiency and stability of perovskite QLEDs. Various molecules were applied, and comparison experiments were conducted to verify the necessity of passivation on both interfaces. Eventually, the passivated device achieves a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 18.7% and current efficiency of 75 cd A<sup>−1</sup>. Moreover, the operational lifetime of QLEDs is enhanced by 20-fold, reaching 15.8 h.

Up to now, major breakthroughs have been made in perovskite-based light light-emitting diodes (LEDs), of which film-based LEDs have achieved 20.3% and 21.6% of EQE at green and infrared region, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. As another vital part of perovskite LEDs, QD-based LED (QLED) has obtained extensive attention for their more flexible solution processing characteristics and better mass production potential. Since the first device reported in 2015<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, perovskite QLEDs have also made great breakthroughs during the past years. For example, the red perovskite QLEDs exhibited an EQE of 21.3% through an anion-exchange<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, which has surpassed the film-based LED in red region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Howbeit, the maximum EQE of blue and green QLEDs is 2.8%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and 16.48%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, respectively, which is lower than that of film-based perovskite LEDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Consequently, it is highly desired to explore a feasible and effective strategy to preparing the highly efficient perovskite QLEDs.</p><p id="Par4">In general, highly efficient exciton recombination in QD films are significantly critical for high-performance QLEDs. Highly luminescent perovskite QD films are determined by the quality of QD materials and film constructions. As the central role, a lot of work has been devoted to optimize the quality of colloidal QDs, including component regulation, surface engineering and other process optimization, which are effective to enhance the radiative recombination of perovskite QD films. For example, the PL properties of CsPbX<sub>3</sub> QDs can be improved by alloying A-site cation of FA and MA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, or doping the B-site metal cation of Sn<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Ce<sup>3+</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In addition, massive hanging bonds or defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> on QDs would reduce exciton recombination efficiency. In this regard, some surface passivation routes were applied, such as introducing the organic ligand of didodecyl dimethyl ammonium bromide (DDAB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, or passivating the QDs with inorganic ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The above-mentioned methods all focus on the improvement of colloidal QDs, ignoring the damage that the film-forming process may bring to QDs to a certain extent. Therefore, it is also crucial to improve device performance from the perspective of QD films.</p><p id="Par5">As is known that a large part of fluorescence is lost when the colloidal QDs transform into the QD solids, this is because massive defects would be introduced inevitably during the film-forming process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. These defects are prone to regenerate during the device construction process on account of the highly sensitive surface and complex interface environment, and hence lead to the formation of non-radiative recombination centers. In addition, these defects located on the interface between QD layer and carrier-transporting layers would sorely affect the injection and transportation of carriers, and degrade the device efficiencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. To solve the problem, a lot of film-treatment methods have been applied to passivate the QD film, such as proper oxygen treatment, solvent treatment, or coating organic molecules on the interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Interface molecular passivation has been widely used in perovskite-based device, which could not only improve the effective radiation recombination, but also enhance the stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. However, most of work only focused on the top surface of the perovskite film, few reports noticed the importance of double-sided passivation. However, it is well known that the perovskite layer is at the center of the sandwich structure in practical optoelectronic devices, both the top and bottom surface of the QD film may face the interface problems that defects and other deposited materials can affect the carrier behavior inside the film. Thus, the interface treatment on both sides of perovskite QD film may provide a good way for the depressed device efficiency and stability.</p><p id="Par6">In this work, we present a bilateral passivation strategy to reduce the interfacial defects of perovskite QD film, through evaporating a layer of organic molecules between QD films and carrier transport layer (CTL). The phosphine oxide molecule, diphenylphosphine oxide-4-(triphenylsilyl)phenyl (TSPO1), was used as the typical passivation molecule. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used to reveal the decreased defect traps and non-radiative recombination. The decreased defects were further verified by transient TA spectra analysis and space charge-limited-current (SCLC) method, and the improved exciton recombination efficiency is reflected in the increased PLQY of QD film (increase from 43 to 79%) and increased electro-optic conversion efficiency (the current efficiency of QLEDs increase from 20 to 75 cd A<sup>−1</sup>, and the maximum EQE from 7.7 to 18.7%). In addition, the comparison experiments of unilateral and bilateral passivation were conducted to demonstrate the necessity of passivating both interfaces. Besides TSPO1, a series of other organic molecules used in this system also achieved impressive results, which showed the universality of this bilateral passivation method. Moreover, profiting from the strong interaction with perovskite and blocking between perovskite and CTL, bilateral-passivated molecules endow the films and LEDs with enhanced stability. For example, a 20-fold enhancement in the T<sub>50</sub> operational lifetime (from 0.8 h to 15.8 h) was observed. Our study demonstrates that defects on the interface between the QD films and charge transporting layers are detrimental for devices, which can be hopefully suppressed by bilateral passivation. The findings highlight the importance of passivation on both interfaces of QD films for constructing high-performance perovsktie QLEDs as well as other QD-based optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, and phodetectors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Bilateral passivation strategy and theoretical model</title><p id="Par7">The high density of dangling bonds and uncoordinated atoms (e.g. Pb and/or halide vacancy) caused by solvent evaporation and lost surface ligands is responsible for the traps and non-radiative recombination, which degrade the PL emission and device performances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In this regard, we propose a bilateral passivation strategy through evaporating organic ligands on both top- and bottom-side of perovskite QD film, the theoretical model passivated with TSPO1 as typical ligand was shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>. The interaction between uncoordinated Pb and P = O from TSPO1 was deemed to be the key factor that passivate the defects of QD films, which would be further discussed later. In the device, those defects mentioned above would capture electrons and holes, thus resulting in low device efficiency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Meanwhile, these defects could provide ion migration channel that might accelerate the degeneration of device, causing the poor stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Based on the bilateral-passivated QD film, we further designed the optimized device with TSPO1 on both top- and bottom-side of QD films which was expected to passivate the defects, decrease non-radiative recombination, and thus improve the device performances (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>The bilateral passivation strategy for efficient and stable QLEDs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Diagram of the interaction between TSPO1 and perovskites.

The forming energy between Pb and O from TSPO1 was −1.1 eV calculated by density functional theory (DFT), which showed that the interaction between surface Pb and O = P could be easily formed. Furthermore, the calculated density of states (DOS) was also applied to assess the passivation action of TSPO1. We performed DFT calculations assuming a PbBr<sub>2</sub>-rich CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> surface, in which non-coordinating Pb atom located outside surface. The DOS curves of the TSPO1-passivated and pristine structures are reversed to provide an intuitive comparison plotted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>. The DOS of the unpassivated surface showed significant trap states on the band edge, which is due to the non-coordinating Pb atom. While, the trap states in QD films after passivating by TSPO1 was greatly weaken, which indicated the TSPO1 could effectively passivate defects, eliminate the trap states, and prevent the trapping of carriers.</p><p id="Par9">In addition to passivating defects, the P = O has strong interaction with surface Pb atom, which could prevent the loss of ligands from electric field. The weak adhesion of surface ligands on perovskite QD is responsible for defect regeneration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. We compared the bond order between surface Pb atom and several functional group of common organic ligands (TSPO1, sulfydryl, carboxyl and amidogen ligands), as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>. It could be seen that carboxyl and amidogen ligands (such as oleic acid and oleylamine) cannot bond with Pb atom, which is responsible for the poor stability and attenuating luminescence. However, phosphorus oxygen groups exhibited stronger interaction with Pb (bond order is 0.2) compared to other groups, which could suppress the regeneration of defects. The regenerative defects might act as the ion migration channel that was detrimental to stability. Meanwhile, the tough passivation layer could also block the ion migration and damage to perovskite from the transport materials at the interface, leading to better device stability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Characterization of perovskite QD films</title><p id="Par10">We investigated perovskite films based on CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QDs synthesized by the typical hot-injection method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The as-synthesized QDs had a cubic and uniform morphology with the size of 8 nm and the QD ink exhibit excellent PL properties with a PLQY of 85 ± 3% and a FWHM of 20 nm (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Nevertheless, the light emission of the film exhibited a sharp decline due to the formation of non-radiative recombination centers during the film-forming process. The QD films are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, and the schematic diagrams present the passivating location of the TSPO1 molecules. The photogragh of QD film under UV lamp exhibits that the naked CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> QD film shows a dim glow compared to colloidal QDs. While, the emission is significantly enhanced after passivating TSPO1 at the interface of QD film, the up-side passivation shows better improvement than bottom passivation because the exposed upper surface faces severer challenge. Eventually, the bilateral-passivated film exhibits the brightest glow. It means that the passivation on both up- and bottom-side of QD film is necessary, traps are effectively passivated by TSPO1. The interaction between TSPO1 and perovskite was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), in which the characteristic peak at 1188 cm<sup>−1</sup> was observed for TSPO1, corresponding to the stretching vibrations of P = O bond. It can be found that the P = O peak drifts to about 1184 cm<sup>−1</sup> in the QD films, which indicates that the bonding between TSPO1 and perovskite QD can be formed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed that Pb 4 f peak shifts towards higher binding energy (BE) of about 0.2 eV for TSPO1-passivated QD films in reference to unpassivated one (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). It also unveiled the chemical bonding between P = O group and Pb atom, which is due to the coordination between electronegative O<sup>−</sup> and uncoordinated Pb<sup>2+</sup>, leading to higher binding energy for Pb 4 f.

The absolute PLQY of QD films under different passivation strategy were tested to further evidence the increased exciton recombination efficiency, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>. It could be seen that PLQY of naked QD film exhibited a sharp decline to 43 ± 4% versus colloidal QDs. The low PLQY could be greatly improved with increasing TSPO1 passivation thickness. However, the optimization effect was saturated when the TSPO1 thickness reached a certain value because the defects were passivated adequately at this level. Compared to passivation on bottom, top-side passivaion exhibited better optimization due to the exposed upper surface. While, unilateral passivation only was not as effective as the bilateral passivation. The maximum PLQY of QD film could be increased to 79 ± 3% under bilateral passivation, which indicated more efficient electron−hole recombination in the passivated QD films. From above results, although single-side interface passivation can also improve the performance of QD film, treatment on both sides is more effective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Reduced non-radiative recombination in bilateral-passivated perovskite QD film</title><p id="Par12">Ultrafast exciton dynamics analysis was carried out to make a further insight into the promotion effect of TSPO1 passivation for PL properties.

From the entire bleaching color mapping, no extra bleaching signal appears after passivated by TSPO1, indicating no associated energy transfer process occur between TSPO1 and QDs. In order to parse these blending spectral profiles, the characteristic decay-associated spectra (DAS) of QD film was obtained through a global fitting analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>).

The comparison of decay time τ<sub>3</sub> indicated that the TSPO1-passivated QD films exhibited a slower kinetic recombination delay (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), which reflected a lower density of surface defect trap states in the films.

The conspicuous improvement in the PL decay lifetime absolutely indicated surface defect passivated by TSPO1.

Relatively, the quickly reaching the steady state indicate that the density of defects in passivated QD films is greatly depressed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par22">In summary, the bilateral passivation strategy demonstrated in this work results in effectively controlling the surface states of QD films. We introduced a layer of organic molecules (e.g. P = O, S = O and C = O) on both top- and bottom-side interface of QD films to reduce the defect density and suppressed the non-radiative recombination. The decreased defects of the QD films are clarified by transient photocurrent measurements, SCLC and DLCP method. The passivated QD films exhibit high exciton recombination features with a PLQY of 79%, and the corresponding LEDs have a high electro-optic conversion efficiency with the EQE of 18.7%. Interestingly, the passivation approach makes the QD materials and LEDs exhibit a higher stability. For example, a T<sub>50</sub> operational lifetime of 15.8 h for QLEDs based on QD films passivated by TSPO1 is a factor of 20 longer than the control devices. The proposed bilateral passivation strategy can be widely applied to other types of perovskite materials, and other optoelectronic devices including solar cells, and photodetectors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="Par23">PbBr<sub>2</sub> (99.99%), Cs<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (99.9%), oleic acid (OA, AR), oleylamine (OAm, AR) were purchased from Macklin Inc.

The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) formulated by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) was used as the exchange-correlation functional to optimize the structure and simulate density of states (DOS). The electronic wave functions were expended in plane-wave basis sets with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV. The Monkhorst–Pack k-point meshes with a grid spacing of 2π × 0.04 Å<sup>−1</sup> or less were used for electronic Brillouin zone integration. The equilibrium structural parameters (including both lattice parameters and internal coordinates) of each involved material were obtained via total energy minimization by using the conjugate-gradient (CG) algorithm, with the force convergence threshold of 0.01 eV Å<sup>−1</sup>. To properly take into account the long-range van der Waals interaction that plays a non-ignorable role in the perovskites involving organic molecules, the DFT-D3 method was adopted. Hybrid functional HSE06 was used to correct DOS results because GGA-PBE usually underestimates conduction bands.</p><p id="Par29">The binding energy <italic>E</italic><sub>b</sub> is defined as<disp-formula id="Equ2"><label>2</label><alternatives><mml:math id="Equ2_Math"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">perovskite+molecule</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">perovskite</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">molecule</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ2_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
