Biosynthesis of alkanes is ubiquitous in many kinds of organisms. Cyanobacteria possess two enzymes, acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) reductase (AAR) and aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (ADO), which function in a two-step alkane biosynthesis pathway. These two enzymes act in series and possibly form a complex that efficiently converts long chain fatty acyl-ACP/fatty acyl-CoA into hydrocarbon. While the structure of ADO has been previously described, structures of both AAR and AAR–ADO complex have not been solved, preventing deeper understanding of this pathway. Here, we report a ligand-free AAR structure, and three AAR–ADO complex structures in which AARs bind various ligands. Our results reveal the binding pattern of AAR with its substrate/cofactor, and suggest a potential aldehyde-transferring channel from AAR to ADO. Based on our structural and biochemical data, we proposed a model for the complete catalytic cycle of AAR.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Acyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (AAR) and aldehyde deformylating oxygenase (ADO) are the two enzymes in a cyanobacterial alkane biosynthesis pathway that is of interest for biofuel production.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">The demands for petrol-based fuels has remained high, calling for alternative fuel sources. Biofuels are of particular interest as a renewable supplement for gradually diminishing fossil fuels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Long-chain alk(a/e)nes are the major constituents of conventional transportation fuels. Biosynthesis of alkanes represents a promising way to produce substitutes for petroleum-based fuels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Long-chain alk(a/e)nes are commonly produced from fatty acid metabolites in various species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The earlier discovery of the pathway responsible for alkane biosynthesis in cyanobacteria allowed the conversion from solar energy to alkanes through photosynthesis, without providing external carbon sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. This two-step pathway utilizes two water-soluble enzymes, namely acyl-acyl carrier protein (acyl-ACP) reductase (AAR) and aldehyde-deformylating oxygenase (ADO). AAR catalyzes the first step of this pathway, reducing the substrate fatty acyl-ACP/fatty acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) into the corresponding aldehyde in a NADPH-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Subsequently, ADO catalyzes the conversion of fatty aldehyde into alk(a/e)ne with one carbon shorter (C<sub>n-1</sub> hydrocarbon) and the formate as a C<sub>1</sub>-derived form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">However, this pathway yields little alkane products, primarily because of the slow turnover of the two enzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Thus, structure-based engineering of the two enzymes is a practical way to optimize the efficiency of alkane synthesis. Several crystal structures of ADO from different species of cyanobacteria were previously solved, revealing that ADO adopts a ferritin-like eight-helix (henceforth named helix 1–8) architecture, with a di-iron center buried inside the molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. An occluded substrate binding cavity accessing the di-iron center was identified in these structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In addition, a hydrophobic tunnel featuring an opening between helix 7 and helix 8 was suggested to be the substrate entering tunnel based on the structures of ADO from <italic>Prochlorococcus marinus</italic> (<italic>Pm</italic>ADO). Together, the substrate cavity and the entering tunnel form a “T-shaped” channel inside ADO. ADO is considered to be the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Based on the available structural information, a number of ADO mutants were generated and shown to possess higher activity compared with the wild type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The catalytic reaction of AAR was shown to occur in two steps. Firstly, the substrate (fatty acyl-ACP or fatty acyl-CoA) was found to be associated with AAR, with the fatty acyl moiety covalently bound with the residue C294 of AAR (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>). As a result, an acyl-enzyme intermediate is formed, and the ACP or CoA moieties are released. Subsequently, a corresponding aldehyde is produced from the acyl-enzyme intermediate in the presence of NADPH (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). AAR was previously shown to prefer stearoyl-CoA among acyl-CoA esters of different length and saturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and subsequently it was shown to exhibit the highest activity toward stearoyl-ACP (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>). Previously reported results suggested that AAR utilizes a “Ping-pong” mechanism, binding fatty acyl substrate prior to binding the cofactor NADPH during the catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. To date, no structure of either AAR alone or AAR in complex with substrate or NADPH has been solved. In addition, due to the poor solubility of long chain aldehydes, it had remained unclear how are the aldehydes transferred between two water-soluble enzymes in the hydrophilic environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. A recent report suggested that together, AAR and ADO forms a tight complex that, by facilitating the aldehyde transferring from AAR to ADO either in a direct or an indirect way, increases the efficiency of the alkane biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, due to the current lack of the complex structure, the precise details of the pathway of aldehyde transferring from AAR to ADO have remained undetermined.</p><p id="Par6">Here we report the crystal structure of AAR from <italic>Synechococcus elongatus PCC</italic> 7942 (<italic>Se</italic>AAR) in its apo form (AAR<sub>apo</sub>), together with three structures of AAR in complex with ADO from the same species of cyanobacteria (<italic>Se</italic>ADO), in which AAR binds either substrate or substrate/cofactor. Our results provide details about the binding mode of AAR with ligands, the interaction between AAR and ADO, as well as the potential aldehyde-transferring pathway between the two enzymes. AAR in the four structures likely represents different state during its catalytic process, and our results shed light on the catalytic mechanism of AAR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The AAR<sub>apo</sub> structure represents the resting state of AAR</title><p id="Par7">In this work, we solved the AAR<sub>apo</sub> structure at 2.8 Å resolution (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and modeled the complete AAR protein containing 341 amino acid residues. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, AAR is composed of three domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD, residues 1–130), the middle domain (mid-domain, residues 131–264), and the C-terminal domain (CTD, residues 265–341). A conserved loop, <sup>162</sup>GATGDIG<sup>168</sup>, in the mid-domain was designated as the dinucleotide recognition loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and contains the classical sequence motif GX<sub>(1-3)</sub>GX<sub>(1-2)</sub>G for binding NAD(P)<sup>+</sup> or NAD(P)H (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Residue C294, which is strictly conserved in AAR homologues and has been identified as the key residue for catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, is located approximately at the center of AAR molecule. Above C294, a wide cleft that includes the dinucleotide recognition loop is visible (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).

In our AAR<sub>thioester</sub>–ADO structure solved at 2.18 Å resolution, we observed a long tube-shaped electron density, which can be well fitted with a stearic chain, within an interior tunnel of AAR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7a</xref>). No electron density corresponding to the CoA moiety was observed, despite the incubation of stearoyl-CoA with AAR prior to crystallization. This finding indicates that the acyl-enzyme intermediate was spontaneously formed, and the CoA moiety had already been released. The structure showed that the C1 atom of the stearoyl chain (stearoyl-C1) had formed a covalent thioester bond with the hydrosulfide group of C294 (C294-SH; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7a</xref>). Mass spectrometric analysis of the stearoyl-CoA-incubated AAR sample that was used for crystallization confirmed the thioester bond formation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7b</xref>), thus the AAR<sub>thioester</sub>–ADO structure represents the acyl-enzyme intermediate state of AAR.

One end of the acyl-tunnel connects with the wide cleft above C294, forming an L-shaped, long channel (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). At the other end, the acyl-tunnel can be seen to extend toward the AAR–ADO interface with its opening surrounded by residues Y23 and Y26 from the NTD of AAR and sealed by M221 of ADO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

The main cause of this shift is that the C294S mutant is not able to form a thioester bond, and thus fails to fix the stearic chain at the active site of AAR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). This extended conformation of stearoyl-CoA induces movement of the Fr-I region of AAR (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12a</xref>). Thus, Y23 and Y26, which form the terminal end of the acyl-tunnel in the AAR<sub>thioester</sub>–ADO structure, are distant from the stearic moiety in the AAR<sub>stearoyl-CoA</sub>–ADO structure. These changes result in a wider opening at the surface of the AAR molecule (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12b</xref>). Furthermore, M21, Y23, and Y26 of AAR form additional hydrogen bonds with R218 and M221 from helix 8 of ADO (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12c</xref>), and the conformation of M221 of ADO alters so that it no longer seals the acyl-tunnel of AAR as it does in the AAR<sub>thioester</sub>–ADO structure (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12b</xref>). Together, these structural changes facilitate the release of produced aldehydes from AAR, suggesting that the AAR<sub>stearoyl-CoA</sub>–ADO structure mimics the aldehyde-releasing state of AAR, in which the free aldehyde is released, ready to be transferred to ADO.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>A potential aldehyde-transferring channel from AAR to ADO</title><p id="Par17">Previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, together with our enzymatic assay, demonstrated that both AAR and ADO alone are functional (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In addition, we found that when both incubated with AAR, the wild-type ADO yields two times more product (heptadecane) than the triple mutant (E196A/E200A/D201A) of ADO (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>), which is unable to form the AAR–ADO complex (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). These results together indicate that the formation of AAR–ADO complex is to facilitate the direct transfer of the aldehyde product from AAR to ADO, which increases the efficiency of alkane production in this pathway. Direct transfer would require a contiguous channel from AAR to ADO. In our AAR<sub>ligand</sub>–ADO structures, the acyl-tunnel of AAR has an opening at the surface of AAR and toward AAR–ADO interface (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12b</xref>), suggesting the release direction of the aldehyde. However, in these structures, ADO exhibits an occluded conformation, therefore, we were not able to identify the entry point for the aldehyde to access the active site of ADO based on our AAR–ADO complex structures. Previously reported crystal structures of <italic>Pm</italic>ADO showed that a T-shaped channel is present inside ADO, with an opening between helices 7 and 8 at the ADO surface, which was suggested to represent the entry point for aldehyde<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The helices 7 and 8 of ADO are at the AAR–ADO interface and helix 7 is essential for the complex formation. On the basis of these results, we superposed the <italic>Pm</italic>ADO structure (PDB code: 4PGI) with the ADO part of our AAR<sub>stearoyl-CoA</sub>–ADO structure, and found that the two openings of both <italic>Se</italic>AAR and <italic>Pm</italic>ADO face each other (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), thus the acyl-tunnel of AAR and the T-shaped channel inside ADO are linked, forming a long contiguous channel in the superposed model. The opening at ADO surface leads to the entering tunnel, which corresponds to one half of the horizontal arm of the T-shaped channel. The other half of the horizontal arm together with the vertical arm forms the substrate cavity, which was observed in several ADO structures solved in both the present study, as well as in earlier reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Based on these structural observations, here we propose a model for the process of transferring aldehyde from AAR to ADO. The alkyl group enters the T-shaped channel of ADO, as a result of which the entire aldehyde molecule passes through the entering tunnel, before it reaches the distal end of the whole horizontal arm of the T-shaped channel. The aldehyde group proceeds toward the inside the horizontal arm after the transfer is completed, and upon the bending of the alkyl chain in the middle, accesses the di-iron center of ADO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Cartoon model of the proposed catalytic process of AAR in the two-step pathway.</title><p>The NTD, mid-domain, and CTD of AAR are colored blue, yellow, and magenta, respectively.

When we superposed the structure of <italic>Pm</italic>ADO (PDB code: 4PGI) on <italic>Se</italic>ADO in our complex structure, we found that W178 in <italic>Se</italic>ADO and R191 in <italic>Pm</italic>ADO are located at the same positions, with their main chain atoms and C<sub>β</sub> atoms well superposed (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14b</xref>). Our structural comparison indicated that W178 could easily change its rotamer to swing its indole ring away, thus opening the entry without inducing large movement of the main chain atoms. Together, these results suggest that W178 (or R191 of <italic>Pm</italic>ADO) functions as a gate residue; it may shield the hydrophobic entering tunnel of ADO from the aqueous environment, whereas the approaching aldehyde produced by AAR may result in its side chain swinging away, leading to the opening of the entry at the ADO surface. These conformational changes result in the formation of a long hydrophobic channel through which the aldehyde could be transferred from AAR to ADO.</p><p id="Par19">Our structures provide strong evidence that the interactions between the NTD of AAR and the C-terminal region of ADO are essential for the complex formation and the aldehyde transfer. This is consistent with the previous analysis showing that introducing the ADO–AAR fusion protein (C-terminus of ADO linked with N-terminus of AAR) into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> increased its alkane yield by 4.8-fold compared with the strain expressing both AAR and ADO, but separately<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The fused protein may easily form a complex similar to that presented here, and promote alkane production by facilitating the direct transfer of the aldehyde product from AAR to ADO.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Structural variations of AAR in active and resting states</title><p id="Par20">Superposition of the AAR<sub>apo</sub> structure onto the AAR part of the AAR–ADO complex structures showed that the Fr-II region, which is flexible in the AAR<sub>apo</sub> structure (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>), is stabilized by the hydrogen bond between R118 in Fr-II and D201 of ADO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). In addition, three other regions of AAR, namely Fr-I, Fr-III, and Fr-IV (Q277–M284), exhibit dramatic conformational changes between the structures of apo- and ligand-bound states (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15a</xref>). The N-terminal segment (H7–A37) containing Fr-I is more loosely packed, potentially hindering AAR–ADO complex formation in the AAR<sub>apo</sub> structure. Nevertheless, it adopts a conformation that facilitates intermolecular interactions in the AAR–ADO complex structures (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15a</xref>). The Fr-III region (W221–T235) in the mid-domain, which is involved in NADPH binding, swings toward the central cleft in the AAR–ADO complex structures, resulting in a better fit of NADPH in the cleft (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15b</xref>). Moreover, a short fragment containing M279 in the CTD (Fr-IV), which potentially clashes with the stearic chain in the AAR<sub>apo</sub> structure (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15c</xref>), changes its conformation to shape the acyl-tunnel in the AAR–ADO complex structures (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15c</xref>). The three fragments tend to move toward the active center, creating a more compact architecture of AAR within the AAR–ADO complex structures (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15a</xref>). The compact folding allows AAR to better accommodate the substrate/NADPH, therefore AAR in the AAR–ADO complex structures is likely to adopt an active conformation, which allows the catalytic reaction to proceed, whereas the AAR<sub>apo</sub> structure represents the resting state. Furthermore, our structures suggest that the active form (the ligand-bound form) is more favorable for AAR to bind ADO, compared with the loosely packed apo form of AAR.</p><p id="Par21">In addition, our structural analysis suggested a pivotal role of Y247 for maintaining AAR in a compact conformation. It forms a hydrogen bond with H7 from the NTD and hydrophobic interactions, with aromatic residues from both CTD and NTD of AAR (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15d</xref>), thus drawing the mid-domain, CTD, and NTD together. In addition, Y247 may also be involved in the catalytic process, as it participates in the formation of the acyl-tunnel via its benzene ring and stabilizes NADPH via its carbonyl group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). In agreement with these structural observations, the Y247F mutant of AAR exhibited reduced binding affinity with stearoyl-CoA, and maintained only ~50% of the catalytic activity of the wild type (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Furthermore, Y247A completely failed to bind stearoyl-CoA (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). Interestingly, we found that Y247A mutant also loses the capability to bind ADO, while the binding affinity of Y247F mutant with ADO is almost the same as that of AAR wild type (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). This observation suggests that mutation of the Tyr residue to Ala induces the structural or conformational change of the whole AAR protein, resulting in the complete loss of its function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par22">We solved the crystal structures of AAR and the AAR–ADO complex bound with several, structurally different ligands, thus greatly advancing the understanding of the detailed mechanisms of the catalytic cycle of AAR(–ADO) responsible for alkane production. Interestingly, we noticed that neither the AAR protein with ligands nor the AAR–ADO complex without ligands yielded crystals, implying that both types of binary complexes are flexible, and only the ternary complex (AAR–ligand–ADO) is sufficiently stable to yield crystals. These results suggest that AAR shows a synergistic effect of substrate binding and ADO association. In agreement with this observation, our structural data suggested that the compact folding of AAR in the complex is favorable for substrate/NADPH binding and ADO association, and suggest that the formation of AAR–ADO complex facilitates the catalysis of AAR by relieving its substrate/product inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">However, the stable AAR–ADO complex may not represent the optimal state for alkane production, since the rate-limiting enzyme ADO with low turnover may slow down the whole catalytic process of this pathway, if it is stably complexed with AAR. In agreement with this idea, it was previously shown that alkane yield is upregulated in <italic>E. coli</italic> when expressing ADO and AAR at an increased molar ratio of 3:1 compared with the control strain (1:1 molar ratio of ADO and AAR)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. It was earlier reported that both AAR and ADO alone exhibit full activity, thus complex formation is primarily responsible for the subsequent aldehyde transfer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We assumed that after the transfer process is completed, AAR returns to the apo state and adopts a loose conformation similar to the AAR<sub>apo</sub> structure, and dissociates from ADO. As a result, the free AAR could reload its substrate and bind with another ADO molecule, thus the rate-limiting effect of ADO could be partially relieved. The transient AAR–ADO complex may be critical for optimizing the catalytic efficiency of this pathway.</p><p id="Par24">Basing on these assumptions, together with the insights from the AAR structures captured at different states, we propose a five-state (S0–S4) model that could account for the catalytic mechanism of AAR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). AAR alone adopts a loose conformation as shown in the AAR<sub>apo</sub> structure, which represents the resting state (ligand-free) of AAR (S0). The first step of catalysis involves the binding of either acyl-ACP or acyl-CoA substrate (S1). This process is stimulated by monovalent ion atoms, such as K<sup>+</sup> ions. Simultaneously, an acyl-enzyme intermediate is spontaneously formed before either the ACP or CoA moiety is released (S2, represented by the AAR<sub>thioester</sub>–ADO structure). Our results indicated that substrate binding induces a conformational change of AAR, resulting in its compact folding, facilitating the formation of a stable AAR<sub>ligand</sub>–ADO complex in S1 and S2 states. In the complex, the acyl moiety is linked with C294 at the center of AAR molecule, whereas the alkyl group is pointing toward the AAR–ADO interface. Subsequently, NADPH is incorporated into the cleft above C294 of AAR (S3, represented by the AAR<sub>NADPH</sub>–ADO structure), before AAR catalyzes the hydride transfer of NADPH, and before reduction of the acyl moiety to a long-chain aldehyde. It is noteworthy that AAR in apo state (S0) is able to associate with ADO, as shown by the ITC results in the present study as well as in earlier report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The AAR–ADO binary complex may further bind the substrate, resulting in a stable ternary complex. Moreover, AAR alone is fully active and capable of catalyzing the conversion of acyl-ACP/acyl-CoA to aldehyde, and the formation of AAR–ADO complex is to fulfill the aldehyde transfer function. As a result, AAR may form a complex with ADO at several different states, even before binding substrate (S0 state) or after binding NADPH (S3 state). Following aldehyde production and complex formation, the free aldehyde product is released from AAR (S4, represented by the AAR<sub>stearoyl-CoA</sub>–ADO structure), which results in further conformational changes of the N-terminal region of AAR at the AAR–ADO interface. This conformational change of AAR and the moving aldehyde may lead to the altered conformation of the C-terminal residues of ADO, such as the gate residue (W178 in <italic>Se</italic>ADO and R191 in <italic>Pm</italic>ADO), thus opening the entering tunnel in ADO. After aldehyde transfer into ADO, AAR may return to the resting state exhibiting a loose conformation (S0), detach from ADO, and prepare for the next cycle. The aldehyde in ADO moves further to occupy the substrate cavity with its head group close to the di-iron center of ADO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Our suggested mechanism explains the increased alkane yield when providing ADO, especially in higher molar ratio to AAR (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>), and highlights the functional importance of the reversible association and dissociation of AAR and ADO in the alkane biosynthesis pathway.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p id="Par25">The AAR gene (<italic>Synpcc7942_1594</italic>, gene ID:3775018) from the complete genome of <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> PCC 7942 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_007604.1?from=1660735&amp;to=1661760&amp;report=genbank" ext-link-type="uri">Genbank ID:CP000100.1</ext-link>), was synthesized (GeneScript, China) and cloned (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) into the modified version of vector pET24a (Novagen), that encodes a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site with the sequence of ENLYFQG, followed by a downstream 21-residue peptide, including a His(6)-tag with the sequence of SMNSSSVDKLAAALEHHHHHH.

The extracted supernatant was pooled together, dried with nitrogen gas, and then resolved in 20 µL ethyl acetate for the GC-MS measurement.</p><p id="Par29">The concentration of octadecanal and heptadecane was measured using an Agilent 7890 A gas chromatograph coupled with an Agilent 7000B QQQ mass spectrometer. A total of 2 µL sample was loaded with the helium as the carrier gas onto the chromatographic column HP-5ms (30 mM × 0.25 mM ID, 0.25 μm; Agilent) at the flow rate of 1.3 ml min<sup>−1</sup>. The injector temperature maintained at 300 °C with spotless mode. The GC oven settings were as follows: initial temperature 75 °C, held for 5 min, then at 40 °C min<sup>−1</sup>, increased to 325 °C and held for 5 min. Ionization mode of EI (70 eV, 230 °C) and full scan of 50–550 <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> were chosen for MS detection. The standard curve was plotted based on the measuring of the commercial octadecanal and heptadecane (Sigma Aldrich) at a gradient concentration (from 3.125 to 75 µg mL<sup>−1</sup>). Data were acquired and processed using MassHunter Workstation Software and the NIST database.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Preparation of the AAR–ADO complex</title><p id="Par30">To get the AAR in complex with stearoyl-CoA and ADO, AAR was first incubated with its substrate stearoyl-CoA at the molar ratio of 1:3 for 30 min at 18 °C, and was further incubated with ADO protein at 1:1 molar ratio for additional 4 h. The unbound stearoyl-CoA was removed from the AAR–ADO complex through gel filtration using the superdex200 10/300GL column, with elution buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 1 mM TCEP. The eluted protein complex was characterized through SDS–PAGE and concentrated to 40 mg mL<sup>−1</sup> for crystallization. The molecular weight of both the AAR protein alone and AAR protein covalently bound with stearoyl-CoA were determined by mass spectrometry (HPLC-Q-TOF-MS).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Crystallization, structure determination, and refinement</title><p id="Par31">Crystallization screens were carried out at 18 °C by mixing equal volume of protein and reservoir solution, using the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals of AAR-His were grown in condition of 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH8.5, and 1.2 M NaAc. For phasing, the AAR-His crystals were soaked in mother liquor (0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH8.5, 200 mM NaAc, and 25% PEG3350) containing 10 mM ethyl mercury phosphate for 10 s. Crystals of AAR were harvested in reservoir solution of 0.1 M citric acid, pH6.0, and 1 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The crystals of AAR–ADO in complex with substrate (AAR<sub>thioester</sub>–ADO and AAR<sub>stearoyl-CoA</sub>–ADO) were harvested in reservoir solution containing 0.1 M HEPES, pH 7.5, and 20% PEG8000. To obtain the crystal of the AAR<sub>NADPH</sub>–ADO, the crystals of AAR<sub>thioester</sub>–ADO were soaked with 1 mM NADPH in reservoir solution overnight. Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen at 100 K for data collection using 2.5 M NaAc in mother liquor as cryo-protectant for AAR-His crystals, 20% glycerol in mother liquor as cryo-protectant for AAR<sub>apo</sub> crystals, and the reservoir solution as cryo-protectant for AAR–ADO complex crystals. Diffraction data were collected at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility at wavelength of 0.98 Å (0.9779~0.9792) Å (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>). Diffraction data were processed and scaled with HKL-2000 package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The initial phase of AAR-His was obtained from the Hg-derivative crystals by single isomorphous replacement anomalous scattering method using AutoSol in PHENIX package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In the AAR-His structure, the C-terminal peptide encoded by the vector forms an α-helix, which is participating the molecular packing in the crystals, leading to an artifact of AAR structure. Thus, the AAR-His structure was used only for phasing and all other experiments were performed using AAR (without C-terminal 20-residue-peptide) protein. The structure of AAR<sub>apo</sub> was solved by Molecular Replacement using the structure of AAR-His as a search model. The AAR<sub>ligands</sub>–ADO structures were solved by Molecular Replacement using the structures of AAR-His and ADO (PDB code:4RC8) as search models. Most part of the structures were built by AutoBuild in PHENIX package<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, whereas a small parts were built manually by Coot<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The models were refined by Phenix.refine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. A summary of data collection and structure refinement statistics is provided in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>. The Ramachandran plot showed that most of the residues (95–96.4%) in these four structures are in the most favored regions, and no residues lie in the disallowed region. All the figures of the structures were prepared by Pymol (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.3r1, Schrodinger, LLC., 2010). The difference map for showing the density of ligands were calculated by the program “create a map from map coefficients” in phenix supplying the PDB without ligands and MTZ files.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="Par32">Further information on experimental design is available in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">Nature Research Reporting Summary</xref> linked to this paper.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to the staffs at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Shanghai, China) for technical support during diffraction data collection.
