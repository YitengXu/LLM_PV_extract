Three-dimensional perovskite solar cells are most efficient but need to have improved environmental stability. Inclusion of larger ammonium salts has led to a trade-off between improved stability and efficiency, which is attributed to the perovskite films containing a two-dimensional component. Here, we show that addition of 0.3 mole percent of a fluorinated lead salt into the three-dimensional methylammonium lead iodide perovskite enables low temperature fabrication of simple inverted solar cells with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 21.1%. The perovskite layer has no detectable two-dimensional component at salt concentrations of up to 5 mole percent. The high concentration of fluorinated material found at the film-air interface provides greater hydrophobicity, increased size and orientation of the surface perovskite crystals, and unencapsulated devices with increased stability to high humidity.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Efficient and stable perovskite solar cells with simple active layers are desirable for manufacturing, yet formation of a two-dimensional component in the perovskite film compromises the performance.

The improvement in efficiency in both cases has been achieved by manipulation of the constituents within the perovskite active layer leading to materials with high absorption coefficients, long carrier diffusion lengths, and small exciton-binding energies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Combining the optimized 3D-perovskite layer with a standard <italic>n</italic>–<italic>i</italic>–<italic>p</italic> device architecture has led to a certified PCE of 25.2%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The very high-efficiency 3D-perovskite solar cells have generally relied on increasingly complex perovskite mixtures (multi-cations and anions), which is an issue for reliable manufacturing. Furthermore, the long-term stability of devices containing 3D perovskites against moisture, heat, and light is still a concern for commercial application of the technology. Therefore, significant effort is now being put towards improving the device stability without sacrificing the efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskites with a general formula of (RNH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(A)<sub><italic>n</italic>−1</sub>B<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>X<sub>3<italic>n</italic>+1</sub> have been proposed as a method to improve long-term durability. The increased stability has been attributed to the hydrophobicity and thermal stability of the 2D-perovskite arising from incorporation of large organic spacer cations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Alongside the enhanced stability there has been steady improvement in the efficiencies of 2D-perovskite solar cells with PCEs of up to 18.2% being reported for inverted (<italic>p</italic>–<italic>i</italic>–<italic>n</italic>) devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, with 2D-perovskite solar cells, there might ultimately be a trade-off between stability and efficiency with the latter being affected by quantum confinement of the excited state, and a lower carrier mobility and narrower absorption window relative to a range of 3D materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In this sense, mixed 2D/3D hybrid-perovskite materials, i.e., materials that have both 2D and 3D components, provide an attractive conceptual route to combine the advantages of enhanced stability of 2D-perovskites with the strong light absorption and good charge carrier transport properties of a 3D-perovskite active layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, although in some cases it is clear from the data that there are 2D and 3D crystal types in the active layer in other cases, a 2D/3D structure is assumed simply on the basis that a large large organic cation was added to the processing solution. There is also some confusion in the terminology used with 2D/3D potentially corresponding to simply the large organic cation used, the structure of the bulk of the film, or a bilayer structure with the 2D component on top. Whether or not a 2D/3D-perovskite combination exists and performs well is strongly dependent on the choice of the large organic cation and the design criteria are not yet fully understood. Currently, <italic>n</italic>-butylammonium and phenylethylammonium (PEA) have been the most widely studied large organic cations. They have been reported to impart a 2D/3D structure with improved ambient stability and devices containing them have had PCEs of up to 20%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, the hunt is now on for new organic spacers to achieve the concept of stable 2D/3D-perovskite solar cells. For example, Grancini et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> reported an ultra-stable (1 year) 2D/3D (5-ammoniumvaleric acid iodide)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>/MAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite junction with a PCE of 14.6% in standard <italic>n</italic>–<italic>i</italic>–<italic>p</italic> mesoporous solar cells. By introducing the 2D inducing 2,2-(ethylenedioxy)bis(ethylammonium)lead iodide microcrystals into a multication 3D perovskite, Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> realized <italic>n</italic>–<italic>i</italic>–<italic>p</italic> devices with a high steady-state efficiency of 19.7% and encapsulated modules that retained 90% of the initial PCE of 11.6% after 3000 h in air. Zhou et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> have reported highly efficient, stable 2D/3D hybrid PSCs through incorporation of thiophenemethylammonium iodide spacer cations into a formamidinium/methylammonium-based 3D perovskite, with the optimized device having a PCE of 21.5% in an <italic>n</italic>–<italic>i</italic>–<italic>p</italic> structure. Very recently, fluorinated organic spacer cations have been applied in mesoporous-based <italic>n</italic>–<italic>i</italic>–<italic>p</italic> 2D/3D-perovskite solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The choice of the fluorinated spacer cations was reported to be due to their hydrophobic character and superior stability. The highest PCE reported thus far for a 2D/3D device is 22.1% with the structure FTO/titanium dioxide/perovskite/spiro-MeoTAD/Au/antireflective coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The active layer in this latter device was a bilayer, with the fluorinated ammonium salt dip-coated onto the formamidinium-based perovskite layer followed by an extended thermal treatment. We note that the impressive performance was achieved with an optimized antireflection coating.</p><p id="Par5">Perovskite solar cells historically grew out of research on dye sensitized solar cells and hence many of the developments in materials and record efficiencies have been based on the standard <italic>n</italic>–<italic>i</italic>–<italic>p</italic> architecture using a metal oxide-based electron extraction layer. However, inverted (<italic>p</italic>–<italic>i</italic>–<italic>n</italic>) perovskite solar cells are also attracting attention due to their potential for simple, low-temperature preparation processes, reduced hysteresis, and improved long-term stability under ultraviolet (UV) light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. There have been few reports of 2D/3D PSCs using the inverted configuration, with most having PCEs lower than their <italic>n</italic>–<italic>i</italic>–<italic>p</italic> device counterparts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. A complex multicomponent perovskite [(PEA<sub>0.25</sub>F5PEA<sub>0.75</sub>)<sub>2</sub>PbSCN<sub>2x</sub>I<sub>4-2x</sub>]<sub>0.005</sub>[(FA<sub>0.64</sub>MA<sub>0.20</sub>Cs<sub>0.15</sub>)Pb<sub>0.99</sub>(I<sub>0.79</sub>Br<sub>0.2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>] containing a small amount of a fluorinated ammonium cation has been recently reported to have a maximum PCE of 21.10% in an inverted device architecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, it is important to note that the efficiency was also achieved with the use of an antireflection coating. Furthermore, although the active film was formed in a single step there was insufficient evidence provided to determine the location of the fluorinated ammonium cation in the film and the maximum amount fluorinated additive incorporated was 1%.</p><p id="Par6">In this work, we incorporate 2-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorophenyl)ethylammonium iodide (FEAI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> into the processing solution normally used for the formation of the 3D methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) and demonstrate simple perovskite-based inverted solar cells with a champion efficiency of 21.1%. We demonstrate that small quantities of the additive enhance the performance relative to the neat MAPbI<sub>3</sub> in terms of PCE and stability to humidity and temperature. We also show that when the FEAI concentration in the processing solution is above a critical level the performance of the cells decreases. Importantly, we report that for the high-efficiency cells there is no evidence for the formation of a 2D-perovskite layer nor well defined large 2D crystals. Rather the efficient photoactive films are composed of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystals that are larger at the surface than the bulk with the fluorinated additive concentrated at the surface.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Device performance</title><p id="Par7">The 2D/3D-perovskite active layers are generally formed in one of two ways: either by processing a solution containing the salts that individually would give rise to a 2D or 3D perovskite in the desired ratio or sequentially depositing each type of cation. We note that the high-efficiency <italic>n</italic>–<italic>i</italic>–<italic>p</italic> devices reported by Liu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> were prepared by the latter method. In our current work on inverted solar cells, we prepared the perovskite films from solutions containing different mole percent (mol%) of FEAI and methylammonium iodide with the ratio of the salts relative to lead iodide chosen to give the stoichiometry required in principle for the formation of both the 2D [(FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>] and 3D (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) perovskites. Thus, the mol% values shown in the figures and used in the discussion are based on the assumption that (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> and MAPbI<sub>3</sub> are formed quantitatively from their respective salts during processing, although this will be commented on later. The devices had the architecture ITO/PTAA/PFN-P2/perovskite/C<sub>60</sub>/BCP/Cu [where PTAA = poly(bis{4-phenyl}{2,4-bimethylphenyl}amine), PFN-P2 = poly({9,9-bis[3’-({<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-dimethyl}-<italic>N</italic>-ethylammonium)propyl]-2,7-fluorene}-<italic>alt</italic>-2,7-{9,9-di-<italic>n</italic>-octylfluorene}), and BCP = bathocuproine], with the performance of the devices containing different mol% of (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>.

Given that the 0.3 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>-containing devices gave the best overall efficiency, we focussed our detailed device study on this blend. An important feature of the high-performing 0.3 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> devices was that there was negligible current–voltage hysteresis between the forward and reverse scans (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).

The absorption spectra of the neat MAPbI<sub>3</sub> and 0.3 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>-containing films are overlaid in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> [note the absorption spectra are consistent with the External Quantum Efficiency (EQE) response in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>], with those of higher (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> content shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> and pictures of the films in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>. It appears at first sight that the absorption spectra of films containing up to 10 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> were essentially identical to that of the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> with an absorption onset of around 760 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, with only the 50 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>-containing film being significantly different. The 50 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> containing film had distinctive absorbance peaks at around 403, 499, 547, and 569 nm, which were in line with previous reports on 2D/3D perovskite-containing films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and could be ascribed to the excitonic absorption of 2D-perovskite phases with <italic>n</italic> = 1–4 layers, respectively. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> shows how the colour of the films change with increasing (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> content. It can be seen that even though the absorption spectra of the films containing up to 10 mol% of (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> were the same as MAPbI<sub>3</sub>, the surface of the films had an increasingly red hue. The red hue could arise from different reflectivity from the surface of the films due to differences in crystal size and/or orientation (see later discussion on film structure), and/or it might be associated with an increase in the bandgap from quantum confinement effects arising from the 2D component, which becomes increasingly visible at higher concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. To gain further insight into the effect the (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> content of the absorption of the films, we used Tauc Plots to estimate the bandgaps of the perovskite films. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> shows that the bandgaps of the films with up to 3 mol% of (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> were within experimental error the same.

It was found that the blue shift in the emission normally associated with the formation of a mixed 2D/3D composite, where charge carriers are confined by the large potential barrier caused by the 2D-perovskite component<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, only occurred when the (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> concentration reached &gt;10 mol%. The emission of the 10 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> content film had a small blue shift, whereas that of the highest concentration [50 mol% of (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>] was significantly blue shifted. In addition, emission peaks at &lt;600 nm were also observed for the 50 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> film, which correlate with the absorption peaks and arise from small n (<italic>n</italic> ≤ 4) 2D phases in the film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

The PL decay profiles for the neat MAPbI<sub>3</sub> and the best-performing 0.3 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>-containing films were essentially the same and could be fitted to a biexponential with a relatively fast component, closely related to recombination induced by defects or impurities, and a slower component arising from radiative recombination occurring in the bulk perovskite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">In a final part of the study on the photophysical properties of the films, we measured the temperature dependence of the PL (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).

When the temperature was decreased to 100 K and below, the high-energy emission peak disappears, whereas the low-energy emission intensity increases. Previous studies report that this low-energy emission is due to localized trap-mediated carrier recombination in the perovskite film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Adding 0.3 mol% of (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> suppressed the temperature at which the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> phase transition occurred and at 77 K there was still a clear component relating to the tetragonal phase. When the concentration of the (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> was increased tenfold (3 mol%), similar suppression of the phase transfer with decreasing temperature was observed (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). In conclusion, in the context of the device performance, analysis of the optical properties of the films showed that the neat MAPbI<sub>3</sub> and films containing 0.3 mol% of (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> had similar photophysical properties, and hence there must be an alternative reason for the improvement in the device performance. Furthermore, it was found that up to a concentration of (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> of 10 mol% there was little evidence for a significant concentration of the classically described mixed 2D/3D composite throughout the films.</p><p id="Par12">In the next part of the study, we investigated the structural properties of the materials. The 2D grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GI-WAXS) patterns and the corresponding one-dimensional (1D) scattering profiles of the neat MAPbI<sub>3</sub> and films containing up to 10 mol% of (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>. The 1D scattering profiles were obtained from the measured 2D scattering data by radial averaging through the azimuthal angles of 0° to 180°. The measurements are shown at two angles of the incident beam, 0.14° and 0.3°, which are below and above the critical angle of crystalline MAPbI<sub>3</sub> (ca. 0.26°). At the lower angle, the observed scattering originates from the top few nanometres of the film while at the higher angle the beam probes tens of nanometres into the film providing information on the bulk structure. The predominant feature, which was observed in all of the 2D diffraction patterns is a broad ring at a momentum transfer (<italic>Q</italic>) of ca. 1 Å<sup>−1</sup> [<italic>q</italic> = 4<bold>sin</bold>(<italic>θ</italic>/2)/<italic>λ</italic>, where <italic>θ</italic> is the angle of the diffraction and <italic>λ</italic> is the wavelength of the incident X-ray beam]. This broad feature can be assigned to the overlapping diffraction from the (002) and (110) planes associated with the tetragonal crystal structure of MAPbI<sub>3</sub>. That is, the films containing up to 10 mol% of (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> comprised MAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystals. Focussing initially on the measurements with the deeper penetration (higher angle), the overall breadth of the peak (see for example Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9c</xref>) and the distribution in an arc with an increased intensity close to 0° and 90° (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9a</xref>) are indicative of the individual crystallites being nanosized or disordered and having weak preferential orientation such that the (110) and (002) planes are either parallel or perpendicular with the surface. In general, there was little change in the structure of the material with increasing (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> concentration, except at the highest concentration studied, 10 mol% where there appeared to be some increase in the breadth and changes in the radial distribution of this peak.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>2D GI-WAXS measurements and out-of-plane, high-resolution GI-XRD patterns of the thin films.</title><p>The 2D GI-WAXS measurements with an incident beam of <bold>a</bold> 0.3° and <bold>b</bold> 0.14° for the neat MAPbI<sub>3</sub> and 0.3 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>-containing films.

This is particularly noticeable for the 10 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>-containing film, as evidenced by the discrete spots along the rings (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9b</xref>) and features on the peaks of the 1D profiles (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9d</xref>). These observations are consistent with the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystallites at the surface becoming larger in size with addition of the (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>. Moreover, there is also evidence for the (110) planes of the material being more strongly aligned parallel with the surface and this surface ordering increases with concentration up to 10 mol%, although there appeared to be a small decrease seen between 0.3 and 0.5 mol%. The difference in orientation and size of crystals at the film surface could lead to different film reflectivity, which in turn could explain why the surface colours of the film change while the absorption spectra are so similar. In summary, these results clearly show that the structure of the films normal to the substrate changes with different mol% of (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>. Importantly, the section of the film that is near the air interface is different from the bulk of the film.</p><p id="Par14">To complete the X-ray studies, we undertook high-resolution out-of-plane Grazing Incidence X-ray diffraction (G-XRD) measured as a function of incidence angle and composition with the patterns shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9e</xref>. The films with different mol% of (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> were found to have a crystal structure that is qualitatively similar to that of the neat MAPbI<sub>3</sub> and different to what would be expected for the 2D RP perovskite, (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>. That is, if pure 2D crystals were present in the films, they were either too small or few to be observable. It is conceptually feasible that individual (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> molecules could coat the surface of the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystals or form an amorphous component within the film. Surface coating of the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystals would lead to a reduction in surface defects and be consistent with the increase in the PL signal with increasing (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> content. We also found that in the neat MAPbI<sub>3</sub> films there was a very weak peak at ca. 0.9 Å<sup>−1</sup>, which can be ascribed to the residual lead iodide in the as-formed film. With increasing addition of the FEAI in the processing solution, the intensity of this peak decreases and completely disappears when &gt;1 mol% of FEAI was added, indicating that the addition of the FEAI reduced the extant PbI<sub>2</sub> content in the films. The effect of extant PbI<sub>2</sub> on the performance of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> devices is still a matter of debate. There are some reports stating that a small excess of lead iodide can lead to devices that exhibit a higher PCE, and that the presence of higher lead iodide concentration can decrease the material and device storage stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In contrast, it has been found that if the PbI<sub>2</sub> forms sheets within the perovskite layer then improved stability can be achieved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">To further investigate the perovskite film structure, we carried out Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) imaging on the complete devices (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). We found that when the devices were cut/fractured the copper electrode partially delaminated. Nevertheless, it was possible to identify the separate glass, ITO, PTAA/PFN-P2, perovskite, C<sub>60</sub>/BCP and copper layers. We found that the neat MAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite was not highly textured within the bulk of the layer. As increasing amounts of FEAI were added to the perovskite layer it was found that the apparent average crystal size in the bulk decreased. However, it should be noted that increasing the amount of FEAI made the perovskite layers more prone to degradation under the measurement conditions and hence care had to be taken to avoid the introduction of artefacts. It would be reasonable to conclude that the differences observed in the X-ray data for the surface and bulk crystals within the films were due to the film surface being enriched with fluorinated (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>.</p><p id="Par16">To study this, we used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling of the signal associated with the fluorine atoms to determine where the (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> was located in the film. The 0.3 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>-containing film was found to have a relatively high (19 atom%) concentration of fluorine within 50 nm of the surface with a negligible (&lt;0.7 atom%) in the bulk of the film (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). We note that if the 0.3 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> was evenly distributed throughout the film then the average fluorine concentration would be approximately 0.4 atom% of fluorine and would be below the detection limit of the XPS measurements. Furthermore, concentration of 19 atom% is a clear indication that the (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> must be at the top surface (50 nm of the 220 nm film). That is, during the solution processing to form the thin film, the (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> concentrates near the air interface. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref> also shows the profiles for 3 mol% and 10 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>-containing perovskite films, and it can be clearly seen that in all cases the concentration of the fluorine atoms was highest near the surface of the film. Furthermore, the absolute concentration of the fluorine atoms was found to increase near the surface with increasing (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> concentration. Also, with increasing (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> concentration, the depth at which the presence of the fluorine atoms was measured was found to increase. These results are also consistent with the increased PL signal seen for the higher (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> content films. That is, with the (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> distributed more deeply within the film a greater degree of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystal surface passivation could occur. We were interested to see whether the phase separation that occurred during the single processing step for MAPbI<sub>3</sub> was more general and so we carried out a similar set of experiments with the formamidinium lead triiodide, with the results shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>.

The decline of the PCE was mainly attributed to the deterioration of the FF (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>).

It can be seen that the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> film had a contact angle of 62° with that of the 0.3 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>-containing being 90°. Furthermore, the contact angle increased with the increasing mol% of the (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>), indicating that the perovskite films containing the fluorinated organic cation were more hydrophobic.</p><p id="Par20">We also tested the stability of the devices using maximum power point tracking under simulated AM 1.5 G illumination with the results shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>. We found that the PCE of the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> device decreased rapidly (35% in ≈7 h), which was similar to that previously reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The burn-in observed for the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> devices has been ascribed to amorphous regions containing a high density of ionic defects, which when removed through a series of post-fabrication steps can lead to  devices with greater stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. In contrast, the 0.3 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub>-based device showed a significantly decreased PCE decay rate under maximum power point tracking conditions. Within the first 10 h, there was only a 22% decrease and after 100 hours the PCE had dropped to 40% of its initial value. The fact that decay was slower for the 0.3 mol% FEAI-containing device could be due to a decrease in ionic defects and increase in crystal ordering at the surface of the perovskite layer induced by the FEAI.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par21">Drawing the results together provides a picture of the perovskite film that gives rise to inverted perovskite solar cells with a hysteresis-free maximum PCE of 21.1% (without the use of an antireflection coating) and improved stability to heat and humidity. Addition of small amounts of FEAI to the processing solution used to form the perovskite led to films in which the (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> vertically phase separated such that it was concentrated near the electron transport interlayer in the devices. At low loading (0.3 mol%) the majority of the (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> was within the first 50 nm of the top of the film. It was found that the (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> did not form a clearly defined 2D-perovskite capping layer or 2D crystals of significant size when mixed with the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> at concentrations of up to 10 mol%. Instead, at these concentrations the films were composed of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> with the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystallites at the surface being generally larger in size and having the (110) planes of the material more strongly aligned parallel with the surface. Although the room temperature photophysical properties of the 0.3 mol% (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> content films were essentially identical to the MAPbI<sub>3</sub>, the presence of the small amount of (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> was sufficient to depress the phase transition temperature. Coupling the results from the water contact angle and SKPM measurements with the fact that increasing the (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> content led to an increase in the PL efficiency and lifetime, the results provide a picture where the (FEA)<sub>2</sub>PbI<sub>4</sub> found at the surface and grain boundaries passivates the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystallite surface defects within the perovskite film. These results show additives that can in principle form 2D RP perovskite films when mixed with a 3D perovskite do not necessarily have to be used at a concentration to form a 2D/3D mixed perovskite film to give devices with good stability and performance. The results show that if there is no FEAI in the active layer composition (pure MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) or there is too much additive (as little as a few percent), then the devices have poorer performance. The addition of 0.3 mol% of FEAI led to perovskite films in which there was no observable 2D phase and devices with the best performance. Thus, the results relax the requirement for 2D phases to be clearly present in the perovskite active layer to overcome the traditional trade-off between the PCE and stability in 2D and 3D PSCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par22">Methylammonium iodide (MAI, &gt;99%) was purchased from GreatCell Solar Limited.

The excitation source was a light-emitting diode emitting at 441 nm pulsed at 1 MHz with a pulse width of 1.2 ns and the PL decays were measured at 767 nm. A long-pass filter was used to block any scattered excitation. The instrument response function (IRF) was determined by removing the long-pass filter and measuring the excitation scattered off the sample at 441 nm. The data were fitted with the software application DAS6 (supplied by Jobin-Yvon) using multi-exponential decays convolved with the IRF.

Thin films of the samples were deposited onto silicon wafers (1 cm × 1 cm), and the angle of incidence and surface normal were aligned to the beam by iterative half-cut and rocking curve measurements. The XPS profile was collected using a Kratos Axis Ultra XPS Surface Analysis System with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray source. Elemental depth information was collected using XPS in conjunction with argon-ion bombardment. The argon ion-beam etching was carried out at a beam energy of 4 keV.
