In well-tuned conditions, such anodes enable green hydrogen generation in photoelectrochemical water splitting cells. Bismuth vanadate films have to ensure high efficiencies in electron/hole pair generation and sufficiently high rates of charge transfer to the conducting substrate and the electrolyte, respectively. Thus, the tuning of coating properties has to aim for high phase purity, good layer integrity as well as optimum diffusion path lengths. In order to explore the potential of aerosol deposition to produce BiVO<sub>4</sub> films with high photoelectrochemical activity and to elucidate influences on microstructure and application properties, powder sizes and spraying parameters had to be tailored. By ball milling over durations of up to 20 min, particles sizes in the range from 8.3 down to 0.6 µm were obtained. With respect to spray conditions, the process gas pressure was varied from 1.0 to 2.1 bar corresponding to gas flow rates of 10-40 l/min. The wide range of powder sizes and parameters in aerosol deposition allowed for developing a window of deposition in order to derive the most promising combinations for layer build-up. Optimum parameter sets in application on stainless steel substrates were transferred to FTO-coated glass substrates for backlit cell layouts. The thickness and conductivity of the layers were adjusted to a layer thickness range of 200-500 nm in order to achieve maximum photocurrents. The production of homogeneous, large-scale prototypes demonstrates that aerosol deposition is suitable for processing layers for solar energy harvesting with high photo current densities of up to 3.55 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>AD BiVO<sub>4</sub></kwd><kwd>aerosol deposition</kwd><kwd>aerosol spraying</kwd><kwd>hydrogen

Hydrogen-based technologies could fulfill both needs. As a renewable energy carrier, hydrogen can be stored in pressurized gas tanks, as cryogenic liquid or in solid metal hydrides (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>). Hydrogen can then be used as a flexible energy carrier in various applications, e.g., to generate electrical energy in fuel cells or to produce ammonia or synthetic hydrocarbons in chemical reactors without any greenhouse gas emissions (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). Apart from using wind power or solar cells as energy sources to drive water splitting by electrolysis, environmentally friendly hydrogen production can also be achieved by direct conversion of sunlight in a photovoltaic cell. Corresponding photoelectrochemical water splitting cells are based on semiconductor materials to generate charge carriers by the absorption of sunlight, thus enabling the electrolysis reaction and the generation of hydrogen directly from water (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). Advantages of such direct conversion over electrolysis concern lower ohmic losses and thus higher efficiencies.</p><p id="Par3">As a metal oxide semiconductor with a band gap energy of 2.4 eV, bismuth vanadate (BiVO<sub>4</sub>) shows light absorption within the visible range of the solar spectrum, which predestines this material for the use in photoelectrochemical water splitting cells (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). Moreover, the band gap structure suits well for use as photoanodes for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). As commercially available low cost and non-toxic material with a good electrochemical stability, BiVO<sub>4</sub> should allow for easy technological implementation (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">So far, photo-active films are mainly produced by thin film techniques, but at rather high costs and low deposition rates (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). Less costly processing routes are opened by thermal spraying (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>) or sol–gel techniques (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>); however, these cannot guarantee the required phase purity or absence of remnants from the binder. As solid state and binderless alternative, aerosol deposition (AD) offers several advantages: comparatively low costs, high deposition rates, as well as absence of undesired phase transformations and impurities or residues that could reduce the photoelectrochemical activity. The approach of this research concerns a systematic investigation in tuning aerosol deposition of BiVO<sub>4</sub> coatings for highly effective sunlight harvesting and green hydrogen generation by studying influences of powder sizes and process gas pressures on layer formation.</p><p id="Par5">The aerosol deposition method (AD) was developed in the 1990s by Jun Akedo´s group at the National Institute of Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) in Tsukuba, Japan (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>). Thin ceramic layers can be deposited at room temperature in a vacuum by using small, about micron-sized ceramic particles by spraying onto polymers, metals and ceramics as substrate material. So far, a wide variety of different ceramics has been explored for possible use as spraying material to produce thin ceramic coatings by aerosol deposition (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>). Wolpert et al. demonstrated the feasibility for using aerosol deposition to produce thin BiVO<sub>4</sub> coatings for solar hydrogen generation. However, so far a systematic investigation to derive most effective feedstock sizes and spray parameter sets for aerosol deposition of BiVO<sub>4</sub>, ensuring the needed process stability, is still missing (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows a principle sketch of the aerosol deposition method. The aerosol is produced in an aerosol generator and fed directly into the main process gas stream. Due to the flow through a converging nozzle and the gas expansion into a vacuum chamber, the aerosol is accelerated to high velocities of up to 350 m/s (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>). The vacuum chamber is necessary to minimize interaction with the surrounding atmosphere and to reduce the bow shock effect in front of the substrate, thus preventing the fine powder from being deflected with the gas flow.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic illustrating the principle of the aerosol deposition method</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2023_1550_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par7">In general, ceramic particles are brittle and show no plastic deformation. However, according to results from Calvié et al., plastic deformation can be observed even in brittle ceramic particles if they are nano-sized (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>). The bonding mechanisms for aerosol deposition are still controversially discussed (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>). However, literature agrees well with the view that coating formation is associated with substantial grain refinement upon impact (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>). More information about the aerosol deposition can be found in the overview article of Hanft et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials and Preparation</title><p id="Par8">The BiVO<sub>4</sub> powder was delivered by American Elements, Los Angeles, California, USA with a particle size of <italic>D</italic>10 = 2.5 µm, <italic>D</italic>50 = 8.3 µm and <italic>D</italic>90 = 17.2 µm. The as-received powder was milled with a planetary mill (Pulverisette 5/4 classic line) from Fritsch GmbH, Idar-Oberstein, Germany, by using 500 ml zirconia grinding vials and 2 mm zirconia grinding balls. Milling was performed at 400 revs/min in isopropanol and was interrupted in intervals of 1 min with 10 min for cooling. The weight ratio of milling balls, powder and isopropanol was set to 10:2:0.25 (with milling balls: 400 g; powder: 80 g; isopropanol: 20 g). In order to achieve different particle sizes, the milling times were varied from 1 to 20 min. The powders were dried in an ambient atmosphere for 2 h at 200 °C, then cooled down in a vacuum and stored in a glove box to prevent the absorption of water before spraying.</p><p id="Par9">In order to develop optimum powder sizes and conditions for deposition, stainless steel AISI 304 plates with a thickness of 3 mm were used as substrates (lateral size of 10 mm × 10 mm). Substrate surfaces were polished to a maximum roughness of Ra ≤ 1 µm. Previously optimized spray conditions were used for processing thin films onto conductive fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates from Solaronix SA, Aubonne, Switzerland. FTO substrates allow for backside illumination during photoelectrochemical analyses. The different substrate types were all cleaned with ethanol for 5 min in an ultrasonic bath. Possibly remaining adsorbates on the surface were removed by plasma cleaning in an oxygen atmosphere for 5 min directly before the use in aerosol deposition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Aerosol Deposition (AD)</title><p id="Par10">Aerosol deposition was performed by using specially designed equipment for ensuring well-defined and reproducible process gas and chamber pressures. The BiVO<sub>4</sub> powder was sprayed via aerosol deposition in the as-received and the differently milled states. Nitrogen was used as common carrier and process gas at gas flows of 10, 20 and 40 l/min, corresponding to process gas pressures of 1.0, 1.3 and 2.1 bar, respectively. The base pressure of the vacuum chamber was kept at about 0.3 mbar. The spraying distance was set to 30 mm and the substrates passed the aerosol gas stream with a traverse speed of 15 mm/s. The substrates were coated with two layers to explore the most suitable parameter regime. In order to ensure homogeneous surface coverage, a De Laval slit nozzle was used with nozzle throat dimensions of 4.0 mm × 0.2 mm. The RBG 1000ISD from Palas GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany was used as powder feeder. The feed rate was adjusted to about 3.8 cm<sup>3</sup>/h. For selected experiments with fine powders, the cyclone types Z1000 and Z500 from Palas GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany were used together in line to remove possible agglomerates from the aerosol. The Z1000 can cut off particles larger than 10 µm and the Z500 cut sizes larger than 5 µm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Powder Size Analyses and Microscopy</title><p id="Par11">The particle size distributions were measured by laser scattering using a LA-910 from Horiba, Kyoto, Japan.

The acceleration voltage was adjusted to 10 kV. The different cross sections were prepared in situ in the HR-SEM by using the focused Ga<sup>+</sup>-ion beam of the Helios G4 UC.</p><p id="Par13">The SEM cross section micrographs were used for measuring the coating thickness by using the analyzing tools of the HR-SEM Helios G4 UC. A minimum of five measurements were performed to determine the mean coating thickness.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Post Treatments for Photoelectrochemical Cell Applications</title><p id="Par14">The as-prepared coatings by aerosol deposition contain a number of nanoscaled defects that act as active centers for electron–hole recombination and thus reduced half-cell activities. To further enhance the electrode performance a dilute solution of Ammonium metatungstate hydrate (Sigma Aldrich) was spin coated on top of the electrodes. The electrodes were then annealed in air for 2 h at 500 °C to reduce the amounts of defects and to form a few tens nanometre thick WO<sub>3</sub> coating on the surface.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Photoelectrochemical Analyses</title><p id="Par15">The photoelectrochemical analyses were performed by using a three-electrode setup in a Zahner PECC-2 cell (Zahner Elektrik GmbH, Kronach, Germany) controlled by a Zahner Zennium Electrochemical Workstation and 0.15 mol citric acid solution (pH7, 0.441 mol NaOH) as the electrolyte. The electrodes were cycled with 25 mV/s under anodic conditions from open circuit potential (OCP) to 1.8 V against the reference of a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). The cyclic analyses were performed under dark conditions and illumination. The sample was illuminated through a quartz glass window (0.503 cm<sup>2</sup>) using a LOT solar simulator (Xe arc lamp, with AM1.5G filter, 1000 W/m<sup>2</sup>, OT Quantum Design, Darmstadt, Germany).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Powder Morphologies and Sizes</title><p id="Par16">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the SEM micrographs of the different BiVO<sub>4</sub> powders prepared for aerosol deposition. The morphology of the as-received powder is more or less equiaxed with rather smooth surfaces, only a few particles showing fracture (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). Some particles are agglomerated. High energy milling results in smaller particle sizes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, c, d, e and f). Already a milling time of 1 min reduces the average particle size by a factor of two from 8.3 to 3.8 µm, resulting in a powder morphology that is more angular and fractured, as is typical for milled ceramic brittle particles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). By increasing the milling time to 10 min, particle sizes are reduced further (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, d and e). Nevertheless, some coarser particles are retained. Enhancing the milling time to 20 min mainly reduces the amount of larger particles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f). The particle size distributions of the different powders used in this study for aerosol deposition are summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.

To some extent, this can be attributed to problems by powder agglomeration during spraying. The milled powders tend to form agglomerates in the aerosol spraying jet or already in the process gas feed line. As reported by Hanft et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>), agglomerates should be loosely bonded to the substrate.

The yellow spots on the left sample correspond to loosely bound coarse agglomerates. The problems with agglomerates can be solved by using the Palas Z1000 and Z500 cyclones in line after powder feeding. According to the literature (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>), agglomerates can reach high kinetic energies upon impact. However, losses in energy attributed to fracture and separation of primary particles are assumed to lead to porous coatings with insufficient quality.

Such is realized by the use of glass substrates that are coated with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) to ensure electrical conductivity in contact to the BiVO<sub>4</sub> layer. In order to avoid losses by electron–hole recombination, coating thickness should be tuned to about 0.5 µm. In addition, the coating should have low porosity, well bonded internal interfaces and a good connection to the substrate in order to avoid ohmic losses and to enable a high half-cell efficiency. These boundary conditions and possible influences of this substrate type on coating build-up call for separate optimization procedures to transfer basic parameter sets to photoelectrochemical cells for hydrogen generation.</p><p id="Par23">Based on the general optimization procedures, the powders with mean particle sizes of 2.1 µm (milled for 2 min) and 0.6 µm (milled for 20 min) were selected for transferring the process to FTO coated glass substrates.

Powders and pressures were selected according to the best results presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The coating thickness is varied by robot traverse speeds and numbers of spray layers. According to Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, powder mean particle sizes of 3.8 µm result in better layer build-up than sizes of 2.1 µm. However, another set of experiments dealing with the kinematic parameters (not shown here) demonstrate, that this powder is probably to coarse for homogeneous layer build-up. For powder sizes of 3.8 µm, obtained coating thicknesses did not correlate to the different parameters like numbers of spray layers or traverse robot speeds. In contrast, such correlations can be derived for using powder sizes of 2.1 µm.

This indicates that fragmentation takes place in aerosol deposition of BiVO<sub>4</sub>, in good agreement with the literature on experimental work that claim size dependent particle fracture and grain refinement as a pre-requisite for bonding (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>). The basic features of aerosol deposition are also supported by simulation results given in the literature. Under the aim to gain a better understanding of the binding phenomena in aerosol deposition, Daneshian et al. performed molecular dynamic (MD) simulations (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>), (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>). Despite the simplified 2-D approach in the model, the simulation results allow to distinguish between (1) rebound events, (2) deformation and bonding as well as (3) particle fracture depending on powder size and velocity during aerosol deposition. They show that particle deformation as well as fracture could contribute to bonding. In line with this view, the critical velocity to reach deformation and bonding may be defined by a threshold to locally exceed sufficiently high degrees of stress and deformation or fracture in the particle interior. The combination of deformation and fracture rather well corresponds to observed results in aerosol deposition of BiVO<sub>4</sub> coatings.

In summary, further work is needed to optimize the spraying process or the pre-treatment of the milled powders to reduce the agglomeration in the aerosol stream and to enhance the coating quality. Nevertheless, the process map for aerosol deposition of BiVO<sub>4</sub>, developed in the present study, might provide a good basis for that.</p><p id="Par29">The gained knowledge using stainless steel substrates could be transferred to other substrate materials. In this study, special focus is given on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses, which are used for applications in back-lit photoelectrochemical cells. First experiments in this work demonstrate that it is possible to coat larger areas of FTO substrates homogeneously by aerosol deposition. A homogeneous coating quality and the required coating thickness of around 200-500 nm is achieved by using well-tuned feed rates and kinematics during deposition. Herein, the results for using FTO glass substrates indicate that the increase in coating thickness not linearly scales with the amount of material deposited onto area units as induced here by slower traverse scan speeds or less layers. In addition, influences from powder sizes and spray parameter sets have to be considered. Thus, the adjustment of a defined coating thickness and quality is more difficult than expected, which could be attributed to effects by deceleration on particle deformation and fracture upon impact, given by impact velocities and response by properties of the present surface to deposit on.</p><p id="Par30">By parameter optimization and guaranteeing the required process stability, aerosol deposition of BiVO<sub>4</sub> could be successfully upscaled for processing uniform anodes for photo-electrochemical hydrogen production. Under herein established parameter sets and procedures, photo current densities of about 3.55 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> are achieved, which are two times higher than those obtained by samples that are processed by aerosol deposition of non-optimized, as-received powder shown by Wolpert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. According to results reported in literature, photo current densities from 1.5 to 2 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> were reached by using thin film techniques such as spray pyrolysis or pulsed layer deposition for layer production (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>). Abdi et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>) and Jang et al.

In comparison to results from literature, the aerosol deposited BiVO<sub>4</sub> coatings of the present study already show a similar photo-electrochemical performance as good layers that were processed by thin film techniques. Nevertheless, aerosol deposited BiVO<sub>4</sub> coatings still have a potential for further improvement, for example by doping or by applying co-catalysts layers, which is currently being under investigation. With such efforts, the quality of BiVO<sub>4</sub> coating could move a step forward toward the theoretical photo current density of BiVO<sub>4</sub> of 7.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> as estimated for test conditions

Based on the systematic variation of milled feedstock powder sizes and process gas pressures, a process map of the necessary conditions for successful BiVO<sub>4</sub> coating formation is derived. On stainless steel substrates, larger powders need higher gas pressures for successful layer deposition. For all feedstock sizes, higher pressures appear to be beneficial for reducing coating porosity. Layer build-up is associated with particle deformation and fracture, which can result in coating thicknesses smaller than the initial particle sizes. Respective procedures for coating optimization are transferable to other substrate materials such as FTO glass. Applying optimum powder sizes and spray conditions in aerosol deposition as well as tuned kinematics, thin semi-transparent and homogenous layers can be processed in larger scales that fulfill the needs in direct sunlight harvesting, e.g., in photoelectrochemical cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors like to thank Charline Wolpert for fruitful discussions and the laboratory staff of the Helmut Schmidt University, Thomas Breckwoldt, Marion Kollmeier, Stefan Meyer, Matthias Schulze and Camilla Schulze for support in experimental work.
