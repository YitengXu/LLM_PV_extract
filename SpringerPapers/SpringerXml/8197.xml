However, recent researches on standing NWs have started to reveal their potential of surpassing these limits when their unique optical property is utilized in novel manners. Here, we present a theoretical guideline for maximizing the conversion efficiency of a single standing NW cell based on a detailed study of its optical absorption mechanism. Under normal incidence, a standing NW behaves as a dielectric resonator antenna and its optical cross-section shows its maximum when the lowest hybrid mode (HE<sub>11δ</sub>) is excited along with the presence of a back-reflector. The promotion of the cell efficiency beyond the planar limits is attributed to two effects: the built-in concentration caused by the enlarged optical cross-section and the shifting of the absorption front resulted from the excited mode profile. By choosing an optimal NW radius to support the HE<sub>11δ</sub> mode within the main absorption spectrum, we demonstrate a relative conversion-efficiency enhancement of 33% above the planar cell limit on the exemplary a-Si solar cells. This work has provided a new basis for designing and analyzing standing NW based solar cells.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>4026</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2014</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep04915.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past decade, semiconductor nanowires (NWs) have been actively investigated as building blocks for third-generation photovoltaics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Their remarkable advantages of reflection-reduction, light-trapping and material-saving have proved critical for achieving high-efficiency solar cells at low cost. Despite all the merits, the existing NW-based solar cells are still restricted by the same fundamental efficiency limits as are the planar devices. These limits originate from the basic processes of solar energy conversion and have been concluded to be beyond the scope of the NW applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The conclusion, however, has been challenged by a few latest researches based on standing NWs. Krogstrup <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> have reported an absorption cross-section ~8 times larger than the geometrical cross-section on a single standing GaAs NW, which may function as a built-in light concentration and increase the open-circuit voltage beyond the planar limit. Another work by Wallentin <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> has indeed demonstrated a higher-than-planar <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> on a sparsely distributed InP NW array, although its origin remains to be determined amongst several different possibilities.</p><p>Clearly, certain properties of the standing NW structure may hold the key to breaking the planar efficiency limits when utilized in novel manners. In the above cases, the Shockley-Queisser limit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> of cell efficiency—a fundamental limit imposed by the detailed balance condition of the cell-sun system—is notably breached by the much enlarged optical cross-section of the standing NWs. This effect has not been proposed on the previously well studied lying NWs because their optical cross-section is only about twice their geometrical ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Another potential of the standing NWs is to resolve the intrinsic current-losses in the defect-rich regions of the cell by utilizing its unique resonant features to shift the absorption front to a more ideal absorber within the cell. If realized, such effect would not only promote the cell efficiency beyond the planar structure limit, but also loosen the constraints on the critical parameters such as the doping concentration and the emitter thickness in cell designs. At present, the biggest obstacle to the quantitative analysis of all these possibilities is the lack of a theoretical description for the light-absorption mechanism within a single standing NW. Compared to the lying NWs, a standing NW is essentially finite in length and its resonant modes cannot be accurately predicted by the previous methods based on infinite-waveguide analogies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p>In this work, we present a detailed investigation on the potential of the single standing NW structure to go beyond the fundamental efficiency limits that confine a planar solar cell. As the core concept, the optical absorption mechanism has been determined by employing the theories of finite-sized dielectric resonator antennas (DRAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, where we find that a single standing NW behaves exactly as a DRA under normal incidence and the enlargement of its optical cross-section strongly depends on the excitation of the lowest hybrid mode (HE<sub>11δ</sub>) due to the optical antenna effect. Based on this knowledge, we quantitatively examined the aforementioned effects for the exemplary a-Si solar cells. First, a <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>-increment of 124 mV is achieved by choosing an optimal NW diameter that supports the strongest HE<sub>11δ</sub> resonant mode within the main absorption spectrum and leads to a maximal built-in concentration of 21-fold. Second, a notable rise in the internal quantum efficiency (IQE)—from 86% of the planar cell to 96% of the standing NW one—is observed when the primary absorption region is shifted to the intrinsic middle layer of the cell. This corresponds to a 3.5-fold reduction in the recombination-induced current-loss and exhibits an inherent tolerance to defects. Finally, a remarkably high conversion efficiency of 17.67% is resulted for the a-Si standing NW cell, showing a 33% relative increase over the planar cell limit. These observations have provided guidelines for designing and analyzing standing NW based solar cells and inspire novel methods in improving the cell efficiency beyond the planar efficiency limits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Open-circuit voltage beyond the planar limit</title><p>The most significant difference between the optical property of a sub-wavelength dielectric particle and that of a macro-scale one is that the former possesses a scattering/absorption cross-section larger than its geometrical one<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In the field of photovoltaics, such phenomenon was first observed and analyzed on lying NWs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, but has recently been demonstrated as even more pronounced on standing NWs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In the latter case, a standing NW has two sub-wavelength dimensions parallel to the wavefront (whereas a lying NW has only one) and thus behaves as a more effective scatterer to light. Its optical cross-sections may extend to several times as large as its geometrical area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, which leads to an effective built-in light concentration.</p><p>In <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(a)</xref>, a schematic drawing illustrates the built-in concentration effect. A standing NW can not only absorb incident light within its geometrical boundary (indicated by straight arrows), but also absorb light further away from its axis (indicated by curved arrows). Thus it equals to a lens with a concentration factor <italic>C</italic> applied to a planar cell. Since the photocurrent density <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> is proportional to the absorption cross-section while the saturation current density <italic>J</italic><sub>0</sub> remains constant, the <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> could be improved by a factor of <italic>nkT</italic>ln<italic>C</italic> according to the formula <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> = (<italic>nkT</italic>/<italic>q</italic>)ln(<italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub>/<italic>J</italic><sub>0</sub>) (where <italic>n</italic> is the diode quality factor, <italic>k</italic> is the Boltzmann constant, <italic>T</italic> is the absolute temperature and <italic>q</italic> is the elemental charge). In <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(b)</xref>, we plot the <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> of a standing NW on a transparent substrate (without a back-reflector) as a function of NW size for different NW morphologies (assuming an IQE of unit, under AM1.5 solar spectrum). The <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> exhibits a significant enhancement over a wide range of NW size, especially for radius <italic>R</italic> ~ 50 nm where a 10 fold increase over the planar absorption limit is observed. The enlarged absorption cross-section comes from the well-known optical antenna effect, where the resonant modes supported by a sub-wavelength structure extend noticeably outside of its geometrical boundary and thus become easily exited by outer light-field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. A more intuitive image is shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(c)</xref>. It shows the Poynting vector in the middle plane normal to the NW axis, with the solid circle indicating the NW geometry and the dashed circle indicating the approximate location where the Poynting vector directs away from the NW. Apparently, external light energy can couple into the leaky modes of the NW even at places several radius away from the NW center, thus leading to an effective built-in concentration.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(a) Schematic 3D drawings of the single standing NW cell (the front and rear contacts are omitted) and the equivalent built-in concentration effect.

For this purpose, we define the absorption efficiency <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> as the ratio of the absorption cross-section and the geometrical cross-section of the NW. In <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(a) and (b)</xref>, <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> is displayed as a function of the NW radius <italic>R</italic> and the incident wavelength λ for a single standing NW on a transparent substrate and on a perfectly reflecting back-reflector, respectively. Several resonance peaks are clearly visible in both cases, dominated by the one with the smallest radius. Compared to the ones analyzed by Cao <italic>et al.</italic> for a lying NW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, the patterns of <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> are similar in shape. However, there are some crucial differences. First, Cao <italic>et al.</italic> employed the Lorentz-Mie scattering formalism, where the NW is treated as an infinitely long cylinder and the absorption efficiency <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> is expressed as the sum of an infinite series. An <italic>n</italic>th-order leaky-mode-resonance (LMR) occurs when the denominator Δ<sub>n</sub> of the <italic>n</italic>th term goes to 0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, <italic>i.e.</italic><disp-formula id="Equ1"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep04915_Equ1_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula id="IEq1"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep04915_IEq1_HTML.jpg"/></inline-formula> and α denotes the incident angle (see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref> for the definition of other parameters). The above equation is equivalent to the one given by Cao <italic>et al.</italic> and determines the LMR peak positions as discrete values of <inline-formula id="IEq2"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep04915_IEq2_HTML.jpg"/></inline-formula> for incident angle 0 &lt; α &lt; <inline-formula id="IEq3"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep04915_IEq3_HTML.jpg"/></inline-formula>. However, for a standing NW where α = <inline-formula id="IEq4"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep04915_IEq4_HTML.jpg"/></inline-formula>, this method predicts the lowest order (<italic>n</italic> = 1) resonance at <inline-formula id="IEq5"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep04915_IEq5_HTML.jpg"/></inline-formula>, which clearly differs from the simulated results or experimental observations. Since the condition Δ<sub>n</sub> = 0 also represents the cutoff frequency of an infinitely long cylindrical dielectric waveguide (which is 0 for the lowest mode HE<sub>11</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, it is most likely that the discrepancy arises from viewing the standing NW as infinitely long. Second, any resonance peak determined by <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (1)</xref> should show up as a straight line through the origin in the <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub>(λ,<italic>R</italic>) plot. While it is roughly true for a lying NW, the peak positions in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(a and (b)</xref>) deviate more notably from this description. Third, a shift in peak position is observed for a standing NW on a back-reflector compared to that on a transparent substrate (for instance, the maximum of <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> is found at λ = 610 nm for a NW with <italic>R</italic> = 50 nm, whereas it shifts to around λ = 630 nm for the same NW radius when a back-reflector is applied), which can hardly be explained quantitatively or even qualitatively under the Lorentz-Mie scattering formalism.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(a) and (b) Absorption efficiency <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> as a function of wavelength λ and radius <italic>R</italic> for NWs on a transparent substrate and on a perfect back-reflector, respectively.

With a finite length, a standing NW is essentially a DRA that supports a series of size-dependent modes by trapping light within its boundaries through internal reflection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For a cylindrical DRA, these modes can be divided into the transverse-electric modes (TE<sub>0<italic>mp</italic> + δ</sub>), the transverse-magnetic modes (TM<sub>0<italic>mp</italic> + δ</sub>) and the hybrid modes (HE<sub><italic>nmp</italic></sub><sub>+ δ</sub>/EH<sub><italic>nmp</italic></sub><sub>+ δ</sub>), where the subscripts <italic>n</italic>, <italic>m</italic> and <italic>p</italic> denote the azimuthal variation of the fields, the order of variation of the field along the radial direction and the order of variation of fields along the z-direction (δ denotes an incomplete period), respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. When illuminated by a plane wave in the axial direction (which carries only an <italic>n</italic> = 1 component), only the <italic>n</italic> = 1 HE modes are effectively excited in the DRA, with the lowest-order one HE<sub>11δ</sub> carrying most of the energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Systematic studies have been done to determine the resonant frequencies of an arbitrary DRA. For a cylindrical one, although a simple analytical equation is not available (like <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (1)</xref>), there are closed-form expressions for the resonant frequencies based on the numerical results of rigorous methods. Mongia <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> have summarized such expressions for the lowest modes that are widely used in the field of DRA, namely (for the HE<sub>11δ</sub> mode) <disp-formula id="Equ2"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep04915_Equ2_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula>where <italic>R</italic> denotes the DRA radius, λ denotes the resonant wavelength, ε<sub>r</sub> denotes the relative permittivity and <italic>L</italic> denotes the DRA length. The resonant condition predicted by <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (2)</xref> is shown as the dashed white line in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(a)</xref>, where we have taken ε<sub>r</sub> = 11.9 (a-Si) and <italic>L</italic> = 500 nm. An excellent agreement is found between the simulated peaks of <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> and the predicted HE<sub>11δ</sub> mode resonance. This is a clear evidence that the absorption of a single standing NW is dominated by the coupling of the incident light into the DRA modes and the NW functions as a most effective antenna (with a highest <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub>) when the incident wavelength matches one of its supported modes and causes a leaky-mode-resonance. The literature has not provided an expression for the second lowest mode HE<sub>12δ</sub> designated in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(a)</xref>, since these higher-order modes are only weakly excited and are less important for antenna applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> (which is consistent with the simulated results: when the HE<sub>11δ</sub> mode is excited, the optical cross-section is enlarged to over 17 times its geometrical cross-section, whereas for the HE<sub>12δ</sub> or higher-order modes, this number is below 5). To further verify the validity of this interpretation, we have compared the simulated results in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref> for a 2.5 μm long standing GaAs NW with the resonant condition given by <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (2)</xref> (where we have taken ε<sub>r</sub> = 13.18 (GaAs), <italic>L</italic> = 2.5 μm). A remarkable match is also found between the HE<sub>11δ</sub> mode and the lowest-branch (left most) resonance in the absorption cross-section (note that this paper presents the absorption cross-section, for which the second branch HE<sub>12δ</sub> dominates in magnitude. When normalized to the geometrical cross-section, the lowest branch HE<sub>11δ</sub> shows the highest <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> and thus the strongest antenna effect, in agreement with our previous discussion). Since their simulated results have been proven by experimental measurements, we believe the DRA model describes the absorption mechanism of a single standing NW quite accurately. It also suggests that the promotion of the open-circuit voltage and the apparent efficiency beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit would be more significant if the NW diameter can be further reduced from ~425 nm to ~250 nm (to match the HE<sub>12δ</sub> mode within the main absorption spectrum) or eventually to ~100 nm (to match the HE<sub>11δ</sub> mode within the main absorption spectrum, which would produce the highest built-in concentration).</p><p>Compared to the Lorentz-Mie scattering formalism, the DRA model not only gives the right prediction of the dominant resonance peak in a standing NW, it also well explains the influence of a back-reflector. When a metallic plane is introduced below a DRA, this new structure is equivalent to an isolated DRA of double the height under the condition that the symmetric plane is an electric wall (<italic>E</italic><sub>z</sub> = 0 on this plane) for the specific mode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This condition is satisfied for all HE modes in a cylindrical DRA, so a standing NW of length <italic>L</italic> on a perfect back-reflector is equivalent to an isolated NW of length 2 <italic>L</italic> under axial illumination (where only the HE modes are excited). In <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(b)</xref>, we have plotted the HE<sub>11δ</sub> mode as a dashed white line by taking ε<sub>r</sub> = 11.9 (a-Si) and <italic>L</italic>' = 2 <italic>L</italic> = 1000 nm. A good agreement is found between the <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> of a 500 nm-long NW on a back-reflector and the HE<sub>11δ</sub> mode of a 1000 nm-long isolated NW, whereas the HE<sub>11δ</sub> mode of a 500 nm-long isolated NW shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(a)</xref> distinctly deviate from the <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> plot in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(b)</xref>. This precise prediction of the peak-shifting in <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> strongly suggests that a standing NW is indeed a DRA that absorbs light energy by coupling the incident light into its DRA modes. A similar phenomenon is also observed for the HE<sub>12δ</sub> mode, although further study is needed to quantitatively prove its origin.</p><p>Another important effect of the back-reflector is revealed by comparing the <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> magnitude in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(a) and (b)</xref>. When the HE<sub>11δ</sub> mode is excited, a NW with a back-reflector shows a <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> of ~35, over twice the value of the same NW on a transparent substrate. More generally, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(b)</xref> exhibits an approximately 2-fold increment in <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> for all NW radius and incident wavelength compared to <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(a)</xref>. This surprisingly high gain in the absorption of a nano-scale device with a back-reflector has been experimentally demonstrated by Kempa <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, where they observed an almost doubled <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> of a coaxial NW when a back-reflector is applied. This phenomenon is quite important for our discussion since the additional 2-fold increment in <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> would lead to a more pronounced built-in concentration effect and a higher <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> above the planar limit. In <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(c)</xref>, we integrate the <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> from <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(a) and (b)</xref> with the AM1.5 solar spectrum and plot the resulting <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> for the case without (solid blue line) and with (solid red line) a back-reflector, respectively (assuming an IQE of unit). Apparently, the back-reflector effectively promotes the absorption in a standing NW, leading to the highest built-in concentration <italic>C</italic> = 21 for a NW of radius <italic>R</italic> = 50 nm, whereas the same NW shows only <italic>C</italic> = 10 on a transparent substrate. The more than doubled built-in concentration suggests a fundamental difference between the way a back-reflector promotes the absorption in a planar cell and the way it does in a NW cell. This is revealed in the inset of <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(c)</xref>, where the absorption enhancement ratio (defined as the ratio of <italic>Q</italic><sub>abs</sub> with and without a back-reflector for a NW cell of <italic>R</italic> = 50 nm and the ratio of <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> with and without a back-reflector for a planar cell) is plotted against the incident wavelength. For a planar cell, the back-reflector promotes the absorption by reflecting the transmitted light back into the cell and prolongs its optical path, thus the promotion can only be seen for longer wavelengths where the material is relatively weak-absorbing, as indicated in the inset of <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(c)</xref>. By sharp contrast, the NW cell benefits from the back-reflector for all wavelengths. This originates from the fact that LMR plays a crucial role in the absorption of a nano-scale device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and the effectiveness of the excitation of such leaky modes strongly depends on the overlap between the source field and the mode field. As evidenced in the above discussion, a standing NW on a back-reflector is equivalent to an isolated NW with double the length. Thus, the leaky modes in this new prolonged antenna have a doubled space-overlap with the external driving field and are more effectively excited. We have given an intuitive illustration in the color images where the amplitude of the radial component of the Poynting vector is plotted for a NW of <italic>R</italic> = 50 nm with and without a back-reflector, respectively. This quantity is a straight-forward measurement of the coupling efficiency and it clearly shows that a NW with a back-reflector is a much more effective antenna.</p><p>So far, we have thoroughly discussed the optical absorption of a single standing NW. We will now determine its influence on the cell's open-circuit voltage. In the following, we will only consider the cases with a back-reflector (corresponding to <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(b)</xref>, or the red solid line in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(c)</xref>), since they generally have higher built-in concentrations. In <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, the hollow triangles show the simulated <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> of a NW cell with varying radius, while the dashed black line shows the <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> of the planar counterpart under the total-absorption condition. The planar cell exhibits a <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> of 882 mV, in close proximity to that of the world-record a-Si solar cell (877 mV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, proving the validity of the simulation models. Compared to the planar limit, the NW cells show substantially higher open-circuit voltages, with a maximum of 1.006 V observed for a NW cell with <italic>R</italic> = 50 nm. The 124 mV increment in <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> clearly proves that a NW cell is capable of operating beyond the Shockley-Queisser limit. To quantitatively relate this enhancement to the built-in concentration effect, we have taken the general formula for concentrated photovoltaics: <italic>V</italic><sub>NW</sub> = <italic>V</italic><sub>planar</sub> + <italic>nkT</italic>ln<italic>C</italic> and plotted three sets of estimated values of <italic>V</italic><sub>NW</sub> for different diode quality factors <italic>n</italic> = 1.3/1.7/2.1, respectively (here <italic>V</italic><sub>NW</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>planar</sub> denote the open-circuit voltages of the NW cell and the planar cell, respectively. And <italic>C</italic> is the concentration factor defined as the ratio of <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> between the NW cell and the planar cell). Apparently, there is a direct correlation between the extent to which the <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> of the NW cell exceeds the planar limit and the logarithm of the built-in concentration <italic>C</italic> and the cell can be viewed as having a quality factor <italic>n</italic> = 1.5 ~ 2 under illumination, quite consistent with the empirical values for a-Si solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Thus, it is evident that the built-in concentration effect of a standing NW promotes its open-circuit voltage beyond the one-sun planar limit in an almost identical way as an external concentrator applied to a planar cell. Finally, we should point out that a higher open-circuit voltage directly translates to a higher energy-conversion efficiency of the NW cells. This extra efficiency finds its origin in the fundamental process of energy-conversion in a solar cell, where the solar radiation is converted in to an electron-hole gas inside the cell with a chemical potential μ given by <disp-formula id="Equ3"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep04915_Equ3_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula>here <italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub>S</sub> and Ω<sub>inc</sub> denote the band gap of the cell material, the temperature of the cell, the temperature of the sun and the receiving solid angle of the solar radiation, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Any macro-scale solar cell without external concentration has an Ω<sub>inc</sub> = Ω<sub>s</sub> = 6.8 × 10<sup>−5</sup> (the solid angle of the sun), resulting in the Shockley-Queisser limit of conversion efficiency. However, a standing NW cell is able to interact with the solar radiation in a solid angle much larger than Ω<sub>s</sub> owing to its optical antenna effect, thus the entropy loss in the energy transfer is suppressed and the cell shows up as a more efficient thermal electronic engine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Simulated <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> versus <italic>R</italic> for NWs on a back-reflector.</p><p>The dashed color curves show the calculated results by using <italic>V</italic><sub>NW</sub> = <italic>V</italic><sub>planar</sub> + <italic>nkT</italic>ln<italic>C</italic>, for <italic>n</italic> = 1.3, 1.7 and 2.1, respectively.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep04915_Fig3_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Carrier-extraction capability beyond the planar limit</title><p>In the above section, we have discussed the distinctively different optical-absorption mechanisms in a planar cell and in a standing NW cell, the latter of which is dominated by the coupling of light into the cell's DRA modes. In this section, we will show that such difference not only results in an elevated chemical potential μ of the electron-hole gas generated within the cell (which translates to a higher <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>), but also leads to a more effective extraction of these photocarriers, embodied by a notable rise in the IQE. To begin with, we briefly go through the carrier-extraction of a solar cell. When an electron-hole pair is excited, they must be diverted to their respective contacts before recombination to contribute to the current. The efficiency of this process is measured by IQE, defined as the ratio of collected carriers and generated carriers. In practice, IQE is less than unit to an extent determined by the cell construct, the optical-absorption profile and the density of states of the material, <italic>etc</italic>. While the last factor can be remedied by improving the quality of the material, there is an inherent difficulty in coordinating the first two factors to achieve an optimal cell performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This is reflected by the fact that the optical-absorption in any macro-scale solar cell submits to an exponential distribution, where most of the photocarriers are generated near the front surface. Nevertheless, the same region often resides the heavily-doped defect-rich emitter, leading to an inevitable recombination loss. Such conflict between the absorption region and the electrical structure accounts for a critical part of current loss in many types of solar cells and puts an extra constraint on cell designs. However, a standing NW cell is not bound by this limit due to its distinct light-absorption mechanism. In this case, the absorption region is primarily defined by the field profile of the excited modes. Thus, it offers an additional degree of freedom in cell designs and can potentially improve the cell efficiency.</p><p>For consistency, we will illustrate this effect based on the cell structure with the highest open-circuit voltage determined in the previous section, namely the <italic>R</italic> = 50 nm NW cell on a back-reflector. We will see later that this choice is well-founded by the simultaneous dependence of both the promotion in <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> and IQE on the excitation of the HE<sub>11δ</sub> mode. In the left part of <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(a)</xref>, the optical-absorption profile under AM1.5 illumination is plotted as color maps for the planar cell and the <italic>R</italic> = 50 nm NW cell on a back-reflector, respectively (the numbers correspond to the carrier-generation rate). The region of the heavily-doped p-type emitter is also labeled by dashed frames in both cases for comparison with the optical profile. Apparently, the absorption in the planar cell exhibits a rapid exponential decay along the Z-minus axis due to the dominant role of the middle-wavelength light in the AM1.5 solar spectrum, for which the a-Si material is quite absorptive. As a result, a large overlap is found between the place of generation of the photocarriers and the region of the heavily-doped emitter, implying a considerable current loss (as will be shown in the following). By contrast, the absorption pattern in the NW cell is distinctively different. Its photocarriers are concentrated around specific locations along the axial direction, with a clear azimuthal symmetry. According to the previous discussion, this is a typical mode profile of the HE<sub>111 + δ</sub> mode excited by λ = 630 nm, where the azimuthal variation of the fields is of the form sinϕ (thus <italic>n</italic> = 1), the radial variation of the fields has one maximum (thus <italic>m</italic> = 1) and the axial variation of the fields has one complete period (thus <italic>p</italic> = 1). Unlike the planar case, the optical profile in the NW cell cannot simply be viewed as a superposition of the respective profiles of different wavelengths weighted to their intensity in the AM1.5 solar spectrum (otherwise we should anticipate a much less characterized optical pattern due to the contribution from the off-resonance wavelengths that dominate in intensity). Instead, the highly characterized HE<sub>11δ</sub> mode profile results predominantly from the optical antenna effect, where the NW responds to the resonant wavelength (λ = 630 nm) with a much larger cross-section than the off-resonance ones and thus exhibits field patterns close to that of a single mode. This is particularly beneficial to the cell designs since it provides us with a simple and effective control over the absorption profile within the cell. Finally, the shifting of the absorption region from the heavily-doped surface layer to the intrinsic middle layer clearly solves the dilemma faced by the planar cell, as is shown in the following.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(a) Carrier generation profile and logarithmic recombination rate within the planar cell and the <italic>R</italic> = 50 nm NW cell on a back-reflector.

We have used the exact same set of electrical parameters in these simulations to reveal the exclusive influence of an altered absorption profile. The resultant IQE (integrated value for the whole AM1.5 spectrum, the same below) rise is remarkable: from 86% for the planar cell to an extremely high value of 96% for the NW cell, which corresponds to a 3.5-fold reduction in recombination-induced current loss. The origin of such enhancement is found by comparing the magnitude of the recombination rate in these two cells. The recombination rate in the heavily-doped emitter is one order of magnitude higher in the planar cell than in the NW cell, despite the fact that the latter carries a current density 20 times higher than the former (due to the built-in concentration). This is a direct embodiment of the ineffectiveness of the planar cell design regarding carrier-extraction. On the other hand, the suppressed recombination in the emitter of the NW cell comes at the expense of a 3 ~ 4 order-of-magnitude increase in the recombination rate in the i-layer, due to both the localized maximums of the electrical field and the optical antenna effect. This, however, proves to have little influence on the overall carrier-extraction of the NW cell since the intrinsic layer is in nature an ideal absorber of light with a negligible base recombination rate. The dominant recombination loss in the NW cell is still attributed to the surface doped layers, as is evident in the figure. It should be noted that there are several regions in the n-doped bottom layer of the NW cell where the optical maximums partly overlap with the doped region so the local recombination rate is relatively high. Nevertheless, the impact of such overlap is limited by the sinusoidal variation of the optical fields along the Z-minus axis in the HE<sub>11δ</sub> mode, where only a small proportion of light energy resides in the surface doped layer, in contrast to the exponential case exhibited by the planar cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>At last, we will give a more general demonstration of the advantage of the standing NW structure in cell designs by comparing the carrier-extraction capability of the planar cell and the NW cell in different parameter ranges. The minority carrier diffusion lengths in the doped layers, <italic>L</italic><sub>n</sub>(electrons) and <italic>L</italic><sub>p</sub>(holes), are critical indicators of the cell performance and are given prior consideration during the fabrication of the a-Si solar cells. We have varied their values from a default <italic>L</italic><sub>n</sub>/<italic>L</italic><sub>p</sub> = 6.3 nm/5.8 nm to a range of 1 nm ~ 600 nm by changing the dopant concentration in the p-layer/n-layer simultaneously (<italic>L</italic><sub>n</sub> and <italic>L</italic><sub>p</sub> are kept proportional and in close values in all cases and only <italic>L</italic><sub>n</sub> is later shown as the variable). In <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(b)</xref>, the IQEs of the planar cell and the NW cell are shown for two distinct regions: (1) <italic>L</italic><sub>n</sub> &gt; <italic>W</italic> (light green); and (2) <italic>L</italic><sub>n</sub> &lt; <italic>W</italic> (light yellow), where <italic>W</italic> is the thickness of the doped layers and has a constant value of 20 nm. This division follows the approximate rule of solar cells that the photocarriers can be effectively collected only when their diffusion lengths are equal to or larger than the respective layer thicknesses. It is apparent from the figure that both the planar structure and the standing NW structure can efficiently extract the photocarriers when the diffusion lengths in the doped layers are sufficiently long (<italic>L</italic><sub>n</sub> &gt; <italic>W</italic>), embodied by IQE values close to unity in the left region. However, such a condition requires an excellent quality of the material and puts a strict constraint on the doping concentrations, which is of limited interest to practice use. The superiority of the standing NW structure lies in the right region where <italic>L</italic><sub>n</sub> &lt; <italic>W</italic>, corresponding to the actual cases where the carrier diffusion lengths within the doped layers are often limited to a few nanometers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In this region, the NW structure is able to maintain a relatively high carrier-collecting efficiency (IQE &gt; 90%) even for diffusion lengths small than 1 nm, while the planar structure suffers dramatically with decreasing <italic>L</italic><sub>n</sub>, showing an IQE of ~75% at <italic>L</italic><sub>n</sub> = 1 nm. Such difference, as is discussed above, has arisen from the fact that the absorption front in the NW cell is shifted from the doped emitter to the intrinsic middle layer when its HE<sub>11δ</sub> DRA mode is excited, which provides the NW cell with inherent tolerance to doping-induced recombination. The congruity between the electrical structure and the absorption profile of the NW cell opens up many new potentials in cell designs: ultra-high doping and much thicker emitters can be used to meet the requirements for a strong built-in electric field or a high-quality contact, the restriction on the deposition technique is loosen and the current loss in the intrinsically defect-rich materials can be suppressed when applied to certain types of heterojunction solar cells, <italic>etc</italic>. Finally, it is intriguing to compare these theoretical results to those of the latest experimental investigations. In the work by Wallentin <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, the EQE of the standing-NW-array InP solar cell is found to sensitively depend on the thickness of the top n-segment, in contrast to our previous findings. As an explanation, they showed by optical simulation that most of the photocarriers are generated near the top of the NWs under the chosen NW dimensions. This discrepancy has most likely arisen from the fact that the NW diameter in their work (180 nm) is too large to support the HE<sub>11δ</sub> mode resonance within the main absorption spectrum. In such a case, the superposition of the optical profiles of the off-resonance wavelengths would lead to a non-characteristic planar-like absorption pattern (as is evidenced by their simulation) and diminishes its advantage in quantum efficiency. It would be helpful to examine the cell performance based on standing NWs with smaller diameters (~100 nm), for which the superior carrier-extraction capability should be clearly demonstrable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The previous sections have assessed two different approaches in efficiency improvement regarding open-circuit voltage and internal quantum efficiency, respectively. The efficiency gain in both cases relies directly on the excitation of the HE<sub>11δ</sub> resonant mode, which indicates that the NW diameter should be chosen according to the resonant condition of the main absorption wavelength in order to achieve maximal conversion efficiency. Experimentally, this choice can be enabled by many techniques such as vapor–liquid–solid (VLS) growth and metal-assisted chemical etching (MACE), which are capable of fabricating NWs with diameters as small as 10 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Also, the use of a back-reflector can further promote the effects. Here in the following, we give an overall comparison between the performance of the planar cell and that of the optimal standing NW cell. The simulated <italic>I</italic>–<italic>V</italic> curves of the planar cell (dark green, under total-absorption condition) and the NW cell (light purple, <italic>R</italic> = 50 nm with a back-reflector) are shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and their cell parameters are listed in the middle chart. The open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current density of the planar cell shows upper limits of 882 mV and 18.84 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, in good accordance with the experimental records for a-Si solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. By comparison, the NW cell shows a <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> 124 mV beyond the planar limit due to the built-in concentration and exhibits an extremely high <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> of 432.7 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> under the combined influence of the built-in concentration and the promoted carrier-extraction efficiency. When calculated with the projected area of the cell (which is the horizontal cross-section of the NW), the apparent efficiency (η<sub>a</sub>) of the NW cell is 364.6%, several times higher than the ray-optics limit. Such a high η<sub>a</sub> shows that the standing NW cell can generate a considerable amount of electric work while occupying a very small footprint, which makes it a perfect choice for nano-scale electric power sources on a chip or for sensor applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Finally and most importantly, the energy conversion efficiency (η<sub>c</sub>, defined as the ratio of the output electric energy and the absorbed photon energy) of the NW cell reaches a high value of 17.67%, showing a 33% relative increase compared to the planar cell limit (13.32%, which is close to the initial efficiency of the record a-Si cell in experiments). This improvement in energy-conversion efficiency is attributed to the fact that the NW cell is able to convert the solar radiation into an electron-hole gas with a higher chemical potential and that it collects these photocarriers more effectively due to the congruity between its electrical structure and optical profile. Therefore, the standing NW structure could be a promising building block for ultrahigh-efficiency solar cells or a platform for high efficiency nano-scale energy sources.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><italic>I</italic>–<italic>V</italic> characteristics and cell parameters of the planar cell and the <italic>R</italic> = 50 nm NW cell on a back-reflector.</p><p>The apparent efficiency η<sub>a</sub> is calculated with the projected area of the NW cell.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep04915_Fig5_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The left part of <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(a)</xref> shows the cell structure of the simulated single a-Si standing NW solar cells.
