The onset of COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the issue in an irreversible manner. Bioplastics produced from renewable sources are a result of lookout for sustainable alternatives. Replacing a ton of synthetic plastics with biobased ones reduces 1.8 tons CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Here, we begin with highlighting the problem statement—Plastic accumulation and its associated negative impacts. Microalgae outperforms plants and microbes, when used to produce bioplastic due to superior growth rate, non-competitive nature to food, and simultaneous wastewater remediation. They have minimal nutrient requirements and less dependency on climatic conditions for cultivation. These are the reasons for current boom in the algal bioplastic market. However, it is still not at par in price with the petroleum-based plastics. A brief market research has been done to better evaluate the current global status and future scope of algal bioplastics. The objective of this review is to propose possible solutions to resolve the challenges in scale up of bioplastic industry. Various bioplastic production technologies have been comprehensively discussed along with their optimization strategies. Overall studies discussed show that in order to make it cost competitive adopting a multi-dimensional approach like algal biorefinery is the best way out. A holistic comparison of any bio-based alternative with its conventional counterpart is imperative to assess its impact upon commercialization. Therefore, the review concludes with the life cycle assessment of bioplastics and measures to improve their inclusivity in a circular economy.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Graphical

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Plastic is an indispensable item in today’s era. Plastic industry is a key contributor toward any country’s economy due to its huge revenue generation and wide array of end products across diverse areas. Population explosion has led to an ever increasing demand for plastic commodities. On an average, an annual demand of 140 million tons of plastic requires 150 million tons of fossil fuel as an input. If this trend continues, estimates are that by 2050, plastic will outweigh all the fish in the sea. Petroleum-based plastics have long been used and offer convenience, versatility, durability and affordability due to well-established processes and mature technology. But they are a threat to the ecosystem as they consequently accumulate in the environment, being non-biodegradable. They are recalcitrant and leach into water bodies to form hazardous chemicals. Their open burning generates more than one gigaton CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Microplastics are becoming a matter of growing concern due to their ubiquitous presence in water, food and air samples as well as inside the human body. They reduce the carbon capture ability of phytoplanktons. About 8 million tons of plastic leak into the oceans annually. This can be alleviated by redesigning packaging materials. Plastic debris in the oceans and seas affect aquatic species through ingestion, entanglement and suffocation, eventually leading to death in many cases (Quero and Luna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2017</xref>). Plastic waste is piling up at an annual rate of 25 × 10<sup>6</sup> tonnes globally, completely jeopardizing the solid waste management system. Hence, it is rightly termed as ‘White pollution,’ and it will not be an exaggeration to say that we live in a plastisphere (Balaji et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). The gravity and urgency of the situation can be well understood by the facts presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Facts highlighting the urgency of switching to bioplastics</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10098_2022_2353_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par4">Many countries have recently banned single-use plastics (SUP) like disposable bottles, straws and polybags. While crude oil prices are at an all time high and our fossil reserves are fast depleting, need of the hour is to look for sustainable and greener alternatives. Extensive research efforts are being carried out in this direction. As a result, biopolymers like Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) and Polylactic acid (PLA) have recently gained popularity. They offer the dual advantage of being biodegradable and at par with the synthetic plastics in mechanical and physical properties. They decompose about 60% or more into CO<sub>2</sub>, water and compost by the surrounding microbes within 3 months, while petrochemical-based plastics take 1000 years for the same (Saratale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2020</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> highlights some of the noticeable pros of bioplastics. Bioplastics can be classified as either biodegradable, bio-based or both. Being biobased means that it has originated from renewable biomass like plants. However, the property of biodegradability is decided by the chemical composition of a polymer and not by its source. Likewise, the time of biodegradation is decided by the environmental factors like temperature and microbial consortium in the vicinity. There are three major classes of bioplastics, (i) Fossil fuels-based plastics but biodegradable. E.g., Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate (PBAT), (ii) Bio based but non-biodegradable (Drop-ins). E.g., Bio-based Polyethylene, Polypropylene, Polyethylene-terepthalate (iii) Bio-based as well as biodegradable plastics. E.g., Polylactic acid (PLA), Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), Polybutylene succinate (PBS) (European Bioplastics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>). This review focuses on bioplastics that are both, biobased and biodegradable.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Advantages of Bioplastics</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10098_2022_2353_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par5">The demand for single use plastics (SUP) skyrocketed as the highly infectious disease COVID-19 hit the globe. This was in lieu of the safety measures and changing patterns in consumer behavior. Personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, gloves, masks, eyewear, face shields, sanitizer bottles were used in huge amounts by frontline workers and general public alike. According to a WHO report, the monthly global usage of gloves, goggles and face masks could roughly be around 76, 1.6 and 89 million, respectively (Chaib <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>). These will dramatically contribute to medical waste and microplastic pollution since they are made of non-biodegradable plastics like polypropylene (PP), polyethylene, polystyrene, polycarbonate and polyacrylonitrile. One surgical mask has 4.5 g of PP while one N-95 has 9 g of it. Moreover, it has been reported that 10-30 W electricity is consumed and 59 g CO<sub>2</sub> is released in the manufacture of one mask (Selvaranjan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2021</xref>). Medical trials and vaccination drives utilized syringes in numbers large enough to circle the globe multiple times, if laid end-to-end. To put things in perspective, generation of global herd immunity would require 800–1000 billion syringes for vaccinating 60% of the world population. Rapid antibody and RT-PCR testing procedure utilize SUP supplies. Sequencing of one suspected sample generates 37.27 g plastic waste. According to the data till August 2020, 15.4 M kg of plastic waste has accumulated due to vigorous COVID-19 testing worldwide. Hence, the pandemic opened up another potential area for bioplastic utilisation. Conversion of PLA resins and filaments into masks and medical equipments like face shield frames by 3-D printing is underway (Patrício Silva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2021</xref>). Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), polylactic acid (PLA), Polyethylene 2,5-furandicarboxylate (PEF) and PEF-co-PLA are fit for use in PPE suits due to their appropriate physiochemical properties. Their use can reduce the negative impact on environmental viability caused by their petrochemical equivalents. However, it would require scalability, capital, safe design, well-structured policies and financial assistance at the government level to be able to do so for visible impact.</p><p id="Par6">Artificial intelligence has offered many innovative solutions to reduce and manage plastic waste. AI technology is optimizing product and packaging designing to reduce the amount of plastics used. Deep neural networks are a reliable and cheap method of predicting structural properties that directly impact a material’s biodegradability. These prediction models can perform millions of computations to give the best potential biopolymer structure. Hence, AI solutions can identify “smarter” plastics that are durable and easily recyclable (Novak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2021</xref>). Satellite imaging and machine learning is being used to detect oceanic plastic patches and clean them. Real-time monitoring of recyclable plastics in mixed waste is helping in faster and accurate sorting. Real-time analysis of ambient operating conditions in composting facilities is possible through wireless Internet of Things (IoT) sensors. Corrective actions can be taken immediately from anywhere if thresholds are breached (Riley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2021</xref>). With the help of nanotechnology, lightweight aluminum and steel have been developed to reduce the dependence on SUP items. Antimicrobial nanomaterial coating on perishable products can reduce the need of plastic packaging.</p><p id="Par7">The objective of the contribution is to provide consolidated information about algal bioplastics and their contribution toward circular economy. Based on literature review, three research questions were formulated: Are algal bioplastics superior to other plant-/animal-derived plastics? What are the recent technological advancements in their production processes? What is the current status of start-ups producing algal bioplastics and what are the challenges they face in scaling up? The review attempts to address these questions and propose possible solutions to the challenges encountered by the bioplastic industry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Sources of bioplastics</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Plants and animals</title><p id="Par8">So far, first and second generation feedstock is being commercially employed for bioplastic production. This includes sugarcane, cassava, lignocellulosic biomass, corn, straw, woodchips, paper, sawdust, vegetable fats and oils, recycled food waste, etc. Naturally processed polysaccharides and proteins like starch, cellulose, gluten, casein, etc., are also turned into bioplastics (Coppola et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2021</xref>). Chemical modification or fermentation of plant or animal-derived lipids and sugars is also performed for bioplastic production (Sudhakar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2021</xref>). The co-products of animal processing like skins, tallows, hides, etc., are a natural, low-cost carbon source for producing biodegradable films and PHA. Being easily available in plentiful amounts, they can remarkably cut down production cost while at the same time put this waste to good use. Animal-derived proteins like gelatin, collagen from broken casings, keratin, etc., are well suited for producing compostable films due to favorable functional properties. However, purity analysis of biopolymer made from feedstock is necessary before use in food or medical industry to rule out the possibility of contamination (Maroušek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">Bioplastic production using algal biomass is still in the infancy stage. Substitutes of agro-crops are being sought after because using them for bioplastic production will raise the following concerns in the long run. First, they will compete with human food and animal feed. It is anticipated that the world will demand 70% more food, fodder and fiber in near future as per the data of Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Microalgae and cyanobacteria surpass this problem. Second, growth of plants requires arable land, expensive fertilizers and large quantities of water. In comparison, microalgae is easily adaptable since it can grow on wastewater resources and remediate them at the same time (Kumar and Bharadvaja <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2021</xref>). They demand minimal energy and nutrient input and contribute to circular and bio-economy. They grow thirty times faster than food crops without requiring much supervision and disease management. In the upcoming decades, urbanization and population rise will spring up the food demand and lessen the agricultural land area which will further intensify the problem. Third, plants need long duration for growth in quantities that are exploitable and profitable on an industrial level (Balaji et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). On the contrary, microalgae possess higher rate of photosynthesis and biomass yield. Some of them double in a matter of 6 h. Last but not the least, cell wall disruption for biopolymer extraction from plants is difficult due to layers of impenetrable, tough cell wall. This requires phytomass to be pre-processed by cellular disintegration, pelletizing and enzymatic hydrolysis in attempt to remove the recalcitrant lignin. It not only complicates the procedure but also incurs additional processing cost of about 140 EUR per kg of theoretically hydrolysable lignin. There is additional energy requirement to provide high pressure and temperature for disintegration. Oil extraction from seeds is another cost-intensive step. Skipping these steps can cut down the cost of production by more than 50% and make bioplastic price competitive. Hence, algae as a raw material emerges as a lucrative choice (Škapa and Vochozka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2019</xref>). Low PHB expression level in plants is also a matter of concern. Genetically manipulating plants by introduction of biosynthesis genes to obtain greater yield is being attempted by many researchers. (Zeller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">Aforementioned are some latest studies where plants have been used as a starting material for bioplastic production. Arikan et al. utilized potato peels to generate potato peel bioplastic that showcased complete biodegradability within a month along with better water absorption in comparison with commercial bioplastics (Bezirhan Arikan and Bilgen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2019</xref>). Starch-based bioplastics have been made from <italic>Manihot utillissima</italic> (cassava) peels using modified PVA and citric acid to improve its mechanical properties. Chong and colleagues made fiber-reinforced bioplastics by putting corn waste to use. Corn starch provided the sachharide part that formed the matrix and the waste functioned as the reinforcement material (Chong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2021</xref>). In an attempt to resolve the large-scale stubble burning and prevent associated pollution, rice straw has been viewed as another potential feed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Microbes</title><p id="Par11">Microbial species are also being investigated for the potential of bioplastic production, in place of terrestrial crops. It has been found that <italic>Alcaligens eutrophus</italic> accumulates as much PHB as 85% of the cell dry weight, while recombinant <italic>E.coli</italic> cells can produce up to 70–90% PHB content. Bacteria like <italic>Azotobacter beijernickii</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas, Micrococcus, Bacillus, Rhodococcus, Ralstonia eutropha</italic> and <italic>Rhdodococcus</italic> produce PHB naturally in response to excess carbon presence and nutrient limited conditions. The extent of production depends on the microbial strain, concentration and type of substrate provided and physiochemical factors like temperature and pH (Singh Saharan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2014</xref>). The prime drawback of using bacterial fermentation for producing biopolymers is costly production, 48% of which is attributed to the carbon source. In order to sustain heterotrophic microbial growth, external aeration and carbon source supply must be ensured which makes the process expensive when compared to conventional polymers. Bioplastic production using autotrophic cyanobacteria is an economically wiser choice since it would significantly reduce the feed costs and the simpler genetic makeup would make genetic engineering for bioplastic accumulation easier. All it requires is sunlight and the cheapest carbon source, CO<sub>2</sub>. It can survive with these minimal requirements under adverse environmental conditions. However, the purification costs for both will be comparable. Efforts are being made in the direction of reducing raw material cost and securing reliable and scalable supply of cheap carbon sources. <italic>Ralstonia eutropha</italic> is an autotrophic bacteria that produces significant amount of PHB, intracellularly, using CO<sub>2</sub>. It has reportedly produced 80% PHB content of dry cell weight (DCW) using animal or plant oils, alcohols, simple sugars and organic acids. <italic>Methylobacterium</italic> uses methanol as carbon substrate to produce PHB at lower price (Priyadarshi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2014</xref>). In a latest study by Saratale et al., <italic>Ralstonia eutropha</italic> (ATCC 17,699) and the most noxious weed, <italic>Eichhornia crassipes,</italic> were exploited for PHB production. PHB accumulation of 73% of DCW and titer of 7.30 g/L were obtained (Saratale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Algae</title><p id="Par12">In an attempt to sustainably produce plastics while simultaneously maintaining an undisturbed supply of food and feed, researchers have explored the marine world and found microalgae to be a promising and viable alternative. Seaweeds are rich in polysachharides like carrageenan, agar and alginate, that are the starting materials for producing bioplastics (Sudhakar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2021</xref>). Algal breeding can be done on industrial effluents and sewage water without stressing existing water reserves for biomass production. Microalgae has excellent capacity to reduce the Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) of wastewater by utilizing and assimilating the organic and inorganic nitrogen (ammonia, nitrate, etc.) and carbon for growth. It also helps in recovering phosphorus in a sustainable and economically feasible manner (Stávková and Maroušek <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021</xref>; Maroušek and Maroušková <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2021</xref>). This gives microalgae an extra edge over other sources used for bioplastic production. It can now comply with zero waste policy and also upcycle existing wastes and residual microalgal biomass into valuable products in biorefineries. PHB production using microalgae will offer maximum societal benefits at reasonable cost and no negative environmental impact as opposed to their petrochemical counterparts (Ansari and Fatma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016</xref>; Coppola et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2021</xref>). Microalgae is one of the main reasons why oceans are the largest CO<sub>2</sub> sink. Yet another reason for algae to be an ideal source of bioplastic production is that they directly capture the atmospheric carbon and trap it into biopolymers. For e.g., <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> soaks the maximum amount of CO<sub>2</sub> and is widely studied for bioplastic production. Algae can capture up to 960 kg of CO<sub>2</sub> per ton (Rahman and Miller <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2017</xref>). There is abundant space available for microalgae since about 3/4th of the earth’s surface is water. Thus, utilizing them for this purpose will convert the waste biomass into a universal commodity and at the same time mitigate climate change (Balaji et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). The small size of microalgal cells facilitates a scalable production since there are no added costs of protein isolation and pre-treatment.</p><p id="Par13">Oil prices, feedstock cost and policy support are decisive factors in the cost-competitiveness of bioplastics. Exchange rate is a crucial indicator of fluctuations in international crude oil prices. Artificial neural network-based models accurately predict the exchange rate and inflation-deflation, which affects the purchasing power of consumers (Vochozka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2020</xref>). From monetary perspective, a study estimates the algal biomass production cost in an open raceway pond to be around 1.7 to 1.9 USD/kg of dry weight (DW) under ideal conditions. Considering inflation adjustments, that amounts to 2.1–2.2 USD/kgDW at present. Here, biomass productivity of 10 g/m<sup>2</sup>/day was assumed for the study period of 300 days In contrast, productivity of 1–4 g/L has been reported in the literature when algae is cultivated in a closed system like a photobioreactor (PBR) (Slade and Bauen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2013</xref>). The production cost of one short ton of dry weight algae in a PBR is around USD 1137. According to a latest research, the cost of producing PLA using cassava starch as a starting material is 2,890 USD/t PLA. However, if cassava root is used, it reduces to 2710 USD/t PLA due to byproduct (gypsum and flour) generation that reduced the net cost. Hence, this clearly indicates that following a holistic and integrated approach can make the process profitable (Wellenreuther et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2022</xref>). Similarly, a recent study reported the production cost of PHA to be 2.2–5.0 euros per kg. When PHB is produced from microalgae, cultivation and harvesting operations constitute 62–72% share in the total cost. (Reichert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020</xref>). Thus, the choice of open cultivation system is preferable on a commercial scale. Algal biorefineries accommodate the high production cost by utilizing the high value products like pigments, produced in multiple product streams. Also, utilizing waste heat and solar energy instead of natural gas can compensate for the energy demands of the production unit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Algae-based bioplastics</title><p id="Par14">Polylactic acid (PLA) is a thermoplast having characteristics equivalent to polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS) and polypropylene (PP) in addition to being biodegradable. It is derived from lactic acid condensation or lactide polymerization where lactic acid is preferably produced by bacterial fermentation due to separate production of its D and L isomers. Its thermal properties and tensile strength are superior to synthetic polymers and it has been investigated for its recyclability. PLA decomposes completely into organic matter, CO<sub>2</sub> and water. Upon hydrolysis or alcoholysis, PLA gets regenerated as lactic acid. It is degraded in an industrial composting facility and does not give off any toxic byproducts upon oxygenation (Plavec et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2020</xref>). Fiber-reinforced PLA composites are a popular choice for green packaging of food products on account of easy fabrication, affordability, non-toxicity, thermal stability, flavor and aroma resistance and heat sealing ability at lower temperature. According to a research, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of PLA are 1600 kg per ton while that of PA, PET and PP are 7150, 4140 and 2740 kg CO<sub>2</sub> per ton. This suggests that PLA production is a closed loop system with lower carbon emissions (Karamanlioglu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">Polyhydroxyalkanoates are a family of 150 types of different biodegradable polymers classified according to the number of monomeric units they possess. Two of the most popular kinds are the short chain PHAs—Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and Poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) PHBHV consisting of 3HB and 3HB-3HV units as monomers, respectively. They are polyesters accumulated in the inclusion bodies in microbes and microalgae as carbon and energy reserve under unfavorable conditions. PHAs are believed to solve the unending issue of plastic litter since they possess inherent thermoplastic properties and mechanical properties similar to petrochemical plastics and are thus referred to as bioplastics. However, their physical properties vary depending on the type and number of monomers they are made up of (Priyadarshi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2014</xref>). Their renewable nature presents them as attractive targets for the plastic industry. They can be produced by fermentation using plant sugars and oils as carbon and energy sources. When exposed to enzymes like PHA hydrolases and depolymerases, secreted by microbes, they get broken down into water and carbon dioxide. The time required for complete decay varies from some weeks (in anaerobic sludge) to years (in sea).

It is majorly composed of 3-hydroxyvalerate (3HV) along with 3-hydroxyhexanoate (3HH) as minor components. It exists as an amorphous fluid intracellularly but becomes crystalline upon extraction. PHB was first discovered by a microbiologist named Lemoigne in <italic>Bacillus megaterium</italic> in 1966 by chloroform extraction. Its tensile strength and thermal properties are similar to synthetic plastics. It is an environment-friendly option and suitable replacement of petroleum-based plastics due to its thermoplastic processibility, hydrophobicity, high degree of crystallinity, optical purity, gas barrier properties and high melting temperature of 175 °C. It can degrade under home-composting conditions unlike other bioplastics that require industrial composting facility. PHB fibers are elastic and hard but have low elongation at break (EAB) which can be improved by blending it with PHBV or polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV) to form a co-polymer, either biologically or chemically (Saratale et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2020</xref>; Kamravamanesh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2018a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">b</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">When microalgae are encountered with nitrogen or phosphorus deficiency, the intracellular accumulation of PHB is favored due to the high NADPH pool.

It occurs with the help of three critical enzymes and involves three PHB precursors. It starts with glucose being converted to two molecules of acetyl CoA via glycolysis. Then, the phaA encoded enzyme, β-Ketothiolase, condenses them into a single molecule of acetoacetyl-coA which is further reduced by NADPH dependent acetoacetyl–coA-reductase (encoded by the gene phaB) to D-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA. Finally, the third enzyme PHA synthase (encoded by the gene phaC) links D-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA molecules via ester bonds to form the biopolymer, Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) (Balaji et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>; García et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2021</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) synthesis pathway from glucose <bold>b</bold> Poly(3-HydroxyButyrate-co-3-HydroxyValerate) synthesis pathway from propionic acid.

Microalgae-PBS mixture was melt blended at 130 °C for 6 min, dried and finally compressed at 130 °C under 10 MPa pressure for 3 min. The resultant bioplastic showed a tensile strength of 25 MPa, melting point of 66.85 °C and was 55% crystalline (Zhu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2017</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Conversion technologies of biomass to bioplastic</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10098_2022_2353_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p><p id="Par27">In solvent casting, additives, polymers and microalgae are mixed in a suitable solvent and cast dried into films. In a study by Fabra et al.

The mixture was compression molded under a pressure of 207 MPa at 130 °C for 4 min to form thermoplastic films having tensile strength of 13.5 MPa with spirulina and elongation % of 2.1 with Nannochloropsis (Fabra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2018</xref>).

It was observed that increasing maleic anhydride concentration improved the morphology from rough to smooth, tensile strength from 31.27 to 4.14 MPa and elongation from 10.86 to 13.00%. Thus, it was evident that compatibilizer made the biocomposite more elastic and homogenous (Dianursanti and Khalis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">Injection molding is a cheap, quick and simply automated process for mass producing materials in various shapes and sizes. The only major challenge is to fully and properly accommodate the melted polymer mix into the micro-nanostructure before it cools and solidifies owing to the high surface area to volume ratio (Maghsoudi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>). Torres et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2015</xref>) combined the biopolymer PBAT with residual microalgae biomass (RMB) through twin extrusion followed by injection molding. The two components were extruded together at 100 rpm while being exposed to a temperature of 100 °C for 2 min. Subsequently, the mixture was injection molded at 30 °C. Biomass plasticization was done with glycerol and urea in the extruder at 100 °C. The resultant biopolymer had a tensile strength of 21 MPa along with 600% elongation. Optimum results were reported with 20% RMB, 30% glycerol and 7.5 (parts per hundred rubber) phr of urea. (Torres et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2015</xref>). Twin screw extrusion is a scalable method to convert bio-derived powders and granules into extruded homogenous plastic products with a good conversion rate. The microalgae additive mixture is directly plasticized at high temperatures with a residence time of few minutes inside the extruder (Maghsoudi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>). It was exploited for producing <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> 11-32A-starch biocomposite with a melting point of 159 °C and water content of 2.34% (Mathiot et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Genetic engineering</title><p id="Par29">Genetic engineering is easy to perform on simple, single-celled phototrophs like microalgae and cyanobacteria due to no cell differentiation as in complex plants.

In the context of bioplastic research, metabolic engineering of algal and cyanobacterial strains has been attempted to introduce PHB production pathways, enhance the PHB yield, produce new PHBs and to utilize cheaper and a variety of substrates to achieve economies of scale. Heterologous transformation of cyanobacteria with PHB synthetic genes (3-ketothiolase, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase and PHB synthase) of R. eutropha has been reported (Balaji et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 is one such cyanobacteria that does not produce PHB indigenously. So, its recombinant strain was produced by transforming it with the above genes. Moreover, PHB productivity was enhanced by the incorporation of a stronger promoter and supplementation of acetate. These <italic>R.eutropha</italic> genes have been transformed into E.coli because of its high growth rate even at risen temperatures and simple cell structure. Due to this, <italic>E.coli</italic> that naturally lacks PHB synthesis ability can produce PHB in bulk which can be purified economically by simple cell lysis methods. Through genetic engineering, it will be possible to make algal bioplastics commercially more feasible by reducing its production cost by use of alternative substrates and new extraction methods (Balaji et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). A merger of genetic engineering and molecular microbiology can assist in better understanding bioplastic properties through analysis of genetic and metabolic blueprints. Recombinant microalgae also exhibit the potential for high PHB accumulation due to their high reproductive capacity, ease of handling and maintenance and rapid growth in simple media (Hempel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011</xref>),</p><p id="Par31">Influence on sugar catabolism also affects PHB accumulation. Osanai et al. in their study overexpressed sigma factor sigE in the control strain (GT) to activate sugar catabolic genes in the recombinant strain GOX50. It was concluded that manipulating carbon metabolism was more effective than heterologous transformation in increasing the PHB yield. Inverse metabolic engineering (IME) is the identification of phenotypes of interest and their encoding genes. This approach was used by Tyo et al. who created a library of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PCC6803 mutants by inserting transposons at particular loci. It was observed that the mutants with ORF sll0461 disruption accumulate higher levels of PHB intracellularly. sll0461 codes for the proA gene that synthesizes a key enzyme of proline biosynthetic pathway- γ-glutamyl phosphate reductase. Proline functions as a protective osmolyte, in the absence of which, stress conditions trigger higher PHB production (Tyo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2009</xref>). There have been studies which found that upregulation of PHA synthase activity was ineffective in increasing the PHA content in transgenic strains. Lau et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2014</xref>), in their study, obtained increased PHA accumulation through upregulation of photosynthetic enzymes and proteins participating in the electron transport chain. The higher production potential of CCsNphT7BCn was linked to overexpression of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCo) which provided efficient supply of essential precursors of PHA production. These high producing strains did not show higher concentration of PHB synthesizing enzymes, indicating that it is not their low levels that limit PHA production. Instead the total carbon flux drives PHA biosynthesis (Lau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2014</xref>). CRISPR-Cas9 system of gene editing can be used in future to overexpress PHB biosynthetic genes. It is already being analyzed in <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> (Kamravamanesh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2018b</xref>).</p><p id="Par32">However, this promising technology comes with drawbacks of its own. Needless to say, any external intervention in the genetic makeup of an organism can make it a potential threat to the environment, when exposed. So these transgenic microalgal or cyanobacterial strains are cultivated indoors under strict control and vigilance and not in outdoor open pond systems. Genetic transformation can boost the intracellular PHB accumulation only up to a certain threshold, above which any more of it is detrimental for the cellular metabolism. If this limit is low in many species, the entire process will go in vain. Wild-type cells show better reproducibility and fitness than transgenic ones. Thus, the screened cells may lose the recombinant gene after a few generations. To overcome this, antibiotics are added to sustain the genetically modified cells under a constant selection pressure. These antibiotics are hazardous for public health (Pulz and Gross <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2004</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Algae species used for bioplastic production</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Microalgae</title><p id="Par33">The successful commercial exploitation of microalgae for bioplastic production requires identification of the most promising and efficient species and taking into consideration the physiochemical factors that affect the production pathways. (García et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2021</xref>). The <italic>Chlorella</italic> species is a freshwater green alga comprising of 51 to 58% protein of the total dry cell weight. Its thick cell wall imparts it better crack resistance and thermal stability than <italic>Spirulina. C. sorokiniana</italic> is widely used in making starch blends because of its high gelatinization temperature of 110 °C. There are many studies on these two microalgae due to their small cell size, which makes them desirable in film and fiber market where particle size is a crucial determinant. In addition, their small size and high protein content make it easier for them to be converted into bioplastic on a large scale, in a cost-effective manner without generating much waste in pre-treatment. They are also well-investigated species for their production methods since they are being utilised for quite some years in the nutraceutical industries. Apart from that, both <italic>Chlorella</italic> and <italic>Spirulina</italic> have the potential to remediate the wastewater they grow in and recycle the CO<sub>2</sub> bubbled into the growth medium in the form of higher biomass productivity. Bioplastics made wholly of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> (CV) are brittle irrespective of the species used, but when plasticized, CV bioplastics exhibit better plastic-like behavior (yielding and initial modulus) than <italic>Spirulina</italic>. It is probable that compatibilized <italic>Chlorella</italic> blends can outperform compatibilized <italic>Spirulina</italic> blends in terms of performance. Hydrogen ions in <italic>Chlorella</italic> allow blends to be produced without any gaps. <italic>Chlorella</italic>-PVA and <italic>Chlorella</italic>-PE composites are used for food packaging purposes. This difference in blending behavior of the two can be explained by their varying amino acid composition (Cinar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>; Zeller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2013</xref>; Dianursanti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Cyanobacteria</title><p id="Par34">Blue green algae are unicellular organisms found in fresh, marine and brackish water. They accumulate the homopolymer of PHB as intracellular granules under stressful environment. They reserve it as a surplus carbon and energy source to be metabolized later under unfavorable conditions. They are a preferred host system due to their ability of photoautotrophy and survival in minimal nutrient supply. They are powerful CO<sub>2</sub> scavengers and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Sharma and Mallick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2005</xref>). By far, 137 cyanobacterial strains from 88 species and 26 different genera have been screened for PHB content. Out of these, 134 strains showed decent PHB concentration under normal conditions, while 63 strains showed extraordinary PHB accumulation, when subjected to nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium deficiency. PHB is a carbon-rich metabolite. So 26% of the total carbon required for its synthesis is fixed when cells are nitrogen starved and pre-grown photoautotrophically. However, 74–87% of it is contributed by intracellular carbon recycling. The time of addition of acetate has significant impact on PHB levels. Acetate supplementation in the beginning along with nitrogen depletion supplies 44–48% of the total carbon required for PHB synthesis, doubling the accumulated PHB amount. In contrast, if it is added in between, it can only supply 34% carbon. So a check on nutritional status during the formation of PHB precursors is vital in obtaining high PHB accumulation in the cytoplasm of cyanobacteria (Dutt and Srivastava <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par35">PHB accumulation was first reported in 1966 in the cyanobacteria <italic>Chlorogloea fritschii</italic> (Kaewbai-ngam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>).

evaluating their entire life cycle based on different impact categories. Impact categories are indicators for LCA quantification and include ecotoxicity, human toxicity, water and land use, eutrophication, acidification potential, global warming potential, ozone depletion potential, etc. Choice of the right impact categories is essential to a meaningful LCA. LCA allows a consumer to weigh the pros and cons of a product and take informed decisions. Different analytical approaches give different outcomes. Cradle to gate (resource acquisition and production), cradle to grave (acquisition, production, use and end of life phase) and gate to grave (use and EOL phase) are three methods of LCA based on system boundaries. Resource acquisition in case of plastics involves oil extraction and refining, while for bioplastics, it involves plant cultivation and associated agrochemical inputs. Out of the these, cradle to grave provides near accurate estimation of results as it takes consumer interaction, disposal and waste management system into consideration (Rosenboom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2022</xref>). The contribution of bioplastics toward a circular economy is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> (European Bioplastics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Role of bioplastics in circular economy</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10098_2022_2353_Fig8_HTML.png" id="MO8"/></fig></p><p id="Par37">Using the ‘distance to target’ approach, a bioplastic and its petrochemical counterpart can be simultaneously compared for their environmental impact. Cradle to gate greenhouse gas emissions for petrochemical based plastics is 1.8–3.55 ton CO<sub>2</sub>/ton, while that for bioplastics is 0.4–1.3 ton CO<sub>2</sub>/ton. In a cradle-to-grave LCA by Moretti et al., it was found that if PLA cups are composted/recycled and produced using renewable electricity, their environmental footprint would be lesser than polypropylene cups even after examining the land use change impact category (Moretti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2021</xref>). Chávez et al. assessed the life cycle of different bioplastics according to their effects on health and environment. This included genetic modification of feedstock, use of agrochemicals during its cultivation, exposure to hazardous additives and solvents during its manufacturing, generation of toxic by-products, water use and energy use efficiency. Based on this, they highlighted the sustainability improvements of biopolymers in comparison with their conventional counterparts and concluded that PHA and PLA are preferable choices over other biopolymers (Álvarez-Chávez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>). Growing of feedstock for bioplastics requires land which leads to changes in land use pattern if plants are used as a feedstock. Pesticides and fertilizers used also negatively impact the acidification and eutrophication impact category. So even a 5% global increase in production of first generation bioplastics would not be sustainable. Microalgae cultivation instead can be done in limited area with water recycling and no competition with food to address this issue (Ita-Nagy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>). Latest reviews regarding LCA of bioplastics have underlined the inadequacy of LCA methodologies, insufficient data availability, biased choice of impact categories and absence of consequential modeling. Bioplastics outperform petroleum based plastic in some impact categories, while in others, the latter are superior. Cradle-to-gate cycle of PHB suggests that it is more beneficial than polypropylene even after considering the large energy and water requirement, eutrophication potential and chemical toxicity. This is because the decrease in global warming potential, ozone depletion potential, and abiotic depletion compensates the increase in other impact categories for bioplastics. Thus, it was successfully concluded in the study by Harding et al. that when compared in overall indices, PHB is more eco-friendly and sustainable than PE and PP (Harding et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par38">End-of-life (EOL) is a key component of LCA<bold>.</bold> Among various options, mechanical recycling has been widely concluded as the most suitable disposal method for bioplastics with least carbon footprint. Anaerobic digestion, landfilling, composting and incineration of 1 kg PLA generate 2.2 kg, 1.6 kg, 1.5 kg and 1.7 kg CO<sub>2</sub> respectively, as opposed to 0.62 kg CO<sub>2</sub> in case of mechanical recycling (Rosenboom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2022</xref>). It is cheaper, compared to chemical recycling, and does not emit obnoxious gases as in incineration. Landfilling causes leachate seepage and uncontrolled methane release upon biodegradation. For effective anaerobic digestion of bioplastics to occur, their degradation time should be within 15–30 days. PHB fulfills this criteria while PVA, PLA and PCL fail to do so (Bátori et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2018</xref>). One major sustainability issue of bioplastics like PLA is that they are not home compostable and require elevated temperature conditions (&gt; 50 °C) of industrial composting unit to degrade quickly and completely. The compostability rate of bioplastic depends on its thickness which is 68 µm and 3000 µm for PBS and PLA, respectively (Reichert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020</xref>). Stepping up bioplastic production would mean land transformation and use of more agrochemicals for cultivation that can translate into negative consequences. PHB and PLA show higher levels of eutrophication, acidification and GHG emissions, respectively, in comparison with some fossil fuel-based plastics. First and second generation bioplastics present major concerns of ecotoxicity, deforestation and soil quality degradation during their production (Rosenboom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2022</xref>). To mitigate these burdens, algae which is viewed as waste can be resourceful when converted into new generation bioplastics.</p><p id="Par39">To assess the sustainability of bioplastic, certain schemes and ranking criteria must be defined. Developing predictive models like BioWin and Biodegradability evaluation and simulation system (BESS) that suggest consumers the best bioplastic based on application and EOL options available are needed (Reichert et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020</xref>). Responsible consumer behavior can go a long way in deciding the success of any eco-friendly product. Improper labeling, lack of knowledge, standards and certifications and information overload are reasons of confusion and ineffective sorting among end users. Moreover, there is no established large-scale sorting facilities for bioplastics due to their limited production. Hence, bioplastics end up in landfills as opposed to the intended EOL treatment route which fails its purpose. Artificial intelligence (AI) and Infrared spectroscopy guided optical sorting at material recovery facilities help to differentiate between visually indistinguishable bioplastics and plastics. AI assists in their application-based segregation of as opposed to composition. However, these are expensive, complex and presently limited (Morris and Hicks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2022</xref>). Improved sustainability can be achieved by optimizing production processes through technological advancements and powering production units utilizing renewable energy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusion and future outlook</title><p id="Par40">The escalating consumer demand for plastic is intensifying the problem of plastic litter. It can only be mitigated by shifting to greener and sustainable alternatives like biodegradable plastic. However, the industrial-scale use of algae and other waste biomass for bioplastic production is still far from real as first and second generation biomass remain as the dominant raw material till date. Bioplastic, rightly called as the ‘Plastics of future,’ has the power to relieve the over-burdened waste management system. But some hurdles need to be overcome, in order to make this platform widely accessible and economically feasible. Extensive research efforts are being carried out in the direction of bioengineering, improved downstream processing and constructing mathematical or network models of PHA production pathways. The most attractive approach in this regard is a microalgal biorefinery that integrates multiple value-added product streams (food, feed, pharma products, biofuel) and wastewater remediation so as to extract maximum benefit from a single batch of biomass. It improves the techno-economics of microalgae cultivation on a commercial level. However, ways to minimize the use of additives in the process need to be further investigated since they render the product unsuitable for application in the medical and food packaging sectors. Various options like nutrient limitation, precursor supplementation and parameter optimization are being explored to get maximum PHB yield from cyanobacteria. In addition, innovative, cheaper and more efficient conversion technologies need to be researched. For instance, PHB purification from microalgae and carbon source are two significant cost drivers in the production process. CRISPR-Cas9 has been recently employed for producing superior strains through genetic engineering and needs further studies to be fully developed. There is a need to put the global plastic challenge into better context by incorporating a holistic life cycle perspective into research efforts. A complete techno-economic analysis would aid in better understanding the larger picture of bioplastics in the vast plastic industry, that are emerging as a promising alternative to their conventional counterparts. LCA of bioplastics is an under-researched area that needs better understanding, when considering the gate to grave approach. Development of bioplastics that degrade under mild conditions effectively can boost their applicability. Economic constraints are a major factor in determining the upscaling of the mentioned current technologies that are successful at the laboratory scale. Conclusively, the current market trend and technology improvisations in the area suggest a bright future for start-ups in the algal bioplastic avenue. It is now only a matter of few years that they will soon hit the market and become a popular choice among people within no time.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Department of Biotechnology, Delhi Technological University for their constant support.
