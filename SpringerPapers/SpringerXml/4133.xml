sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">By far the highest growth and new investment in renewable energy technologies globally are being experienced by the solar sector, and especially photovoltaic (PV) systems that have experienced an average growth rate of close to 24% per year in the past 5 years (2017–2021)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Global PV capacity crossed 700 GW in 2020<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and is estimated to reach ~22 TW in 2050<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, as part of plans to attain a carbon-free power supply by 2050.</p><p id="Par4">PV cells are usually sensitive to a portion of the solar spectrum (e.g. 300–1100 nm for single-junction Si cells), with only 10–25% of the incident solar energy converted into electricity by commercial PV panels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The rest of the electrically unusable solar energy, which accounts for over 70% of the incident energy, dissipates as waste heat in PV cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and results in an increase in their operating temperature. As a consequence, the temperature of PV cells can exceed 65 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> in hot and sunny conditions, leading to a significant decrease in electrical efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The efficiency of most common Si-based PV panels typically decreases by 4.0–6.5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and their ageing rate doubles for every 10 °C increase in operating temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, significant potential to generate additional electricity from the over 700 GW existing PV installations globally is currently lost due to the lack of thermal management, and this loss will worsen as global PV capacity continues its explosive growth. High-efficiency and low-cost thermal management approaches for PV panels are of great significance in this context, as these would allow significantly enhanced power generation of dozens of GW from current global PV installations, and with a potential to mitigate the loss of hundreds of GW in future installations.</p><p id="Par5">Active thermal management methods have proven to be effective at removing heat from PV panels by employing either water or air flows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, however, they usually require heat exchanging structures (e.g. fin structures, metal thermal absorbers, etc.) and/or hydraulic structures (e.g. piping and pumps), which introduces design, installation and operational complexity as well as additional cost, and are associated with parasitic electricity consumption to drive the coolant flows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Passive thermal management methods, the most common of which rely on natural convection cooling, on the other hand, usually have simpler structures but are also limited to lower cooling rates. Another passive thermal management method is based on sub-bandgap reflection, and is capable of cooling Si cells by ~4 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Recently, advanced passive thermal management methods for PV panels have been attracting increased attention. For example, passive radiative thermal management methods employ selectively-emissive coatings in order to emit heat via radiation to the cold outer space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. These methods have a typical cooling power of only 40–140 W/m<sup>2</sup> under a cloudless sky<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, which is lower than the ~200–400 W/m<sup>2</sup> that can be achieved by natural convection, mentioned above. The combination of radiative cooling with the sub-bandgap reflection method can further improve the cooling performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. An impressive passive cooling power of ~300 W/m<sup>2</sup> has been achieved by utilising atmospheric water, decreasing the operating temperature by ~10 °C under 1000 W/m<sup>2</sup> solar irradiance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Despite recent progress, there remains significant room for more efficient thermal management solutions aimed at PV-based systems, with substantial added benefits if this can be done by synergistically utilising the recovered heat for multi-generation purposes, i.e. for delivering one or more additional useful energy vectors, instead of rejecting it to the surroundings. This remains a crucial challenge for existing PV thermal management technologies, but also presents a great opportunity for radically boosting the solar utilisation efficiency of PV-based solar technologies.</p><p id="Par7">Here, we aim to co-generate electricity, heat and clean water from the same pumpless ‘hybrid’ solar collector, while performing thermal management to improve PV electrical performance. This is done by implementing a highly effective thermal management method inspired by the transpiration of plant leaves. Trees are extremely effective in moving water from the soil to a height of tens of (and in some cases more than one hundred) metres for transpiration, in order to keep their leaves always cool and to protect their most important functions, i.e. photosynthesis process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. These natural solutions are particularly promising, as they are capable of maintaining leaf temperatures within a stable range, regardless of the weather<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Transpiration also plays important roles in the water cycle and in freshwater generation in nature, especially in rainforest areas. In this study, we propose a bio-inspired hybrid multi-generation photovoltaic-leaf (PV-leaf) with: (i) a biomimetic transpiration structure, featuring a specific design and materials selection (bamboo fibres and stacked hydrogel cells), to drive water flows passively from a separate water tank to the solar cell without a pump; while (ii) covering the whole area of the cell with water and evaporating the water with high effectiveness within the collector to capture clean water vapour and heat simultaneously with high efficiency in addition to electricity from the same component.</p><p id="Par8">The transpiration performance of the PV-leaf is demonstrated experimentally as being capable of removing 75% (590 W/m<sup>2</sup>) of the heat in the PV cell, significantly decreasing the PV cell’s operating temperature by ~26 °C relative to a standalone PV cell. The PV-leaf is shown to have a capability of passive control, adapting to different ambient temperatures and also a strong compatibility for utilising different working fluids (e.g. water and saline). Importantly, the PV-leaf is capable of synergistically utilising the PV heat to produce additional fresh water and thermal energy, significantly elevating the overall solar utilisation efficiency from 13.2% to 74.5% (~5–6 times that of a standalone PV cell). This paper presents the hybrid multi-generation PV-leaf concept, includes details concerning the design of a proof-of-concept PV-leaf including of the biomimetic transpiration structure, and proceeds to report results from indoor and outdoor tests both for the transpiration performance under various working conditions, and of the multi-generation performance of the PV-leaf for combined electricity, thermal energy and clean water provision. The biomimetic transpiration structure is constructed from affordable, readily-available and environmentally-friendly materials, allowing these systems to be mass manufactured and to compete economically and environmentally with established technologies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>PV-leaf configuration and working principle</title><p id="Par9">As illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, a typical plant leaf structure comprises photosynthetic cells, vascular bundles (veins), sponge cells and stomata, cuticle and epidermis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.

In this design, a biomimetic transpiration (BT) layer is attached to the back of a solar PV cell in order to remove the heat generated in the cell. Natural bamboo fibre bundles are employed to mimic the vascular bundles in transporting and distributing liquid water over the cell’s surface, while hydrogel cells with large specific surface area and excellent water absorption performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> are used to mimic the sponge cells in providing effective evaporation. Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> shows the configuration of the PV-leaf transpiration structure, which comprises a BT layer (~1 mm thick) and a supporting mesh (0.5 mm thick) connected to the underside of a PV cell layer (~150 μm thick) over an effective area of 10 × 10 cm<sup>2</sup>. In the BT layer, around 30 branches of bamboo fibre bundles are homogeneously embedded into the potassium polyacrylate (PAAK) superabsorbent polymer (SAP) hydrogel cells, distributing water over the entire area covered by the BT layer.

This interaction between the operating temperature and transpiration rate allowed for effective control of the PV-leaf temperature and contributed to the stabilisation of this temperature after a short transient. It is of interest to recall that the experiments in this study were conducted in a no-wind laboratory environment, and that the PV-leaf temperature will be expected to further reduce due to convection and the effect of wind speed in an outdoor environment. To gain further insight into the role of different experimental variables (i.e. wind speed, relative humidity, water tank temperature, and thickness of the BT layer), a 3-D model was developed and validated against the experimental results (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Simulation results in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref> show that the PV-leaf temperature can be lower than the ambient temperature when the wind speed is higher than 1.5 m/s. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref> also shows the effects of the relative humidity and of the water tank temperature on the cooling performance of the PV-leaf. The temperature reduction (i.e. temperature difference between the PV-leaf and the standalone PV cell) decreases almost linearly from ~26 °C to 0 °C as the relative humidity increases from 10% to 100%. The temperature of the non-insulated water tank is close to the ambient temperature and has a slight influence on the cooling performance.</p><p id="Par15">Benefiting from the lower PV cell operating temperature relative to a standalone PV cell at otherwise similar conditions, the electrical performance curves of the PV-leaf can be observed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> to shift towards higher values, specifically, with the open-circuit voltage increasing from 0.58 V to 0.63 V, the fill factor increasing from 0.75 to 0.77, and the electrical efficiency increasing from 13.2% to 15.0%, as shown directly in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>.

The PV-leaf was tested at two different ambient temperatures of 24.1 °C and 33.5 °C, so as to investigate the passive control effect of the PV-leaf. The performance of the PV-leaf alongside a reference standalone PV cell at the lower ambient temperature (24.1 °C) is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, where it can be seen that, at these conditions, the standalone PV cell reached 61.0 °C while the PV-leaf was only at 42.5 °C with a transpiration rate of 0.8 L/h/m<sup>2</sup>. When the ambient temperature was increased from 24.1 °C to 33.5 °C, the standalone PV cell temperature increased from 61.0 °C to 68.8 °C, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, i.e. the standalone PV cell temperature increased by 7.8 °C as the ambient temperature increased by 9.4 °C.

The transpiration rate of the PV-leaf increased by 37% (from 0.8 to 1.1 L/h/m<sup>2</sup>) as the ambient temperature increased, providing additional cooling power in the hotter environment.

The salinity effectively decreases from ~3.5% (the saline) to ~0% (the condensed water), as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>. The saline was also dyed to observe the cleaning process visibly.</p><p id="Par33">The conventional PV-thermal desalination system also can cogenerate electricity, thermal energy and clean water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, which typically consists of a hybrid PV-thermal solar collector and a separate desalination module. Comparing to the conventional PV-thermal desalination system, the desalination process of the PV-leaf occurs below the PV cells without the need of separate desalination modules. The passive control and self-pumping capability of the PV-leaf enables it to automatically adjust the water mass flow rate, thus eliminating the need for additional pumps and control units.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par34">We have presented a bio-inspired PV-leaf design that has the potential to address the critical need for the effective thermal management of PV panels, while delivering additional useful outputs of both thermal energy and freshwater. The PV-leaf is free from complicated heat exchangers, membranes, pumps and control systems. Demonstration results showed that the bio-inspired transpiration structure implemented within the PV-leaf can remove ~590 W/m<sup>2</sup> heat from the PV cell under a solar irradiance of 1000 W/m<sup>2</sup>, decreasing the PV cell temperature by ~26 °C and leading to a significant improvement of its electricity output by ~14%. Compared to previous studies on transpiration cooling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, the solution in this work does not require pump, control unit, expensive porous materials, and is able to cool the target surface to a significantly lower temperature, which is suitable for multi-generation applications, as well as applications of thermal management for PV cells. Both indoor and outdoor testing demonstrated that a PV-leaf can passively control its transpiration rate to adapt to different ambient temperatures and solar irradiance. The PV-leaf has shown a strong compatibility for utilising seawater, which is far more abundant than freshwater as its working fluid without significantly compromising its thermal management performance. Similar to tree transpiration, the PV-leaf is able to control the transpiration rate passively in response to changes to its internal conditions and the ambient temperature. Simulation results show that PV-leaf has better transpiration performance in hot and dry climates.</p><p id="Par35">The PV-leaf can also synergistically produce an additional 1.1 L/h/m<sup>2</sup> of freshwater under a solar irradiance of 1000 W/m<sup>2</sup>, while improving the electrical efficiency of the device by ~10% and generating considerable additional useful thermal energy from the heat recovered from the solar cell. Assuming a PV electrical efficiency of 20% and 100 equivalent sunny days in a year, the projected 8.5 TW of installed PV panels in 2050 would produce over 40 billion m<sup>3</sup> of freshwater each year if the panels were to employ a PV-leaf structure, significantly relieving the stress of global water scarcity.</p><p id="Par36">We employed widely-available, low-cost and environmentally-friendly materials and components to fabricate the key components of the PV-leaf, avoiding complex and costly customisation, which assists in ensuring that the additional electricity generation has a value greater than, and that more than compensates for, the cost of additional materials and components. Specifically, the capital cost of the additional transpiration components (hydrogel, fibre bundle, supporting mesh and piping) of the PV-leaf relative to a conventional standalone PV panel is estimated to be ~1.1 $/m<sup>2</sup>, based on available bulk prices (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), which is only ~2% of the price of a commercial PV panel (~55 $/m<sup>2</sup>). The payback time of the additional components is thus less than half a year. Given current predictions for the global PV capacity to reach over 22 TW by 2050, and assuming that 30% of the PV panels have access to water resources as coolant, PV-leaf designs promise to generate an additional ~650 GW of power globally, which is close to the current global PV installed capacity.</p><p id="Par37">As a future perspective beyond the main scope of this work, the PV-leaf concept can be upscaled to larger-scale collectors, beyond which even larger solar plants of a commercial size can be divided into several small areas allocated to separate, interconnected PV-leaves (e.g. see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). We hope that this work can help motivate further studies on commercially relevant PV panel cooling designs, as well as other systems, which may benefit from biomimetic transpiration cooling.</p><p id="Par38">Overall, the high-efficiency and low-cost bio-inspired hybrid PV-leaf shows great promise for significantly increasing the capacity of solar installations, without relying on complicated and expensive heat transfer elements and other components, enabling the potential of simultaneously solving the global challenges of increasing energy demands and freshwater scarcity, and accelerating the race to net-zero.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>PV-leaf fabrication</title><p id="Par39">The BT layer was constructed of PAAK hydrogel cells and bamboo fibre bundles. Commercial PAAK particles were purchased from Wastland. First, 1.0 g PAAK particles were dispersed in 200.0 g of distilled water. The mixture was stirred for 5 min and allowed to stand for 2 h at normal laboratory conditions. The fully swelled hydrogel cells had diameters in the range ~2–5 mm. A 5-mL syringe was used to mill the hydrogel cells from a large size (~2–5 mm) to a smaller size (~0.2 mm). The water evaporation enthalpy of the hydrogel cells was measured by the method described in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. A stainless-steel woven wire mesh was used to support the BT layer. In total, around 30 branches of bamboo fibre bundles with diameters of ~1 mm were fixed uniformly over the surface of the stainless-steel woven wire mesh. The distribution of the fibre branches is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>. The hydrogel cells were then uniformly pasted on the stainless-steel woven wire mesh and wrapped around the fibre bundles. The BT layer had a thickness of ~1 mm and an effective area of 10 × 10 cm<sup>2</sup>, and was attached to the back of the 150-μm-thick monocrystalline silicon solar cell (SunPower). The back surface of the solar cell was coated with ultra-thin (&lt;50 μm thick) electrical insulation and an anti-corrosion coating (3M Scotch 1601) to avoid any impact of corrosion or short circuiting on the PV efficiency. A 0.7-mm-thick high transmittance glass (Schott Borofloat) with 94% transmittance was used to cover the solar cell for protection, and 2-mm-thick aluminium frames were used to clamp the layers together. The effective solar absorption area of the PV-leaf was 10 × 10 cm<sup>2</sup>. The vapour collection chamber (10.5 × 10.5 × 1.5 cm<sup>3</sup>) was made of 3-mm-thick polycarbonate plates. The power of the DC brushless ventilation fan was controlled by a DC power supply.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>PV-leaf indoor test</title><p id="Par40">The root of the fibre brunches was soaked in the covered cup filled with water or saline (3.5%wt) during the tests. The prototypes were tested under 1000 W/m<sup>2</sup> of simulated sunlight in a solar simulator (K. H. Steuernagel Lichttechnik) calibrated by a first-class pyranometer (KIPP &amp; ZONEN-CMP6 with an accuracy of ±0.5%). In order to calculate the PV electrical efficiency, a high-precision source metre (Keithley-2460 with an accuracy of ±0.02%) with <italic>I</italic>–<italic>V</italic> tracing software (TestScriptBuilder) was used to measure <italic>I</italic>–<italic>V</italic> curves. A four-wire connection method was made to eliminate the effects of lead resistance when measuring the electrical performance. The mass loss of the water cup was measured by using a precision balance with a 1-mg resolution (Kern-PNS-600 with an accuracy of 0.001 g). The transpiration rate (i.e. rate of water mass loss) was then calculated using an in-house MATLAB code. Four calibrated T-type thermocouples (T.C. Direct with an accuracy of ±0.5 K) were attached uniformly over the back of the solar cell to measure the solar cell’s temperature. Two calibrated T-type thermocouples and a humidity meter (Habor with an accuracy of ±7%) were installed around the solar collector to measure the ambient temperature and relative humidity around the solar simulator area. The salinity of the saline solution was tested by a refractometer (ATC with an accuracy of ±0.1%). The experiments were conducted in a dedicated indoor solar-testing laboratory fitted with an air-conditioning system, which was operated using a set-point to control both the temperature and humidity at a suitable level for experiments and material storage. We also constructed a thermal insulation box around the solar simulator, which we used to increase the surrounding temperature to over 30 °C when simulating a hot climate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>PV-leaf outdoor test</title><p id="Par41">The outdoor testing platform is located on the roof of the Roderic Hill Building in the South Kensington Campus of Imperial College London (51° 29′ 58.11′′ N 0° 10′ 41.7648′′ W). Both the PV-leaf and standalone PV cell used for benchmarking/comparison purposes were oriented southwards and titled 30°. The methods used for measuring the operating temperature, mass flow rate and humidity were the same as the indoor tests. The solar irradiance was measured by a pyranometer (KIPP &amp; ZONEN-CMP6).
