The provision of electricity to off-grid communities is therefore a long-standing developmental goal. Yet, many off-grid electrification projects neglect mid- and long-term operation and maintenance costs. When this is the case, electricity services are unlikely to be affordable to the communities that are the project’s primary target. Here we show that, compared with diesel-powered electricity generation systems, solar photovoltaic systems are more affordable to no less than 36% of the unelectrified populations in East Asia, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa. We do so by developing geo-referenced estimates of affordability at a high level of resolution (1 km<sup>2</sup>). The analysis illustrates the differences in affordability that may be found at the subnational level, which underscores that electrification investments should be informed by subnational data.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>3226</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2021_Article_82638.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">About 56% of the population of sub-Saharan Africa lacks access to modern forms of energy. The corresponding shares in East and South Asia are 3% and 11%, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. For comparison, whereas the populations of Africa and China are similar in size, Africa’s installed electricity generation capacity is one-tenth of that in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. The economic, social and environmental impacts of this shortage contribute to perpetuating poverty in these regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. For this reason, providing electricity to unelectrified communities has been a long-standing policy priority of national governments, aid donor- and aid recipient-countries, and is an ambition incorporated in the Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations General Assembly. Under Sustainable Development Goal 7 (“ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”), an aspirational target has been set to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Yet, progress in electrification has been slow, and has relied mostly on centralized generation and grid extension, a choice that is not always suitable for scattered rural communities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">To provide electricity to unelectrified communities and meet the expected increase in demand of communities that already have access to electricity, at least 900 gigawatts of new electricity generation capacity will have to be installed over the next 30 years, a tenfold increase relative to current installed capacity across Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, lack of access to modern energy services is concentrated in rural areas, where 80% of the energy-poor live<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Therefore, investments will have to be provided through development aid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and independent power producers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, who are mostly privately capitalized, because the credit ratings of national governments and public utilities in these regions are inadequate for raising the amounts of capital required to finance universal electrification. Such investments can only materialise if the following conditions are met<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>: credible power sector planning is introduced; financial risks are reduced, through the involvement of development-finance institutions and other risk-mitigation measures; and regulatory frameworks are reformed, to make them more conducive to attracting the required investments.</p><p id="Par4">A large share of the communities that currently enjoy access to electricity can afford electricity tariffs (by one estimate, a share as large as 90%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, affordability stagnates at the approximately 25% of the population that lacks access to electricity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. To make electricity affordable to all, potential short- and mid-term investment returns need to be specified for the full range of electrification options and, spatially, across individual communities.</p><p id="Par5">In grid-connected communities in sub-Saharan Africa, insufficient generation capacity and inadequate transmission and distribution infrastructure result in frequent outages. These outages lead to increased use of diesel generators. The differences in energy-system behaviour have become even more evident in the disruptive lockdown associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The lockdown caused carbon emissions to rise in African cities, in sharp contrast to the—temporary—drop in emissions in China, and the improvments in air quality in India’s largest population centres. Europe has also seen major reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide.</p><p id="Par6">The increased use of diesel generators during the lockdown, to keep the economy afloat, brought about a shift in work patterns in many African countries, including Kenya and Nigeria, where many whitecollar employees have been asked to work from home. Although the informal sector represents a large part of the urban economy, and it has been greatly affected by the pandemic, the lack of statistics prevents an analysis of how the lockdown and its implications on electricity generation affected the informal sector. Also, the role of photovoltaic- and diesel- based electricity generation systems as complements to unreliable grids is not documented enough in the literature. In light of this, the analysis reported in this article focuses only in the unelectrified communities.</p><p id="Par7">This study maps unelectrified communities where, measured in terms of current energy expenditure, off-grid electrification powered by renewable energy would be affordable. Solar photovoltaic (PV) off-grid electrification is advantageous from two points of view. First, it reduces maintenance and running costs relative to diesel powered electricity generation, thus making the technology affordable for a larger share of the population in the long term. Second, it reduces emissions of local air pollutants and contributes to mitigating the emissions of global-warming greenhouse gases. For 71 countries, the analysis identifies the unelectrified communities in which solar-powered electricity generation is a feasible option even when competing with low-priced diesel.</p><p id="Par8">In the period between 2007 and 2017, off-grid electricity generation represented only a minor share of total installed capacity, not exceeding 10 megawatts in the countries for which data are available. The only exceptions were Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, and Indonesia. This study argues that, on the grounds outlined above, there is a strong case for expanding solar energy-powered off-grid electrification.</p><p id="Par9">The article contributes to the literature by putting forward an innovative methodology for assessing the affordability of electrification systems. Specifically, the article advances current knowledge in three ways:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par10">Inclusion of ability-to-pay and affordability considerations into the analysis of rural electrification technologies at a highly disaggregated (1 km<sup>2</sup>) resolution never provided before.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11">Development of a robust, geo-referenced approach for identifying locations in which renewable energy-powered electrification systems represent a no-regrets option on all accounts.

Not least, for the various parameters that affect the performance and sustainability of off-grid electricity generation systems, the analysis presented in the article highlights how plausible proxies can be obtained where data are lacking, thus inviting future work in this area. Finally, the article underscores that highly disaggregated geo-referenced estimates are indispensable to make policy and investment decisions in the area of rural electrification.</p></list-item></list></p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Mapping unelectrified populations</title><p>Building on earlier work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, this study focuses on the 71 countries in Africa, East Asia, and South Asia that are home to the vast majority (85%) of unelectrified communities worldwide (“<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>”). It thus provides a nearly-comprehensive assessment of universal electrification.</p><p id="Par15">To analyse and quantify the spatial distribution of the population lacking access to electricity, the study relies on 2014 and 2015 geo-referenced datasets in various formats and spatial resolutions.

Under these conditions, decisions about electrification are likely to be dominated by three factors. First, PV minigrids exhibit higher up-front costs compared with diesel-based minigrids. Second, high population-growth rates result in stronger demand for quick and cheap electrification, relative to the favourable PV conditions. In this reasoning, higher interest rates lead to lower, more widely discounted future operational costs that are associated with the purchase of fuel. Third, the growth in demand for diesel leads to increased diesel prices in the mid term.

communities in which PV minigrids represent a no-regret option purely from the economic perspective. However, comparatively lower costs alone will not necessarily lead to successful electrification interventions. Affordability must also be taken into account.</p><p id="Par33">Electrification programmes incur two types of costs: up-front costs and O&amp;M costs. After an initial period, the latter are borne by the programme beneficiaries. It follows that, if the programme beneficiaries cannot afford these costs, programme objectives will not be achieved. Because universal access to electricity targets the poorest areas in the world, it is imperative that O&amp;M costs be low.</p><p id="Par34">In light of the above, the analysis breaks down cost estimates into two components: up-front costs and O&amp;M costs. It is assumed that the former will be borne by a public entity, such as a national government, an aid agency, or a development bank, and that the latter will be borne by beneficiaries of the electrification programme. It is worth noting that, most often, financial appraisals focus on up-front costs, because discount rates minimize the weight of O&amp;M costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. They do so even if ignoring O&amp;M costs likely results in a system that is underutilized at best. A large number of projects financed by independent power producers are in this situation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par35">Drawing on field data and conservative assumptions about the operating costs of a PV system, it is estimated that the O&amp;M costs associated with PV minigrids represent one-tenth of the total costs of the system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. For diesel-based minigrids, the estimate is that US$0.01 per kWh covers the initial capital cost, accounting for the commercial price and the average lifetime of the 4–15 kw diesel generators. O&amp;M costs account for the rest. This cost component accounts for the diesel consumption associated with the production phase, including the price increase associated with transportation from the distribution hub to the consumption location. In the case of diesel-powered systems, O&amp;M costs are much larger, relative to the cost of PV-based systems.</p><p id="Par36">To assess affordability, the study estimates two parameters: the running costs of electricity and the level of electricity expenditure that households can afford. Estimates of the latter are calculated under the assumption that, provided that the same services are obtained and the overall available expenditure is not exceeded, the choice of fuel is inconsequential to households. This assumption ignores the substitution between energy and other goods purchased by households.</p><p id="Par37">Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows two types of estimates: the cost of electricity, including the share that corresponds to O&amp;M costs, and the potential daily expenditure on electricity of a poor household<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

First, the relevance of considering affordability in contextualizing the options for achieving universal electricity access in poor areas. Indeed, the results of the analysis reveal five clusters of countries in terms of the ratio of potential daily expenditure on electricity to cost, thus reflecting the difference in the expected ability to pay. The closer the modelled costs are to the actual energy expenditures in the rest of the country, the higher the market up-take that can be expected. Second, the differences in O&amp;M costs per household, and in technology between countries. In almost all countries, poor households can afford the daily O&amp;M cost of PV systems, but not the O&amp;M cost of their diesel counterparts.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Modelled electricity generation costs—total and O&amp;M—versus potential daily expenditure on electricity per poor household per day. These cost estimates are calculated under the adverse PV conditions scenario and clustered in five groups, according to the ratio between the potential daily expenditure on electricity and the modelled generation cost (total and O&amp;M). Blue columns show average diesel-based electricity costs per country (O&amp;M costs are presented in light blue), and red columns show average PV electricity generation costs (O&amp;M costs are presented in light red). Rhombus sow the average potential daily expenditure on electricity per country. Group I clusters the countries where this expenditure is greater than the generation cost per day. Stated differently, in these countries electricity is more affordable among poor households. At the other extreme, in Group IV, electricity generation costs per day are at least 50% higher than the potential daily expenditure on electricity. In other words, in these countries poor populations face more difficulty in covering the cost of electricity. If the competing technology is cheaper across all locations within the country, the modelled cost (either PV or diesel) is not shown.</p><p><bold>Source:</bold> Authors' compilation based on the analysis.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2021_82638_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par39">The study uses the phrase “low-hanging fruit” to describe communities that (a) are in areas in which PV constitutes a no-regret investment option, (b) are wealthier than the average in the country, and (c) include unelectrified populations, that is, potential new customers, representing a larger share of the total than the average in the country.

These communities are a no-regret option for PV investors, because PV is the cheapest option, even under unfavourable PV conditions. Together, these areas are home to a large number of people who can afford the electricity tariffs associated with PV minigrids. Investing in PV technologies rather than diesel-based technologies would therefore be justified on two accounts: (a) the O&amp;M costs associated with the electricity generation technology, and (b) health and environmental concerns.</p><p id="Par44">At present, most national investment decisions on electrification are shortsighted. They often put too much weight on up-front costs, even if the magnitude of these costs may eventually render the investment futile. The findings reported here are directly relevant to governments in low-income countries as well as to development agencies and banks. Specifically, the methodology used, which is extensively documented in the methods section, could be used to inform the design of future electrification programmes, especially those targeting rural areas with low purchasing power.</p><p id="Par45">Investing in PV minigrids in communities where the technology represents a no-regrets option could serve two purposes. First, these communities would be provided with affordable and sustainable electricity. Second, such an investment could help turn the tide on the investment-decision paradigms sketched above. Ultimately, the findings reported in this article suggest that investments in electrification led both by the public sector and by independent power producers will generate suboptimal results if they are framed around decision criteria that neglect O&amp;M costs as well as health and environmental concerns. As more granular consumption data become available, this methodology can be used to study the issue of affordability at higher spatial resolutions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Geographical coverage</title><p id="Par46">The geographic coverage of the study is the area of the 71 countries depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">4</xref> in the main text. The roles of these countries in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 7 vary substantially. Official databases on access to electricity globally show important discrepancies. The difference between 2014 estimates of electricity acces by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the World Bank is approximately 200 million people worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.The IEA’s higher estimates are based on utility connections, while the World Bank’s estimates are based on household surveys.</p><p id="Par47">The Global Tracking Framework, an intergovernmental effort aimed at tracking progress with three energy sector-related goals, including access to electricity, identifies 20 “high impact countries” in light of their current low rates of electricity access and large populations.

First, Burundi, Cameroon, the Philippines, Zambia, and Zimbabwe were added because the unelectrified population in these countries is estimated at over 9 million people. Second, Indonesia and Pakistan were added because of the large discrepancy in the estimates of unelectrified population by the IEA and the World Bank. Concerning Pakistan, the World Bank reports an electricity access rate of 97.5%, while the IEA reports 72.5%. Regarding Indonesia, the respective estimates are 97.0% and 84.0%.

First, the favourable PV conditions that are consistent with the first pathway among the shared socioeconomic pathways, labelled SSP1. In this pathway, the future shifts strongly towards environmental protection and sustainable resource use. For this scenario, national retail diesel prices of 2012 are considered representative of the first half of the decade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. During this period, diesel prices were stable at a high level and reached the highest value of 2010–2020 in February 2012. National-level taxes and subsidies are included in national diesel prices (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S.2</xref>).</p><p id="Par51">The adverse conditions for PV systems are consistent with SSP3 or the regional rivalry–fragmentation SSP. In this case, regionalization wins out over globalization; current high-fertility countries experience high population-growth rates, and oil-price volatility becomes the norm. To replicate this second set of conditions, it is assumed that investment decisions are based on low-cost diesel. The lowest oil prices in 2010–2020 were recorded in the second quarter of 2020 because of the drop in demand caused by the lockdowns associated with the COVID-19 emergency and the price war between the Russian Federation and Saudi Arabia. Oil prices showed remarkable volatility, ranging between US$20 and US$40 per barrel (an average of US$30 per barrel). The low prices were only recorded in January and February 2016, when the price of Brent fell to around US$29 per barrel. Because retail fuel prices in the second quarter of 2020 were not available at the time of the analysis, country values of February 2016<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> have been selected as input to recreate the adverse scenario.</p><p id="Par52">If accelerated policy ambitions drive electrification-technology decisions in the near future, the prevailing financial project appraisal will make the high up-front investment option (the PV minigrid) more expensive because the higher interest rate will discount the future fuel cost. That decision, together with high population growth rates, makes diesel the most competitive alternative for more and more communities. However, higher demand would lead to an increase in diesel prices, and all initial investments would then have been locked in on unsustainable resources. For the rising diesel prices, the national retail diesel prices of 2012 have been used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Cost calculation</title><p id="Par53">Location-specific estimates of the cost of electricity from PV minigrids and from diesel generators were calculated following the methodology described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par54">To calculate the levelized cost of electricity (US$ per kWh) for PV minigrids, it was assumed that two-thirds of the electricity are consumed during daytime (for the load profile, consult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>).

This number marks the threshold between Tier 3 and Tier 4 as defined by the Global Tracking Framework of the multitier matrix for measuring access to household electricity consumption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. This consumption level allows for general lighting, televisions, fans (as relevant), and any medium- to high-power appliances. In order to check the effect of different load profile, costs were calculated for a high night consumption profile (instead of a profile defined by two-thirds of the consumption occurring during daytime). The results of this sensitivity analysis are conclusive: costs increase by less than 10% in almost 80% of the area under study. In more than 90% of the locations, the difference in cost between low and high night-time consumption is less than 0.02 US$.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Affordability among poor unelectrified households</title><p id="Par79">To address the question of affordability, estimates are required, first, on the running costs of electricity and, second, on the amount of money that households can spend.</p><p id="Par80">For the latter, the study relied on the Global Consumption Database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, which is a freely accessible database on household consumption patterns in developing countries. Started in 2007, the database is updated periodically and currently covers 92 developing countries. The data are drawn from national household surveys, which collect information for a group of households representative of the entire country. The available data refer to 2010, and, although one may not assume that consumption has not changed more recently, this is the only dataset with worldwide coverage on household consumption.</p><p id="Par81">For each of the 92 countries covered, the market is segmented into four groups: the lowest consumption segment (the bottom half of the global distribution), the low-consumption segment (51th–75th percentiles), the middle consumption segment (76th–90th percentiles), and the highest consumption segment (to the 91st percentile and above). Some of the expenditure values in the Global Consumption Database are comparatively low. According to the data, the 4.5 billion low-income people in developing countries collectively spend more than US$5 trillion a year, more than the middle and higher consumption segments combined. The literature often states that households in developing countries spend a relatively high proportion of their disposable incomes on fuel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In fact, according to the Global Consumption Database, the lower consumption segments spend significantly more than the middle and higher segments combined on energy and, especially, on food and beverages.</p><p id="Par82">Because households actually spend their money on all types of fuels, it seems sensible to assume that they can afford to spend a share of their income on a particular fuel, as long as this fuel provides at least the same quality of service. This assumption ignores the substitution between energy and other goods purchased by households. Further exploration about the affordability definition is beyond the scope of this study. The present study focuses on the affordability of electricity use, rather than on the affordability of access (for example, the costs of connections), which would merit a separate effort. The affordability of use is usually approached by quantifying the share of household income allocated to energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par83">The analysis first examined Global Consumption Database data on household energy and electricity expenditures in the countries under study. Of the 71 countries, data for 49 countries are available. For the missing countries, the values reported on comparable countries are used on a case-by-base basis. Yearly expenditure data on electricity and energy (in millions of purchasing power parity U.S. dollars) for higher and lower segments and the population per country in each segment were obtained from the database. These data and data on household size were used to derive the yearly expenditure on electricity and energy per poor household, at the national level. These values show great variability. With US$11 spent on energy per year, the Comoros and Tanzania present the minimum values, while Pakistan, at US$420 per year, shows the maximum. In electricity, Togo and Liberia, at US$0.00 and US$0.23 per year are at the bottom, while Djibouti, at US$220 per year, shows the highest value. Understanding the variations not only between countries, but also within countries and the relation between increased energy spending and willingness to pay should be the object of dedicated studies. The literature on energy poverty in developing countries has not contributed sufficiently to knowledge on the factors associated with variations in energy spending<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The analysis that underlies this study has relied on the robustness of the methods used in the Global Consumption Database.</p><p id="Par84">With regard to potential daily expenditures on electricity, the 80% of the current total expenditure on energy by the poor is used (for country values, refer to Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S.3</xref>). This represents the vast majority, if not the totality, of the unelectrified population in the countries under study. In sub-Saharan Africa in 2010, the same year as the year of the consumption data, the electricity access rate was 33.5%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, electricity consumption does not provide an appropriate measure of the available purchasing power of households.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Dr. Katalin Bodis and the GHSL team (EC JRC.E.1) for their valuable contributions at the beginning of the project and EC DG INTPA.F.1 for their continuous support to the JRC Africa clean energy access activities.
