Many current implementations use materials with bandgaps too small to achieve maximum efficiency or use cost-prohibitive substrates. Here we demonstrate a material system for intermediate band solar cells using InGaN/GaN quantum-dot-in-nanowire heterostructures grown directly on silicon to provide a lower cost, large-bandgap intermediate band solar cell platform. We demonstrate sequential two-photon current generation with sub-bandgap photons, the hallmark of intermediate band solar cell operation, through vertically stacked quantum dots in the nanowires. Near-infrared light biasing with an 850 nm laser intensity up to 200 W/cm<sup>2</sup> increases the photocurrent above and below the bandgap by up to 19% at 78 K, and 44% at room temperature.

Using III-nitride materials in a nanowire geometry, devices are developed for use as light emitting diodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, high electron-mobility transistors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, photodetectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, lasers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In the case of solar cells, attaining high efficiency at a reasonable cost is crucial for a viable platform. With traditional silicon-based solar cells achieving efficiencies of just over 26%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, they are approaching their fundamental limiting efficiency of around 32%. While traditional solar cells are subject to the Shockley–Queisser limit<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, intermediate band solar cell (IBSC) concepts increase both current and voltage while still using a single junction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Such designs enable the harvesting of energy from sub-bandgap photons through intermediate states deep inside the semiconductor bandgap that act as steppingstones for photogenerated carriers to reach the conduction band while operating at the higher voltage associated with the large bandgap. IBSCs have the potential to reach ultrahigh efficiencies in excess of 45% (and over 60% with concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>), equivalent to a triple-junction solar cell, without the materials, tunnel junctions, number of layers, and cost associated with multijunction solar cells.</p><p id="Par4">The formation of an intermediate band has been pursued using highly mismatched alloys, quantum dot systems and hyperdoping, as outlined in a review by Okada et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> A common route to produce IBSCs is through InAs (0.35 eV) quantum-dot arrays in GaAs (1.4 eV) using established growth processes of the InAs/GaAs quantum-dot system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. While InAs/GaAs quantum dots have proven useful for tuning the bandgap of individual subcells in the regime of thermionic carrier escape in multijunction solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, as IBSC candidates they have sub-optimal theoretical power conversion efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and suffer from losses through carrier escape out of the quantum dots at room temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Ideally, with a 6000 K black body spectrum, the optimal bandgaps for an IBSC should be 1.95 eV and 0.7 eV under full concentration, and 2.4 eV and 0.9 eV under 1-sun illumination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>; these high bandgaps are unavailable with most III–V semiconductors. The InGaN/GaN material system supports the ideal bandgap combinations for intermediate band operation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, has a strong absorption coefficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and also benefits from some commercial maturity from light emitting diode technology. The bandgap of InGaN alloys ranges from 3.4 to 0.7 eV, spanning the solar spectrum and the ideal intermediate band transition energies between bands. InGaN quantum dots in planar GaN on AlN/sapphire substrates have previously demonstrated the sequential two-photon subgap absorption that is the hallmark of intermediate band activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">We improve on those results by using InGaN quantum dots inside GaN nanowires on silicon substrates, showing strongly increased sequential two-photon carrier generation while using an inexpensive substrate and higher-indium compositions. The nanowire growth mode removes the need for a lattice-matched substrate and supports vertical stacking of multiple quantum dots without the formation of extended defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In such a platform, IBSC designs would support higher efficiencies and superior light trapping while retaining the cost advantages of silicon substrates. We demonstrate that the sequential 2-photon subgap photoresponse in our nanowires on silicon is non-thermionic and is significantly stronger than found with ZnTe:O<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, InAs/GaAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, GaAs:N<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and even previous InGaN/GaN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. We show that this sequential two-photon photocurrent at room temperature is non-thermionic and that with light bias, the solar cells exhibit a 44% increase in photocurrent at room temperature, and a 19% increase in subgap photocurrent at 78 K.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Figure of merit</title><p id="Par6">A necessary condition for an efficient IBSC is for the intermediate band absorber material to have a high figure of merit <italic>v</italic> = <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub><italic>μτα</italic><sup>2</sup>/<italic>q</italic>, where <italic>α</italic> is the sub-bandgap absorption coefficient, <italic>μ</italic> is the carrier mobility, <italic>τ</italic> is the carrier lifetime, <italic>E</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub> is the bandgap, and <italic>q</italic> is the elementary charge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The figure of merit captures the trade-off between increased sub-bandgap absorption and increased carrier recombination due to the introduction of an intermediate band. While an accurate determination of the electron figure of merit requires knowledge of the largely unknown intermediate band to conduction band absorption cross-section, we expect the hole figure of merit for InGaN/GaN systems to be relatively high as a result of the strong bulk material interband absorption (&gt;5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup>) and large interband transition energies (&gt;2 eV), despite short nonradiative carrier lifetimes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> (~1 ns) and low hole mobilities (~10 cm<sup>2</sup>V<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Nanowire design and geometry</title><p id="Par7">A dense, random ensemble of c-plane nitrogen-face GaN nanowires, each containing ten InGaN quantum dots, was grown by molecular beam epitaxy directly on a silicon substrate, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–c</xref>. The indium composition in the quantum dots varies, ranging up to ~40% with variation between and within nanowires. In the nanowires, the quantum-dot states are inherently decoupled from the conduction and valence band states as a result of strong carrier confinement in the dots. This decoupling of the quantum-dot region is provided by 3 nm barriers of GaN between dots, as shown in the band diagram in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>. The quantum dots have diameters of about 40 nm and heights of 3 nm. Transmission electron microscopy and growth details of such nanowires have been previously described with the quantum-dot indium composition studied in great detail<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

An electrical bias of 4 V is chosen to produce significant current in forward bias through the solar cell, for operation as a light emitting diode. The radiative recombination inside the quantum dots allows determination of the transition energies between the confined electron and hole quantum-dot states. Increasing the bias voltage introduces a blueshift of the output spectrum a shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>. Electroluminescence spectroscopy at 4 V bias reveals broad emission from the quantum dots from about 550–750 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), indicating a broad distribution of quantum-dot state energies. With reduced temperatures, the electroluminescence reaches a peak at around 200 K at 670 nm. The increase in luminescence with temperature down to 200 K is attributed to the reduction in phonon-assisted recombination of carriers inside the quantum dots nanowires. The decrease in electroluminescence below 200 K is a result of the high magnesium dopant activation energy (~0.15 eV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> which decreases the <italic>p</italic>-type dopant activation. The electroluminescence spectrum from the nanowire solar cells depends on the indium composition, geometries and dimensions of the quantum dots. The peak of the electroluminescence spectrum is consistent with the radiative recombination from multiple intermediate levels to the valence band. The broad electroluminescence spectral feature indicates that indium composition fractions can be over 40%, corresponding to an effective bulk InGaN bandgap of ~2 eV.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Optoelectronic characterization and simulation.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Electroluminescence (EL) spectra as a function of temperature with corresponding slices through the center wavelength and temperature of maximized signal. <bold>b</bold> Current-voltage characteristics as a function of AM1.5D illumination up to 16 suns concentration. <bold>c</bold> Simulated absorptance for the valence band to intermediate band transition as a function of incident photon wavelength and number of dots.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43246_2020_54_Fig2_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">Illuminated current-voltage characteristics are measured as a function of illumination intensity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

Under AM1.5D illumination, the solar cells show a high ideality factor at low illumination conditions prior to decreasing under stronger illumination. This effect may be attributed to a change in recombination from electron- and hole-limiting at low illumination to being only hole-limited at higher injection conditions, due to the effective mass disparity between the two carrier types.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Simulated maximum absorptance</title><p id="Par10">We anticipated the quantum efficiency of these devices to be limited by the quantum-dot sub-bandgap absorption. We constructed a drift-diffusion model of an InGaN/GaN quantum-well device to estimate an upper limit to the sub-bandgap absorptance from the quantum-dot region with ideal miniband transport (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), detailed in Sec. 6 of the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information</xref>. This model contrasts with our decoupled dots in the fabricated nanowires, which likely exhibit less effective carrier collection than the miniband model. Nevertheless, the model estimates the effects of incomplete absorption on our device performance. The large diameter of the quantum dots leads to a quantum-well-like density of states in the quantum dots. The simulated absorptance for a quantum-dot device is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>. The model treats InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells with the same thicknesses as the experimental dots; the 10-layer configuration corresponds most closely to our experimental devices.</p><p id="Par11">The simulated device absorbs 20–30% of the incident light at wavelengths from 500 to 620 nm. Full devices will require nearly 50–100 quantum dots or light trapping enhancements to achieve sufficient absorption. We estimate an effective bulk absorption coefficient for the valence band to intermediate band process from the slope of the absorptance vs. number of quantum dots in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, giving a value of approximately 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup> in a broad range from 500–600 nm.

While the tunable beam can drive both valence band to intermediate band and intermediate band to conduction band transitions, the light bias can only excite the intermediate band to conduction band transitions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). In order to be sensitive to the valence band to intermediate band transition, we use a strong light bias, sufficient to promote most carriers in the intermediate band to the conduction band. The experiment is designed to be limited by the valence band to intermediate band absorption process, which requires weak monochromatic, tunable beam at wavelengths less than 600 nm. The infrared bias photons can only be absorbed if intermediate band states are populated after prior absorption of shorter wavelength light. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, the short-circuit quantum efficiency is maximized at 370 nm, then gradually decreases, yet persists, at wavelengths longer than the GaN bandgap even without the light bias. We identify two possibilities for this last effect. The first possibility is the production of a two-photon photocurrent by a single monochromatic beam. The second possibility is current arising from leakage via defect or surface states in a single-photon absorption process. We observe that the photocurrent increases linearly with tunable beam intensity, and therefore deem a two-photon photocurrent process to be unlikely without light bias. The low tunable beam intensity rules out both a significant Auger excitation process and a photofilled intermediate band limiting two-photon process. The subgap photocurrent without light bias is therefore attributed to single-photon absorption leakage pathways. A similar subgap photocurrent is also observed in InGaN quantum-well intermediate solar cells on sapphire.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> With a strong light bias, the photocurrent increases by 44% and 19% at room temperature and 78 K, respectively. At 78 K, this photocurrent increase is predominantly sub-bandgap. Previous observations of sequential two-photon absorption have seen a two-photon signal that is orders of magnitude smaller than the one-photon subgap signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

These electrons in the intermediate band are then excited to the conduction band by the strong bias light. Without the bias light, many of those electrons fall back to the valence band before they can be promoted to the conduction band. With a strong light bias, the total possible photocurrent gain is limited by the valence band to intermediate band absorption, by construction of this experiment. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> shows that shorter wavelengths have a much higher contribution to the subgap photocurrent with and without the light bias, which we expect for two reasons. Firstly, the absorption is stronger at short wavelengths. Secondly, their absorption occurs near the top of the device. The much higher electron mobility over the hole mobility causes carrier extraction to be significantly more effective near the top of the nanowire where the holes have higher collection efficiency. At room temperature, the light bias induces a strong photocurrent increase at room temperature below 375 nm that does not appear at 78 K. We do not expect the light bias to improve carrier collection for above-gap photons, so the results at 78 K match expectations while the improvement at 295 K is more surprising and is not fully understood, though a similar effect was seen in the other InGaN system studied in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, at room temperature.

The wavelength dependent quantum efficiency as at various temperatures is shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6b</xref>.</p><p id="Par14">We expect that most of the sequential two-photon photocurrent originates in the top few dots in an uncoupled dot system. A future device can benefit from modulation doping in the quantum-dot region to improve hole transport through the quantum dots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Alternatively, reducing the barrier thicknesses to promote miniband conduction through the multiple quantum-dot region can also lead to a more homogenous population of carriers in the intermediate band.</p><p id="Par15">We attribute the sub-bandgap photocurrent increase by the light bias to two-step photon absorption but must rule out alternative mechanisms of tunneling and thermionic emission from dot states. We expect a negligible contribution from tunneling since the higher-indium-fraction dots that contribute to the subgap photocurrent have conduction band states approximately 0.9 eV below the conduction band of GaN, leading to negligible tunneling through the 3 nm GaN barriers. The quantum-dot <italic>k.p</italic> calculations accounting for the strain and piezoelectric effects in the quantum dots, incorporating indium diffusion, are described in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Simulations</xref>. To assess the thermionic contribution, we measured the change in photocurrent from wavelengths longer than 370 nm as a function of temperature (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>), with the photocurrent calculated from the quantum efficiency measurements. The photocurrent is calculated for the AM1.5D spectrum, which is representative of concentrated sunlight. A solar cell driven by thermionic escape would show an increasing subgap photocurrent with temperature. In contrast, we see the sub-bandgap photocurrent decrease with temperature at temperatures above 200 K. We therefore exclude sample heating from the bias as the origin of the increased external quantum efficiency signal from light biasing. The decrease in photocurrent below 150 K is consistent with Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, which shows <italic>p</italic>-type carrier freeze-out effects. Calculations in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Simulations</xref> also show that thermionic escape processes are negligible at the temperature range used in the experiments. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6a</xref> shows a similar non-thermionic increase in quantum efficiency with a ~0.1 W/cm<sup>2</sup> red (635 nm) light bias at room temperature, where no appreciable heating to the cell is possible.</p><p id="Par16">Varying the light-bias intensity gives confirmation that the bias is sufficiently strong to make the valence band to intermediate band transition limit the photocurrent. Separate quantum efficiency measurements were performed at room temperature outside the cryostat, as a function of light-bias intensity. The short-circuit current extracted from these quantum efficiency measurements is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>. With increasing light bias applied up to 200 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, the sub-bandgap quantum efficiency increases by 44% to 114 µA/cm<sup>2</sup>, for a total of 77% of the photocurrent being produced from below the bandgap of the host material. The photocurrent in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref> increases only logarithmically with intensity at the higher intensities, which is consistent with the two-photon process being limited by the valence band to intermediate band absorption, as designed. At light-bias intensities of 200 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, the number of bias photons that arrive within the estimated 1 ns hole lifetime is on the order of 100 per nanowire.</p><p id="Par17">Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> also shows single-photon photocurrent without light bias below the bandgap, as in other intermediate band systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This subgap photocurrent is undesirable for IBSC operation, and future devices will need better barriers to ensure carriers are not directly collected from even the first quantum dot.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par18">To realize efficient IBSCs, the absorption in the quantum dots must be increased through light trapping and/or adding more quantum dots. Light trapping is the preferable option due to the lower mobility-lifetime product of InGaN/GaN multilayer quantum dots and can increase the filling of the quantum-dot states. While perfectly Lambertian scattering is known to provide a maximum path length enhancement of 4<italic>n</italic><sup>2</sup>, where <italic>n</italic> is the index of refraction, absorption increase via light trapping has been shown to surpass the 4<italic>n</italic><sup>2</sup> limit in certain nanostructures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Such light trapping schemes should therefore be applied to IBSCs whenever possible to reduce the absorber thickness and enhance carrier collection. The interdot transport characteristics can also be improved through miniband formation by promoting interdot tunneling, especially for holes.</p><p id="Par19">In summary, we show that InGaN/GaN quantum-dot-in-nanowire heterostructures on silicon form IBSCs, enabling sub-bandgap current generation on a lower cost platform. We show the strongest relative change in intermediate band quantum efficiency seen to date due to light bias and the first significant intermediate band photocurrent shown on a silicon substrate or with nanowires. Significant sub-bandgap photocurrent enhancement is observed with a near-infrared light bias and does not increase with temperature. These results suggest that wide-bandgap IBSCs can be achieved on a silicon substrate through nanowire geometries. Future investigations are focused on producing optimal InGaN bandgap combinations for the solar spectrum, increasing sub-bandgap absorption in the quantum dots, and reducing nonradiative recombination in the nanowires through optimizations in device design and fabrication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Microscopy</title><p id="Par20">Scanning electron microscopy is performed using a Zeiss GeminiSEM 500 at 10 kV accelerating voltage under vacuum.
