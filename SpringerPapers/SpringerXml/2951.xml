They contained an assembly of nanoneedles that grow perpendicular to the films. The surface area of the coatings on PET films reached around 284 times that of a bare PET film. Micro-, nano-, or subnanosized surface roughness and inside pores contributed to the high nitrogen adsorption. The coatings on FTO films showed an acetaldehyde removal rate of 2.80 μmol/h; this value is similar to those of commercial products certified by the Photocatalysis Industry Association of Japan. The rate increased greatly to 10.16 μmol/h upon annealing in air at 500 °C for 4 h; this value exceeded those of commercial products. Further, the coatings showed a NO<sub>x</sub> removal rate of 1.04 μmol/h; this value is similar to those of commercial products. The rate decreased to 0.42 μmol/h upon annealing. NO<sub>x</sub> removal was affected by the photocatalyst’s surface area rather than its crystallinity.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>13482</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>31</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2020_Article_70525.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Metal oxides are useful for industrial applications such as gas sensors, batteries, and artificial photosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.

The sensitivity of a hydrogen gas sensor with an SnO<sub>2</sub> micropattern increased linearly with increasing SnO<sub>2</sub> crystallinity. SnO<sub>2</sub> could also be used to fabricate a lightweight flexible gas sensor on a polymer film. A porous iron vanadate (FeVO<sub>4</sub>) thick film consisting of disordered nanorods was fabricated by a hydrothermal method for gas penetration and permeation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The probed I–V behavior and ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy measurements confirmed the semiconducting nature of triclinic FeVO<sub>4</sub> (E<sub>g</sub> = 2.72 eV) and revealed that the activation energy for electric conduction was 0.46 eV. The best gas sensitivity of 0.29 ± 0.01 (m =  − 3.4 ± 0.1) was obtained at optimal working temperature of 250 °C. SnO<sub>2</sub> nanowires were fabricated for an H<sub>2</sub>S gas sensor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. They were functionalized with copper particles during chemical vapor deposition. A CuO@SnO<sub>2</sub> p–n heterojunction was fabricated by oxidizing Cu to CuO. The fabricated sensor demonstrated high sensitivity and selectivity for H<sub>2</sub>S gas. VO<sub>2</sub> nanobelts or nanoparticles were fabricated by a hydrothermal method for thermochromic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Nanoparticles showed high phase transition enthalpy (ΔH = 32.4 J/g) and VO<sub>2</sub>-PET composite films showed optical switching characteristics (T<sub>lum</sub> = 33.5%, ΔT<sub>sol</sub> = 16.0%). A dye-sensitized solar cell was prepared with a ZnO@TiO<sub>2</sub> core shell nanorod array via a low-temperature solution method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. High-aspect-ratio ZnO nanorod arrays were covered with a TiO<sub>2</sub> shell. The TiO<sub>2</sub> shell increased the short circuit current (from 4.2 to 5.2 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>), open circuit voltage (from 0.6 to 0.8 V), fill factor (from 42.8 to 73.02%), and overall cell efficiency (from 1.1 to 3.03%).

ZnO nanorods showed high potential for Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing in water or serum samples. They can be applied to drinking and irrigation water as well as to clinical analysis. A sensitive and selective sunlight-driven photoelectrochemical sensor was developed for the direct detection and reduction of chromium(VI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. It was based on single-crystal rutile TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods decorated with gold nanoparticles. It showed high sensitivity under solar simulator illumination.

Metal oxide nanomaterials and a biosensor fabricated using them were reviewed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Nanomaterial deposition on conductive electrodes is a crucial step for achieving high performance, and a simple, stable, and reproducible method is considered essential for depositing nanomaterials for fabricating a biosensor.</p><p id="Par3">Many devices have reaction sites on the metal oxide surface, and therefore, they need to have a large surface area. In addition, studies are developing new devices by using the characteristic surface structure of metal oxides. Controlling the size, shape, and crystallinity of the metal oxide is known to greatly affect the device characteristics, and new metal oxide materials are being actively developed. There is also a strong need to control the shape and even the exposed crystal plane after the metal oxide material is crystallized. Especially, nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> films with high surface area and high photocatalytic activity are strongly required for photocatalysts and related devices. Performance of the nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> films is strongly affected by the size, shape, crystallinity, and the exposed crystal plane. The development of high performance nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> films is a powerful demonstration of precise control of the size, shape, crystallinity, and the exposed crystal plane.</p><p id="Par4">Metal oxide nano-/microstructures have also been synthesized in animals and plants. The size, shape, crystallinity, and surface structure of metal oxides in aqueous solutions were controlled at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. They are called “Bio-mineralization” and have created a new academic field, “Bio-inspired mineralization”. In the bio-inspired mineralization, we learn from nature and aim to develop novel materials that are not in nature.</p><p id="Par5">This study investigates the bio-inspired mineralization of nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub>.

Ammonium hexafluorotitanate (10.31 g) and boric acid (9.321 g) were dissolved in 1,000 mL of distilled hot water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The concentrations of ammonium hexafluorotitanate and boric acid were 50 and 150 mM, respectively. PET films were exposed to vacuum-ultraviolet light for 20 min in air using a low-pressure mercury lamp (PL16-110, SEN Lights Co.). They were immersed in the solutions at 50 °C for 24 h. The titanium oxide-formed surface of the PET films faced obliquely downward. Therefore, even if homogeneously nucleated titanium oxide particles formed in the solution settle, they are less likely to be deposited on the PET film. Further, the PET film is less likely to be bent or deformed in the solution because it is attached to the glass plate. Moreover, titanium oxide is formed only on the PET film surface because the back surface of the film is in close contact with the glass plate. Thereafter, the glass plates were removed from the solution. The PET films were peeled off from the glass plates, washed with running water, and dried under a strong air flow.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title><italic>Nanostructured TiO</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub><italic> with high surface area</italic></title><p id="Par9">PET films were uniformly covered with nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).

The total surface area of nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> was calculated by multiplying this value by the mass of nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub>.

The total surface area is not affected by the error of the weight of the nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> in this calculation method, and therefore, it can be determined accurately. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the TiO<sub>2</sub> film surface area was the highest ever reported. Nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> in this study was considered to be different from general nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> reported elsewhere.

Nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> coatings showed high N<sub>2</sub> adsorption. The BET specific surface area was ~ 503.6 m<sup>2</sup>/g and the ratio of the surface area to the substrate projected area reached around 284 times that of a bare PET film. Furthermore, the photocatalytic property of nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> on FTO films was evaluated. The acetaldehyde removal rate increased greatly from 2.80 to 10.16 μmol h upon annealing. This value exceeded that of commercial products (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The amount of NO<sub>x</sub> removed was 1.04 μmol; this was similar to that of commercial products. This value decreased to 0.42 μmol/h upon annealing. NO<sub>x</sub> removal was affected by the photocatalyst’s surface area rather than its crystallinity. The study results revealed that nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> had different nanostructure and surface conditions. These contributed to the high surface area and high photocatalytic activity. In particular, the acetaldehyde decomposition characteristics were higher than those of commercial products. Nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> can be used for low-cost, large-area coating of various substrates such as polymer films. The high surface area and high photocatalytic activity can be used for various applications to building interior materials.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Y.
