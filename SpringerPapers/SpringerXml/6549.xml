Here we challenge this view by showing that βCar-EPOs are formed in the absence of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in a non-concerted triplet-triplet reaction: <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub> + <sup>3</sup>β-carotene → βCar-EPOs, in which <sup>3</sup>β-carotene manifests a strong biradical character. Thus, the reactivity of β-carotene towards oxygen is governed by its excited triplet state. βCar-EPOs, while being stable in the dark, are photochemically labile, and are a rare example of nonaromatic endoperoxides that release <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, again not in a concerted reaction. Their light-induced breakdown triggers an avalanche of free radicals, which accounts for the pro-oxidant activity of β-carotene and the puzzling swap from its anti- to pro-oxidant features. Furthermore, we show that βCar-EPOs, and carotenoids in general, weakly sensitize <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. These findings underlie the key role of the triplet state in determining the chemical and photophysical features of β-carotene. They shake up the prevailing models of carotenoid photophysics, the anti-oxidant functioning of β-carotene, and the role of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in chemical signaling in biological photosynthetic systems. βCar-EPOs and their degradation products are not markers of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and oxidative stress but of the overproduction of extremely hazardous chlorophyll triplets in photosystems. Hence, the chemical signaling of overexcitation of the photosynthetic apparatus is based on a <sup>3</sup>chlorophyll-<sup>3</sup>β-carotene relay, rather than on extremely short-lived <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">The endoperoxides of β-carotene play a key role in signaling of photooxidative stress in plant cells and are regarded as the products of chemical deactivation of singlet oxygen.

Aromatic EPOs have attracted much attention, mainly as a convenient source of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> for a variety of applications, ranging from chemical synthesis to photomedicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. This interest has been sparked both by the recognition of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> as a selective oxygenation agent and due to its strong cytotoxicity, making it one of the most dangerous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in biological systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The reactivity of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, as compared to the ground state molecular oxygen, <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, is greatly enhanced due to the excess energy and the spin-allowed character of the reactions with other molecules that display singlet multiplicity, thus making <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> one of the strongest known oxidizing species. Fortunately, <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub> remains inert towards organic compounds in their singlet states, owing to the resonance stabilization of its π-electron system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and Wigner’s spin conservation rule. This permits life on our planet to exist under aerobic conditions at ambient temperatures.</p><p id="Par4">Thermal, photochemical, or chemical activation of aromatic EPOs often leads to the quantitative release of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, and the mechanisms of attachment and release of O<sub>2</sub> have been thoroughly investigated, both experimentally and theoretically<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In most cases, the -O-O- bridge is formed in a concerted [2 + 4] cycloaddition of a <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> dienophile to a flat aromatic substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Inversely, cycloreversion leads to the release of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and the regeneration of hydrocarbon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Another way the -O-O- bridge can be formed is the trapping of <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, which is applied, e.g., in the synthesis of cyclic peroxides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. It is also an established experimental approach in the studies of biradicals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">So far, non-aromatic EPOs remain somewhat less elaborated, and their chemistry is not understood that well, perhaps with the exception of some naturally occurring ones, such as prostaglandin G<sub>2</sub>, artemisinin, and the endoperoxides of β-carotene (βCar-EPOs, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Our previous studies revealed that in a sensitized process <italic>all-trans</italic>-β,β-carotene (βCar) sequentially accumulates up to eight oxygen atoms, while its C<sub>40</sub>-skeleton remains intact, yielding a series of βCar-EPOs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, whose major products are β-carotene-5,8,-endoperoxide (βCar-5,8-EPO) and β-carotene-7,10-endoperoxide (βCar-7,10-EPO). To account for the pigment oxygenation mechanism, we proposed a concerted [2 + 4] cycloaddition of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> to βCar in an s-<italic>cis</italic>-diene conformation, according to generally accepted mechanism of attachment of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> to dienes. The products of this chemical quenching appear to be responsible for the controversial pro-oxidant features of carotenoids (Crts), in particular βCar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. βCar-EPOs, found to rapidly accumulate in plants under high-light stress, were assumed to be the products of the in situ chemical quenching of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> by βCar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Their accumulation, in particular of βCar-5,8-EPO, is correlated with chronic Crts oxygenation, the extent of photosystem II photoinhibition, and the expression of various <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> marker genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The lower mass and volatile degradation products of βCar-EPOs, such as β-cyclocitral, play a crucial role in the chemical signaling of oxidative stress in oxygenic photosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>The structures and the electronic absorption spectra of β-carotene and its oxygenation products, and their breakdown in the dark.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The structural formulae and electronic absorption spectra of β-carotene and β-carotene endoperoxides recorded in acetone at room temperature. <bold>b</bold> The spectral changes and kinetics (inset) of βCar-7,10-EPO breakdown in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the presence of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline <italic>N</italic>-oxide (DMPO) as spin trap, in the dark at room temperature, monitored by electronic absorption spectroscopy.

Crts are considered to be the first line of defense against ROS, owing to their anti-oxidant features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and their capacity to nearly “catalytically” scavenge <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and chlorophyll (Chl) triplets through physical quenching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The versatile (photo)protective functioning of Crts relies on their low-energy T<sub>1</sub> state, matching that of the <sup>1</sup>Δ<sub>g</sub> state. Crt T<sub>1</sub> is able to intercept the excitation energy from Chl triplets and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, and then to dissipate it harmlessly into the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Practically each collision of Crt molecules with these excited species leads to spin-allowed intramolecular excitation energy transfer (EET), and they are quenched almost within the diffusion limits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The quenching of Chl triplets by Crts is especially important in photosynthetic pigment-proteins, in which Crts also play accessory antenna functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Recently, it has been found that Crt triplets can be efficiently generated via singlet fission in Crt aggregates or in photosynthetic antenna complexes, which is relevant to the quest to elevate the quantum performance of organic solar devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. The efficiency of photosynthesis organisms and of such devices critically depends on (photo)protection, which ensures their durability under dense photon fluxes. In the photosynthetic apparatus, a major risk is associated with the excellent <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> sensitizing properties of Chls, since their excited state relaxation is dominated by the S<sub>1</sub>-T<sub>1</sub> intersystem crossing (ISC), despite the absence of heavy atoms in these molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Paradoxically, photosynthetic solar energy conversion, the major source of bioenergy on the planet, relies entirely on singlet-singlet energy transfer, and useful photosynthetic reactions must necessarily compete with ISC in Chls. This latter process is wasteful in terms of energy and creates a severe risk of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> sensitization and oxidative damage to the photosynthetic machinery, the very origin of molecular oxygen.</p><p id="Par7">Considering the mechanism of βCar-EPOs formation, the cycloaddition of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> to a 1,3-diene system with 6-s-<italic>cis</italic> conformation, present near the ionone rings in the βCar molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, apparently may result in βCar-5,8-EPO. However, oxygenation to βCar-7,10-EPO requires an s-<italic>trans</italic> to s-<italic>cis</italic> conversion at the single C<sub>8</sub>–C<sub>9</sub> bond, implying a different mechanism for the addition of O<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, chemically generated <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> does not cause oxygenation, but only isomerization of βCar<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, whereas the lifetime and concentration of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in our preparative system are expected to be strongly suppressed by both βCar and βCar-EPOs. Such pilling-up inconsistencies motivated us in this study to investigate in detail the mechanisms of the formation and breakdown of βCar-EPOs, and the involvement of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and other ROS in these processes. We synthesized and characterized a series of βCar-EPOs, and their breakdown was monitored using HPLC and LC-MS/MS techniques and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), electronic absorption and time-resolved emission spectroscopies. In particular, our principal approach was to tune, in our preparative system, the level of O<sub>2</sub> and the lifetime of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> from the nanosecond to the millisecond range. In parallel, ab initio computations were performed to gain structural and thermodynamic insights. Here, we demonstrate that <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> does not participate in oxygenation of βCar and the formation and breakdown of βCar-EPOs are not concerted reactions. Our study reveals a strong biradical character of the T<sub>1</sub> state as well as its key role in the photophysics and (photo)chemistry of Crts. βCar-EPOs are an uncommon example of non-aromatic EPOs that release <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>.

The shifts in their electronic spectra (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) reflect a gradual shrinkage of the π-electron chromophore system due to the attachment of oxygen molecules, from 11 conjugated C = C bonds in the parental βCar to 9, 7, and eventually to 6 conjugated C = C bonds in βCar-5,8,7′,10′-diEPO. The identity of the products was confirmed by detecting their molecular ions of m/z values near 569 and 601 in their mass spectra (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>), which correspond to the presence of one or two -O-O- bridges, respectively. The results of the ab initio calculations on βCar and its two main oxygenation products confirm these assignments (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). They also show a very weak solvent effect on the ground state, the S<sub>2</sub> state, and the orbital energies (HOMO and LUMO) of βCar and βCar-EPOs molecules (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). The stability of βCar-7,10-EPO is lower than that of βCar-5,8-EPO by 45–47 kJ/mol and does not depend on the medium. A slightly stronger solvent influence is seen in both the dipole moments and polarizabilities of the pigments. As expected, these parameters, with respect to βCar (plain hydrocarbon), increase in βCar-EPOs. The dipole moment of βCar-7,10-EPO is higher and its polarizability is evidently lower than that of βCar-5,8-EPO, which agrees well with the shorter conjugation length in the former EPO (<italic>n</italic> = 8). This effect is also manifested in the lower value of both the LUMO-HOMO energy difference and the S<sub>2</sub> energy predicted for βCar-7,10-EPO. Consequently, the predicted excitation energies decrease in βCar-5,8-EPO (<italic>n</italic> = 9) and βCar (<italic>n</italic> = 11), reproducing well the experimental trends (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

In all these reactions, highly purified and free from trace impurities samples of βCar were used as the substrate, always freshly obtained by repurification of commercially available pure βCar. The purity of the pigment, also used as a reference in all the analytical runs, is evidenced in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>. In addition, to eliminate possible problems related to the photoexcitation of the solvent in the illumination experiments, red light was applied (&gt;630 nm). To reduce the partial pressure of oxygen in the reaction medium, extensive purging with high-purity Ar was performed or oxygen was removed after a thorough degassing of the samples under moderate vacuum and then using chemical trapping (Oxoid™ AnaeroGen™ 2.5 L sachets, Thermo Scientific™). The level of residual oxygen was monitored by recording phosphorescence from Pd-pheophytin a (Pd-Pheo) used as the oxygen probe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

In contrast, in the absence of βCar, the kinetics of the self-promoted photodegradation of bacteriopheophytin a (BPheo) is 5-fold faster in the deuterated solvent (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), evidencing at the same time the production of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in the system. Moreover, regardless of the oxygen level, HPLC analyses of reaction mixtures always reveal the characteristic bands of βCar monoendoperoxides with retention times near 26 min (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Not only is extended Ar purging insufficient to stop the reaction, it even runs under very low oxygen content, or under aerobic conditions when the <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> level and its lifetime is strongly suppressed by DABCO. The same results were obtained when Pheo (the S<sub>1</sub> maximum at 660 nm), instead of BPheo, was used as PC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Furthermore, very slow oxygenation of βCar also occurs in the dark, either with or without PC, and white light or even red light above 630 nm accelerates it in the absence of PC, in agreement with a previous study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.

In the dark at ambient temperatures, βCar-EPOs show appreciable stability. For instance, in methanol they keep decomposing slowly, but can easily be detected even after 25 days of standing, if judged using electronic absorption and mass spectroscopies (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>), and HPLC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). The changes in the electronic absorption profiles of βCar-7,10-EPO and βCar-5,8,7′,10′-diEPO solutions reflect their slow conversion to species whose absorption maxima are shifted to red, whereas the spectra of βCar-5,8-EPO and βCar-5,8,5′,8′-diEPO practically do not change (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>).

Interestingly, there is a strong spin trap effect on the reaction rate, which increases 5-fold in the presence of 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline <italic>N</italic>-oxide (DMPO) at 150 mM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">HPLC analysis shows that in all cases the spontaneous breakdown of βCar-EPOs yields hydrophobic products whose absorption spectra are consistent with the spectral changes (or lack) seen while the βCar-EPOs are kept in organic media in the dark (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Thus, the breakdown product of βCar-7,10-EPO has absorption bands red-shifted with respect to the parental compound, while the spectra of βCar-5,8-EPO and the product of its breakdown are almost identical (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>). These spectral features of the parental and product molecules agree with the results of the computations (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). The chromatographic retention times of these products are always much longer (&gt;45 min) than those of the parental EPOs (20-27 min), indicating a change from a relatively high to very low polarity, similar to that of βCar (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the mass spectra, the formation of these hydrophobic products is correlated with the gradual disappearance of the βCar-EPOs molecular ions (m/z of ~569 or ~601) and the appearance of new signals of lower m/z values, in particular a signal at 536, which corresponds to that of βCar (Supplementary Figs <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). As expected, the stability of βCar-EPOs under illumination is markedly reduced and under white light, they quickly bleach completely.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Mechanism of the formation of β-carotene endoperoxides</title><p id="Par12">The participation of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in the formation of βCar-EPOs is very questionable, as they are formed under a variety of conditions that exclude it from the reaction medium (see below). First of all, at concentrations in the mM range βCar is expected to eliminate (via physical quenching) any <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> possibly generated in our system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In fact, the lifetime of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in it is reduced by three orders of magnitude. Moreover, when using PC, βCar-EPOs do keep being formed under reduced partial pressures of oxygen (using Ar or a chemical absorber of O<sub>2</sub>) or in the presence of a very high excess of DABCO, an extremely efficient physical quencher of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Finally, the use of the deuterated solvent has no effect on kinetics and oxygenation products, while PC alone, in the absence of βCar, is degraded much faster than in ordinary acetone (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Intriguingly, HPLC analyses indicate that wide-range manipulation of the lifetime of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> does not change the βCar oxygenation pattern (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), implying that <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> does not contribute to it.

In the <italic>all-trans</italic> conformer of βCar this could only be satisfied near the terminal β-ionone rings. In reality, however, these rings are twisted by as much as 46° with respect to the backbone plane (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>), owing to considerable steric interactions between the skeleton and the terminal side methyl groups (CCDC entry No. 1120466)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Such a twist causes a significant decoupling of the terminal C = C bonds from the conjugated π-electron system, reflected best in the electronic absorption spectrum of βCar (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Moreover, the computations reveal that the energetic cost of forcing one of the rings to the backbone plane is great and amounts to ∼30 KJ/mol (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). For this reason, the population of such (half-flat) conformers of βCar at ambient conditions is negligible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the formation of βCar-EPOs with their -O-O- bridge located nearer the molecule center, such as βCar-7,10-EPO, simply cannot be achieved by [2 + 4] cycloaddition. As mentioned above, prior to the reaction, a full conversion of the s-<italic>trans</italic> to s-<italic>cis</italic> of the respective single C–C bonds in the βCar skeleton would be required, which is not the case. Considering the alternative mechanisms, one obvious possibility is a thermally activated reaction between the two reactants in their ground states, βCar(S<sub>0</sub>) and <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. Indeed, such a reaction takes place in the dark, regardless of the presence/absence of PC, although at a very low rate − the formation of βCar-EPOs becomes noticeable after several weeks of standing at room temperature (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Apparently, βCar(S<sub>0</sub>) and <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub> react very slowly in a spin-forbidden reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>; the vast majority of collisions between the reactants are unproductive, as predicted by reaction rate theory. In the absence of PC, under white light the reaction speeds up somewhat, and surprisingly, even under red light (&gt;630 nm). This light-driven oxygenation seems to be promoted via the S<sub>2</sub> state, considering the fact that its activity extends far to the red (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). However, βCar in singlet excited states, due to both their short lifetimes and Wigner’s principle, cannot be expected to directly participate in chemical reactions. Rather, via ISC a longer-lived <sup>3</sup>βCar(T<sub>1</sub>) will be populated with a very low quantum yield (∼0.001<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>). Hence, <sup>3</sup>βCar(T<sub>1</sub>) seems to be the factor common to all these light-driven reactions, which is consistent with a strong stimulation by light in the presence of PC. Otherwise, various mechanisms would lead to exactly the same products and the same pattern of βCar oxygenation, which is very improbable. The major ways in which <sup>3</sup>βCar(T<sub>1</sub>) is populated in our system are the following: (i) an efficient EET from <sup>3</sup>BPheo and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, and (ii) a much less efficient O<sub>2</sub>-enhanced ISC from the S<sub>1</sub> state, resulting in <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> sensitization (see below).</p><p id="Par14">The trapping of <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub> by <sup>3</sup>βCar occurs in the encounter complex [<sup>3</sup>βCar•<sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub>]* created in collisions between <sup>3</sup>βCar(T<sub>1</sub>) and <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and/or by a direct EET to [<sup>1</sup>βCar•<sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub>] from <sup>3</sup>PC.

The structures of the final products imply the sequence of steps leading to the closure of the -O-O- bridges. As no rearrangement around C<sub>5</sub> is possible, βCar-5,8-EPO must be formed while retaining the original conformation. In contrast, the formation of the 7,10-O<sub>2</sub> bridge requires an 8-s-<italic>trans</italic> to 8-s-<italic>cis</italic> change in geometry at the C<sub>8</sub>–C<sub>9</sub> bond. This is achieved by the rehybridization (sp<sup>2</sup> → sp<sup>3</sup>) of two respective carbon atoms and two rotations around the C–C bonds (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). Due to these extra steps, the overall rate of the 7,10-product formation is necessarily slow, which is highly consistent with the reaction yield, which is lower by a factor of 3–4 with respect to the 5,8-product. The 7,10-product is energetically less stable than the 5,8-product, by ∼44 kJ/mol, and a major contribution to this value comes from the steric interactions between the O<sub>2</sub> bridge and the skeleton (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). This strain is rather confined because of the protective effect of side methyls on the skeletal conformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.

Additionally, in vivo βCar-5,8-EPO is the major product of βCar oxygenation and its accumulation in light-stressed photosynthetic tissues is well documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In contrast to our conclusions (see below), it is regarded as an early index of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> production in leaves, and its low-mass breakdown products, in particular β-cyclocitral and apo-10'-carotenal, are considered to be markers of oxidative stress, which participate in stress signaling and the induction of acclimation genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

The βCar-7,10-EPO breakdown begins with a Kornblum–De La Mare rearrangement favored by protic media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>, followed then by photochemical processes or, alternatively, with a photolytic cleavage of the -O-O- bridge. In either case, an <italic>allylic</italic>-like 1,4-biradical intermediate is formed, additionally resonance-stabilized by a large π-electron system. This intermediate in the excited state cleaves into a variety of lower mass free radical and biradical products in a Norrish type II reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. This mechanism explains the formation of β-cyclocitral and apo-10'-carotenal as the end products.

The lifetime of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in the photosynthetic membranes is greatly reduced due to the physical quenching by βCar and other quenchers. Under ambient or moderately strong light, the triplets of chlorophylls (<sup>3</sup>Chl) are efficiently extinguished by xanthophylls and other carotenoids, including βCar. Under strong illumination, <sup>3</sup>βCar, generated in excess, chemically reacts with ground state molecular oxygen (<sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) and undergoes oxygenation to βCar-EPOs.

It not only circumvents the barrier of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> quenchers, but also conveys more specific information about triplet state overproduction. Sophisticated triplet sensing, via the T–T reaction and its products, may activate, in a pre-emptive way, various cellular protective and repair mechanisms. In a sense, βCar oxygenation in the photosynthetic apparatus constitutes a smart safety valve that controls the <sup>3</sup>Chl population while conveying chemical information. Furthermore, considering the high rates of βCar-EPOs’ photodecomposition, their accumulation in photosynthetic tissues implies that the efficiency of the <sup>3</sup>βCar(T<sub>1</sub>) + <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub> → βCar-EPOs reaction in vivo is higher than anticipated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par32">In light of our findings, it is important to understand how the photoprotective mechanisms present in the photosynthetic apparatus deal with triplet overproduction. Most of βCar in the photosystems is hosted by the PSII core, and this is also the primary site of its oxygenation to βCar-EPOs. This and other degradation processes occur permanently, as a continuous turnover of βCar, as well as of Chls but not xanthophylls, takes place in the photosystems, even under relatively low light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>. Whereas, the major antenna, LHCII, exclusively binds xanthophylls (lutein, neoxanthin, and/or zeaxanthin/violaxanthin) which appear not that much prone to oxygenation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, being already partly oxygenated. The overexcited Chls in LHCII are a potent source of triplets and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, and several photoprotective mechanisms evolved to eliminate or minimize damage. In the first place, the triplets are efficiently quenched by the L1/L2 luteins, which are located in close proximity to the Chls. Whereas, neoxanthin acts as an oxygen barrier, limiting the access of O<sub>2</sub> to the inner domain of the complex, thereby strongly contributing to the photostability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup>. Direct evidence for the limited access of O<sub>2</sub> to lutein sites was inferred from the decay kinetics of their T<sub>1</sub> state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup>. A comparison of the molecular packing within the structures of LHCII and PSII confirms this notion, showing differences in the exposure of βCar and the xanthophylls (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). The LHCII assembly is a very tightly packed structure in which the luteins are buried deeply inside the protein domain. Neoxanthin locks the entire assembly and partly protrudes into the lipid bilayer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup>. Intriguingly, the protruding fragment consists of the 6-8 allenic and 3,5-dihydroxy moieties that protects it from any O<sub>2</sub> attack. Altogether, on the one hand, very little triplets are likely to “escape” from overexcited LHCII, and on the other hand, O<sub>2</sub> is not allowed to penetrate into the sites where the triplets are produced. Under strong light, when the capacity of these photoprotective mechanisms is exceeded, the population of unquenched triplets rises and deleterious <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> is produced. Then the other xanthophylls bound in LHCII and βCars in the core antenna and around the P700 and P680 reaction centers, as well as other compounds abundant in the photosynthetic membranes, e.g., tocopherols and prenylquinols, take over and physically scavenge <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup>. In effect, the concentration of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in the photosystems is kept at a very low level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup> and its residence lifetime is shortened from tens of microseconds (in solution, Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) to tens of nanoseconds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. Thus, in practical terms, any ‘chemistry’ involved in <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> elimination in this environment is quite limited, but appears to take place and pigments are continuously degraded while their degradation products act as “T-stress” signals (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).</p><p id="Par33">In conclusion, our study reveals that the chemical reactivity of β-carotene, the model carotenoid that is responsible in part for its functioning as anti-oxidants and photoprotectants, is triplet state-driven. The first excited triplet state of β-carotene, <sup>3</sup>βCar(T<sub>1</sub>), plays a pivotal role in its oxygenation to endoperoxides, showing a remarkable biradical character in reactions with another species of biradical nature, <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. In the absence of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, light strongly stimulates these reactions, particularly in the presence of PCs, which points to the crucial role of <sup>3</sup>βCar(T<sub>1</sub>). We find no indications of the chemical reaction between <sup>1</sup>βCar(S<sub>0</sub>) and <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, and hence βCar-endoperoxides are not the products of the chemical quenching of <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> by βCar, as is commonly thought. On the contrary, it is βCar in the triplet state that is chemically quenched by <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub> in a very specific type of T–T annihilation reaction.</p><p id="Par34">βCar-endoperoxides are formed via non-concerted recombination of two biradicals: <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and an <italic>allylic</italic>-type excited biradical <sup>3</sup>βCar(T<sub>1</sub>), resulting in a nearly barrierless closure of the -O-O- bridges. The breakdown of βCar-endoperoxides follows in the reverse direction an analogous non-concerted radical mechanism. Such radical mechanisms enable intramolecular rearrangements that account for the structures of the products. Under ambient conditions in the dark, βCar-endoperoxides are surprisingly stable, release O<sub>2</sub> and quantitatively revert slowly to carotenes—isomers of βCar. βCar-endoperoxides are much more photolabile and readily release <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and free radicals. To our knowledge, they are a rare example of non-aromatic endoperoxides that release <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>. The yields of the liberated free radicals are very high, most likely due to a photochemically generated cascade in the Norrish type II reactions, and may lead to the damage of lipids. The production of various ROS by βCar-endoperoxides explains well the controversial pro-oxidant activity of βCar and the paradoxical switch of its anti- to pro-oxidant features under higher tensions of O<sub>2</sub>. At low O<sub>2</sub> levels, βCar keeps up as the protector, whereas at higher levels, the oxygenation to βCar-endoperoxides, and their breakdown into <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> and free radicals, become dominant. We have also found that Crts not only physically quench <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, but are also able to photocatalytically generate <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, though with low efficiency. We suggest that the essential step in this photocatalysis comprises excitation energy transfer to <sup>3</sup>O<sub>2</sub> from Crt* in the S<sub>1</sub> state that produces <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>, and occurs with a concomitant transition from the S<sub>1</sub> state to the T<sub>1</sub>. The sensitization is facilitated by the exact matching of <sup>1</sup>Δ<sub>g</sub> energy to S-T splitting in Crts. These findings shed new light on the sophisticated photophysics and photochemistry of these fascinating isoprenoid chromophores.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Synthesis and isolation of β-carotene endoperoxides</title><p id="Par35">The endoperoxides of β-carotene were synthesized photocatalytically from synthetic all-<italic>trans</italic> β-carotene (Sigma, Germany) and isolated following the methods described earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.
