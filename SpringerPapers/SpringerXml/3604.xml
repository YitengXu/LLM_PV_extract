EB radiation is an additive-free process using short-lived reactive species, formed by the radiolysis of water, to carry out decomposition of organic pollutants. Studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of irradiation, alone or in combination with other processes, for the decomposition of refractory organic compounds in aqueous solutions, and in the removal or inactivation of microorganisms and parasites. Irradiation processes have been known for decades; however, their general application in the water field was impaired by the cumbersome and complexity of past existing technology. The technological picture is changing significantly in the last few years, with instrumentation that is significantly cheaper, easier and safer to use. Application of EB processing in the water sector promises a cost-efficient, by-products-less, and ultimately effective technology taking advantage of characteristics not available in others: total absence of chemical additives; capability of generating simultaneously both strong oxidants and reducers (hydroxyl radicals, hydrogen atoms, solvated electrons and others); capability of processing aqueous, colloidal, and opaque solutions; compatibility with existing technologies. This paper examines some of the few existing applications of this technology, which is still unknown, or poorly familiar, to most water professionals and researchers.</p></abstract><kwd-group

implemented by electron beam irradiation, and aimed at tackling the pressing problem of organic micro-contaminants (including CECs, contaminants of emerging concern, EPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>) in natural, drinking waters, and wastewater discharges. Electron beam processing is a technology that induces water radiolysis that, in turn, causes strong oxidation and reduction reactions in the exposed solution, with the possible complete mineralization of the organic compounds therein contained. HEO processes, as they are indicated in this paper, were studied since the 1950s by radiation chemistry scientists (Kurucz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1995</xref>), but never actually introduced into common water treatment practice, due to the cumbersome and expensive equipment then available. Current concerns with a series of newly detected emerging pollutants, difficult to remove with âconventionalâ treatment processes, may ultimately become a factor in bringing back into practice this technology, which has technically evolved in the meantime, due to a number of current, high-tech, ongoing applications in the most diverse industrial sectors. <italic>Multa renascentur quae iam cecidere</italic> (many things, which have fallen into disuse, will be reborn), a quote by Latin poet Horace (Horatius, about 65â68 B.C.), may best represent this situation, in which a technology, at one time considered efficient but impractical, is finally rediscovered due to newly arisen needs, and through better technical implementation. Still, full-scale applications are few, but as shown in this review paper, its potential is enormous.</p><p id="Par3">The presence of metals, bacteria, hydrocarbons, and other ion-like nitrates (<inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq1_Math"><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>NO</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Since these contaminants have been subject to regulation and control for a long time, effective technologies for their removal from wastewater are well established, and generally adopted (Callegari and Capodaglio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2017</xref>; Capodaglio and Callegari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>; Capodaglio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2016a</xref>). This is not the case for most emerging compounds, while it is a priority to remove them from drinking water, no effective removal technologies have been discovered, to date, which are capable to remove simultaneously all the contaminants of concern (Shi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>). Some techniques have demonstrated to remove, to a limited extent, certain contaminants: The most commonly used processes for this purpose are biodegradation and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) (Shi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>; Capodaglio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2010</xref>; Cecconet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2017</xref>). Although partly effective, these processes may result in the formation of numerous degradation/transformation by-products, which are not well studied, as typical screening approaches for known compounds (typically, low resolution mass spectrometry utilizing triple quadrupole technology) are not yet capable of identifying them (Capodaglio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016b</xref>). Also, as biotransformation/biodegradation pathways are often not known (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2012</xref>), very few analytical standards are available for these secondary products (Helbling et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">AOP treatment in aqueous media is also likely to be an expensive venture, since extremely high conversion yields are needed (ideally below detection limit), as these compounds retain their adverse properties even at minute concentrations, and have very low initial concentrations. These factors make the specific treatment cost (per unit mass) very high (Petrie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">Nanomaterials seem to have good potential for emerging contaminants removal, due to their large specific surface areas. However, to prevent their further spread into water, they will need subsequent immobilization onto macro-particles such as granular activated carbon (GAC), or powdered activated carbon (PAC). Recently, application of bioelectrochemical systems (BESs) for removal of small concentrations of pharmaceutical products from solutions was proposed (Pisciotta and Dolceamore <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2016</xref>). BESs are a group of processes where electrochemical reactions are exploited for oxidative removal of environmental contaminants, associated with direct energy recovery (Capodaglio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>; Molognoni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017a</xref>), or through the use of small electric potentials, to achieve pollutants reductive removal (Molognoni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2017b</xref>). Cecconet et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2017</xref>) recently reviewed the application of biological combination processes (e.g., membrane bioreactors combined with other technologies, such as BESs and others) to achieve improved pharmaceutical compounds removal from solutions. Research on new, efficient technologies for removal of emerging contaminants in waters will be top priority in the future years (Shi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">This review paper on HEO technology summarizes results of a few existing applications carried out so far in the water and wastewater field, illustrating potential advantages of the technology compared to current state-of-the-art AOP processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>State-of-the-art CECs removal</title><p id="Par7">State-of-the-art process technologies for CECs degradation include physicochemical treatments, oxidation by chlorination and/or ozonation, UV irradiation. Biodegradation is also applied, but can deliver mixed results, as not all these compounds can be completely broken down biologically, or happen to be bio-refractory. Even with best available technologies adopted, in fact, biological treatment may remove only part of the wide range of emerging contaminants. Estrogens, endocrine disruptors, and pharmaceuticals may appear in solution as ions, at neutral pH, and remain undegraded by biological treatment. Furthermore, they might not be adsorbed onto the activated sludge flocs, depending on their properties (Urase and Kikuta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2005</xref>). On the other hand, compounds or by-products accumulation into the solid (waste sludge) phase may contribute to transfer significant environmental risks to different media (e.g., soil), when sludge is disposed. Available advanced treatments include ultra-violet (UV) photolysis, ion exchange, and membrane filtration, often in combination with chemical oxidizers (e.g., O<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and/or external catalysts addition (e.g., TiO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p id="Par8">Among âconventionalâ processes present in state-of-the-art wastewater treatment facilities, physicochemical treatments such as coagulationâflocculation processes are generally found unable to obtain significant CECs removal (Bolong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>; Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2009</xref>), except when used conjunctly with PAC or GAC dosage, oxidation by chlorination and/or ozonation, and/or UV irradiation (Westerhoff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2005</xref>). Compounds such as carbadox, sulfadimethoxine, trimethoprim are not removed by metal salt coagulants (Adams et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2002</xref>), nor are diclofenac and carbamazepine (Petrovic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>; Vieno et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2006</xref>). PAC appears to be the most effective adsorbent material, especially for those substances containing refractory organics and non-biodegradable compounds (Abu-Zeid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1995</xref>). The use of coagulants and PAC/GAC, however, introduces the need for proper downstream processing of the generated sludge, to avoid secondary spread of environmental contamination.</p><p id="Par9">Oxidation is a promising removal mechanism for some compounds, especially when performed using strong oxidants, such as chlorine or ozone. Oxidation with these chemicals, however, has been shown to generate by-products, not yet fully studied, and whose effects are mostly unknown, save for a few. Ozone oxidizes substrates either directly, or by producing hydroxyl radicals that react with molecules in the solution. Both ozone and radicals are strongly reactive, and have been proposed by Huber et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>) as promising options for the removal of CECâs.</p><p id="Par10">Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2011</xref>) investigated AOPs removal efficiency of different pharmaceuticals (caffeine, acetaminophen, carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, erythromycin, lincomycin, and codeine) as a function of treatment approach and type of disinfection (free chlorine, ozone, monochloramine, and permanganate). Oxidative removal of these compounds varied significantly: overall, chlorination was proven highly effective, but pH conditions caused notable differences in its efficiency. Permanganate was also effective to decompose some PPCPs.</p><p id="Par11">Other advanced treatments tested for CECs removal include ultra-violet (UV) photolysis, ion exchange, and membrane filtration (Mboula et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2013</xref>): Bisphenol-A (BPA) conversion rates up to 99% were observed; this, however, corresponded to a mineralization ratio of just 40% (implying that the remaining 60% BPA was transformed into intermediate by-products of unknown characteristics). UV and ion-exchange addition may improve CECâs removal, when applied conjunctly to other processes, but cannot be considered feasible stand-alone removal options, as they require absorbed doses about 100 times higher than those needed for disinfection, a result difficult to obtain in real conditions (Adams et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2002</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">Combination of photocatalysis and chemical irradiation for CECs removal was attempted with success, however, also this required long reaction times, between 30Â min and 8Â h, depending on the treated compound. An extensive review on the use of AOPs for CEC (EDs and PPCPs) removal in water effluents was presented by Esplugas et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">At the moment, the attention of researchers seems mostly focused on monitoring methodologies for these compounds, rather than finding generally applicable solutions for their elimination from water (Petrie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2015</xref>). It should be pointed out that these compounds are usually present in water at trace levels (Î¼g/L, or even ng/L); thus, most analytical instruments for their quantification require pre-concentration steps, such as solid phase extraction (SPE), solid phase microextraction (SPME), or accelerated solvent extraction (ASE). Detection methods must be developed accurately for each individual class of compounds and suffer severe limitations when they have to be applied for simultaneous pre-concentration of different contaminants (Bolong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>; Capodaglio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Shortcomings of current technologies</title><p id="Par14">All the process technologies illustrated above have some, more or less significant, drawbacks: almost all require <italic>extended contact times</italic> for removal or destruction of contaminants to occur (in the order of few to several hours, to achieve transformations up to about 90% of the original contaminantsâ mass). Furthermore, even when such transformations occur, they do not necessarily lead to full mineralization of contaminants, as oxidation of these chemicals has often been found to <italic>generate by</italic>-<italic>products</italic>, with mostly unknown effects, which may also be as harmful as the original compounds, or more (Huerta-Fontela et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2011</xref>). These compounds may be found in treated water effluents or in process residuals (e.g., in biological or chemical sludges) with considerable risk of secondary dispersion in the environment.</p><p id="Par15">Destruction of CECs by application of the indicated technologies has shown to be heavily dependent on environmental and process conditions, with possible cross-interference among various factors. Since most of these processes require additives (PAC, nanomaterials, catalysts), these may constitute significant additional process cost factors. Costs may be in the form of process coadjuvants, or in the generation of additional process residues (e.g., spent PAC and nanoparticles, process sludges) that should be properly disposed of. Additionally, when strong oxidants are used, process and operatorâs safety is always an issue. Certain additives, either by improper use or by accident, could themselves cause generation of new pollutants (i.e., disinfection by-products (DBPs), when using chlorine), precursors of carcinogenic compounds, or induce undesired contamination if released into the environment (Bolong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>; Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2009</xref>; Chang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Rationale for high-energy oxidation processes</title><p id="Par16">Radiation processing with high-energy electron accelerators (a.k.a.

The technological progress achieved in these fields has brought the technology to a maturity level economically compatible with many new, diverse applications. Studies on EB application to the water sector can in fact be dated back to the 1950s, supported by positive results, but impaired in their general, wider sectorial application by a then awkward, difficult-to-operate technology. Today, based on modern applications and new studies, promising results obtained in the treatment of emerging pollutants and EDâs in laboratory tests, and on the general industrial improvement of this technology, HEOs application in the water field offers a promise of cost effectiveness and efficiency (IAEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>EB technology</title><p id="Par18">EB irradiation is a process involving the use of electrons charged with high energy (hence the alternative term of <italic>High-Energy Oxidation</italic>), to treat an object, or medium, for a variety of purposes, including modification (as in industrial applications) or destruction (environmental applications) of undesired molecules, or intermolecular links. The basic components of a typical electron beam device are schematized in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>: in a sealed device kept under high vacuum, a heated emitter (cathode) releases electrons that are then accelerated by a grid, using high voltageâpower supply (DC) or radiofrequency (in more compact designs). Electrostatic and/or magnetic fields control beam direction (by focusing and deflection) on an exit window, cut on thin metal foil. Electrons emerge from the window with energy proportional to the high voltage applied to the anode, in quantity depending on cathodic current. By adjusting these parameters, it is possible to control, respectively, penetration of the beam (proportional to energy) and dose rate (proportional to current). The entire apparatus is conceptually very similar (except for the amount of energy involved) to an old-fashioned cathodic-tube television box.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.Â 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Typical EB machine</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10098_2017_1410_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par19">The energy emitted by an EB machine is measured in electronvolt (eV), which by definition is the amount of energy gained (or lost) by the charge of a single electron moving across an electric potential difference of 1Â V.

The irradiation dose is measured in Grey (Gy), defined as the absorption of one joule of radiation energy by one kilogram of matter. As a reference number, a dose of 1.5Â KGy, such as those commonly used to achieve wastewater disinfection, is a relatively low value, in the low range of those adopted, for example, in food distribution industry applications (irradiation of fresh vegetables for fungi and bacteria control, in order to increase product shelf life). The use of direct high voltage to produce the beam allows the conversion of input AC power to beam power with an efficiency greater than 95%, thus making EB irradiation a highly energy-efficient process. By comparison, modern UV systems commonly applied in wastewater disinfection have energy efficiencies (conversion of electric energy to UV) of about 30%, at best.</p><p id="Par20">In traditional industrial applications, the effect of irradiation causes degradation of target molecules, breaking their internal chains and therefore reducing their molecular weight.

Results also demonstrated that, since irradiation was applied before the biological treatment step, the latter showed substantial advantages from the reduced toxicity and improved treatability of the influent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Other industrial wastes and pesticides</title><p id="Par37">Experimental results indicate that radiolytic degradation may be a suitable and effective method for treatment of industrial wastes and pesticides (2,4-D, MCPA, carbendazim, etc.) and that kinetic modeling, based on rate constants of radical reactions involved, can sometimes predict with good or satisfactory agreement such results, proving that the process could also be reliably designed from a theoretic basis (Trojanowicz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Inorganic wastes and other contaminants</title><p id="Par38">Recently, it was shown that EB irradiation of both synthetic and real industrial effluents can result in removal of numerous inorganic components, including heavy metal ions (Ribeiro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2004</xref>). Although this requires rather high absorbed doses (20Â kGy), more than 96% of Cr, Fe, Zn and Co were reduced to insoluble forms, from original g/L concentration levels in the solution. Cadmium seems less susceptible to precipitation by this process, as well as other metals. Removal of Cadmium, Lead (Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">b</xref>) and nitrates (Guo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008a</xref>) from solutions by irradiation were also reported.</p><p id="Par39">Waste metalworking fluids (WMFs) are representative of waste streams that are heavily polluted, toxic, recalcitrant to bio-treatment, and require more sustainable routes of safe disposal. Traditionally, spent WMFs are treated chemically or by evaporation or ultrafiltration, but advances showed that their biological treatment may be a promising cost- and energy-effective option, in particular if combined with advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as Fentonâs reagent, or other hybrid approaches that include biodegradation, electron beam irradiation, and zero-valent nano-iron AOPs, employed individually, or in sequence (Thill et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2016</xref>). Treatment of MWF with EB showed initially no detectable impact on COD removal, however, acute toxicity decreased with increasing absorbed dose, indicating transformation of organic molecules into biodegradable ones. Biological, nano-iron and EB treatment were tested in sequential combinations and permutations to identify the optimum hybrid treatment sequence. The sequence that lead to optimal synergistic detoxification was found to be EB, biological, nanoscale zero-valent iron and an additional biological phase, in that order. Overall COD removal for pristine MWF improved by 92.8Â Â±Â 1.4%, a significantly greater value than with biological treatment on its own. EB pretreatment enabled these waste streams to be biotreated at high concentrations, confirming that, even when employed as a complementary treatment, the feasibility of EB treatment is a realistic and potentially economic option for treating recalcitrant wastewaters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par40">Pollutant removal processes in water and wastewater treatment facilities have been undergoing significant development in the last years due to concerns about new, difficult-to-remove classes of contaminants. Among âinnovativeâ processes, AOPs, mostly based on the reactivity properties of hydroxyl radicals <sup>Â·</sup>OH are a very active research topic today. Strangely enough, one of the most efficient ways for the production of such radicals, water radiolysis by means of ionizing radiation, is often not even mentioned in extensive and comprehensive reviews of the field (Gligorovski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2015</xref>), nor is much known or diffused in current practice. HEO for water and wastewater treatment, currently well known almost only to radiation chemists, could be an innovative <italic>âColumbusâ Eggâ</italic><xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> solution to many emerging problems in the field, known, or yet to be discovered, that could ensure consistent and reliable results that other solutions struggle to deliver. The main advantages of EB processes, discussed in this review, consist of an ample degradation range potential of organic and inorganic contaminants, related to the absorbed energyâdose, and not to reaction time (which is practically instantaneous). Absence of additives, residuals and by-products, the almost total control that can be exerted on the process and its end-points by varying applied energy and adsorbed dose (depending on the desired degree of solutes degradation), and easy energy deliver with a high degree of precision by easy-to-operate facilities are among the advantages of this technology (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). <table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>TableÂ 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Installation cost of EB apparatus with 1Â MeV capacity, as a function of beam power.

For example, in the case of refractory, poorly degradable organic compounds, the process can be used as a pre-treatment to break down large âindigestibleâ molecules to more biodegradable ones. Despite its extended possibilities, it probably would not be economically appropriate to use EB to completely mineralize easily biodegradable organic matter, but its use may be economically advantageous in dealing with other types of complex organics contamination, or to obtain DBPs-free disinfection, and elimination of antibiotic resistant bacteria, a considerable current concern (Amro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>; Gehringer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>; Han et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>; Sungpyo and Aga <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par43">The cost of implementation of a technology strongly underlies almost all of the decision-making in its selection for application. In many cases, the only existing economic analyses for new technologies derive from small-scale, laboratory-level applications, as is in the case of the presented technology. Given the type of technology, its economic feasibility improves with increasing size of electron accelerator apparatus (TableÂ <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), as its unit cost decreases exponentially with installed beam power. Of course, full-scale research in industrial pilot plants should result in a better knowledge of actual costs: TableÂ <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> summarizes literature-reported cases in which costs of processes, including a HEO step, have been reliably estimated, reported in descending date of implementation.
