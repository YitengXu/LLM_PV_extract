sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Electric propulsion is becoming the standard drive technology for satellites. In contrast to conventional chemical engines, the currently most frequently used “fuel” is xenon, an inert gas, which undergoes no chemical reaction and therefore does not contain any energy for the thrust generation. Instead, solar-electric power is used to ionize the propellant and electrostatically accelerate the ions. This way, much higher exhaust velocities are achieved than in case of chemical engines, where the effective exhaust velocity is roughly the thermal speed of the burned hot gas. Since the exhaust velocity also has the physical meaning of force (thrust) per mass flow rate, this important quantity is usually named the specific impulse in the field of electric propulsion. The propellant consumption for a particular mission will therefore be much less if electric engines are applied.</p><p>The most common electric thruster types are ion thrusters like Hall Effect Thrusters (HET) and Gridded Ion Thrusters (GIT), and the long-standing electrothermal thrusters like arcjets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. HETs and GITs produce the ions by the intermediate step of a plasma from which the ions are extracted. To compensate for the permanent loss of positive charge due to the ejected ions, a neutralizer, or cathode, is used that releases electrons into the exhaust plume.</p><p>Plasma based thrusters inherently suffer from a certain amount of neutral gas that unintentionally leaks through the open side of the discharge channel in case of HETs or through the grid holes in case of GITs. The neutral gas interacts with the accelerated ions by means of collisions, in particular by charge-exchange collisions. The latter generate ions with low thermal velocities that form a secondary plasma surrounding the spacecraft (the primary plasma meaning the neutralized exhaust plume) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This secondary, thruster-generated plasma is addressed by the here described <italic>Electric Propulsion Diagnostics Package</italic> (EPDP) for electrically driven spacecraft.</p><p>The plasma surrounding the spacecraft attains, as all low-temperature plasmas, a positive potential with respect to the spacecraft. Therefore, the initially cold, i.e. gas temperature, ions can be accelerated and fall back onto the spacecraft. Close to the thruster exit, where the secondary ions are created, the potential is typically still several tens of volts above the spacecraft potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], so that the ions can reach the spacecraft surface with energies above the sputter threshold.</p><p>Spacecraft often carry sensitive instruments, solar panels and other subsystems that might be disturbed or degraded by the unintended backflow from the applied thruster. The problem is not unique to electric thrusters, it was already known for chemical engines long before the time of electric propulsion systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, it is reasonable and important to ask for such undesired effects in the case of electric propulsion systems, too, and in particular when a new thruster type enters the market.</p><p>Similar attempts to evaluate energetic ion backflow and its surface modifying effects have been made before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The Deep Space 1 mission, launched in 1998 and solar electrically propelled by a gridded ion thruster, already carried a diagnostic package with twelve sensors, including quartz crystal microbalances for an assessment of surface deposition or erosion, calorimeters, a retarding potential analyzer (RPA), and a planar as well as a spherical Langmuir probe (LP) for diagnostics of the plasma environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The in-flight measurements proved the significance of a thruster-induced plasma environment; current densities of 0.1 <italic>μ</italic>A cm <sup>−2</sup> were measured near the thruster exit during the operation of the thruster. One of the findings was that molybdenum from the thruster grids was deposited on the spacecraft surfaces. After 2 750 h of thruster operation, a sensor in direct line-of-sight to the thruster collected a thin film of about 25 nm width, while a shadowed sensor still measured a 2.5 nm layer.</p><p>An in-flight diagnostic system for such effects was also part of the SMART-1 mission launched in 2003 that was driven by a xenon Hall thruster [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. That electric propulsion diagnostic package consisted of an RPA, a spherical LP, and a small solar cell and a quartz microbalance as contamination sensors. The measured ion energy distributions of the backflow exhibited a dominant population with energies about 35 eV; but there was also a plateau with approximately 15 % of the peak rate that extended to approximately 60 eV, from where it decreased and vanished at 90 eV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The floating cathode (neutralizer) of the Hall thruster attained potentials ranging from −5 V up to +10 V along the orbit. The measured erosions were low.</p><p>We want to emphasize the importance of in-flight measurements when it comes to the thruster-generated secondary plasma. The backflow of ions to the spacecraft is a very small unintended side effect that can hardly be imitated in test facilities. In contrast to the situation in space, where the plasma is only in contact with the satellite and can expand freely, chamber walls constitute a plasma confinement due to the plasma sheaths. Moreover, the neutral gas distributions are obviously very different in space and in a test chamber, and it is precisely the gas atoms and their interaction with the accelerated ions that is the cause of the plasma surrounding the spacecraft.</p><p>In this contribution, we report on a joint collaboration of von Hoerner &amp; Sulger GmbH, OHB System AG, and the Christian-Albrechts-Universität zu Kiel for the development of a generic Electric Propulsion Diagnostic Package for satellites propelled by a variety of electric thrusters. The system is planned to fly for the first time on the Heinrich Hertz communications satellite that is scheduled to be launched in 2023 (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It will also be the first time that a Highly Efficient Multistage Plasma Thruster (HEMPT) will be employed in space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

The RPA will be used to measure the energy distribution function of the plasma ions that reach the satellite. It is equipped with four grids, where the outer grid is connected to spacecraft potential and integrated into the slanted surface of the common sensor head. This allows an orientation toward the thruster plume. The planar LP is integrated into the top face of the plasma sensor. The actual probe surface is surrounded by a guard ring that is always kept by the probe electronics at the same potential as the actual probe.

The change of the resistance of a silver meander is monitored during the operation of the thrusters, from which the erosion can directly be calculated. The erosion sensor has its own housing, separate from the plasma sensor [see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>(b)]. This article focuses on the plasma diagnostics part of the EPDP, i.e. the plasma sensor, so that no experimental data pertaining to the erosion sensor will be shown.</p><p>The two sensors will be located behind the thrusters, that is, where the primary plume cannot reach them (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Note that plasma and erosion sensor are mounted at comparable positions relative to the respective thrusters on opposite sides of the satellite. Since the EPDP measures only at two positions on the satellite, it can consequently not provide a complete characterization of the plasma–surface interaction. To close this gap, modeling of the spacecraft environment is very important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The EPDP is expected to provide reliable data for validation and improvement of numerical models.</p><p>The electronics box, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>(b), includes the main electronics of the instrument, particularly all sensor electronics, power supply, and the spacecraft interface. It contains a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), the voltage generators, measurement circuits for RPA and LP, and the resistance measurement electronics for the erosion sensor. Additionally, there are electronics measuring temperatures of two thermistors attached to LP and RPA. All voltages are generated from the DC 28 V satellite bus voltage, and the communication with the spacecraft is via an RS-422 serial interface.</p><p>The electronics box is planned to be accommodated behind one of the thruster radiators, i.e. shadowed from the thrusters. The plasma sensor is mounted on the same radiator that carries the electronics box on its back side at a distance of 55 cm from the thruster exit [see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>(b)]. The 45 <sup>∘</sup> slanted face of the plasma sensor, in which the RPA is integrated, points toward the center of the HEMPT exit. The erosion sensor will be attached to the other radiator diagonally opposite to the plasma sensor [see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>(a)].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The retarding potential analyzer</title><p>An RPA essentially consists of a biased grid placed between the entrance and a collector plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Only the charged particles with kinetic energies exceeding the grid potential overcome the potential barrier and reach the collector. The RPA can therefore be regarded as a high-pass energy filter.</p><p>In addition to the mentioned discriminating grid, more grids are necessary in order to obtain meaningful signals at the collector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The RPA comprises four titanium grids, which can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The first (entrance) grid is electrically and mechanically integrated into the surface of the sensor head and therefore at spacecraft potential. The purpose of this grid is to electrostatically become part of the conductive surface of the satellite without disturbing the ambient plasma. At the same time, most of the plasma electrons are repelled in the plasma sheath between entrance grid and plasma. However, the ions accelerated by the potential drop between plasma and satellite ground will pass through the grid. Electrons with sufficient kinetic energy can overcome the potential barrier and pass through the grid, too. These electrons are to be sorted out electrostatically, otherwise their current onto the collector would partially neutralize the ion current, in which we are interested. In order to repel these electrons, the second (repeller) grid is used; it is negatively biased, e.g. at −20 V. Behind the above mentioned third (discriminator) grid, another electron repelling grid is used. This one reflects ion-induced secondary electrons that are generated at the collector surface by the ions that hit the collector. If these emitted secondary electrons were lost, their current would be misinterpreted as an additional ion current. Obviously, this grid needs to be sufficiently negative with respect to the collector, which is the potential of origin of the secondary electrons. We keep this secondary electron grid at the same negative potential as the plasma electron repeller grid by driving it with the same voltage supply.

However, in those cases it is used as an instrument for the determination of ion beam current densities, but here, we use it as a plasma diagnostic tool, and the notion of a plane Langmuir probe therefore describes its function much better [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

The key physical effect to be measured is the sputtering of metallic silver from an exposed detector surface due to the bombardment with particles emitted by the HEMPT.</p><p>The measurement principle of the erosion sensor is based on a resistance measurement of a thin silver layer. By measuring its resistance change over time, the erosion rate can be calculated. The silver layer in its current design is a 2 <italic>μ</italic>m thick, 1 mm wide, and 180 cm long meander, extending over an area of 2 cm ×10 cm on a rectangular ceramic substrate plate, which results in a resistance of approximately 15 <italic>Ω</italic>. The meander structure becomes necessary to increase the sensor resistance to a reasonable value compared to the wire resistance of the harness.</p><p>A photo of the erosion sensor can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>(b). The rectangular surface is the ceramic plate with the conductive thin film path. To lower thermal stress and prevent cracks of the ceramic, it is fixed by metallic springs. The erosion sensor is connected through a D-Sub connector and mounted to the spacecraft by M4 screws.</p><p>For the resistance measurement, four wires are used to remove the influence of the connecting wires by separating the stimulus wires from the sensing wires. Since the expected temperatures can range from approximately −80 <sup>∘</sup>C to +110 <sup>∘</sup>C, thermal effects are subtracted from the signal by using information from a thermistor attached to the ceramic. Possible radio-frequency disturbance from the thruster and other electromagnetic interference sources are filtered out from the measurement signal by the measurement electronics. Also a possible strong DC current flow produced by the HEMPT and solar wind effects have to be considered, which may generate a DC offset in the measurement signal; therefore, an AC measurement principle is employed. The erosion sensor has a measurement resolution of 10 nm.</p><p>We emphasize that the erosion sensor is not suitable for measuring deposition of material. Unlike a quartz microbalance, the measuring method described here can only detect erosion. If deposition is to be expected, for example of conductive grid material in the case of GITs, then the erosion sensor would not be the method of choice. A dielectric coating would hinder the measurement process, while a conductive coating would cause short circuits of the meander.</p><p>Tests, in particular for the wide range of operating temperatures, are still to be carried out and will be subject of a future publication.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>The test environment: setup and methods</title><p>In contrast to typical measurements in test chambers, the three diagnostics onboard the satellite will not be exposed directly to the thruster plume as it was explained in the section “<xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">The electric propulsion diagnostic package (EPDP): setup and methods</xref>” (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Instead, the sensors measure the <italic>dilute backflow</italic> from the thruster plume that feeds the plasma around the spacecraft. In order to create a plasma environment similar to the situation aboard a satellite, we use a broad-beam ion source that has been described in detail in various publications, e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and place the plasma sensor at a position <italic>outside the beam</italic> so that the beam will not strike the diagnostics.

An antenna emits approximately 360 W of 2.4 GHz microwaves into the source chamber. The potential in the ceramic source chamber is raised by an inner ring anode and defines the accelerating potential and strong electric field in the grid system. For the tests, only two anode potentials are used: +1 200 V and 0 V.</p><p>The latter setting applies to the tests where the RPA is directly exposed to a beam of ions with lower energies; this position is denoted by “Pos. 2” in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>(a).

The screen with aperture reduces the beam diameter from 125 mm to 80 mm. The beam dump is made of carbon fiber velvet, which not only has a very low sputtering yield, but also a very low ion-induced (or induced by fast neutrals) secondary electron emission yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>The plasma sensor is mounted on the turnable and laterally movable platform together with a Faraday cup, which does not belong to the EPDP.

The distance of the RPA entrance grid and the Faraday cup aperture (diameter 5.7 mm) to the screen is 37 cm throughout the tests.

The 11 mm long probe tip made of a 100 <italic>μ</italic>m tungsten wire can be moved across the ion beam at a distance of 35 cm from the screen for a measurement of the plasma potential profile, and in particular it is used for a characterization of the plasma in front of the EPDP sensor head.</p><p>The RPA can be moved into the beam and rotated about its vertical axis until it faces the beam source, with the center of the entrance grid lying on the rotation axis.

The most abundant energy is where the derivative peaks are. (Note that the first derivatives with the unit nA/V are a measure of the rate at which ions of a given energy interval impinge on a surface, i.e. ions per m<sup>2</sup>, s, and eV, which is different from the number density per energy interval in a volume element, i.e. ions per m<sup>3</sup> and eV.)</p><p>One can clearly notice the shift of the curves on the discriminator voltage axis.

This means that the injected electrons, which fall from the negative hot filament potential into the attractive plasma, do not affect much its potential. The emitted electrons traverse the plasma and are absorbed by the walls: The hot filament and the walls act like a thermionic diode. In this case, plasma and filament can maintain different potentials. The situation changes for cathode potentials ≥0 V, at which the electrons are trapped in the chamber, because the electric field in the plasma sheaths reflects them. Now, the hot filament is “connected” to the plasma via the plasma electrons (not the thermionic electrons): The filament in the plasma resembles a second diode, whose forward direction is for positive filament voltages with respect to the plasma potential. In this regime, the plasma potential increases linearly with the cathode bias voltage with a slope of approximately 0.7 for both probes. Finally, the plasma sheath at the chamber walls acts as a diode, too: For shifted plasma potentials <italic>U</italic> below the undisturbed plasma potential, the electron current across the sheath increases exponentially with the potential shift (the current is proportional to the Boltzmann factor exp(<italic>eU</italic>/<italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic><sub>e</sub>)).

Here, the behavior is similar: The energy profile is roughly flat at (8.3±0.5) eV for the negative cathode bias voltages and linearly increasing with increasing positive cathode bias voltages (0.56 eV per V). However, the transition between the two regimes seems to be shifted by approximately 10 V in the positive direction. This could find an explanation in the different plasma potentials at the hot filament position and at the beam positions where the ions are created by charge-exchange collisions.</p><p>We learned from these preliminary experiments that the application of positively biased hot filaments is a simple and efficient method to shift the plasma potential in the beam and to rise the energies of the secondary ions. On a spacecraft, such potential shifts may occur unintentionally for various reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Variation of the repeller grid voltages</title><p>These measurements aim at a correct or optimal choice of the RPA repeller voltages. The two repeller grids are driven by the same voltage supply and connected to each other in the sensor housing; a common wire in the harness connects them to the electronics box. Figure <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> shows IEDFs for the 1.2 keV Xe ion beam with the plasma sensor still in the position “Pos. 1” in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>(a).

The peak width saturates at its lowest half width (0.6 eV) for the repeller voltages from approximately −16 V to −8 V. The finding, that already moderate repeller voltages are sufficient for preventing the plasma electrons from passing through the outer repeller grid, reflects the fact that the electron temperatures are small under the given beam conditions, namely below 1 eV in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>(c). However, the capability of the hardware to change the repeller voltages can be used for an in-flight fine tuning of the RPA.</p><p>One has to keep in mind that the ion beam is not monoenergetic, so that the minimum measured widths of less than ±1 eV can be used as a conservative estimate of the resolution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>In the idling beam</title><p>In the following, the RPA is moved into the beam, where it is exposed to the primary ions from the ion source. However, as described in “<xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">The test environment: setup and methods</xref>”, the anode voltage of the ion source is 0 V, so that only the plasma potential in the source relative to ground potential accelerates the ions.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Two ion populations</title><p>The RPA is facing directly the ion source, but is laterally moved out of the central position “Pos. 2” marked in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>(a). The panel in Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> shows collector currents and resulting IEDFs for three different positions: on the beam axis, at the edge of the beam, i.e. 40 mm away from the axis, and 100 mm away from the axis. The current profiles exhibit three discriminator grid voltage regimes separated from each other by two negative flanks, one at a low energy below 10 eV and another one above 100 eV. The flanks result in IEDFs with two peaks. The two peaks mean two ion populations, one at (6.5±2.0) eV and one at (107±5) eV, which can clearly be distinguished since they have small widths compared to their distance. This double-humped ion energy distribution function can easily be understood: The population with higher energies are the primary ions from the “idling” ion source, and the population with lower energies are the secondary, charge-exchange generated ions.

This reflects the beam profile, to which we come back in connection with the absolute calibration of the RPA. In contrast, the secondary ions approximately stay at the same rate; this seems to be a rather complicated result of the respective “drainage volume”, the volume from where the RPA collects these ions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Directivity of the RPA</title><p>The following test assesses the directivity, or angle dependent sensitivity, of the RPA. The RPA is placed in the central position “Pos. 2” marked in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>(a), i.e. at the beam axis, where it is rotated up to approximately 25<sup>∘</sup> in both directions.</p><p>Figure <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref> shows the currents measured by the collector segments at the different angles of incidence for the low energy ion beam. Two major results can be extracted from the data. First, the sensitivity of the RPA decreases within 15<sup>∘</sup> to less than one half. (The effect of the cosine of the angle is less than 4%.) Second, the outer collector segments are very sensitive to the angle of incidence. For example, the segment 3, which is oriented in the direction in that the spot on the collector plate is shifted, reaches its maximum current value at an impact angle of approximately −15<sup>∘</sup>. The other two segments point 60<sup>∘</sup> upward and downward due to the trisection of the outer segments. Therefore, segments 1 and 2 reach their respective maxima already at smaller angles of incidence than +15<sup>∘</sup>. The up–down asymmetry between the segments 1 and 2 seems to be due to the broken symmetry of the setup in the vertical direction. For example, the translation stages and the cathode are in the lower half of the cylindrical chamber, while the upper half is essentially empty.

The currents measured by the RPA are significantly smaller than the currents that arrive at the plane of the outer grid. A part of the ions and electrons ends at one of the four grids, and another small part, depending on the angle of incidence, reaches the collector plate beyond the collector segments.</p><p>Moreover, the trajectories not only depend on the ion energies and directions, but also on the current density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Especially the ion population with energies corresponding to the descriminator grid potential slows down to very low speeds in the vicinity of the discriminator grid. Hence, the ion density increases there significantly, which can result in a high space charge and a local potential above the discriminator grid potential. At low ion current densities, as a result of lower plasma densities, the latter effect can be neglected. In conclusion, the measured currents and the derived absolute heights of the obtained IEDF are to be interpreted with caution. (Note that this warning does not refer to the measured ion energies, but to the absolute values.)</p><p>Nevertheless, the here described method provides a conversion factor that allows a rough estimate of the ion current density from the actually measured collector currents at vanishing discriminator potentials.</p><p>Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>(a) shows the total current at a discriminator grid voltage of 0 V as a black curve. In this case, all ions can, at least in principle, reach one of the collector segments. The red curve depicts the total current at a discriminator grid voltage of +40 V. In this case, only ions with kinetic energies that exceed 40 eV can pass through the discriminator grid. The difference between both, i.e. the ions with kinetic energies less than 40 eV, is plotted as the blue curve.

This reflects the presence of charge-exchange ions at all these positions. In contrast, the ions with high energy (above 40 eV) are concentrated about the beam axis and vanish completely at a distance of 100 mm from the axis. Remember that the aperture of the screen has a radius of 40 mm. The width of the Gaussian best-fit curve for the total current is approximately 40 mm, too. The energetic ions can therefore be identified as the primary ions from the ion source.</p><p>The second part of the calibration method consists of Faraday cup measurements at the same positions where the RPA measured under the same conditions. To this end, the translation stage with the two diagnostics is moved twice through the beam, the first time with the RPA directed toward the beam, and a second time, on the way back, after a rotation by 45<sup>∘</sup>, with the Faraday cup directed toward the beam.</p><p>Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>(b) shows the resulting current densities. In case of the Faraday cup, we simply calculate the current density from the measured current and the cross section of its aperture. The profile resembles the total current measured by the RPA in that it has an inner Gaussian part for the radii up to 50 mm and a broader outer part. From the discussion of the RPA measurement, we conclude that the inner part is dominated by the energetic ions from the ion source and the outer part consists only of charge-exchange ions created in the plume.</p><p>The Gaussian best-fit curve for the Faraday cup data results in a width of approximately 50 mm. This is one quarter broader than in case of the RPA. The reason could be found in the much greater acceptance angle of the Faraday cup. At radii somewhat larger than 40 mm, which is the core radius of the beam cylinder, there are still beam ions due to the beam divergence, which we assume for an ion energy of 1.2 keV in the order of magnitude of a few degrees, probably less than 10<sup>∘</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These oblique energetic beam ions fully contribute to the current measured by the Faraday cup, but they are significantly attenuated by the ion optics in the RPA.</p><p>Therefore, such a calibration of the RPA currents makes only sense for perpendicularly incident ions and vanishing discriminator voltages.

The tests are not intended to perfectly imitate the situation on the satellite in space, which is impossible. For example, even for the same relative geometrical arrangement of thruster and plasma sensor, we expect the measured plasma density in space to be significantly lower than in the test environment. The reasons are the lower background gas density and the missing plasma confinement by potential drops at chamber walls.</p><p>The cylindrical test chamber has a diameter of 2.4 m and a length of 4.5 m and is equipped with cryogenic pumps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The thruster was operated with the same settings as they will be on the satellite. For this test, two editions of the EPDP hardware were available, so that both could be used in parallel: the engineering model, which was also used in the previously described tests in the HIBEX chamber, and its predecessor, the demonstrator model. The two models differ only in that the engineering model has a mass optimized (thinner and lighter) case. The position and orientation of the engineering model sensor were chosen according to the planned installation on the satellite (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>). The length of the line of sight from the engineering model to the plume was 36 cm. The demonstrator model sensor was placed at a different position with a distance of 55 cm to the plume.

The three diagnostics, a retarding potential analyzer, a plane Langmuir probe, and an erosion sensor were described in detail. Tests of the two former instruments were included in this article, while the tests of the erosion sensor are still to be carried out.</p><p>A novel, suitable test environment for simulating the situation in space in an idealized form was introduced that is based on a broad-beam ion source. The neutral gas density in the beam chamber enables charge-exchange collisions between beam ions and neutral atoms. The created thermal ions flow radially out of the beam toward the cylindrical chamber wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These charge-exchange ions created along the beam are used to mimic the backflow of ions created behind the thruster to the spacecraft.</p><p>In the first part of the demonstrated testing, the plasma diagnostics were placed near the chamber wall in order to be exposed only to the secondary, charge-exchange ions, and not to the direct irradiation of the energetic beam ions.</p><p>A further feature of the test environment is the capability of controlled manipulations of the plasma potential in the beam and, related to the former, the energy of the secondary ions. This was achieved by a variable bias of the hot filament in the beam chamber, which was placed a few centimeters from the beam. It was shown that the hot filament is able to pull the plasma potential up, but it is not possible to push the plasma potential down. The behavior could be explained with the diode-like electron conductivity between filament and wall (thermionic electrons), filament and plasma (plasma electrons), and plasma and wall (sheath). Thus, the application of hot filament biases that are positive with respect to the undisturbed plasma potential is an excellent way of controlling the plasma potential in the beam. The technique was successfully applied for shifting the energies of the ions. Accordingly, the LP registered shifts of the plasma potential.</p><p>Furthermore, this satellite-like sensor position outside the beam was used for tuning the secondary electron repeller voltages of the RPA. It was found that the repeller voltages can be optimized with regard to the energy resolution, however, the determination of the peak energy of an almost monoenergetic beam was little affected by the choice of the repeller voltages.</p><p>The ion beam setup enabled another important model situation. For this purpose, the broad-beam ion source was operated without the application of an external acceleration voltage, so that a relatively weak beam with energies in the order of magnitude of only 100 eV, instead of 1.2 keV, was created. Under these conditions, it was possible to move the RPA into this “idling beam” without it being damaged. The RPA detected two ion populations with narrow energy distributions, which could be identified as the primary and secondary ions. It was confirmed by the RPA on a translation stage that the primary ions were concentrated within the beam cross-section, whereas the secondary, charge-exchange ions exhibited a flat profile across the chamber diameter.</p><p>The idling beam configuration was used, firstly, for a calibration of the RPA with the aid of an additional Faraday cup that was moved along with the RPA on the same path. A calibration constant, by which the unretarded RPA collector current can be translated into the current density measured by the Faraday cup, was successfully determined.</p><p>The idling beam was, secondly, also used for an assessment of the directivity of the RPA. The instrument was mounted on a rotation stage that enabled variable ion incidence angles. It was found that the RPA has an acceptance angle (apex) of approximately 30 <sup>∘</sup> (full width of half maximum), and that the segmented collector with three outer 120 <sup>∘</sup> ring segments is very sensitive to oblique irradiation.</p><p>The tests make the developers of the Electric Propulsion Diagnostic Package confident that its instruments will soon collect valuable data on the side effects of the thruster-generated secondary plasma. The instrument will hopefully fly on the Heinrich Hertz satellite from 2023 on.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>FB and MH performed the development of the instrument control unit including the measurement electronics and the Erosion Sensor, supported the tests in the HIBEX chamber, and performed the test with the HEMPT.
