The volumes of these brines range from hundreds of liters to tens of thousands of cubic meters per day, depending on the type and scale of the industrial sectors. Currently, most of the waste brines, especially brines produced in seawater desalination plants, are directly discharged into adjacent open water bodies, e.g., rivers, lakes, near shore seawater, and the rest are injected underground in deep wells or treated in evaporation ponds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These conventional methods have been proved to have detrimental effects on aquatic ecosystems and land vegetation systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Thus, with ever tightening environmental regulations and increasing public environmental awareness, these direct or semi-direct disposal of the waste brines is facing strong criticism. As an ambitious target for brine treatment, the concept of zero liquid discharge (ZLD) has received renewed attentions recently, since it aims to eliminate all waste liquid and produce solid salts as the only byproduct<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">A typical ZLD process is composed of a concentration system, which concentrates the original source brine to near saturation, and a crystallization system that completely removes all residual water from the brine to produce solid salts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In the past decades, the concentration system has been significantly improved by various technologies, including reverse osmosis (RO), electrodialysis, membrane distillation (MD), and mechanical vapor compression concentrator, etc. However, the improvement in the crystallization system is very sluggish because all membrane based desalination technologies cannot work with near-saturation brines due to salt scaling and fouling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The current brine crystallization is mainly achieved either by brine crystallizers or by evaporation ponds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The conventional brine crystallizers use electricity or fossil fuel to heat the brines for bulk water evaporation and thus salt crystallization with high energy consumption (&gt;50 kWh m<sup>−3</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In addition, the use of pressure container made from expensive corrosion resistant materials brings high capital cost of the brine crystallizers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The application of evaporation pond, on the other hand, is limited by its restricted capacity, high land cost, and low solar energy efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Therefore, the crystallization system has been the bottleneck of the ZLD brine treatment, but it receives very little attention mainly because of the lack of new strategies.</p><p id="Par5">Photothermal material assisted solar driven water evaporation is gaining popularity as an environmental friendly way to produce water vapor for clean water production via solar distillation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In such a process, solar energy is harvested and converted to heat by the photothermal materials, and thus to produce water vapor from various source water, such as seawater, in a solar still. Then the condensate from the water vapor is collected as fresh water. Salt precipitation on the photothermal material during operation is considered troublesome because it affects the light absorption of the photothermal material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Several rationally designed structures have been reported in the last several years to eliminate the surface salt precipitation by making salt rejecting photothermal devices via facilitating the accumulated salts diffusion back to the source water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In 2016, Mi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> regarded the salt accumulation on the photothermal material as an opportunity to achieve ZLD desalination in a solar still setup. When 15 wt% pure NaCl aqueous brine was used as source water, a thick layer of accumulated NaCl crystals formed on top of their two dimensional (2D) graphene oxide (GO) membrane. The white salt layer significantly decreased light absorption of the device, and led to a considerable reduction in evaporation rate. However, a stable water evaporation rate of 0.5 kg m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> was still recorded, indicating the salt precipitation did not block the evaporation. In 2018, a three dimensional (3D) cup-shaped solar evaporator which separated the light adsorption surface from the salt precipitation surface was reported. This design enabled an unimpeded sunlight absorption and in turn a much higher and long-term stable water evaporation rate (e.g., 1.26 kg m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>) even at a near saturated brine (25 wt% NaCl brine)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. It should be noted the above-mentioned evaporation rates were both achieved in open space without collecting the condensate. Even for the 3D cup structure, the clean water production rate was only ~0.5 kg m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> when placed inside a solar still. Therefore, the direct ZLD desalination can be achieved by this advanced solar distillation but only with less than 35% energy efficiency for seawater.</p><p id="Par7">One of the major advantages of solar driven water evaporation process is that the water removal rate is only slightly affected by the salt concentration of the source water, and latent heat of highly concentrated NaCl brine is lower than that of pure water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. On the contrary, the energy consumption and operation cost significantly increases with the increase of salt concentration in membrane-based process, especially RO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Thus, instead of one process achieving all, it is a more attractive and energy efficient strategy to first use conventional processes (e.g., RO and MD) to produce clean water from regular seawater and to concentrate brines with low concentrations to near saturation, and then to employ the solar driven water evaporation for salts crystallization from the near-saturation brines to achieve ZLD goal.</p><p id="Par8">In this work, we rationally designed a new 3D solar crystallizer device operated with dead-end type solar driven water removal mode (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), in which water evaporation surface and light absorption surface are physically separated by an aluminum sheet with high thermal conductivity. Its bottom and inner wall act as the sunlight absorbing component with a high light absorptance of 0.99, while its outer wall surface serves as the water evaporation surface and consequently salt crystallization surface. The high thermal conductivity of the aluminum separator benefits effectively conducting the heat generated at the bottom of the device to its wall for water evaporation. All these features result in a high solar-to-vapor performance of the device. This device produced high water removal performance (1.61 kg m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>) under one sun illumination when treating pure NaCl brine with 24 wt% concentration. However, when directly treating concentrated real seawater brines, a quick decline followed by a close to zero water evaporation rate was recorded by the same solar crystallizer. Comparing the crystallization behavior of pure NaCl brine and real seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) brine, it was found that the scaling formed by magnesium species, which has not received enough attention in current researches in this field, clogged water transport channels and then caused performance degradation. Here, the salt crystallization inhibitor, nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA), was introduced into the same real seawater source brines to modulate salt crystallization behaviors on the outer surface of the solar crystallizer, successfully, resulting in dense scaling crust layer-free salt crystallization while treating real brine. The application of the solar crystallizer coupled with small amount (only 8.4 wt‰ of the salt) of salt crystallization inhibitor was demonstrated for treating highly concentrated SWRO brine (21.6 wt%) for 288 h and showed a very high and stable water evaporation rate of 2.42 kg m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>. Moreover, the solar crystallizer array exhibited a daily water evaporation rate of 48.0 kg m<sup>−2</sup> in the outdoor field test, showing a great potential for practical application. It is believed that this simple but promising strategy provides a low-cost and sustainable solution especially for small to medium-sized industrial brine treatment with ZLD, where both solar irradiation and access to land are available.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Schematic illustration of solar crystallization device.</title><p><bold>a</bold> A scheme of the solar crystallizer; <bold>b</bold> schematic of cross section view of the solar crystallizer.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2021_21124_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Structure and design of the 3D solar crystallizer</title><p id="Par9">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> presents a schematic diagram of the 3D solar crystallizer with an open box structure with one bottom closed. The bottom and wall of the crystallizer are bi-layered in configuration. The inner layer is a commercially available spectrally selective solar absorber (Alanod<sup>®</sup>) homogeneously coated on an aluminum sheet and serves as photothermal component. The outer layer of the solar crystallizer is a porous and hydrophilic quartz glass fibrous filter membrane (QGF membrane, Merck<sup>®</sup>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). The outer QGF membrane, when wet, is directly stuck onto the backside of the aluminum sheet via capillary force without any glue. It wicks brine from the source brine reservoir and allows the brine to spread over the entire outer surface during operation. The inner layer of the 3D crystallizer acts as the light absorbing surface while the outer QGF membrane serves as water transportation and evaporation surface. The aluminum sheet completely separates the two active surfaces and has a desirably high thermal conductivity (~200 W m<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>), which is beneficial for the heat conduction. The solar crystallizer is directly placed on top of an expanded polystyrene foam with a low thermal conductivity (<italic>K</italic> = 0.03 W m<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>) to minimize the heat loss to the bulk brine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The source brine is transported from the reservoir to the solar crystallizer by a one-dimensional (1D) QGF strip in the middle of the device via capillary action<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">When sunlight is illuminated onto the crystallizer directly from the above, it is absorbed by the photothermal coating at the bottom of the device to generate heat. As illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, the generated heat is then effectively conducted to the wall part owing to the high thermal conductivity of the aluminum sheet, and thereafter drives the water evaporation and the ultimately precipitation of salts exclusively on the outer wall of the crystallizer. By design, our 3D solar crystallizer completely physically separates its light absorbing surface and water evaporation and thus salt precipitation surface, which solves the drawback of precipitating salt crystals affecting light absorption otherwise inherent in 2D devices and allows for two surfaces to be independently optimized.</p><p id="Par11">Considering the size and shape of the output beam of the available solar simulator (Newport 94021A), the designed 3D solar crystallizer was fabricated to have a tetragonal cup-shaped structure with the bottom side length of 31 mm.

It is further shown that the evaporation rate well above the theoretical limit of a full solar-energy utilization is achieved therein and it increases almost linearly with the height of the solar crystallizer, which is in a good agreement with the experimental results measured in lab (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>).

The higher heat conductivity of the 3D crystallizer in this work may be the major reason. In these two 3D structures, the light directly hits only on the bottom part of the devices and is in situ converted to heat via photothermal effect. The low thermal conductivity of the device reported by Shi et al. makes its bottom part having a much higher temperature than the wall part, which increases the heat loss via thermal radiation. As a proof, our 3D crystallizer showed a relatively uniform temperature distribution under solar radiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>).

The result that the concentrated SWRO brine with a higher salt concentration (i.e., 21.6 wt%) showed a slightly higher water evaporation rate than the concentrated seawater (i.e., 16.8 wt%) is a surprise, which presumably is caused by their different compositions (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">However, after the first 4 h, a significant reduction in the water evaporation rates was observed for both real brines.

In the former case, the water evaporation keeps stable for a long period of time, while it drops quickly in the latter case, which is ascribed to the huge difference in salt crust structures in the two cases. The dense salt crust surface layer along with the salt crystals filling inside the QGF membrane in the case of the concentrated SWRO brine leads to the failure of the 3D crystallizer during the long term operations.</p><p id="Par33">In order to ascertain the mechanism of forming the dense salt crust layers and inner pore filling crystals in the case of the real seawater brines, the crystallization behaviors of pure NaCl brine and concentrated SWRO brine were investigated and compared (the experimental details can be found in SI). The SEM images of the crystals formed by evaporating 20 wt% pure NaCl brine (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S14</xref>) show individual and well separated cubic crystals only. For pure NaCl brine, as water is being removed from the evaporation surface, the temperature is lowered and the salt concentration is increased on the surface, which makes the salt crystals tend to precipitate on the outer surface and therefore it keeps the water channel inside the QGF membrane unblocked. Thus, the NaCl salt crust tends to growth along the out-of-plane direction to gradually increase its thickness and to maintain its porosity relatively consistent. The porosity of the salt crust formed by pure NaCl brine (20 wt%) is 19.3% based on mercury intrusion porosimetry measurement. As illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, the loosely packed pure NaCl salt crust layer permits liquid water and water vapor transport, which explains the stable water evaporation performance with pure NaCl brine.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Schematic illustration of accumulated salt crystals.</title><p>The salt layer when using solar crystallizer to treat <bold>a</bold> pure NaCl brine, <bold>b</bold> concentrated SWRO brine and <bold>c</bold> concentrated SWRO brine with NTA.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2021_21124_Fig5_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par34">For the salt crystal aggregation formed from concentrated SWRO brine, the SEM images show mixed crystal phases, with cubic crystals dominating and the gap space between the cubes being filled with some wax-like substances (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>).

As the salt precipitates during water evaporation, NaCl, as the most abundant species, precipitates dominantly while highly hydrous magnesium sulfate, as a minor species, precipitates only in the gap space among the cubic NaCl crystals. As the hydrous magnesium sulfate gradually fills the pore space among the NaCl crystals, at one point, a dense crust layer is formed on the surface, which renders the evaporation substrate unable to deliver water to the outer surface and thus water evaporation stops. At the same time, the suppressed evaporation with the real seawater brines leads to a much smaller negative temperature gradient from the outer to inner side of the QGF membrane and a decreased water flux from the inner side of the QGF membrane to its outer side, which benefits the salt ions back diffusion to the inner side. As a result, the inner side of the QGF membrane possesses the similar temperature and salt concentration to the outer surface, and thus promotes salt precipitation inside the membrane, unlike the case of pure NaCl brine.</p><p id="Par36">To solve this problem, a salt crystallization inhibition strategy involving adding NTA into real SWRO was then proposed. The NTA makes cubic NaCl crystal become dendritic-shaped<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Predictably, it will lead the formation of a highly porous aggregation layer on the outer surface of QGF membrane. The large pore volume of the crust layer makes the available MgSO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O not able to entirely fill the pore space among the NaCl crystals, always maintaining sufficient pore space available for water transport to the evaporation surface.</p><p id="Par37">In order to assess the efficacy of this strategy, we firstly investigated the effect of NTA on the crystallization behavior of NaCl crystal and its porosity. Twelve weight % of pure NaCl aqueous brines with different amount of NTA in it were used as source brines, and treated with the 3D solar crystallizer under otherwise the same conditions. At the end of 10-h operation, the morphologies of the salt crust layers show a strong dependence on the amount of NTA added in the NaCl brine, transitioning from hard salt layer to a fluffy pom-poms like structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S15</xref>) with the NTA concentrations increasing from 0, 4.2, 8.4, 16.8, 25.2 to 42.0‰. However, the XRD patterns of these salt crusts (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S16</xref>) did not show any significant change in their crystal phases, indicating that the presence of NTA did not affect the NaCl crystal type. However, the XRD patterns reveal that, with the co-presence of NTA in the brines along with NaCl, the growth of &lt;1 0 0&gt; crystal faces was hindered while &lt;1 1 0&gt; faces of NaCl crystals were preferred instead, indicated by the great change in the intensity ration between &lt;1 0 0&gt; diffraction peak and &lt;1 1 0&gt; diffraction peak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Moreover, the SEM observation clearly demonstrates the shape of the NaCl crystals gradually turned from perfect cubic to dendritic shape (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S17</xref>) (More details and discussions can be found in Supplementary Note S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">4</xref>). Consequently, it leads to a significant change of the physical properties of the salt crust layers. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>, when the NTA concentrations in the source NaCl brines increased from 0, 8.4 to 42‰, the apparent densities of the NaCl crystal aggregates decreased from 0.97, 0.18 to 0.17 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, the porosity increased from 12.4, 58.3, to 84.8%, and the specific surface area increased from 0.08, 4.49, to 11.4 m<sup>2</sup>/g, respectively. All these results demonstrate that a small amount of NTA can significantly increase the porosity of NaCl crust layer by converting the shape of the NaCl crystal from cubic shape to dendritic shape.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>The physical property of the salt crystals in the presence of NTA.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The SEM images of the salt crystals in the presence of NTA; <bold>b</bold> the porosity and surface area of each salt samples; inset photo shows 0.4 g collected salt crystals formed from 12 wt% NaCl brine with (1) 0‰, (2) 4.2‰, (3) 8.4‰, (4) 16.8‰, (5) 25.2‰ and (6) 42.0‰ NTA in cuvette (the bottom side length: 10 mm).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2021_21124_Fig7_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par38">Then the real seawater brines with different amount of NTA were used as source brines and treated by the solar crystallizer. As presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>, the collected salt crystals also turned into dendritic shape in the presence of NTA. The porosity of the surface accumulated salt increased from 1.00 to 43.54% as the NTA concentrations were increased from 0 to 12.6 ‰ (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S18</xref>). It should be pointed out that MgSO<sub>4</sub> is quite uniformly distributed in the salt crust layer along the out-of-plane direction. The sodium-to-magnesium molar ratio of the surface crust after a 24-h operation is 12.6, which is consistent with that of the raw concentrated SWRO brine (13.1), suggesting that the magnesium would not selectively accumulate in the inner side nor the surface side. This feature is another reason for the excellent long-term operation stability of the 3D solar crystallizer as it ensures a stable porous structure of the salts crust layer. All these results strongly support the effectiveness of our proposed strategy of salt crystallization inhibition to control pore spaces of crystallized salt aggregates.</p><p id="Par39">Note that the NTA is one of the various salt crystallization inhibitors to modify the morphology of NaCl crystal. Evaluation of the performance of other salt crystallization inhibitors is necessary in the future to further improve the performance of solar crystallizer while treating different brines with different compositions.</p><p id="Par40">In addition, the scalability of solar crystallizer is also a critically important consideration. The solar crystallizer can be easily scaled up by enlarging its size and the brine treatment capacity of such a system can be multiplied by applying an array of the solar crystallizers. A few enlarged devices with varying magnification ratios were fabricated. Their similar evaporation rates prove the size magnification does not affect the performance significantly when they are used as a single unit. Then twelve solar crystallizers were assembled to form an array and the array was challenged to treat the highly concentrated real SWRO brine of 21.6 wt% outdoors. It turns out that the array delivered a high water evaporation rate of 48.0 kg m<sup>−2</sup>, showing its great potential for practical brine treatment. Under the field conditions, the solar incident angle, ambient temperature, relative humidity and natural wind all affect the performance of the solar crystallizer. Comprehensive evaluation of such effects is necessary for the practical application of the solar crystallizer towards practical ZLD brine treatment.</p><p id="Par41">It has to be cautiously pointed out that the solar crystallizer at this point might not be very effective in treating large volume of the brine due to its large land requirement. However, comparing with the commercial ZLD system, which costs $250000 to over $2 million with the capacity of 5–100 m<sup>3</sup> per day (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.samcotech.com/how-much-will-a-zero-liquid-discharge-system-cost-your-facility/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.samcotech.com/how-much-will-a-zero-liquid-discharge-system-cost-your-facility/</ext-link>), the solar crystallizer offers a low-barrier-of-entry option for treating brine with small to medium volume. For example, for a medium-sized chemical plant producing around 15 m<sup>3</sup> concentrated brine every day, there will be an area of around 300 m<sup>2</sup> solar crystallizer array plus interdevice space required to treat the brine with ZLD. Moreover, due to its simple setup, the array can be placed on the rooftop of factory buildings, which would further reduce its land footprint. The detailed discussions on the scalability of the solar crystallizer can be found in Supplementary Note S<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>. With ongoing work further improving the performance of the solar crystallizer, it is expected that the next-generation solar crystallizer will widen its application perspective.</p><p id="Par42">The 3D solar crystallizer in conjunction with salt crystallization inhibitor in this work provides an opportunity for ZLD treatment of real seawater brines with long-term stability. The salt crystallization inhibitor modulates the morphology of salt crystals and solves the troublesome problem of salt scaling. This solar crystallizer with salt crystallization inhibitor enables a high water evaporation rate of 2.42 kg m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> and the presence of a small amount of salt crystallization inhibitor makes the crystallizer’s regeneration possible, leading to long-term stable brine treatment operations. The high water evaporation rate of 48.0 kg m<sup>−2</sup> per day achieved by the solar crystallizer array in outdoor field test also indicates its great potential for practical brine treatment. Further improvements in the performance of the solar crystallizer can be multi-faceted, including but not limited to applying artificial wind field to enhance environmental thermal energy harvesting, optimizing array assembly. The solar crystallizer is believed broadly applicable to various crystallization processes, such as salt recovery from waste brines, salt mineral extraction from salt lake, and thus is a meaningful contribution to the challenging problem of industrial brine treatment with ZLD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="Par43">Quartz glass fibrous filter membrane was purchased from Merck Millipore Ltd.
