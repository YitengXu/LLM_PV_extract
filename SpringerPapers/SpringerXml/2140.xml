The purpose of this study is to implement a system to characterize silicon solar cell performance and increasing energy efficiency by imposing such coatings as infrared wave absorber to overcome the Shockley–Queisser limit. In other words, this research efforts to improve cell efficiency (coating effects) in addition to imposing the efficiency decreasing effects (temperature increasing). The core of the study is laboratory and experimental set-up measurements to find an organic absorber with the highest absorbance. Ruthenium-based dye, N719, has shown the best performance in experimental conditions and heat extraction to enhance cell energy efficiency. Due to increased absorption in a solar cell (SC), to control the temperature rise of the system, the fan is used as a cooling system. The imposing of N719 results in increasing energy efficiency by up to 1.38%. It is worth noting that a 1.60% increase in energy efficiency is observed due to temperature reduction by 2 degrees.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Photovoltaic cell</kwd><kwd>Energy efficiency</kwd><kwd>Organic absorbent N719</kwd><kwd>Cooling system</kwd><kwd>Experimental set-up</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Islamic Azad University</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>24</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40095_2019_Article_334.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par27">In terms of energy, sunlight at earth’s surface is measured to be 1 kilowatt.m<sup>−2</sup> that consists of 527 watts infrared, 445 watts visible, and 28 watts ultraviolet radiation, in which almost all infrared and near-infrared radiation are shorter than 4 µm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Due to the research on the environmental effects of solar power deployment, it can be mentioned that technological improvements were made last decade. Furthermore, climate change and acidification were some of the parameters that in countries like the United Kingdom and Spain were declined. This decline is nearly 8–34% if countries like China use PV systems instead of current manufacturing systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">First-generation silicon solar cells are currently exhibiting power conversion efficiencies of ~ 22% so that cost-effective photovoltaics have brought about the rapid growth of research and development in the use of silicon in the photovoltaic market. Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) are promising materials not only for solar cells, because of the enhanced absorption spectrum, but also for increased conversion efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Concerning the infrared absorber material, lead selenide, indium arsenide, mercury tellurium, and lead sulfide can be considered as narrow bandgap semiconductors. Due to limitations of silicon, which means a high energy bandgap of 1.1 eV, lead sulfide with a tunable bandgap, with simple manufacturing processes, is considered as a promising candidate for solar cell applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">For bridging the gap between first-generation high-efficiency silicon solar cells with third-generation solar cells, organic semiconductor materials can be chosen, which are cost-effective. However, low yielding efficiencies hinder the real usage of such materials. Another candidate used to reduce recombination in the silicon surface, with results similar to surface passivation method’s conclusion, is poly-(3-hexylthiophene) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Previous research to overcome silicon solar cell efficiency limitation and because of the low absorbance of the infrared part of the spectrum, tandem solar cells were used. To increase electron charge, dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) with silicon substrate of (with 8% efficiency) ruthenium-based dye, N719 was used in this project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].

The common idea with the current study is the silicon substrate and developing semiconductor, but their method cost (which is relatively high) should be minimized.</p><p id="Par36">James Sturm is developing silicon/organic heterojunctions (SOH) to absorb light in such a way that it happened in the conventional crystalline and multi-crystalline silicon photovoltaic. However, no p–n junction was available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This low-cost room-temperature process eliminates the need for any expensive high-temperature diffusion steps required to fabricate p–n junctions. The similarity lies in enhancing the light absorbance feature using inexpensive organic materials and eliminating the p–n junction.</p><p id="Par37">Andrew Ferguson dramatically improved solar photoconversion efficiency in amorphous silicon (a-Si) and organic-based photovoltaic (PV) technologies by breaking the Shockley–Queisser limit. The team was implementing a strategy that allows single-junction solar cells to harvest a wider portion of the solar spectrum effectively with a system that can convert low-energy (red to near-infrared) photons to higher-energy (visible) photons. This harvesting of a wider portion of the solar spectrum with low-energy photons and breaking Shockley–Queisser limit is of interest. Still, the significant difference lies in the use of the amorphous silicon (a-Si) substrate instead of a c-Si cell in this work.</p><p id="Par38">Birkmire et al<italic>.</italic> were addressing the efficiency limit and high fabrication cost of current light-trapping methods by developing novel low-symmetry gratings (LSG) for thin crystalline silicon (c-Si) and copper indium gallium selenide (Cu(InGa)Se<sub>2</sub> or CIGS) photovoltaic solar cells. The researchers were also using deposited high refractive index glass materials for low-temperature LSG processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The same technique of light harvesting for first-generation solar cells is used, but the material employed differs from the stated one<bold>.</bold></p><p id="Par39">Taking into consideration that experimental set-up measurement is substantially different from STC conditions (AM1.5), the operating temperature should be considered as an altering factor. For instance, in a similar project for experimental set-up measurement with a radiation range of 400–1002 watts·m<sup>−2</sup>, cell operating temperature was in the range of 42–60 °C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and the results have shown the efficiency, and another photovoltaic characterization is less compared with laboratory conditions. As a result of the fact that the determination of simulation parameters such as wind speed, ambient temperature, and other experimental set-up conditions are not feasible, optimum temperature performance cannot be measured. Hence, the results of these conditions are incomparable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thanks to increased absorbance, especially infrared radiation, heat accumulation in the solar cell resulting in increased cell surface temperature, devising a technique to mitigate the heat surplus should be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Although in the above activities, two conditions were not considered; first trial experiments in real experimental set-up conditions and at the second trial, the possibility of energy efficiency drop due to increased absorbance and consequently temperature in comparison to nominal cell temperature. The current conversion efficiency of 1.3% at <italic>λ</italic> = 805 nm. Under 1 sun AM 1.5 illumination, the infrared response (780 nm &lt; <italic>λ</italic> &lt; 1600 nm) of the embedded nanocrystals contributes to 33% of the overall photocurrent of the photovoltaic cell. In literature, infrared absorber material was investigated thoroughly, but the effect of the cooling system on the environment has been not considered. By employing a cooling system, excess heat can be used to overcome the drop within efficiency. In other words, this research efforts to increase the cell efficiency (coating effects) in addition to impose with the efficiency decreasing effects (temperature rising).</p><p id="Par40">It is noteworthy to mention that parameters such as the effect of wind, the type of coating, and deposition methods have not investigated in this study. Also, the ideal set-up similar to the standard model for in situ measurements was not harnessed. It should be considered that the effect of each factor can act as the source of errors and can be very undesirable and should be considered in future research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">In this study, for evaluating the overall performance of silicon solar cells with and without applying the coating in an experimental set-up condition (by considering cooling effects), the tests were performed on different consecutive days. The knowledge gap addressed in comparison with other works is the integration of two generations of solar cells due to the absorption spectrum besides the cooling system. In other words, the novelty of this study is considering the two conditions that were not evaluated in previous works. First, it was performed in real experimental set-up conditions, and second, the possibility of energy efficiency drop due to increased absorbance, and consequently, the temperature in comparison to nominal cell temperature were assessed. To implement this idea, the new approach was used to evaluate the performance of electrical and thermal devices simultaneously.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Testing methods and relevant standards</title><p id="Par42">In this work, various organic and inorganic infrared-absorbing coatings were deposited on the silicon-based solar cells substrate distinct methods. The monocrystalline silicon solar cell with an area of 156.25 cm<sup>2</sup> was selected as the substrate, primary cell. At the first step, photovoltaic characteristics were measured prior and after coating and then, such characteristics were evaluated after applying cooling system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Selected dye-sensitized material, ruthenium-based complex, N719 as an organic coating (Solaronix SA company) was prepared and coated by the spraying technique. After deposition, experiments were conducted in a framework that can be divided into two distinct scenarios:</p><p id="Par43"><italic>Scenario (I)</italic>. Measurement of photovoltaic characteristics was performed with the sun light? The simulator in laboratory condition (light source, tungsten halogen lamps), with a radiation source, positioned at a certain standard distance from the cell surface to simulate the STC condition.</p><p id="Par44"><italic>Scenario (II)</italic>. Measurement of characteristics of photovoltaic was performed in standard test time intervals (required time to achieve the equilibrium and stability of the radiation).</p><p id="Par45">To examine the effects of harvesting infrared solar radiation and hence increasing the heat absorption on the energy efficiency of solar cells, contributed experiments were performed.

Applying both conditions need solar simulator condition so that such surveys suffer from two problems; (1) solar simulator only consists of visible or infrared part and not both ones, (2) in case of more accurate monitoring systems, the radiation zone covers 5 cm<sup>2</sup> of surface area, which is far smaller than the real cell surface area harnessed in this research, so temperature stability cannot be investigated as a controlled parameter. For the purpose realization of this scenario, photovoltaic solar cells with similar measurement tools were characterized in laboratory conditions. In comparison with scenario II, these series of experiments were conducted at shortened time intervals. As a result of this, their photovoltaic characterization and resulting system performance were measured more accurately. To achieve an accurate measurement, the constant adjustment was applied to all samples that are simulated within standard conditions, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Based on the ASTM E927 standard, the 1000-watt tungsten halogen lamp given with standard radiation was employed to cover the purpose. Samples were placed in a sealed case box, and a cooling fan in the floor chamber was also installed. Concerning the relationship between temperature and the energy efficiency of the cell, the thermocouple contact probe was placed to sense the cell surface temperature.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Laboratory conditions for solar cell characterization with 156.25 cm<sup>2</sup> area (middle), multimeter (two right), rheostat (one left)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40095_2019_334_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Scenario (II): measurement in experimental set-up condition</title><p id="Par49">In this scenario, the test conditions are as follows; set-up angle according to the latitude angle of MERC (Materials and Energy Research Center),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> the tilt angle was set to 36.65 degrees. A temperature difference of the cell with the coating before and after cooling is one of the effective specifications. So to measure both cell surface temperature and ambient temperature, the thermocouple was applied by the positioning of the probe on the surface of cells. Pyranometer (TES 1333 Solar Power Meter, Taiwan) and anemometers (DT-619 CFM/CMM Thermo Anemometer, China) were also executed to measure the radiation and wind speed, respectively. In the photovoltaic characterization method, controlled experimental set-up conditions had not been meeting; therefore, the factors should be carefully evaluated during testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

Current and voltage were measured in 50 steps based on variable resistance increment.

Its positive effect on the increasing power depended on decreasing temperature is the signed value in this pattern.</p><p id="Par67">However, to be careful at each step to enhance the accuracy, a new filter on data was applied. In the first step, More than 60 experiments and observations were excluded due to absurd temperature differences (due to lack of balance with ambient temperature or probe error). Subsequently, in the second step, it was necessary to define a function between 0 and 1, by means of coated solar cells with a cooling effect, to find resulted experiments in which increasing temperature reduces electrical performance (function equals zero value). So with this new filter agreement, less than 40 observations were found as accurate candidates in values. In the third step, by defining <italic>δ,</italic> we were looking for circumstances that applying for the cooling fan and coating. Those show the most positive effect rather than an uncoated solar cell. In this case, less than ten observations are obtained and, therefore, graph chart in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> is plotted. Final notable points as a result mentioned in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> were 100 droplets (45.61 gr·cm<sup>−1</sup>) of absorber shown best results due to coating, and cooling effects and ratio of input power to temperature difference were noteworthy.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><italic>δ</italic>’–<italic>δ</italic> (left axis) and <italic>δ</italic>’–<italic>δ</italic>/<italic>δ</italic><sub>0</sub> (right axis) to solar radiation for the different amount (gr·cm<sup>−1</sup>) of the absorber</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40095_2019_334_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Calculating correction factor (<italic>δ</italic>’–<italic>δ</italic>/<italic>δ</italic><sub>0</sub>) (the combined effect on the coating and cooling fan on the overall energy efficiency of the solar cell)</title><p id="Par68">This ratio meaning (<italic>δ</italic>’–<italic>δ</italic>/<italic>δ</italic><sub>0</sub>) indicates the ratio of input power to temperature difference induced by coating and cooling fan in comparison to uncoated solar cell without a cooling system.

Conditions are matched as closely as possible with different parameters to measure the performance of the solar cell, accurately. In the scenario of non-laboratory conditions, with and without cooling effect, to assess the impact of variables on energy efficiency, the experimental set-up condition is designed to measure performance.</p><p id="Par73">In the mentioned analysis, quantification of the effect contributed to the coating and finally quantified the overall efficiency of solar cells with consideration of the cooling effect was performed. The results indicate that the application of organic absorbent, complex coating substance, with regards to operational errors, has been positive, in tutorials. In the quantification of this effect, the new variable (<italic>δ</italic>) is harnessed which shows the input power relative to the temperature difference between the cell and the ambient (indicating heat extraction of the system) and this variable represents an increase in total system efficiency with regards to the mentioned type of coating. Outcoming results of the performance of each segment are summarized as follows;<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par74">Qualitative comparison of current–voltage curves is 80 droplets and droplets 100.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par75">Quantitative comparison of the variable delta frequency (before and after cooling) in terms of droplets, number: 80, 100, and 140 droplets.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par76">The final quantitative issue value of delta variables before and after cooling in terms of solar radiation is 100 droplets.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par77">A quantitative comparison of the defined correction factor in terms of solar radiation is 100 droplets.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par78">Seeking the best condition, by applying this coating with spraying 100 droplets or 2 CC of the solution on the solar cell, the best result was achieved in which energy efficiency increased up to 1.4% and considering 2 °C temperature decline after cooling condition, 1.6% energy efficiency move-up is followed.</p><p id="Par79">It is recommended, 100 droplets (45.61 gr·cm<sup>−1</sup>) as the best result is not a proper value, and it should be noted that 80 droplets (36.49 gr·cm<sup>−</sup>1) are approach point, so short intervals between these two values are recommended in future investigations.</p><p id="Par80">Finally, it can be said that the study of solar cells concerning all effects is targeted to be proper research for coatings (in terms of amount and method of coating), which is valuable in the field of cell efficiency. Also, it is beneficial for the research and development of companies to product/promote photovoltaic panels.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The datasets analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par81">The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">N.
