We evaluated the potential conflict between biodiversity protection and future electricity generation from renewable (wind farms, run-of-river hydro) and non-renewable (shale gas) sources in British Columbia (BC), Canada using three metrics: greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, electricity cost, and overlap between future development and conservation priorities for several fish and wildlife groups - small-bodied vertebrates, large mammals, freshwater fish – and undisturbed landscapes. Sharp trade-offs in global versus regional biodiversity conservation exist for all energy technologies, and in BC they are currently smallest for wind energy: low GHG emissions, low-moderate overlap with top conservation priorities, and competitive energy cost. GHG emissions from shale gas are 1000 times higher than those from renewable sources, and run-of-river hydro has high overlap with conservation priorities for small-bodied vertebrates. When all species groups were considered simultaneously, run-of-river hydro had moderate overlap (0.56), while shale gas and onshore wind had low overlap with top conservation priorities (0.23 and 0.24, respectively). The unintended cost of distributed energy sources for regional biodiversity suggest that trade-offs based on more diverse metrics must be incorporated into energy planning.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>17</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2020_Article_64501.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Biodiversity is declining at an alarming rate as a result of habitat loss, overexploitation, and climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. To address this challenge, 196 countries have signed the Convention on Biological Diversity, which aims to halt biodiversity loss by 2020 by reducing direct harm, increasing protected areas, mitigating climate, and reducing global carbon emissions. With global energy demand projected to increase by 14–33% by the year 2035<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, these commitments have contributed to an exponential increase in the development of renewable electricity sources (e.g., wind, solar, biomass, hydropower<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>). Concomitantly, unconventional fossil fuels such as shale gas, are being developed worldwide (International Energy Agency; <italic>iea.org</italic>), and presented as less GHG intensive alternatives to coal-fired electricity generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The development of new renewable electricity has been dominated by distributed energy resources (e.g. wind, solar, small hydropower) that are assumed to be more environmentally benign than traditional, large scale technologies, such as large dams or coal-fired plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. For example, the widespread adoption of renewable energy has resulted in spatially distributed interconnected networks of facilities that can range from small (i.e., single wind turbines or small hydropower dams, &lt;5 or 10 MW installed capacity) to large wind and solar farms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Distributed energy resources pose interesting challenges to land use planning when the goal is to solve a grid-based energy problem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For any given resource type, individual distributed energy resource facilities may have small physical footprints compared to single large facilities, but cumulatively may require substantially more infrastructure (roads, powerlines) per unit of energy produced (e.g., many small hydropower projects with little to no water storage capacity vs. a single large dam flooding vast areas)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Similarly, shale gas extraction and transportation is characterized by a dense network of well pads, access roads, seismic lines, and pipelines which can cumulatively affect large geographic areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. As such, both renewable distributed energy resources and shale development may result in similar spatial footprints that can be difficult to evaluate or integrate into land use planning, as well as conservation planning.</p><p id="Par4">Given the rapid increase in renewable energy and shale gas development worldwide, there is an increasing need to understand the potential for cumulative environmental and biodiversity impacts of such technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Policy-makers and ecologists alike recognize the need for strategic planning for renewable energy and unconventional fossil fuel development to navigate the complex trade-offs between reducing global GHG emissions, minimizing local impacts to biodiversity and human health, while meeting growing energy demands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Thus, identifying optimal energy portfolios that meet economic, environmental and social constraints requires not only a stakeholder-engaged process that addresses social acceptance of emerging technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, but also the development of analytical frameworks that integrate multiple targets and consider the cumulative effects of energy development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. While many studies have focused on identifying optimal sites of renewable energy resources based on physical attributes of their target area and technical specifications of a particular technology, only few attempted to expand the optimization criteria to biotic, economic, or social factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Renewable and unconventional energy development in North America has been characterized by an exponential increase in electricity generating capacity from wind and solar power (15-fold and 24-fold increase since 2000, respectively; US Department of Energy, <italic>energy.gov</italic>), as well as extraction of natural gas from shale (7-fold increase in gas production since 2007<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>). Until recently, the Province of British Columbia (BC), Canada, was undergoing a shift from large energy production infrastructure to a system of numerous small dispersed electricity production facilities installed and operated by private corporations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>; though this focus has changed recently with the approval of a large dam on the Peace River (Site C; 1100 MW installed capacity capable of producing up to 5100 GWh per year; <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.sitecproject.com" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.sitecproject.com</ext-link>), small distributed energy sources are still being developed throughout the province. As such, BC can serve as an example for other jurisdictions aiming at meeting their energy demand via small, distributed renewable sources. Simultaneously large shale gas deposits are being rapidly developed in BC (half of Canada’s shale gas reserves, estimated at ~1200 trillion cubic feet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>). However, neither form of new energy development is currently regulated by land use planning that accounts for the potential for regional biodiversity impacts concomitant with meeting GHG emissions targets. This is an important gap, as British Columbia harbors some the last pristine ecosystems and large mammal assemblages in North America, free-flowing salmon rivers, while many ecosystems and iconic species are under threat from land conversion and other forms of human impacts, including energy development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In this study we quantified the potential trade-offs between development of three electricity-generation technologies [renewable: river diversion hydropower, hereafter <italic>run-of-river hydro</italic>, and on-shore wind, hereafter <italic>wind farms</italic>, and unconventional fossil: extraction and combustion of natural gas from shale], and biodiversity conservation objectives at regional (spatial conservation priorities) and global (GHG emissions) scales. The objectives of this study were to quantify the trade-offs among these energy technologies for biodiversity conservation using three common measures of potential biotic impact: (1) lifecycle GHG emissions for each technology (lifespan of electricity-producing technologies of 30–40 years), (2) cost per megawatt hour ($/MWh) of potential electricity development, and (3) the degree of spatial overlap between infrastructure associated with the future development of each energy technology and regional priorities for species conservation. Despite its widespread use in reserve design, conservation management, and urban planning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, spatial conservation planning has not yet been used to assess biodiversity trade-offs among different renewable and unconventional fossil fuel technologies, and this work has the potential to streamline decision-making on electricity portfolios in the energy planning process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Analysis workflow</title><p id="Par7">This study was focused on the Canadian province of British Columbia, which covers 1 million km<sup>2</sup>, and has strong latitudinal, altitudinal, and longitudinal environmental gradients (from temperate rainforest to boreal forest, semi-desert, and dry grasslands). BC encompasses the most extensive undisturbed temperate rainforests, and some of the last free flowing rivers and intact vertebrate food webs in temperate North America. At the same time, much of the province has been under intense resource extraction pressure (timber, mining, natural gas) for nearly a century, and such extraction continues to contribute substantially to a growing domestic economy as well as foreign trade.</p><p id="Par8">We used existing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies to predict future GHG emissions for wind farms and run-of-river hydro, and combined combustion and upstream emission estimates for future projected natural gas development (e.g., shale gas extraction, processing, and transport). Second, we extracted the costs of electricity production ($/MWh) from both renewable sources, and from natural gas combustion from an existing dataset of all potential electricity sources, used in strategic energy planning in British Columbia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>; we limited the dataset to potential development sites with electricity production costs of &lt; $150/MWh to reflect current electricity markets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Lastly, we estimated the spatial overlap of each energy technology with areas of high conservation priority in BC derived using systematic conservation planning principles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. We identified areas of high conservation value drawing on 385 vertebrate species distributions (341 small-bodied terrestrial species, 7 large-bodied carnivores and ungulates, and 37 fish species) and existing anthropogenic disturbance (i.e., forestry and linear infrastructure) under five prioritization scenarios: each of the three sets of species and anthropogenic disturbance separately, and a scenario combining all four datasets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Energy datasets</title><p id="Par9">To evaluate how potential energy development overlaps with areas of high conservation priority in BC we used a spatially-explicit dataset produced by the BC Provincial power utility BC Hydro (<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>; <ext-link xlink:href="https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-hydro-resource-options-mapping-2013" ext-link-type="uri">https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-hydro-resource-options-mapping-2013</ext-link>) that identified locations of potential electricity production (wind farms and run-of-river hydro) infrastructure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Specifically, BC Hydro used topographic and climatic factors to identify the approximate sitting of individual renewable energy projects, as well as the spatial location of potential infrastructure associated with each project, such as access roads connecting each project to the nearest road network, and powerlines connecting each project to the provincial power grid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. While other energy technologies have been identified, wind farms and run-of-river hydro represent more than half of the potential renewable electricity generation in BC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, and nearly 8,000 potential development locations. We set a maximum development cost of $150/MWh to limit our analysis to a subset of economically viable projects, resulting in 66 run-of-river hydro locations and 87 wind farm locations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We chose this threshold to be greater than the highest price paid for renewable energy in BC (up to $124/MWh in 2017) to allow for increases in the cost of electricity in the near future, but also to exclude sites that are cost-prohibitive in the near term. This threshold also reflects renewable electricity costs worldwide, which have been decreasing over the past two decades, and are forecast to decrease in the near term<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

Under the landscape disturbance scenario (scenario 4), conservation priorities were identified as areas that are intact (undisturbed habitat), as a proxy for intact species assemblages and food webs. For individual taxonomic group scenarios (1–4), each species was weighed equally within its own prioritization scenario. For the combined scenario, each of the four taxonomic and disturbance datasets were weighed equally; for example, each of the 341 terrestrial vertebrate species (dataset 1) were given a weight of 0.00294 (thus summing to 1), while each of the two disturbance layers in dataset 4 was given a weight of 0.5. This weighting system led to a balanced representation of the intact landscapes and the three different sets of species with different habitat and space requirements. When all four sets of data were combined, Zonation produced conservation prioritization outputs that maximized both biodiversity value (e.g., for each taxonomic dataset), and areas with the most undisturbed habitat.</p><p id="Par18">Zonation produces a complementarity-based and balanced ranking of conservation priorities across the entire landscape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>.

We also took into account existing protected areas, which cover ~10% of BC, using a hierarchical mask<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. A hierarchical mask defines a strict sequence of cell removal, starting with the lowest values. In our case, the hierarchical mask was given a value of 1 for all protected areas, and 0 for the rest of the province. Thus, protected areas were given the highest conservation rank (top 10% of the province). The reasons for applying the hierarchical mask are twofold: (1) BC Hydro’s renewable energy planning process, as well as shale development, avoid existing protected areas, and (2) we aimed to focus our analyses on areas currently at risk from future energy development decisions. We excluded from the analyses all areas in the province covered by exposed rock, glaciers, barren lands, lakes, and urban areas.

Foremost, our dataset on potential renewable energy development locations allowed us to calculate the length of new roads and powerlines, as well as the areal footprint of wind farm and run-of-river facilities, but there is no parallel dataset for future shale development. To evaluate the overlap between energy development and conservation priorities, we extracted the Zonation rank values for each cell intersected by the infrastructure of the 66 run-of-river hydro projects (n = 6,623 cells, of which 362 cells were buffer-based footprints, and the rest represented overlap with run-of-river linear infrastructure) and 87 wind farms (n = 13,383 cells, of which 1,240 cells were buffer-based footprints, and the rest represented overlap with wind farm linear infrastructure).</p><p id="Par20">For shale development, we combined the locations of the two shale gas basins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) with the spatial footprint of approved, but not yet developed, rights-of-way for gas extraction, refinement, and transportation infrastructure outside the shale basins.

In addition, within the two BC shale gas basins, the exact footprint and location of future shale development is uncertain, and extraction activities are by nature, distributed across many individual wells. In the absence of exact locations of shale development infrastructure within the two shale basins, we randomly selected 10,000 points at which to extract ranks for each prioritization scenario and characterized the variation in Zonation ranks associated with current and future shale development. While this approach is different from the renewable energy footprint, the outcome (i.e., range of conservation ranks overlapped by energy infrastructure) is comparable, as we did not attempt to compare the three energy technologies in terms of their absolute footprint.</p><p id="Par21">We quantified the overlap between potential energy development and conservation priorities produced from the Zonation outputs using probability density plots for the frequency of cells intersected by potential development across the range of Zonation ranks.

For each energy technology, we calculated the proportion of cells corresponding to wind (13,383 cells), small hydro (6,623 cells) and shale development (10,000 cells) with conservation ranks &gt; 0.7 under each prioritization scenario. Using density plots across the range of Zonation ranks instead of absolute measures of overlap (e.g., km<sup>2</sup> impacted) allowed us to examine the relative overlap of potential shale development with conservation priorities without having to make assumptions about the future locations or density of shale infrastructure, and allowed a direct comparison with run-of-river hydro and wind farms.</p><p id="Par22">We calculated the amount of renewable electricity that could be developed without impacting high conservation priority areas under each scenario (Zonation rank &gt; 0.7, instead of &gt;0.8, because protected areas accounted for the top 10% [0.9–1.0] of Zonation scores after applying the hierarchical mask<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>). While the overlap analysis evaluated trade-offs between the three energy sectors, this analysis provides complementary information, as it focuses on individual renewable energy projects by quantifying the potential energy gain from projects located in low conservation value areas. For each individual renewable energy project, we calculated the average and the range of Zonation ranks of cells intersected by its infrastructure (see above for description of infrastructure considered for potential renewable energy projects). We then ranked the 87 potential wind farms and 66 run-of-river hydro projects separately by their average Zonation rank value, and plotted the cumulative gain in annual electricity potential relative to the average and range of Zonation values.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par23">We identified strong trade-offs between the potential regional and global biodiversity impacts of future electricity production in BC.

As expected, the extraction and combustion of natural gas from shale deposits had the highest potential for future GHG emissions (310–367 g CO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kWh), up to 1000 times higher than what we estimated for run-of-river hydro or wind energy (0.3–13 and 3–45 g-CO<sub>2</sub>/kWh respectively), but could be produced for the least cost (mean = 90.6 $/MWh) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

According to BC Hydro estimates, the 66 potential run-of-river hydro projects included in our analyses would require 2,858 km of new powerlines and 174 km of new roads, and a physical footprint of the actual projects of 579.5 ha (range = 2.3–12.9 ha/project).

Because the shale gas production was considered cumulatively across the two shale gas basins (rather than a well-by-well, or lease basis), it was not possible to make a similar comparison to estimate the amount of gas (and associated energy) produced in low conservation value areas.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Cumulative energy gain from run-of-river hydro (blue) and wind farms (red) relative to the spatial overlap between energy infrastructure and conservation priorities under five prioritization scenarios.

As expected, our analysis confirms that GHG emissions were much greater for shale gas extraction and combustion compared to the two renewable energy technologies, but the differences in overlap between shale gas, run-of-river hydro, and wind farms with regional conservation priorities (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>; Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) highlights a trade-off for biodiversity conservation between global and regional scales. In our analyses, there were substantial spatial disparities between the top conservation priorities when each species group and intact landscapes were considered individually (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,b,c,d</xref>). While recent studies have evaluated geographic differences in sitting of new energy projects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>, studies that focus either on GHG emissions or biodiversity impacts may miss important trade-offs between global and regional conservation targets and priorities. Such underlying trade-offs are important, yet rarely quantified or acknowledged, when thinking about avoiding or minimizing overlap between energy development and regional conservation priorities.</p><p id="Par28">In British Columbia, shale gas extraction is concentrated in two basins in the northeastern part of the province, a region of low vertebrate species richness, but with low levels of existing disturbance and moderate conservation value for freshwater fishes and large mammals (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Many species with large space requirements (e.g., grizzly bear (<italic>Ursus arctos</italic>), caribou (<italic>Rangifer tarandus</italic>)), that also have high value to local communities, could be impacted by habitat fragmentation associated with shale development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and additional shale development has high potential for cumulative effects at the population level<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>.

At the same time, the GHG emissions from shale gas development are similar to those of conventional natural gas, though when used for electricity generation, GHG emissions are half of those from coal-fired plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Thus, without global emission-reduction measures (e.g., carbon capture and storage, alternative transportation fuels), electricity production from shale gas will increase global GHG emissions and contribute to long term temperature rise<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, impacting biodiversity worldwide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">Both run-of-river hydro and wind energy technologies had much lower lifetime GHG emissions than shale gas extraction and combustion, but they differed in their potential spatial overlap with areas of high conservation priority across species groups and intact landscape metrics (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Run-of-river hydro development has the highest development potential on montane streams (e.g., Coast Mountains, Southern BC Rockies; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). We found that potential powerlines and roads associated with run-of-river hydro facilities in these regions are often concentrated in valley bottoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, which have high species richness and house unique terrestrial vertebrate communities, thus increasing overlap with high priority conservation areas for small bodied vertebrates. The Southern Rockies also have high conservation value for large carnivores and ungulates, further highlighting potential conflicts with species sensitive to terrestrial habitat fragmentation and disturbance. In contrast to run-of-river hydro, potential wind farms are concentrated in coastal areas (northern Vancouver Island) and at higher elevation in the southern Interior of BC and the Central Rockies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), although their associated powerlines also tend to converge in valley bottoms. Regardless of the prioritization scenario, wind farm locations had relatively low overlap with high conservation value areas (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), suggesting that potential wind energy development presents less conflict with terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity than the other energy technologies considered here. Overall, selecting renewable energy project locations is more flexible compared to shale development. While we focused on a particular set of renewable energy projects in this study, additional wind and small hydropower sites could be identified to alleviate regional conservation concerns (likely with added economic costs); shale development does not afford this flexibility, as it has to overlap with the geography of shale deposits.</p><p id="Par30">The combined prioritization scenario (5) suggests that that energy development planning in British Columbia could consider both species-rich areas for terrestrial vertebrates, freshwater fishes, and intact landscapes simultaneously, but individual prioritizations are useful for evaluating potential overlap with areas of high conservation values for species groups that have high importance for local communities (e.g., freshwater fishes, Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>), and intact landscapes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>The need for cross-scale evaluation of biodiversity impacts from energy development</title><p id="Par31">In spite of the worldwide boom in renewable energy development, as well as shale gas extraction, the trade-offs between protecting biodiversity at local or regional scales versus measures aimed at protecting biodiversity globally remain largely unquantified. The exponential increase in renewable energy development worldwide (including solar and geothermal, not considered in this study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>), has recently been accompanied by evaluations of impacts on fish and wildlife. Studies of impacts of wind energy on biodiversity have focused on bird and bat mortalities at wind turbines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup>, leading to changes in mitigation measures required to reduce such impacts, such as decreasing the rotation speed, placing facilities outside migration routes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup>, or developing best management practices for sitting wind farms that minimize impacts to wildlife<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup>. Fewer studies have investigated the biodiversity impacts of run-of-river hydro<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup>. Similarly, the potential for impacts from shale development on fish and wildlife has only been studied superficially, and surprisingly large gaps exist in our knowledge of impacts to biodiversity, particularly around ground and surface water contamination from fracturing fluids, terrestrial fragmentation from infrastructure, and cumulative impacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Our study provides a platform for future studies to incorporate uncertainty in renewable and unconventional energy development locations, and their potential biodiversity impacts, while simultaneously considering their contribution to GHG emissions, as well as economic competitiveness. A natural extension of this work would be to identify portfolios of renewable and shale development projects that minimize trade-offs between energy production and local impacts on species of conservation concern, as well as species and landscapes of high social and cultural value for settler and First Nation communities. The three metrics considered here (GHG, cost and species conservation) provide contrasting perspectives on energy development, but the range of potential metrics for investigating trade-offs between renewable and fossil fuels is considerably greater. In particular, the current study does not acknowledge social aspects, such as attitudes towards different types of energy development, or cultural, recreational, and spiritual values of settler and First Nation communities. Tackling such additional complexity and identifying favored energy solutions requires thoughtful engagement with diverse groups in a participatory decision-making framework.</p><p id="Par32">At a global scale, lowering the GHG emissions of the energy sector is a critical step towards stabilizing global temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>, and requires a fundamental transformation of the global energy production system. While some progress has been made at reducing GHG emissions among developed countries since the 1990’s (e.g., −20% in the European Union, no change in the United States, +19% in Canada), the energy sector remains the greatest source GHG emissions globally (~30%). Along with increased efficiency and lower consumption rates, the Fifth Assessment Report of IPCC recommends that the efforts to reduce the GHG emissions from the energy sector focus on transitioning from coal-generated electricity to renewable electricity, as well as natural gas-powered plants (providing that upstream emissions from natural gas extraction become minimal)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>. Concomitantly, some jurisdictions and energy sectors have been proactive in incorporating potential biodiversity impacts in distributed renewable energy planning (e.g., wind energy and solar energy in the U.S., onshore and offshore wind in the EU). However, for jurisdictions where energy planning relies largely on economic-only metrics, challenges remain to environmental assessment and planning for meeting energy demands from many small renewable energy facilities.</p><p id="Par33">Development projects are generally considered individually in the environmental impact assessment process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup>, an approach that does not account for the potential cumulative impacts of multiple facilities across spatial scales or multiple energy sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref></sup>. In contrast, strategic-level assessment approaches evaluating the potential for cumulative impacts from many energy projects relative to pre-existing economic activities and future development<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, must incorporate conservation and biodiversity as quantified objectives along with lifecycle GHG emissions and cost of energy. Our study complements existing strategic planning approaches to energy development and cumulative impact assessment (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref></sup>), and provides a perspective that cuts across energy sectors and build from well-established systematic conservation planning principles. Evaluating the potential for biodiversity impacts from energy portfolios across multiple scales, species groups, and jurisdictions complements local and regional environmental assessments for individual energy projects, and can act as an important filter to inform strategic decisions for land allocation and energy policies.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by grants from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Wilburforce Foundation, and National Science and Engineering Research Council to WJP.
