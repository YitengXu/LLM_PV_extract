Climate affects agriculture and vice versa as they are deeply interconnected. The effect of climate change on agriculture goes a long way to increase or decrease food security and invariably food nutrition through its impacts on agricultural lands. This is because the more food insecurity there is, the more issues of undernutrition are observed.</p><p id="Par2">This chapter studies the different ways climate and climate change affect crop production through the different sections of agriculture in terms of plant diseases and biocontrol, food production, livestock rearing, fish production, forestry, and microbial diversity. It goes further to look at the different ways nations and communities are adapting to climate change to mitigate the challenges of food insecurity and nutrition. Finally, some of the solutions that can be pilot tested at the community level, which can later be cascaded to national and regional levels, are also emphasized. Other recommendations that can become a research focus to forestall this threat are also highlighted and would be important in policy development.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Climate change</kwd><kwd>Environment</kwd><kwd>Food availability</kwd><kwd>Food production</kwd><kwd>Food security</kwd><kwd>Nutrition</kwd><kwd>Soil</kwd><kwd>Weather</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-3-030-42091-8_Chapter_142-1.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group><notes notes-type="Misc"><p>This chapter was previously published non-open access with exclusive rights reserved by the Publisher.

Recently it is also obvious that food nutrition<index-term id="ITerm1"><term>Nutrition</term></index-term> security needs to be addressed. Agriculture is important for food security in two ways: it produces the food people eat and (perhaps even more important) it provides the primary source of livelihood for 36% of the world’s total workforce (ILO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007</xref>). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)<index-term id="ITerm2"><term>Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)</term></index-term> of the United Nations (UN) defined food security at the World Food Summit in 1996 as “when all people, at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (Food and Agriculture Organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1996</xref>). Food security transcends food availability<index-term id="ITerm3"><term>Food availability</term></index-term> (production, distribution, and exchange) but also include how food is accessed (affordability, allocation and preference), utilized (food safety, nutrition, and social value) and also how it is distributed in the supply chain (food stability) (Ziervogel and Frayne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2011</xref>). This also means that it is not just about food but how available food is. And even when it is available, communities and individuals might be food insecure if they are not able to access food either because of monetary incapacitation or because of lack of knowledge of where to acquire the food, based on their livelihoods and socioeconomic level. It could also be as a result of how safe the food is especially in terms of processes followed during food preparation (Ziervogel and Ericksen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Agriculture, forestry, and fisheries have all been affected by climate change, and they have contributed to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, thus affecting climate change negatively. The solution to climate change also partly lies within this sector, if agriculture is able to mitigate climate change through reduction of greenhouse gas emission during sustainable agricultural practices (Al et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">Adaptation to climate change can constitute a range of interventions across all levels from individuals to communities to regional and national level. As observed by Bierbaum et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>), communities can initiate their climate adaptation efforts in numerous ways. For example, in the United States, some diverse strategies employed by different communities to combat the issue of climate change include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par6">Focusing on internal operations</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par7">Beginning with a sector that is particularly vulnerable to climate change</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par8">Integrating climate change concerns into existing planning approaches</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par9">Conducting a community-wide assessment</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par10">The results from these experiments with adaptation strategies demonstrate that there is no “one size fits all” adaptation process or adaptation action (Bierbaum and Stults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013</xref>). This is quite important to note in adaptation plans; however, the information required and the approached to adaptation can be similar across regions and sectors. Therefore, strategies that encourage data and best practices sharing, practical approaches, collaborative, and integrative processes will be important in developing adaptation plans in different countries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title><index-term id="ITerm4"><term>Climate change</term></index-term>Climate Change and Reality</title><p id="Par11">Climate change occurs when changes in the Earth’s climate system result in new weather<index-term id="ITerm5"><term>Weather</term></index-term> patterns that last for at least a few decades and maybe for millions of years. Effects of climate change are seen in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events including droughts, floods, new rainfall patterns, and heatwaves. Increases in temperature have led to an escalation in the distribution of weeds, pests, and diseases some of which are a threat to marine life, plants, animals, and humans. In the same vein, an increase in extreme weather events has led to soil erosion<index-term id="ITerm6"><term>Soil erosion</term></index-term> (by water and wind) and loss of arable land for forestry and agriculture.</p><p id="Par12">Impact of climate change on food production cannot be overemphasized; it is enormous and felt more acutely in developing and the least developed nations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Flooding and droughts have been observed to ruin crops and pastures already being cultivated on the fields. Losses due to floods and droughts between 2004 and 2014 have been estimated to be over 100 billion USD globally (Food and Agriculture Organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2015</xref>; Brida et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The interrelatedness between climate change, food security and nutrition<index-term id="ITerm7"><term>Nutrition</term></index-term> showing the impact of climate change on food security.

Temperature and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) increases in some areas can increase some agricultural productivity. Nevertheless, the higher demand for nutrients, soil moisture<index-term id="ITerm9"><term>Soil moisture</term></index-term>, water availability, and other requirements must also be met in order to realize these benefits. Changes in drought and flood frequency as well as intensity can present severe threats for farmers and ranchers and therefore threaten food safety (Ziska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2016</xref>). In addition, warmer water temperatures are likely to trigger a change in the habitat ranges of many species of fish and shellfish, which may threaten ecosystems. Furthermore, climate change could make it harder to produce food and fish and raise livestock in the same way and in the same places as in the past (Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title><index-term id="ITerm10"><term>Climate change</term><index-term><term>mitigation</term></index-term></index-term>Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation</title><p id="Par14">Adaptation to climate change is a way of responding to global climate change (also called “climatic change” or “anthropogenic climate change”). According to The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)<index-term id="ITerm11"><term>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)</term></index-term>, adaptation is sequence of modifications to actual or expected climate and the impacts of the modification. Adaptation is aimed at mitigating or preventing harm or manipulating beneficial possibilities within human systems. Sometimes, the contributions of human beings enhance adaptations to these modifications and its impacts (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>). This requires intentional efforts in the human environmental system to adapt behavioral patterns, lifestyles, and perceptions that can lower the risk to human lives and livelihoods, while mitigation<index-term id="ITerm12"><term>Mitigation</term></index-term> involves coordinated actions to reduce long-term emissions of greenhouse gases (Al et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>). In contrast, climate change mitigation<index-term id="ITerm13"><term>Mitigation</term></index-term> means reducing greenhouse gas emissions and short-term sequestration and processing of coal and even more significantly by making infrastructural decisions that will reduce risk by reducing long-term emissions. While the entire food system is a producer of greenhouse gas emissions, still the most important component is primary production. Incentives are required to encourage producers, agribusinesses, and managers of biodiversity to follow good practices to mitigate climate change.<index-term id="ITerm14"><term>Climate change</term><index-term><term>mitigation</term></index-term></index-term></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Food Production and Climate Change</title><p id="Par15"><index-term id="ITerm15"><term>Food production and climate change</term></index-term>Climate change will affect food production and welfare of food animals (i.e., livestock, poultry, and fish) in several different ways. Consider the production of livestock that will probably be restricted by climate change as consumption of water by livestock is expected to increase by a factor of three. The need for arable land for pastures and feed production will increase because of a 70% increase in demand for agricultural products. Food safety<index-term id="ITerm16"><term>Food safety</term></index-term> issues also become important because around one-third of the world’s cereal harvest is used for animal feed (Rojas-Downing et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2017</xref>). Furthermore, 14.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG)<index-term id="ITerm17"><term>Greenhouse gas (GHG)</term></index-term> is produced by the livestock industry. The livestock sector will therefore be a key player in reducing GHG emissions and enhancing global food security in the future (Rojas-Downing et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2017</xref>; Gerber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">Climate change and competition for land together with water and food security are likely to adversely affect livestock production at a time when it is most wanted (Thornton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2010</xref>). The output efficiency of feed conversion ratios for food, dairy, and egg production could be felt as a result of losses due to climate change. Increasing temperatures can also lead to death of food animals, as was noted by the deaths of more than 30,000 dairy cows in California and also in reduction of the overall production of milk in 2006 (Pitesky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014</xref>). Temperature affects most of the critical factors for livestock production, such as water availability, weight gain (feed conversion ratio), reproduction (semen quality, cow calf efficiency), and general health. A combination of increases in temperature, CO<sub>2,</sub> and variability in precipitation influences the quantity, quality, and availability of forage and grain feed crops. Livestock diseases are affected primarily by an increase in the variation in temperature and precipitation (Thornton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">Changes in land use, food production, animal production, manure, storage and transportation, and livestock all influence local and global weather<index-term id="ITerm18"><term>Weather</term></index-term> patterns. Production of feed and manure releases CO<sub>2</sub>, nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), thereby influencing climate change. Therefore, livestock production systems increase emissions of CH<sub>4</sub>. The production and transportation of animal products and improvements in land use contribute to increased CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Research on the impact of climate change on livestock production is still minimal and need renewed attention (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">Insects are ectotherms and are highly sensitive to their surrounding environmental conditions particularly the temperature; therefore temperature is a major factor affecting their reproduction (Kambrekar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>). This means increases in temperature for both edible and disease-causing insects could increase their reproductive cycle up to five cycles in a single year, which could affect farm food production negatively in terms of crop stress and yield loss. For beneficial insects, this increase in temperature will lead to increase in their metabolism (Kambrekar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2015</xref>). Perhaps this provides an opportunity to develop new food systems based on insect production, either as feed for livestock and fish or directly for human consumption.</p><p id="Par19">The possible effects of changing climate on insects could result in outbreaks, migration, change in biodiversity, species extinction, change in host shift, and emergence of new pests or biotypes. Due to the climate change, there is an increase in insect pest population, more outbreaks of insects, increased number of generations, as well as development of resistant biotypes (Moore and Allard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">Fish<index-term id="ITerm19"><term>Fish</term></index-term> plays an important role as a source of nutrients and micronutrients for human consumption, and fishing is a crucial food-producing sector and a source of livelihood for coastal farmers. Both fisheries and aquaculture make a significant contribution to food security and the livelihoods of millions of people as job creators, nutritious food providers, revenue generators, and economic growth through harvesting, processing, and marketing fish. Especially susceptible to climate change are small-scale fisherfolk and small-scale aquaculture. Their vulnerability is the function of both their location and their circumstances of vulnerability and disadvantage. Fishing and fishing communities are exposed to extreme climatic conditions and natural hazards, such as hurricanes, cyclones, sea level rise, ocean acidification, flooding, and coastal erosion, as they are mostly situated on the coastline. Millions of people living in the lowlands of coastal regions and the floodplains cannot escape regular flooding. Climate change affects living conditions as well as physical well-being of humans across many agro-forest ecosystems of the world (FAO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">Forests are a climate-stabilizing force.

A forest’s position in climate change is that it both causes and mitigates greenhouse emissions; therefore, there are both pros and cons. Impacts of climate change on forests<index-term id="ITerm20"><term>Climate change</term><index-term><term>on forests</term></index-term></index-term> result from variations in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and shifts in temperature and precipitation regimes, as well as an increase in climate variability reflected by increasing frequency and severity of extreme events. Change in climate will affect tree photosynthesis, rates of growth, leaf phenology, seed production, and cycling of nutrients (van der Meer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2002</xref>). In some regions, forest form a vital resource for the community. For example, tropical forests cover about one third of the Kafa highland region of Ethiopia where a multiple tenure system exists for the utilization of the forest resources (Zewdie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2003</xref>). These include sharecropping and allocation of trees to sons when they come of age. However, the beekeeping and wood processing skills also need to pass from one generation to the next to maintain sustainable livelihoods (Zewdie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2003</xref>). Therefore, climate change effects on such forests will have a major impact on the livelihoods of the people.</p><p id="Par22">The land management sector<index-term id="ITerm21"><term>Land management sector</term></index-term>, the second largest driver of greenhouse gas<index-term id="ITerm22"><term>Greenhouse gas (GHG)</term></index-term> emissions after the energy sector, accounts for around 25% of global emissions. Around half of these come from deforestation and habitat destruction (5–10 Gt CO<sub>2</sub>e per year). Planting of forests and commercial plantations are among the most important strategies to address climate change effects. It is estimated that 2.6 billion tons of carbon dioxide, which is one-third of CO<sub>2</sub> from burning fossil fuels, is absorbed annually by forests. Projections show that there are nearly two billion square kilometers of worldwide degraded land – an area the size of South America – that can open up opportunities for restoration.

Food production is affected by climate especially in regions where biochemical processes are being influenced by climate change. Some of these influences could be positive, negative, or even neutral (Allen Jr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1991</xref>). Location is a determinant of how the effect of climate change will be experienced in different regions (Leff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2004</xref>). In temperate regions where elevated levels of CO<sub>2</sub> will increase plant growth and development, greenhouse fertilization effect is beneficial so crop yields will also increase. Such increase is observed to be as high as 0–10% increase in crops with very high photosynthetic efficiency, while those crops with lower efficiency have higher increase from between 10% and 25%. In such scenarios, the assumption is that the level of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere will increase to 550 parts per million (Tubiello et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2007</xref>; IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>). In some cases, increase in temperature between 1 °C and 3 °C is beneficial to plants in temperate regions; however, in tropical and seasonally dry regions, the impact is negative on crops especially cereals that are already growing near to their optimal temperature regime. Nevertheless, the impact is negative on all crops when the increase in mean temperature is more than 3 °C (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par31">Such temperature increase will also impact livestock production as the growth of feed crops is also compromised and become an indirect effect on livestock production (Porter and Semenov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2005</xref>).

Some of their ability to adapt is due to their habit of browsing together with the anatomical advantage of the upper lips. Therefore, goats can thrive well with limited feedstuffs, especially in arid and semiarid regions (Pragna et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2018</xref>).

The growing population of the world and the overall reduction in global production of staples such as rice and wheat due to climate change (Ray et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2019</xref>) are two fundamental challenges that need to be tackled, with crop protection against diseases having an obvious role to play in bringing solutions to these challenges. Crop diseases affect the life cycles of any growing plant. They affect crop production from seedling stage through budding, flowering, and fruiting until harvesting. Crop diseases that occur during seedling and budding stages will in most cases cause the death of the plants as the growing point is damaged. These deaths lead to complete crop failure and high losses. In addition, losses at the time of harvest in most cases cause the reduction in yield in terms of size and quality and thus also a reduction in overall production (Savary et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2012</xref>). Therefore, loss of crops caused by pests, infections, or even weeds or animal attacks is a risk to farmers, their family or household income, and food security worldwide. Losses of crops due to yield reduction can be defined qualitatively and quantitatively (Cerda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>) in terms of the reduction in the value of the crop or the financial gain from crop sales.</p><p id="Par43">In order to assess crop loss based on decrease in yield of crop, the variance between the real yield (Y) and the attainable yield that can be obtained (Ya) is taken into consideration as Ya – Y according to the definition of crop loss by Esker et al.

As a result of climate variability, the use of pesticide is expected to increase in the United States (Chen and McCarl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2001</xref>). Nevertheless, the estimated effects of climate change on pesticide use are a function of the type of crop and the geographical location.

Biodiversity can be measured at three levels, that is, genetic, species, and ecosystem level. Agriculture and the livelihood of most people globally depend on the genetic diversity of species and the types of species within the ecosystem (ten Kate and Laird <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">1999</xref>). Based on the adverse effect of chemicals in agriculture, and on human health and the environment<index-term id="ITerm79"><term>Environment</term></index-term>, the use of chemicals is gradually being phased out to accommodate other techniques and technologies that can control plants and animal’s pests and diseases and reduce adverse effects currently experienced by living things and the environment.</p><p id="Par52">In order to achieve agricultural biodiversity<index-term id="ITerm80"><term>Agricultural biodiversity</term></index-term>, diseases and pests must be dealt with since they are one of the most deadly blows to food security. Seven thousand plant species and several thousand animal species have been used historically for human nutrition<index-term id="ITerm81"><term>Nutrition</term></index-term> and health requirements (Toledo and Burlingame <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2006</xref>). However, since the 1900s, only 12 crops and 14 animal species now provide most of the world’s food, so there is a very real threat to global biodiversity and also food security.</p><p id="Par53">Soil biological management techniques can improve crop yield and quality, especially through controlling pests and diseases and enhancing plant growth. Soil biodiversity determines the resource use efficiency, as well as the sustainability and resilience of low-input agro-ecological systems, which ensure the food security of much of the world’s population, especially the poor (Paoletti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2000</xref>). Part of the value placed on soil biodiversity is seen in biological control of pests and pathogens that improve plant health and thus also crop production and invariably improving local food security.<index-term id="ITerm82"><term>Microbial biodiversity, climate change impact</term></index-term></p><sec id="Sec15"><title><index-term id="ITerm83"><term>Microbial biodiversity, climate change impact</term><index-term><term>biocontrol of plant diseases</term></index-term></index-term>Biocontrol of Plant Diseases</title><p id="Par54">Biocontrol is one of the integrated disease management practices that help to reduce yield loss of crops (Thurman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2017</xref>). It is the control of plant diseases by applying living biological agents or exudates from such biological agents to the plants. The application could be via foliar application to the leaves or via the roots or seed inoculation prior to planting. Most biocontrol agents (BCA)<index-term id="ITerm84"><term>Biocontrol agents (BCA)</term></index-term> are either from the bacterial or fungal families with a few from the viral and nematodal families (O’Brien <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2017</xref>; Ajilogba and Babalola <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2019</xref>). Some BCAs are either rhizospheric or endospheric microbes, as they attack the pathogens using different modes including phosphate solubilization, antagonism, and hydrogen cyanide production (Ajilogba and Babalola <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>). One important fact about biocontrol is that they are specific to pathogens and sometimes to crops making them very effective. Their effectiveness is also determined by the mode of inoculation, duration of inoculation, time of inoculation, and whether they are applied singly or in a mixture. Climate change also influences biocontrol because changes in the environment<index-term id="ITerm85"><term>Environment</term></index-term> affect different dimension of agricultural production. In the context of climate change, with increasing temperature and variable rainfall patterns, changes are also observed in the cycling of nutrients and amount of soil water as a result of decreases in rainfall. The rainfall pattern also affects the patterns of incidence of plant pests, pathogens, and diseases, and invariably food production and security are ultimately affected (Lin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>; Fuhrer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2003</xref>; Jones and Thornton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2003</xref>).<index-term id="ITerm86"><term>Microbial biodiversity, climate change impact</term><index-term><term>biocontrol of plant diseases</term></index-term></index-term><index-term id="ITerm87"><term>Ocean acidification</term></index-term></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title><index-term id="ITerm88"><term>Microbial biodiversity, climate change impact</term><index-term><term>ocean acidification</term></index-term></index-term>Ocean Acidification</title><p id="Par55">This is more of a recent phenomenon with climate change. It is one of the potentially most harmful and deleterious effects of climate change. Over 30% of carbon dioxide produced in the atmosphere is absorbed by sea and oceans leading to the production of acids when carbon dioxide mixes with water. Most marine creatures cannot survive at low pH. Fish production is at a risk both directly and indirectly. The basic producers in the food chain such as planktons are also at risk, and this creates a reduction in food available to the large fish that consume then directly such as tuna, making them at risk of starving. Increasing acidity could harm shellfish by weakening their shells, which are created by removing calcium from seawater (Doney et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>). Acidification also threatens the structures of sensitive ecosystems upon which some fish and shellfish rely (Hatfield et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2014</xref>; Ziska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2016</xref>). Fish is not only a source of proteins and healthy fats but also a unique source of essential nutrients, including long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, iodine, vitamin D, and calcium. Therefore, the effects on climate change on the acidity of the oceans will cause a decrease in annual fish caught and processed at a good source of protein for humankind. Particularly in the Asian-Pacific region, fish protein forms a vital component of the diet (Needham and Funge-Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2014</xref>). It is not only true for small island states, with their strong dependence upon fisheries; it was also found in continental Asian countries even far inland due to large rivers, waterways, and many rice paddies. Therefore, the importance of fish in the diet should not be overlooked in discussions on nutrition<index-term id="ITerm89"><term>Nutrition</term></index-term> and food security and expected changes under the<index-term id="ITerm90"><term>Ocean acidification</term></index-term> climate<index-term id="ITerm91"><term>Microbial biodiversity, climate change impact</term><index-term><term>ocean acidification</term></index-term></index-term> change<index-term id="ITerm92"><term>Climate change</term><index-term><term>microbial biodiversity</term></index-term></index-term> conditions.<index-term id="ITerm93"><term>Food security and nutrition, climate change impact</term><index-term><term>microbial biodiversity</term></index-term></index-term></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par56">Climate change is a reality, both at global and the regional scales. The magnitude of change is still uncertain and highly variable, as is the timing of the change. However, the severe nature of the impacts which climate change could have on all sectors of Africa’s economy is becoming clear. The ability of individuals and communities to adapt to climate change depends on their vulnerability, exposure, and adaptive capacity. In turn, this is related to their financial and social capital, such as social networks and community cohesion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Recommendations</title><p id="Par57">Adaptation is a key factor that will shape the future severity of climate change impacts on food production; therefore, consideration of additional food such as underutilized crops and/or neglected foods can play a role in increasing food and nutrition supply.</p><p id="Par58">There is, therefore, a need for an integrated policy approach to protect the arable land.</p><p id="Par59">Further assistance needs to be given to small-scale farmers in rural areas in order to strengthen their crop production.</p><p id="Par60">The restoration of forestation should be encouraged in order to make adequate use of forests to address climate change.</p><p id="Par61">Globally and whenever necessary, nations should specifically relate their mitigation<index-term id="ITerm94"><term>Mitigation</term></index-term> and adaptation initiatives to their policy decisions on environmental sustainability in agriculture industry. These policies should both be holistic and anti-poor in order to bridge the gap on the unequal effect that climate change may have on the different agricultural industries.</p><p id="Par62">Consideration should be given to the economic, institutional, and social impacts of climate change by making policies that will target the global poor and vulnerable especially gender based in order to help them create communities that are resilient and robust.</p><p id="Par63">Disasters caused by climate change in agriculture communities demand immediate emergency relief response and comprehensive facilities such as shelters especially in the animal farming communities.
