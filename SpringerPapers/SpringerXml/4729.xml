Standard policies are failing to manage the systemic risk of dangerous-to-catastrophic climate change for a variety of reasons. In this chapter we clarify and expand on a market hypothesis that argues for a second externalized cost of carbon, called the Risk Cost of Carbon (RCC), as the appropriate solution to this risk problem.</p><p id="Par2">The combination of the SCC and RCC creates a new paradigm of complementary market pricing for the dual objectives of improving market efficiency and managing systemic risk, respectively. Introducing the RCC addresses the problem of how to decouple gross world product (GWP) from carbon emissions and how to solve the paradox of time discounting under systemic risk. Subsequently the RCC could have major implications for climate change economics, public policy, and sustainability theory. The hypothesis is novel by taking into consideration both the entropy and the mass of the carbon budget.</p><p id="Par3">The RCC is technically defined as the cost of imposing risk tolerances (%) on climate mitigation objectives, and it has units of USD per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e) mitigated. The RCC is internalized with a “global carbon reward” that manages a trade-off between market efficiency and climate certainty. The carbon reward is issued as a parallel currency and with an exchange rate that is managed by central banks over a rolling 100-year planning horizon. A key recommendation is to test the hypothesis with experiments.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Climate change</kwd><kwd>Systemic risk</kwd><kwd>Risk management</kwd><kwd>Carbon price</kwd><kwd>Biophysical</kwd><kwd>Thermodynamics</kwd><kwd>Entropy</kwd><kwd>Central bank</kwd><kwd>Monetary policy</kwd><kwd>Parallel currency</kwd><kwd>Macroprudential</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-3-030-03152-7_Chapter_8.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></book-part-meta><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">The topic of this chapter is the theoretical plausibility of a second externalized cost of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, called the <italic>Risk Cost of Carbon</italic> (RCC), whereby the first externalized cost is already established as the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>) originally postulated the existence of the RCC, which they describe as the cost of managing climate risk with positive incentives guided by cost-effectiveness analysis. The possible existence of the RCC is explained with the <italic>Holistic Market Hypothesis</italic> (HMH), which Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>) introduced using an epistemology of complementary relationships. The HMH could have major implications for economic assessments, climate policy, and environmental law because it posits that the total externalized cost of the market failure is significantly underestimated when the RCC is ignored.</p><p id="Par5">To understand why risk can be quantified as a cost—such as with the RCC—it is necessary to accept that risk is the “effect of uncertainty on objectives” (ISO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2009</xref>). The RCC is the cost of reducing the uncertainty of achieving specific climate mitigation objectives, whereby the targeted levels of uncertainty are the acceptable probabilities (%) of success or failure. The targeted levels of uncertainty may also be called “risk tolerances”, and the risk tolerances are used to estimate the additional mass of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e) to be mitigated.</p><p id="Par6">The HMH involves an interdisciplinary interpretation of carbon taxes and rewards, including an analysis of their economic objectives and their qualitative effect on the <italic>entropy</italic> of carbon in the environment. The topic of entropy is relevant because it is used to resolve a handful of temporal paradoxes that accompany the standard policy toolkit for climate mitigation. The HMH involves terminology from both neoclassical economics and physics, and this may pose a challenge because economists and physicists typically use different conceptual models, methods, and terminology. The HMH is presented as a macroscopic entropic theory, and if it is cogent and correct, then it should be possible to validate it with experiments and verify it with a statistical-mechanical approach.</p><p id="Par7">To guide the reader, the chapter begins with an introduction to the SCC and RCC (Sect. <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">1.1</xref>). Principles and concepts that support the HMH are described, including climate systemic risk, positive carbon pricing, thermodynamic laws, carbon emissions, and network theory (Sect. <xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec">1</xref>). The HMH is stated in Sect. <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">2</xref> in terms of temporal relationships and the RCC metric. In Sect. <xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">3</xref>, a policy for a global carbon reward is described that can internalize the RCC into the economy. In Sect. <xref rid="Sec18" ref-type="sec">4</xref>, an epistemology of complementary-and-opposite relationships is applied to the carbon tax to verify that the SCC and the RCC are complementary. In Sect. <xref rid="Sec26" ref-type="sec">5</xref>, the theoretical utility of the RCC is discussed in terms of solving a temporal paradox, and the practical utility of the global carbon reward is discussed in terms of the Paris Climate Agreement (COP21), net zero emissions, global growth, and ethics. In Sect. <xref rid="Sec38" ref-type="sec">6</xref>, some concluding remarks are provided, and finally, in Sect. <xref rid="Sec39" ref-type="sec">7</xref>, recommendations are given for future research. For reasons of brevity, the political feasibility of climate policies is not discussed.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Externalized Cost of Carbon</title><p id="Par8">The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) is a negative externality created by anthropogenic GHGs, and it is typically defined as the time-discounted marginal loss in economic welfare that results from 1 metric tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO<sub>2</sub>e) emitted in a given year (e.g., IAWG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2013</xref>). Carbon taxes, which are a kind of Pigovian tax, can be used to internalize the SCC into the economy. Other market-based policies can also be used to incentivize emissions reductions, including cap-and-trade schemes. The ideal carbon tax is related to the SCC under cost-benefit analysis, and consequently the SCC is important in the study of climate change economics (Nordhaus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2017</xref>; Stern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">Despite decades of research into the SCC (e.g., U.S. President <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">1981</xref>), the scholarship on carbon pricing has not associated a specific objective with offering global rewards for climate mitigation. If global rewards for carbon represent an unused price signal, then two fundamentally important questions deserve our attention, namely:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par10">What is the financial mechanism for a global carbon reward?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11">What is the economic objective of a global carbon reward?</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par12">Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>) claim that—based on their Holistic Market Hypothesis (HMH)—a global reward for carbon mitigation can (1) be provided with monetary policy and (2) can be used to manage <italic>climate systemic risk</italic>. Aglietta and Espagne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>) originally coined the term “climate systemic risk” in reference to financial and physical fragilities associated with anthropogenic climate change (refer Sect. <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">1.3</xref>). If these answers to the two questions are correct, then a third question arises:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par13">What is the total externalized cost of carbon emissions?</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par14">Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>) postulate that (3) the total externalized cost of carbon emissions is the SCC plus a second externality, called the Risk Cost of Carbon (RCC). The RCC is the assessed cost of providing a positive externality and it does not substitute for the SCC, which is the assessed cost of a negative externality. They define the RCC as follows:<disp-quote><p id="Par15">…the market price of each metric tonne of additional CO<sub>2</sub>-e mitigation service that is needed to reduce climate systemic risk to an agreed limit. (p. 41)</p></disp-quote></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Positive Carbon Price</title><p id="Par16">The literature lacks clear terminology for defining a positive carbon price (e.g., Sirkis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2015</xref>), and to provide clarity, the terms “positive carbon price,” “carbon subsidy,” and “carbon reward” are given the following definitions for this exposition:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par17">A positive carbon price is defined here to be a price signal that offers payment for mitigating carbon emissions—for abating emissions and for removing carbon from the atmosphere<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref>—and with the payment being divorced from carbon offsetting schemes.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par19">A carbon subsidy is defined here to be a positive carbon price that is offered as an ex post or ex ante payment and when the payment is made with a national fiat currency or as a tax deduction.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par20">A carbon reward is defined here to be a positive carbon price that is offered as an ex post payment for verified carbon mitigation, and when the reward payment is (a) made with a parallel currency denominated in carbon by mass, and (b) provided with conditions for the awardees to maintain an agreed standard of service.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par21">The above provisional terms may help to open up a wider discourse on positive pricing. According to Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>), the global carbon reward should be implemented as a parallel currency so that monetary policy and currency trading can be used to internalize the RCC into the economy. The global carbon reward generates a positive externality because it acts as preventative climate insurance, and this insurance may be classified as a ‘public good’ because it yields physical benefits that are non-rivalrous and non-excludable. The global carbon reward is a macroprudential responsibility of central banks, and this responsibility should be insulated from political interference. In the following section, we will examine the concept of “climate systemic risk,” which is used to define the objective of the global carbon reward and the macroprudential agenda.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Climate Systemic Risk</title><p id="Par22">Aglietta and Espagne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>) describe “climate systemic risk” as the ensemble of financial and physical fragilities produced by greenhouse emissions, whereby “fragility” is the possibility of an unacceptable systemic failure. The actual impacts of a systemic failure may not be known with confidence, and so an emphasis is placed on assessing the probability of a systemic failure rather than trying to predict the quantity of the damages. One example of a climate systemic risk is the possibility that 2.0 °C of global warming will be exceeded by the year 2100. The international ambition to limit this climate systemic risk is a major inspiration for the Paris Climate Agreement (UNFCCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par23">Aglietta and Espagne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>) equate the climate systemic risk with the cost of preventative insurance, whereby the cost is “...equivalent of a value that society attributes to mitigation activities” (p. 5). Aglietta and Espagne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>) also link their insurance proposal to central banks and monetary policy as follows:<disp-quote><p id="Par24">The incorporation of some kind of climate signal in monetary policy and financial stability oversight is required, not because the central banks should be a direct actor of the low-carbon transition, but as part of their financial stability mandate. (p. 18)</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par25">Aglietta and Espagne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>) suggest that climate systemic risk can form the basis of a new hypothesis that differs from the traditional theory for externalized costs:<disp-quote><p id="Par26">The climate systemic risk hypothesis radically departs from the premises of standard externality theory. It suggests that we might want to drastically diminish the probability of occurrence of some very bad outcomes for society, which might lead to its quasi-destruction. (p. 13)</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par27">Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>) claim that a global reward for carbon mitigation is a kind of preventative insurance against unwanted global warming and that it has similarity with payments for ecosystem services (PES) and is analogous to preventative health insurance. Aglietta and Espagne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>) and Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>) both justify their collective insurance proposals, but they use somewhat different reasoning. Aglietta and Espagne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>) emphasize the <italic>Radical Uncertainty Hypothesis</italic> (e.g., Knight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1921</xref>; Keynes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1921</xref>) and climate fragility as key justifications, whereas Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>) present the Holistic Market Hypothesis (HMH) and the RCC as their justification. The main difference between the two proposals is that Aglietta and Espagne (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>) recommend a break from the standard model for externalized costs, whereas Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>) present the RCC as an augmentation to the standard model. In the following sections, we will review the key biophysical concepts underpinning the HMH.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Biophysical Economics</title><p id="Par28">Biophysical economics is an emerging school of economic thought that attempts to understand the economy using the laws of thermodynamics (e.g., Cleveland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1987</xref>). A key strength of the biophysical approach is that the laws of thermodynamics are applicable to all biophysical systems, including to civilization, the climate system, and living organisms. Despite its solid theoretical foundation, biophysical economics is currently only a minor school because it is philosophically at odds with the classical/neoclassical worldview that economic activity is driven by human agency. For example, a commonly cited definition of classical economics is based on Robbins’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1935</xref>) review of the subject, as follows:<disp-quote><p id="Par29">Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses. (p. 16)</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par30">A distinctive feature of the Holistic Market Hypothesis (HMH) is its acceptance of both the classical/neoclassical approach of studying human behavior, and the biophysical approach of studying energy dissipation as the universal source of all kinds of agency. Under the HMH, the biophysical economic worldview that supports the SCC and RCC is considered to be more general than the classical/neoclassical economic worldview that only supports the SCC. This hierarchy of worldviews is relevant when addressing carbon emissions, and the underlying reason is that civilization has its own emergent agency because it dissipates energy. This agency can be relatively strong compared with the agency of individuals, social collectives and political groups. The issue of competing agency is especially relevant to the challenge of mitigating carbon emissions, and this is because the primary energy supply, the agricultural sector, and many other economic activities are strongly coupled to carbon. Under the HMH, the expectation is that civilization’s agency will undermine attempts to quickly reduce carbon emissions. Under the HMH, it is interpreted that previously successful strategies for mitigating other types of pollution are unlikely to be effective when applied to carbon, and this is because most other pollutants are not strongly coupled to the energy supply (e.g. sulphur in acid rain can be removed, and ozone depleting substances can be substituted).</p><p id="Par31">A unique feature of the HMH is the way that the Second Law of Thermodynamics is used to qualitatively interpret the SCC and RCC as a complementary pair. The two most important laws in thermodynamics are known from the works of Clausius (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1854</xref>), Maxwell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1860</xref>), Boltzmann (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1872</xref>), and others:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par32">(Law 1) The First Law of Thermodynamics is the conservation law for energy. It states that the energy of a system is conserved because energy cannot be created or destroyed. The First Law is time-symmetric, and energy is an extensive property with units of Joules.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33">(Law 2) The Second Law of Thermodynamics is the entropy law for matter and energy. The entropy of a classical system is a measure of the “disorder” or randomness of the particles that comprise the system. The Second Law states that the entropy of an isolated system increases monotonically with energy dissipation and eventually peaks at thermal equilibrium. Under the Second Law it is possible for energy dissipation to have reduced the entropy of an open system if the entropy of the open system plus its surroundings has increased. The Second Law is time-asymmetric, and entropy is an extensive property with units of Joules/Kelvin.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par34">The first two laws of thermodynamics were originally derived for gases because gases are relatively simple to study (e.g., Clausius <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1867</xref>). The First Law may be intuitive to most people, but the Second Law often requires clarification. The Second Law is supported by statistical theories for the randomness of particle interactions (e.g., Maxwell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1860</xref>; Boltzmann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1872</xref>), and the law explains why heat will flow down a temperature gradient—from hot to cold—but not in the other direction.</p><p id="Par35">The Second Law is vitally important to our understanding of civilization as a type of ‘heat engine’ that dissipates energy to do the work of producing goods and services while releasing heat and high-entropy waste, such as CO<sub>2</sub>. For example, the First and Second Laws are used to derive the maximum theoretical efficiency of a cyclic engine that converts heat into mechanical work (i.e., the Carnot heat engine). The Second Law also applies to living cells in terms of explaining the local decrease in entropy within the cell walls: a product of energy dissipation and an increase in the entropy of the environment.

By restating this operational objective as the reduction of the <italic>entropy</italic> of carbon within the environment, a connection is made between these policies and the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The entropy of carbon increases when it enters the atmosphere as GHGs, because carbon in this gaseous phase has significantly more entropy than the same mass of carbon that is chemically bound in organisms and solids (e.g., in biota, coal, and carbonate rocks), trapped in sedimentary rocks (e.g., in oil and natural gas), and trapped in ice (e.g., in methane clathrates and permafrost).</p><p id="Par52">The conceptual model for the HMH also considers that taxes and rewards for carbon will incentivize goods and services differently, resulting in two different patterns of decarbonization within civilization and two different patterns of energy dissipation within civilization. The conceptual model is that two market prices with opposite sign (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) will result in two patterns of energy dissipation that can reduce the entropy of carbon in the environment.

The first paradox is the paradox of agency, which occurs when only one of the two perspectives is believed correct. The first paradox is resolved below.

The Type II perspective is systemic by assuming that energy dissipation is the primary agency in the economy. The two perspectives appear paradoxical because they both seem plausible but can also result in radically different interpretations. Under the HMH this paradox is resolved by treating the paradox as a misinterpretation: the claim here is that the Type I and Type II perspectives are compatible when human agency is considered a product of energy dissipation. This interpretation of human agency implies that the biomechanics of economic agents is far too complex to be modeled deterministically and that the neoclassical approach of studying human behavior is a pragmatic simplification. Under the HMH, both types of agency—(Type I) human agency and (Type II) energy dissipation—are assumed to operate simultaneously.</p><p id="Par55">The crucial difference between Type I and Type II perspectives is not their source of agency, but rather it is the manner in which these perspectives influence policy choices for managing carbon emissions. The crucial question is this: why do (Type I) neoclassical economists promote policies for a negative price on carbon instead of a positive price?

In this exposition we clarify the epistemology of Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>), which is the epistemology of complementary-and-opposite relationships. The authors define the epistemology as follows:<disp-quote><p id="Par67">The application of MPD begins with the epistemology of defining complementary pairs as two socio-economic relationships that have opposite characteristics and a capacity to aggregate price signals. (p. 12)</p></disp-quote></p><p id="Par68">The epistemology begins with (Type I) negative pricing and (Type II) positive pricing (refer Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The Type I and Type II policies provide incentives to reduce carbon emissions, but their effects in the marketplace differ because they price carbon in complementary and opposite ways. The epistemology transcends neoclassical economics by considering climate policies as biophysical networks that are designed to reduce the entropy of carbon in the environment (refer Sects. <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">1.4</xref> and <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">1.6</xref>).</p><p id="Par69">Before attempting to verify the HMH with the epistemology, it is necessary to review the policy for a global carbon reward, including its framework, economic instrument, financial mechanism, and the risk assessment approach for estimating the RCC (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">3</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Global Carbon Reward</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Policy Background</title><p id="Par70">The Holistic Market Hypothesis (HMH) is a market theory that the global carbon reward is inherently suited to the objective of internalizing the Risk Cost of Carbon (RCC) into the economy (Type II in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>) recommend that the global carbon reward be implemented using their <italic>Global 4C Risk Mitigation</italic> policy, which is abbreviated as “Global 4C.” Under the Global 4C policy, a parallel currency—which is the reward instrument—is used to internalize the RCC into the economy. The parallel currency is given the generic name <italic>Complementary Currencies for Climate Change</italic> (4C). The Global 4C policy is described below with caveats that the policy has not been validated with models or pilots and the policy may need some adjusting or refining.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Policy Framework</title><p id="Par71">The Global 4C policy is designed to offer a global carbon reward (Type II in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), whereby the reward payment will be provided with 4C issuance. The reward’s financial value will equal the current exchange rate of 4C, and the wealth transferred to market actors is the <italic>seigniorage income</italic> of the 4C as it is issued. The seigniorage income will equal the 4C exchange rate (USD per 100 kg of CO<sub>2</sub>e) multiplied by the mass of CO<sub>2</sub>e mitigated and less administrative costs that will be deducted as commissions. The Global 4C policy will achieve its macroeconomic objectives by pegging the 4C price to mirror the RCC over time.</p><p id="Par72">The global carbon reward—provided by the 4C parallel currency—will be offered to market actors who voluntarily mitigate carbon, and a wide spectrum of mitigation technologies will be rewarded. The rewards may be weighted to reflect social and ecological co-benefits, and the reward rules will have a scientific basis. The amount of 4C issued will be linked to measurement reporting and verification (MRV) for accountability, and the 4C will be offered conditionally such that actors are required to fulfill service agreements that could last for up to 100 years. Chen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2018a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">b</xref>) elaborates on how long-lived service agreements can be managed with blockchain ledgers and “smart” digital contracts. A central authority will govern the MRV, but operationally there will be numerous contractors working over the Internet to undertake the MRV. Market actors can be supported with secondary services for information sharing, collaboration, and coinvesting in projects.</p><p id="Par73">Central banks will play a major role in the Global 4C policy, as they will be required to implement unorthodox monetary policies involving quantitative easing (QE) and currency trading—called <italic>carbon quantitative easing</italic> (CQE)—to peg the 4C price to the RCC over the rolling 100-year planning horizon. As is explained in Sect. <xref rid="Sec16" ref-type="sec">3.4</xref>, by pegging the 4C price to mirror the RCC, a secular “bull market” in 4C will be invoked in foreign exchange currency markets (the Forex) for the time when the RCC is rising in magnitude. The 4C bull market will attract private purchases of 4C, thereby mobilizing private finance for a high-inertia low-carbon transition.</p><p id="Par74">To maintain public accountability, the total supply of 4C will be maintained in proportion to a global carbon stocktake. The central authority will provide accountability by periodically reconciling defaults on service agreements with 4C chargebacks and 4C demurrage fees. Demurrage fees are equivalent to a negative interest rate charged on 4C holdings. The carbon recorded in the stocktake will <italic>not</italic> be available for trading as carbon offset credits (although 4C will be available for trading); and the retirement of all of the carbon that is recorded in the stocktake will make carbon offsets scarcer and more expensive.</p><p id="Par75">The Global 4C policy will internalize the RCC into the world economy. This internalization process may be described as a deleveraging process for climate risk. The deleveraging of risk will occur as 4C liquidity is provided to low-carbon projects in proportion to their carbon mitigation results. The improved profitability of low-carbon projects will attract private investment to the low-carbon sector of the economy, and it will leverage debt finance for low-carbon projects. Climate risk deleveraging will also occur when market actors respond to the 4C global reward by undertaking long-term R&amp;D programs to develop carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies that are scalable and profitable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Parallel Currency</title><p id="Par76">As mentioned above, the economic instrument of the Global 4C policy is a parallel currency, called 4C.

The chosen unit of account for 4C is smaller than that of the RCC by a factor of 10.

A premise of this hypothesis is that market <italic>inefficiencies</italic> are acceptable as a trade-off for reducing climate systemic risk and avoiding dangerous tipping points. Two key premises are involved in the HMH: (a) market-based climate policies function as biophyiscal networks that dissipate energy and reduce the entropy of carbon in the environment while increasing total entropy, and (b) market-based climate policies that employ positive and negative carbon pricing are time-asymmetric under the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The HMH is verfied by checking for time-asymmetry of the dominant social relationships and dominant social responses of the complementary policies. Market Policy Dualism (MPD) is the inspiration for the epistemology of complementary policy relationships, which is explained in Sect. <xref rid="Sec20" ref-type="sec">4.2</xref>. The epistemology is applied in three steps: (Step 1) reversing prices, (Step 2) declaring a currency with biophysical units, and (Step 3) comparing policy objectives based on the “arrow of time.” The logic of the three steps is explained below, and the arrow of time refers to monotonic entropy increases under the Second Law (Sect. <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">1.4</xref>).

The translation is used to derive the policy for a positive carbon price from a policy for a negative carbon price. Perhaps surprising is that market policies have the same dimensionality as money, and this is because they have similar functions (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). William Jevons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1875</xref>) famously defined money as having four functions, and his ideas inspired Milnes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1919</xref>) to write the following couplet: “Money’s a matter of functions four, a Medium, a Measure, a Standard, a Store” (p. 55). The functions of market policies and money are similar, but only certain types of market policy require a new currency instrument. The global carbon reward is one such policy, because it declares a parallel currency denominated in carbon. Cap-and-trade schemes declare permits and carbon offset credits for trading in carbon markets, but these are not currencies per se because their social agreements are only designed to address specific markets.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The three-step epistemological translation for carbon pricing is compared with the four functions of money to achieve dimensional completeness</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="4"><p>Carbon pricing</p></th><th colspan="3"><p>Money</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>Translation<sup>a</sup></p></th><th><p>Carbon tax<sup>b</sup></p></th><th><p>Carbon subsidy</p></th><th><p>Carbon reward<sup>c</sup></p></th><th><p>Jevons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1875</xref>)</p></th><th><p>Classical</p></th><th><p>Biophysical</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Step 2.

For example, Eisenstein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011</xref>) writes: “Money is merely a social agreement, a story that assigns meanings and roles” (p. 108).</p><p id="Par101">Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> compares Jevons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1875</xref>) four functions with a classic description and a biophysical interpretation of these same functions. The “store of value” corresponds to power (J/s) under the biophysical description of money, which is inspired by Garrett’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>) economic model [refer Eqs. (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>) and (<xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>)]. The “social agreement” corresponds to the biophysical function called the “entropic relationship,” which is introduced here with Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. This biophysical interpretation of the social agreement refers to the influence that social agreements have on future patterns of production, consumption, energy dissipation, and high-entropy waste, such as CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In Sect. <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">1.6</xref> it was suggested that market-based climate policies are biophysical networks through which energy dissipation can reduce the entropy of carbon. Step 3 of the translation is the reversal of the social agreement for the carbon tax to achieve a policy objective for the carbon reward: to be consistent with the “arrow of time” under the Second Law (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Axioms</title><p id="Par102"><bold>Axiom A</bold> is a statement that goods and services contain “embodied” energy because energy is always needed to produce goods and services. A corollary to Axiom A is that money is indirectly associated with embodied energy, because the value of money grants access to goods and services.</p><p id="Par103"><bold>Axiom B</bold> is a statement that the unit type (unit of account) of money is fundamentally important for setting the context of value in the economy. The unit type of money must be an <italic>extensive</italic> property, and in the economy there are three principal options: (1) commodities (e.g., 1 oz. of silver), (2) socially or legally declared information (e.g., USD), and (3) services (e.g., 1 hour of education). A fourth option is to adopt a basket of units, but this is not a principal unit type.</p><p id="Par104">A corollary to Axiom B is that service money—money with units defined by a service—is useful for offering rewards to incentivize positive externalities. The corollary is that monetary policy can be used to incentivize the supply of services, assuming that an administrative system is available to couple the currency supply to the observed supply of service. An example is Solarcoin,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> which is a cryptographic token and reward with units of 1 MWh of solar-derived electricity.</p><p id="Par106"><bold>Axiom C</bold> refers to an 0established principle in economics that when a carbon tax (a Pigovian tax) is guided by cost-benefit analysis, the tax improves the efficiency of the market by increasing the marginal private cost of production so that the carbon emissions are reduced sufficiently to achieve a social welfare optimum. The optimum in consumption occurs when the marginal social cost equals the marginal social benefit. This kind of efficiency is neoclassical and is described here as “good efficiency.”</p><p id="Par107"><bold>Axiom D</bold> refers to an established principle in economics that when market actors make investments with imperfect knowledge, they invest according to a risk-versus-reward trade-off (or risk-return trade-off). Consequently, market actors take greater risks when they anticipate greater rewards/returns.</p><p id="Par108"><bold>Axiom E</bold> is a statement that there exist two ethics for reducing carbon emissions. One ethic is to create (a) <italic>good efficiency</italic> (refer Axiom C), and the other ethic is to create (b) <italic>good inefficiency</italic>. The term “good efficiency” is introduced to describe the neoclassical ambition of improving market efficiency to maximize social welfare: the point where the private cost of production plus externalities equals the social benefit. The term “good inefficiency” is introduced to describe the diversion of capital and resources to reduce carbon emissions for the objective of limiting systemic risk and providing climate certainty. This “good inefficiency” is the result of a tradeoff between market efficiency and climate certainty, and it may result in an increase in other measures of well-being that take into account socio-ecological regeneration and sustainability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Translation for Price Reversal (Step 1)</title><p id="Par109">The first epistemological translation compares a negative carbon price with a positive carbon price, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.

The following discussion is offered as a preliminary check on the hypothesis, including an interdisciplinary interpretation of the conceptual model, a proposal for experimental testing, and a solution to the temporal paradox of time discounting under systemic risk (Sect. <xref rid="Sec27" ref-type="sec">5.1</xref>). The utility of the global carbon reward is then discussed in terms of its compatibility with the 2015 Paris Agreement and in terms of achieving “net zero” emissions and managing economic growth (Sect. <xref rid="Sec33" ref-type="sec">5.2</xref>). The ethics of the new paradigm for externalized costs and “carrot and stick” policies are discussed in Sect. <xref rid="Sec37" ref-type="sec">5.3</xref>.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Theoretical Cogency</title><sec id="Sec28"><title>Interdisciplinary Interpretation</title><p id="Par132">Entropy is an extensive physical property that describes the “disorder” of matter that is the result of energy dissipation. In terms of living organisms and civilization, increasing entropy is often associated with decay, and locally reducing entropy is often associated with life and homeostasis. Stabilization of the climate will require limiting the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere, and this implies that greater control over the entropy of carbon in the environment is needed. The HMH takes an interdisciplinary approach by proposing a causal link between carbon pricing, energy dissipation, and the changing entropy of carbon. This approach is unusual because few scholars have framed climate change economics in terms of entropy (e.g., Garrett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>; Guy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>). The standard narrative on climate change economics is founded on neoclassical assumptions (e.g., Stern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2007</xref>), and consequently most attention is given to neoclassical policies such as the carbon tax and cap-and-trade. The global carbon reward policy is unorthodox, however it addresses many common policy issues related to risk and uncertainty associated with climate change (IPCC 2014a).</p><p id="Par133">A reasonable question regarding the HMH is this: given that standard market-based policies and regulatory approaches have successfully limited other types of pollution, such as acid rain (Chan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>), why should carbon be deserving of special treatment? Under the HMH, carbon is assumed to be a special case because it has exceptional chemical functionality compared with other elements. This functionality includes (a) its <italic>tetravalence</italic> and ability to form a wide diversity of organic molecules, (b) its capacity to store and release chemical energy via long-chain organic molecules, (c) its abundance on the Earth’s surface, and (d) its role in storing and replicating large amounts of biological information, such as in DNA. Under the HMH, civilization is interpreted to behave like a heat engine that is currently structured to consume fossil fuels and biofuels as dominant energy sources. This heat engine expresses the two kinds of agency mentioned in Sect. <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">2</xref>: (Type I) human agency and (Type II) energy dissipation. The agency of energy dissipation is overlooked in neoclassical models and policies, which tend to focus on the optimisation of economic welfare. The HMH, on the other hand, points to a need to price climate systemic risk into the financial system to effectively manage climate mitigation in response to dynamic system feedbacks and tipping points of various kinds (e.g. Steffen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par134">The HMH invites policy makers to reassess climate policies in a thermodynamic context. This may begin with the view that social agreements can influence future energy dissipation and entropy (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The HMH posits that all climate policies (taxes, fee-and-dividend, cap-and-trade, carbon offset trading, subsidies, etc.) are designed to reduce/limit the entropy of carbon with varying levels of stringency. Under the HMH, the carbon tax and the global carbon reward are complementary policies because they are time-asymmetric and are likely to be optimal for improving market efficiency and climate certainty, respectively (see Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Experimental Testing</title><p id="Par135">Attempts should be made to experimentally validate the HMH. A variety of experiments and pilot projects should be developed to detect statistical differences in (a) social cooperation, (b) market efficiency, (c) climate certainty, and (d) long-term economic resilience. These tests should apply negative and positive pricing at the decision points of carbon emissions and carbon mitigation, respectively. Experiments should be designed to take into account a variety of factors, including climate sensitivity, climate and social tipping points, economic growth, primary energy supply/demand, energy return on energy invested (EROEI), innovation rates, information sharing, and market sentiment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Resolution of the Temporal Paradox</title><p id="Par136">Mark Carney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>) made obvious the <italic>Tragedy of the Horizon</italic>, which refers to a temporal paradox created by society’s inability to address the temporal dilemma of climate change. The dilemma is that society is weakly motivated to avoid climate damages that will occur in the distant future and by the time the damages materialize it will be too late to mitigate them. The 4C exchange rate mechanism can address the dilemma, because the yield on 4C (i.e., the time derivative of the RCC) will generate a secular 4C bull market and preemptive transfers of financial capital into low-carbon sectors of the economy (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

The temporal paradox is further examined in the following discussion of the time discounting of consumption and investments.</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Time Discounting of Consumption</title><p id="Par137">According to Nordhaus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2007a</xref>), Weitzman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2010</xref>), Dietz et al.

A higher <italic>r</italic> may satisfy the market’s desire for immediate or early consumption, but it also increases the risk of worsening climate change. The paradox is that high <italic>r</italic> values (more often descriptive) and low <italic>r</italic> values (more often prescriptive) may be proposed by stakeholders. A related question is this: if a lower <italic>r</italic> provides a hedge against climate risk, then does a reduction in <italic>r</italic> constitute a risk premium? Here we argue that reducing <italic>r</italic> is only a pseudo risk premium, because under the Tinbergen Rule, the number of policy objectives should be matched by the same number of policy tools (Tinbergen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">1952</xref>). If the objective of the carbon tax is to achieve market efficiency and a welfare maximum, then an additional tool is evidently needed to address the second objective, which is to limit the climate systemic risk (Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par139">A sad irony of manipulating the Ramsey formula to manage climate risk is that the approach will require international consensus on time discounting when economists, politicians, and society have diverse and sometimes contradictory views on the discount rate and taxation. The RCC metric provides an escape from the time discounting quagmire, by allowing policy makers to price risk in global financial markets using the 4C parallel currency. The 4C price and yield—4C(<italic>t</italic>) and Y4C(<italic>t</italic>)—are both measures of the climate systemic risk, and these metrics respond reflexively to the climate systemic risk (Sect. <xref rid="Sec17" ref-type="sec">3.5</xref>). 4C creates an independent price channel that is suitable for risk communication because 4C is immediately beneficial to market actors. Macroprudential regulation of climate change by central banks may also provide a politically stable method of managing climate risk.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Time Discounting of Investments</title><p id="Par140">A formula for the time discounting of investments is the consumption based capital asset pricing model (CCAPM), after Lucas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1978</xref>):<disp-formula id="Equ9"><label>9</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ9_Math"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.25em"/><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ9_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

For example, a low-carbon project with a <italic>β</italic> of 0 or 2 may be discounted at 1.6% or 11.2%, respectively, based on a <italic>π</italic> of 4.8% and an <italic>R</italic><sub>f</sub> of 1.6% (Dietz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2018</xref>). The important question is whether a high insurance premium (i.e., low discounting) is justified with Eq. (<xref rid="Equ9" ref-type="disp-formula">9</xref>) when the investment provides climate mitigation benefits that are correlated to consumption. A difficulty of using CCAPM is that the so-called insurance premium depends on whether society will be richer or poorer in the future and knowing that higher global temperatures positively correlate with being richer. Nordhaus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2007b</xref>) acknowledges that “This leads to the paradoxical result that there is actually a negative risk premium on high climate-change outcomes” (p. 113).</p><p id="Par142">Another feature of applying CCAPM, and the traditional capital asset pricing model (CAPM), is that investors have diverse views on climate change and risk, and forcing climate-based standards for <italic>β</italic> may prove difficult. The RCC metric can bypass these challenges by establishing a risk-free yield on 4C holdings—Y4C(<italic>t</italic>)—in foreign exchange currency markets. 4C holdings will have low sovereign and exchange rate risks, and so 4C trading can shift the risk-free rate of return, <italic>R</italic><sub>f</sub>, to a new level based on an internationally agreed tolerances for climate risk (Sect. <xref rid="Sec17" ref-type="sec">3.5</xref>).

Article 2 defines the ambition of staying well below 2.0 °C of global warming and to pursue 1.5 °C and to “...significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change.” The Paris Agreement lacks a mechanism for setting and enforcing risk tolerances, and so no specific level of climate stabilization is actually guaranteed by the agreement. The global carbon reward can address this shortfall, but this will require a new road map for negotiating risk tolerances for climate mitigation and a concrete plan to implement the 4C exchange rate mechanism. A political agreement will be needed that is either an adjunct to the Paris Agreement or a separate agreement. Regardless of the details, the new policy for enforcing risk tolerances should not result in new direct taxes for citizens and businesses because the effectiveness of the new policy is strongly dependent on offering rewards and not penalties.</p><p id="Par144">A peak authority will be relied upon as the macroprudential regulator of the 4C exchange rate mechanism (Sect. <xref rid="Sec16" ref-type="sec">3.4</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>), is based on predictable 4C exchange rates and risk-free investing, and it represents a possible new model for managed degrowth (van den Bergh and Kallis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2012</xref>). Returns or yields on 4C holdings/investments are risk free because they are underwritten by central banks [refer Eq. (<xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="disp-formula">5</xref>), Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, and Axiom E]. The 4C yield is factored into all investment decisions when the yield influences the official ‘risk-free rate of return’ in the global financial system (refer Sect. <xref rid="Sec30" ref-type="sec">5.1.3</xref>). The resulting increase in 4C holdings will place a negative feedback on spending and GWP per capita. The negative feedback is established because the 4C price is a function of GWP, as defined by Eqs. (<xref rid="Equ12" ref-type="disp-formula">12</xref>) and (<xref rid="Equ13" ref-type="disp-formula">13</xref>). The negative feedback on dirty GWP also creates an opportunity to improve economic welfare based on other indices. For example, the 4C reward rules for climate mitigation can be weighted to enhance social and ecological co-benefits that are reflected in the Inclusive Wealth Index (IWI), the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), and the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs). These policy co-benefits give tangible meaning to the term “good inefficiency”.</p><p id="Par157">With respect to the first two Kaya variables (Eq. <xref rid="Equ14" ref-type="disp-formula">14</xref>), the 4C reward/currency can be used to:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par158">Incentivize governments to improve women’s education and family planning</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par159">Incentivize market actors to save 4C, thereby influencing average GWP per capita</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par160">With respect to the third Kaya variable and the additional carbon mitigation that is decoupled from GWP (Eq. <xref rid="Equ14" ref-type="disp-formula">14</xref>), the 4C reward/currency can be used to:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par161">Incentivize reductions in the average CO<sub>2</sub> intensity of GWP</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par162">Incentivize large-scale CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration using negative emissions technologies (NETs)</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Philosophy and Ethics</title><p id="Par163">The Holistic Market Hypothesis (HMH) appears to resolve the Tragedy of the Horizon paradoxes (Carney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>). The keystone of the solution is the RCC as the missing complement to the SCC. If the proposed risk management approach (Eqs. <xref rid="Equ6" ref-type="disp-formula">6</xref> and <xref rid="Equ7" ref-type="disp-formula">7</xref>) is acceptable to the science and economics community, then a fundamental shift may emerge in the narrative on climate change economics and ethics. This shift could be profound because the RCC may ascribe significantly greater economic value to the protection of the climate, ecosystems, people, culture, and species.</p><p id="Par164">The SCC and cost-benefit analysis emerged from Pigou’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1932</xref>) tax as a pragmatic way of improving market efficiency and maximizing economic welfare: reflecting the ethics of neoclassical economics and anthropocentrism. The RCC and cost-effectiveness analysis described in this exposition (Tables <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) offer a new road map for managing climate systemic risk: reflecting the ethics of biophsyical economics and naturalism. Synergy provided by the internalization of the SCC and RCC (Eq. <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="disp-formula">3</xref>) might provide civilization with long-term resilience: reflecting an ethic of holism. Geo-engineering the Earth’s energy balance was not considered in this exposition, and the economics and ethics of such an approach are not addressed here.</p><p id="Par165">The HMH has important philosophical implications by showing that the externalized cost of carbon is influenced by the observer’s worldview and choice of metrics. This is similar to Bohr’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1937</xref>) <italic>Principle of Complementarity</italic>, which asserts that an observed quantum state (kinematic or dynamic) is determined by the observer’s choice of measurement. In terms of assessing and responding to climate change, an observer could adopted either a (Type I) classical/neoclassical perspective, or a (Type II) biophysical perspective. An observer with a Type II perspective may tend to focus on system dynamics and systemic risks as reported in biophysical studies (e.g., Garrett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>), probabilistic studies (e.g., Raftery et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2017</xref>), and Earth system interpretations (e.g., Lenton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2012</xref>; Steffen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2018</xref>). An observer with a Type I perpsective may tend to focus on standard emissions scenarios, marginal damages, welfare maximization, and mainstream policy options (e.g., Stern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2007</xref>; UNFCCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p id="Par166">Climate change is still mostly an unmanaged problem, and this chapter proposes that the Holistic Market Hypothesis (HMH) of Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>) could be a missing link in resolving the climate crisis (refer Tables <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, and <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The hypothesis is that the Risk Cost of Carbon (RCC) is the positive externality that associates with carbon mitigation services. The RCC is equivalent to the cost of providing preventative climate insurance, and it involves no direct taxes because it is funded through monetary policy and currency trading in open markets. If the SCC and the RCC can be validated as the two externalized costs of carbon, then exciting new endeavors in environmental economics will be possible—including the monetization of climate risk and the improved management of the economy for long-term human prosperity and ecological sustainability.</p><p id="Par167">A technical deduction is that a parallel currency—Complementary Currencies for Climate Change (4C)—can be used to internalize the RCC into the economy. The 4C is used to offer a global carbon reward and to price climate risk in foreign exchange currency markets. If the yield on 4C is risk-free, a higher risk-free rate of return will be created for investors, thereby hedging the climate risk. 4C should be implemented independently of taxes and cap-and-trade markets, because 4C will be used to retire carbon and increase the international price for carbon offset credits. An international agreement on risk tolerances and an international monetary policy are needed to introduce 4C into foreign exchange markets and to create a global price signal for the RCC. The “Global 4C” policy is proposed for this purpose.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Research Recommendations</title><p id="Par168">It is recommended that the HMH be intensively researched. This research should involve central banks under their existing mandates or new mandates for the macroprudential regulation of climate risk. The research should be treated with urgency because the window of opportunity for achieving Article 2 of the Paris Agreement is closing (Figueres et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2017</xref>). Items for research include (1) developing an experimental test for the HMH (refer Sect. <xref rid="Sec29" ref-type="sec">5.1.2</xref>), (2) investigating a statistical-mechanical theory for the efficiency/inefficiency and risk-taking/risk-reducing asymmetries of complementary nonequilibrium carbon pricing (refer Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), (3) developing a model that shows how economic growth and prosperity are managed with complementary carbon pricing (refer Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), and (4) developing 4C reward rules to leverage ecosystem services (e.g., biodiversity) and social co-benefits (e.g., quality of life, employment, peace, and security). Assuming the HMH is correct, the research should include (5) setting a risk management base case for comparative studies, (6) estimating the RCC for the base case, (7) assessing the macroeconomic effects of the base case, (8) undertaking a feasibility study, and (9) pilot testing.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>There are no financial conflicts of interest to disclose.
