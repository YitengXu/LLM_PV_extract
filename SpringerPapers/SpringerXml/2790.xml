id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Due to conventional energy production shortage of fossil fuels and environmental problems caused by, solar power has become most popular. To meet the modern time solar-electric-energy generation is consistently growing by 20–25% (percent) per year over the past 20 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Photovoltaic (PV) devices produce electric power directly from sunlight by an electronic method that occurs naturally in certain types of material, called semiconductors. The semiconductor device that transforms solar light in form of electrical energy is termed PV cell, and the phenomenon is named as ‘PV effects’. The size a solar PV array, cells are mounting up in structure of series–parallel formation for mandatory energy. The voltage outputs of PV arrays vary with change in irradiation and environmental changes. Therefore a MPPT control technique with boost converter is taken to produce the maximum voltage from PV array. In recent years, various control techniques have been proposed for tracking the maximum power point (MPP). Perturbation and observation (P&amp;O) technique is broadly used in the MPPT controllers owing to its simplicity and easy execution. P&amp;O is work based an iterative technique in this operating point at regular interval is perturbed and it thus oscillates around the point <italic>dP</italic>/<italic>dV</italic> = 0 i.e., MPP. Incremental conductance (IC) technique has been used to enhance the tracking accuracy and dynamic performance when quickly change in atmospheric environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It can identify when the MPPT reaches the MPP and stops process of perturbing the operating point to track quickly decreasing and increasing irradiance conditions with superior precision than P&amp;O technique. In this work, a novel IC MPPT method is used with the adaptive variation of step size. An adjustment coefficient is adopted to regulate the step size. Therefore, the PV system can keep a large step size when the operating point is far from the MPP and a decreasing step size when the operating point is close to the MPP, even under extreme irradiance change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. IC MPPT method can effectively solve the problem of traditional method not taking into account the stability and dynamic response speed simultaneously when the irradiance changes tremendously. Compared with other variable step size methods, the proposed method also has less complex adjustment coefficient and computation to improve the computing speed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">The obtained voltage output from PV arrays is less as compared to the voltage rating of most other networks, hence a DC–DC boost converter is used. Basically the output voltage of PV array with boost converter is DC and for commercial purposes it needs to be converted into AC form because most of the loads are AC. MLIs acts main function in PV system to convert the produced DC voltage to AC voltage, to be fed into the load.</p><p id="Par4">Various conventional topologies of MLIs are used for conversion of DC to AC such as neutral point clamped MLI (NPC MLI), flying capacitor MLI (FC MLI) and cascaded H-bridge MLI (CHB MLI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. NPC MLI requires more no. of diodes and the no. of capacitors requires in the FC MLI is more because of voltage balancing requirement. The traditional NPC MLI is integrated with PV system, but voltage across each capacitor needs to be maintained and an external controller is required for this Panda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. CHB MLI is suitable for PV panels but it requires more no. of PV panels in series or parallel connection when the no. of levels increases. Therefore no. of switches of CHB MLI increases when the level of inverter increases. The no. of switches in MLI defines cost, the size of the circuit, reliability and complexity. So the key element in designing MLI is the no. of switches required against the required voltage level. To obtain the same output obtained as in a 7-level CHB MLI, a new circuit topology has been developed with reduced no. of switches without increasing the no. of H-bridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">SHE technique solves different non-linear equations and gives better optimal results for MLIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the work reported in this present manuscript, the “selected harmonic elimination” (SHE) technique is used to reduce selected lower harmonics such as 5th and 7th from the voltage output of MLIs. Furthermore, this paper reports the work on PV based reduced switch 7-level MLI topology, which using less switches, requires less no. of devices involves less expenditure and still RS MLI produces same voltage output as produced by CHB MLI and.</p><p id="Par6">Investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] have explained different methods to reduce harmonics using pulse width modulation (PWM) technique and selected harmonic elimination (SHE) method. Lower-order harmonics are dominant in nature and complete elimination of these harmonics is not possible using conventional PWM techniques. SHE also called programmed PWM technique approach is thus used to eliminate selected harmonics by calculating optimal switching angles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Switching angles are calculated by solving transcendental non-linear equations. Iterative methods such as Newton–Raphson (NR) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and mathematical resultant theory method suffer from some disadvantages. The former approach requires good initial guess and gives only a few sets of solution. The degree of polynomial becomes large when the later approach is applied to higher level asymmetrical MLIs as the no. of harmonics to be eliminated increases. Active harmonic elimination (AHM) technique is a further combinational method of NR and resultant theory method for reducing any no. of selected harmonics. However, AHM technique doesn’t find satisfactory possible solution for the infeasible modulation index. Thus, bio inspired optimization method such as GA (Genetic Algorithm) based selected harmonic elimination is used in this paper to improve the system robustness as suggested in Sen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and Madhusudhana et al.

The objective of the proposed RS MLI is to increase the output voltage level with reduced the no. of switches. A novel IC MPPT technique with DC–DC boost converter is utilized for replacing each DC input of proposed RS MLI. The utilization of separate DC–DC converter is by eliminating the extra controller to balance the DC link voltage.</p><p id="Par9">The organization of paper description is follows: Sect. <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> describes the structure and modeling of PV panel.

Semiconductor device based PV cell is used, that converts sunlight to electrical energy through photovoltaic effect. Nowadays PV arrays mostly used are in standalone application or grid connected. A PV array consists of series and parallel connection of PV cells. Series relation are accountable for increase the voltage of modules whereas the parallel accountable is responsible for increase the current in the array. Generally a solar cell can be modeled by a current source and an inverted diode connected in parallel to it. It has own series and parallel resistance. Series resistance is due to hindrance in the path of flow of electron from n to p junction and parallel resistance is due to the leakage current. Based on single diode modeling of PV cell configuration is used in this work due to simplest and less complex. The efficiency of PV modules is low due to their non-linear and temperature dependent voltage-current and voltage–power characteristics, due to non-linear characteristic of voltage and current and distinct MPP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

The most important feature of PV based RS MLI system is being expedient for increasing the number of output levels with fewer number of switches, thereby reducing the volume, size and cost of multilevel inverter. The GA based SHE technique is used to control the switching pulses of IGBTs for multilevel inverter. By GA technique optimal switching angles are generated in order to eliminate dominant lower order harmonics. From the results it is observed that GA technique is more effective in reduction of THD at the voltage output of PV based RS MLI. In this work, 100 iterations are selected at GA toolbox for obtaining the optimal values of switching angles. The developed topology is investigated through several MATLAB simulations as well as experimental tests in the laboratory applying the modified control approach. In the future work, the proposed PV based RS MLI compare with conventional cascaded H-Bridge MLI in terms of THD analysis of output voltage.</p></sec></body><back><sec
