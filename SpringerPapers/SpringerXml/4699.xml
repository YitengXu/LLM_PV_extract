Thylakoids extracted from spinach are introduced into a BPEC cell containing buffer solution with ferricyanide. Upon solar-simulated illumination, water oxidation takes place and electrons are shuttled by the ferri/ferrocyanide redox couple from the thylakoids to a transparent electrode serving as the anode, yielding a photocurrent density of 0.5 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>. Hydrogen evolution occurs at the cathode at a bias as low as 0.8 V. A tandem cell comprising the BPEC cell and a Si photovoltaic module achieves overall water splitting with solar to hydrogen efficiency of 0.3%.

The most elementary solar fuel production process relies on the water–hydrogen cycle, <inline-formula id="IEq1"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2016_Article_BFncomms12552_IEq1_HTML.gif"/></inline-formula>. The forward reaction is work-consuming (endergonic). Under standard conditions it requires a minimum input of 237 kJ of entropy-free energy (that is, work) to dissociate one mole of water, which is the standard Gibbs free energy of the reaction (Δ<italic>G</italic><sup>0</sup>). The reaction products, H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> gases, serve as fuel that can be stored in separate vessels and converted back into power by the reverse reaction. Thus, H<sub>2</sub> can be produced sustainably by water electrolysis using renewable power sources such as solar power. Replacement of the entire worldwide primary energy consumption (12,910 million tons oil equivalent in 2014; ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>) by solar H<sub>2</sub> produced at an average solar to hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 1%, equivalent to the solar to biomass conversion efficiency of high efficiency crop plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, would demand a net area of 9.7 million km<sup>−2</sup> of solar collectors. This accounts for 6.5% of the total land area or 70.3% of the estimated arable land area on earth, a scenario which is not very practical<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">This limitation motivates research on other routes to store solar energy as chemical bonds in fuel products, for example through biotechnological or artificial photosynthesis processes. Bio-processes for renewable H<sub>2</sub> production have been explored using fermentative and photosynthetic organisms as cellular factories for H<sub>2</sub> production. Traditionally, these bio-processes are categorized into: (i) dark fermentation, (ii) photo-fermentation and (iii) biophotolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Through the fermentative processes, protons serve as electron acceptors from catabolized organic compounds, while H<sub>2</sub> production by biophotolytic processes make use of organisms capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, for example, green microalgae or cyanobacteria. For the latter, sunlight drives the oxidation of water molecules that serve as the electron donor, and protons generated are subsequently reduced to molecular hydrogen. A major barrier to commercialization of these technologies is the necessity to impose substantial restrictions on the bioreactor operating conditions in order to generate significant quantities of H<sub>2</sub>; H<sub>2</sub> production with green algae occurs only under near anaerobic conditions, as the primary catalytic enzyme involved ((Fe–Fe)-hydrogenase) is inhibited by oxygen. Sustained H<sub>2</sub> production using algae can be achieved only when photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution is severely inhibited by sulfur deprivation, to such an extent that it equals the O<sub>2</sub> consumption in the cellular respiration. Similarly, H<sub>2</sub> production from filamentous or unicellular cyanobacteria requires the removal of O<sub>2</sub> from the growth medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The work described here puts forward a different approach that brings together light and photosynthetic membranes in a bio-photo-electro-chemical (BPEC) cell that generates, under illumination, an electromotive force that facilitates the water splitting reaction and funnels electrons and protons for the generation of H<sub>2</sub>. The operation of the BPEC cell requires the concerted operation of three components: (i) a photochemical module that captures light and produces separated charge carriers with excess chemical potential, (ii) a catalytic module that employs the photo-excited charge carriers to carry out endergonic oxidative or reductive chemistry, and (iii) an efficient method for transferring the charge carriers between the two modules while keeping as much of their excess free energy as possible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In previous studies, photosystem I (PSI) complexes isolated from thermophilic cyanobacteria and tethered to either Pt nanoparticle catalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> or [NiFe]-hydrogenase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> were reported to produce up to 170 mol H<sub>2</sub> (mol PSI min)<sup>−1</sup>, under illumination, in the presence of sacrificial electron donor (sodium ascorbate). McCormick <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> reported a BPEC cell that uses a two-step process to produce H<sub>2</sub> at a rate of 2.4 μmol H<sub>2</sub> (mg Chlh)<sup>−1</sup>, using live culture of the cyanobacteria <italic>Synechocystis</italic> PCC 6803, electron mediator (ferricyanide, Fe(III)CN), and a Pt cathode. Recently, Wang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> reported the overall water splitting by self-assembled photosystem II (PSII) membranes on artificial catalysts, achieving H<sub>2</sub> production rate of 9.1 μmol H<sub>2</sub> (mg Chlh)<sup>−1</sup>. In this system, the PSII membranes were irreversibly attached to particles containing ruthenium or rhodium, along with other inorganic components, in the presence of Fe(III)CN. In another recent study, Mersch <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> presented a BPEC cell that couples PSII membranes and hydrogenase to mesoporous transparent electrodes, using 2,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone (DCBQ) as an electron mediator. A benchmark water splitting photocurrent of 450 μA cm<sup>−2</sup> was obtained at an applied bias of 0.9 V under red light illumination (<italic>λ</italic>=660 nm) at an intensity of 10 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>, corresponding to a light-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of (1.5±0.1)%. </p><p id="Par6">Unlike conventional (first generation) biofuel production technologies from crop plants, a process that has been reported to work at an average efficiency of up to 1% and creates a serious competition for food<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, BPEC cells make use of leaves, and are not limited to a particular plant species. Leaves of most crops do not have high commercial value, being mostly used as feedstock. We envision the utilization of crop leaves for green and benign H<sub>2</sub> production, as an intermediate step after the crop plant has given its fruits, and before being fed to animals. Thus, in this work we present a BPEC cell that produces H<sub>2</sub> gas using crude thylakoid membranes (henceforth called thylakoids) extracted from spinach, which is used here as a plant model. The thylakoids are extracted with minimal preparatory effort and then applied simply by letting them settle onto the surface of a transparent electrode, thereby enabling easy replacement of photodamaged thylakoids by fresh ones. Under illumination, a photocurrent is produced, mediated by Fe(III)CN, and channelled to evolve H<sub>2</sub> at the cathode at applied bias far below the reversible voltage of water electrolysis (1.23 V in standard conditions). Furthermore, we present a stand-alone mode of operation, wherein the BPEC cell is coupled in tandem to a Si photovoltaic (PV) module that provides the bias required to produce H<sub>2</sub>. Thus, H<sub>2</sub> is produced by this hybrid tandem cell from oxidized water molecules without any external power source or sacrificial electron donors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>BPEC cell</title><p id="Par7">Our BPEC cell design meets the following principles: (i) Utilization of crude thylakoids without chemical immobilization or modification.

Towards this end, spinach thylakoids were placed in the BPEC cell and incubated in light or dark in the presence or absence of ferricyanide (Fe(III)CN) or ferrocyanide (Fe(II)CN) as a control, and then used, subsequently, for photocurrent and photosynthetic electron flow measurements. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref> presents the residual photocurrent that was measured following 10 min of different incubation treatments.

Incubations in light or dark without Fe(III)CN were found to reduce the photocurrent to about 60 and 80% of the initial photocurrent, respectively, indicating that light enhances the degradation of the photocurrent.

To examine this hypothesis and to determine the fraction of photosynthetically active electron flow in the thylakoids in each of the incubation conditions, thylakoids were collected from the BPEC cell after 10 min of incubation, the Fe(III)CN was washed out by centrifugation, the thylakoids were re-suspended in fresh medium (as explained in the experimental procedures), and analysed for 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) reduction.

A residual photosynthetic electron flow activity of 10% was observed for thylakoids that were incubated with Fe(III)CN in light, compared with 60% of this activity that was retained in thylakoids that were incubated in light without Fe(III)CN. This observation suggests that the combination of light and Fe(III)CN is most harmful to the thylakoids, enhancing the photoinhibition of the photosynthetic electron flow. Thus, we conclude that the photocurrent degradation was caused in part by the photoinhibition deactivation of photosynthetic electron flow which is enhanced in the present of Fe(III)CN.

Towards this end, we sought the conditions in which the photocurrent could give rise to the reduction of protons in order to form H<sub>2</sub> at the cathode. Thus, the anode and cathode were connected to the potentiostat in two-electrode mode of operation, and the photocurrent was measured as a function of the voltage between the two electrodes. In addition, the potential of the cathode was monitored simultaneously by measuring the voltage drop between the cathode and a reference electrode, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1341">Supplementary Fig. 6a</xref>. This enabled simultaneous measurement of the photocurrent as function of the applied voltage between the anode and cathode, as well as the potentials of the two electrodes. The results are shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>. For hydrogen evolution, the cathode must be at a potential lower than 0 V with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale. This condition is reached at a minimum voltage of 0.8 V (see <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>), where the onset of the water photoelectrolysis reaction takes place.

Thus, the introduction of thylakoids to the BPEC cell reduced the minimum bias for the onset of the water splitting reaction from 2 to 0.8 V. The onset at 0.8 V is equal to the difference between the redox potential of the Fe(III) /Fe(II)CN redox couple and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) potential at a Pt electrode. This indicates that the light reactions split water and reduce Fe(III)CN, thus the Fe(III)/Fe(II)CN redox couple sets the anode potential, whereas the cathode potential reaches the HER potential at the onset of hydrogen evolution, giving rise to a bias of 0.8 V at the onset of water splitting with hydrogen evolution at the cathode. It is noteworthy that some photocurrent was measured below the onset of the water splitting reaction (see <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>).

In other words, the PV cell replaces the potentiostat that was used in the experiments described in the previous sections. Such a tandem design has two important merits in regards to solar water splitting. First, coupling the cells in series to increase the photovoltage produced by the device enables overall water splitting, which neither one of the cells could drive alone. Second, unlike a single absorber system, where only photons possessing sufficient energy to drive the water photolysis reaction are used to stimulate the PV cell, in the tandem cell less energy is needed from each photon. This allows a larger wavelength threshold (that is, more efficient light harvesting) and smaller thermalization loss, thereby increasing the power conversion efficiency of the system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. To evaluate the performance of the hybrid BPEC–PV tandem cell, the gases produced in the BPEC cell were analysed by GC (<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>). H<sub>2</sub> gas formation was observed only in the presence of all the components, namely the electrolyte solution, thylakoids and PV cell. Maximal H<sub>2</sub> production rate was obtained within the first 15 min of operation, after which the rate decreased and finally plateaued after 20 min. These observations are consistent with the results obtained for the BPEC cell alone (see inset of <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>). Expectedly, the addition of the herbicide DCMU totally inhibited the H<sub>2</sub> evolution (see <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7c</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>PV–BPEC tandem cell.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Photograph of the tandem cell.

The decrease in photocurrent at light intensities above 80 mW cm<sup>−2</sup> (see <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7d</xref>) is most likely due to photo-saturation of the thylakoids at this light intensity threshold.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par23">We presented here a BPEC cell comprising of plant thylakoids in electrolyte solution that produced photocurrents as high as 0.5 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> derived from photosynthetically catalysed water oxidation.

A stand-alone tandem cell comprising the BPEC cell and a Si PV cell was demonstrated, reaching STH conversion efficiency of 0.3%. This innovative hybrid system brings together natural photosynthetic membranes and man-made PV technology in order to solve one of the greatest challenges in renewable energy development, that is solar energy conversion and storage in hydrogen fuel. Further development of this promising approach should aim to enhance the STH conversion efficiency, for example, by replacing flat transparent electrodes with porous ones.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Plant material and thylakoid membrane isolation</title><p id="Par24">Spinach (<italic>Spinacia oleracea</italic>) grown in fields of the lower Galilee between the coordinates 33<sup>o</sup>4′18.4″N to 32<sup>o</sup>51′50.5″N and 35<sup>o</sup>16′32.8″E to 35<sup>o</sup>6′24.2″E was obtained from the local growers.
