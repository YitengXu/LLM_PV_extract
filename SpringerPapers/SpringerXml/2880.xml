These consumer electronics are frequently upgraded or discarded, leading to serious environmental contamination. Thus, electronic systems consisting of renewable and biodegradable materials and minimal amount of potentially toxic materials are desirable. Here we report high-performance flexible microwave and digital electronics that consume the smallest amount of potentially toxic materials on biobased, biodegradable and flexible cellulose nanofibril papers. Furthermore, we demonstrate gallium arsenide microwave devices, the consumer wireless workhorse, in a transferrable thin-film form. Successful fabrication of key electrical components on the flexible cellulose nanofibril paper with comparable performance to their rigid counterparts and clear demonstration of fungal biodegradation of the cellulose-nanofibril-based electronics suggest that it is feasible to fabricate high-performance flexible electronics using ecofriendly materials.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">The rapid evolution of consumer electronics means that out-of-date devices quickly end up in the scrap heap.

However, rapid technological advances have led to a significant decrease in the lifetime of consumer electronics and also rapid consumption of non-renewable natural resources. On average, cell phones are used for &lt;18 months and computers are used for &lt;3 years before being replaced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In fact, in 2007, it was estimated that over 426,000 cell phones (most of them were still functional) and 112,000 computers were discarded every day in the US, totalling 3.2 million tons of electronic waste generated per year<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These discarded electronics increase the demand for landfill space and may also cause some serious environmental concerns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Thus, the use of biodegradable materials in electronics can reduce the accumulation of persistent solid waste, thereby benefiting our living environment. Moreover, the fabrication of many chips in portable electronic devices involves the consumption of precious materials. In a typical semiconductor electronic chip, the active region comprises the top thin layer and is only a small portion of the chip, whereas the bottom substrate that holds the chip consists of more than 99% of the semiconductor materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In microwave chips for wireless functions, besides the waste of the bottom substrate, only a tiny fraction of the lateral chip area is used for the required active transistors/diodes with the rest being used only for carrying other non-active components. Some toxic semiconductor materials like gallium arsenide (GaAs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> are widely used in high speed communication devices, such as cell phones and tablets, and can lead to a significant amount of hazardous materials and high cost in applications that require sparse areal coverage, such as monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC). To minimize the usage of semiconductors, fully formed electronic devices can be fabricated on a sacrificial material in a dense array format, where each micro-scale device can be released and transfer printed onto any type of substrate, including biodegradable flexible substrates. The feasibility of such an approach has been demonstrated in several reports, where devices are fabricated on a wafer that enables deterministic assembly of individual devices on foreign substrates via the transfer printing process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Utilizing this technique, the handling substrate is no longer necessary and the substrate can be re-used for further growth of active layers on the depletion of all devices. This is especially useful in GaAs-based electronics where the chemical extraction of GaAs from discarded waste is prohibitively expensive and dangerous due to the presence of arsenic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. To obtain degradable capabilities, new materials that are non-toxic and biodegradable in nature, such as paper, silk and a number of synthetic polymers, have been explored as electronic substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Many groups have reported electronics on paper by depositing organic semiconductors, but while the concept is very interesting in that it is flexible and degradable, the performance of such electronics falls behind the requirements of state-of-the-art electronics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Another promising approach developed by Hwang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> was to use biodegradable silk combined with high-performance inorganic semiconductors. Despite their excellent degradation capability, biocompatibility, and performance, silk-based electronics are highly vulnerable to water and solvents. In addition, the suitability of silk for microwave applications is unknown. It should also be noted that only silicon (Si)-based electronics were demonstrated on biodegradable silk substrate. However, Si has a low mobility compared with GaAs, which limits its use in microwave electronics. Cellulose nanofibril (CNF) is an ecofriendly material as it is completely derived from wood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. With its high transparency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and flexibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, as well as desirable electrical properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, CNF is an ideal candidate as an alternative and ecofriendly substrate for electronics. A number of groups have reported on CNF-based electronics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. However, whether the biodegradable CNF substrate exhibits suitable radio frequency (RF) properties for microwave-based consumer electronics applications has been unknown.</p><p id="Par4">In the following, we explore the microwave applications of CNF and demonstrate high-performance electronics that are comparable to existing state-of-the-art electronics, including process-complicated GaAs-based microwave level electronics where the operating frequency is beyond gigahertz, as well as Si-based digital electronics, on CNF substrates. Fungal biodegradation of these CNF-based electronics, for the purpose of cycling degraded CNF back for forestry fertilizer, was also carried out to show the decaying process over time. While transfer printing techniques and CNF paper are used to realize various high-performance flexible electronics in this work, what is described is a new, much more sustainable, green electronic chip concept to address the societal impact of today’s economically important yet environmentally unsustainable consumer electronics, based on the important properties that were discovered from CNF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>CNF film and its characteristics</title><p id="Par5"><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> presents a likely life cycle of the CNF film where the film is first made from CNFs extracted from the woods, degraded via a fungal biodegradation process on disposal and sent back to the woods without adverse environmental effects. Electronic systems based on such material could significantly facilitate recycling and management of waste streams. Thus, the ecofriendly wood-based CNF substrate is clearly an ideal substitution for electronics that exist today. However, pure CNF film is vulnerable to water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. To address this issue, we coated the pure CNF film with a bisphenol A-based epoxy resin. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM865">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, the epoxy coating increased the contact angle of the CNF film from 28.4° to 74.6°, thereby making the CNF film much more hydrophobic. This treatment allowed for easier handling of the CNF substrate and offered better manufacturing capabilities. Epoxy is a type of thermoset plastic commonly used in electronics packaging materials (for example, electronic molding compounds, as well as underfills) due to its ease of handling, desirable materials properties and relatively low cost. The epoxy coating can also enhance the mechanical properties of the CNF film. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b–e</xref> introduces the unique material properties of epoxy-coated CNF films. As shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, the CNF film was transparent, thus making it ideal for certain applications. The transmittance was over 80% for an 80-μm thick CNF film and 60% for a 220-μm thick CNF film over the visible spectrum. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1c</xref> presents thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data showing the weight loss of the epoxy-coated CNF film as a function of temperature as well as the first derivative of the TGA curve. There were three peaks in the differential TGA curve, with the first (213 °C) and third (270 °C) peak corresponding to the decomposition of the CNF and epoxy process, respectively. The middle peak observed at 310 °C was attributed to the overlapping of the CNF and epoxy decomposition peaks. The glass transition temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>g</sub>) of the film was measured at 72.8 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM865">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), which was similar to that of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film, a commonly used substrate for flexible electronics. In addition, the CNF film was strong and flexible enough to allow reversible bending as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM865">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>. The flexural modulus of the epoxy-coated CNF film was calculated to be 2.5 GPa, which is comparable to that of PET (1.5 to 2.8 GPa)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The electrical properties of the CNF film were also appealing for use with electronics. As presented in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, the CNF film did not undergo an electrical breakdown, even at very high voltages (for example, 1,100 V), which is far beyond the requirement for consumer electronics. Furthermore, because the dielectric and RF properties of the substrate are major aspects to be considered in designing a RF circuit, the RF loss and dielectric constant were extracted using a microstrip waveguide and analysed at high frequencies.

Here we present, for the first time, methods to fabricate microwave GaAs-based devices on foreign substrates, namely the CNF substrate in this case. It should be noted that today’s majority portable gadgets (&gt;85% in cell phones) with wireless communication functions employ GaAs-based microwave devices for their superior high-frequency operation and power handling capabilities. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> outlines the procedure for manufacturing GaInP/GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) on a CNF substrate via schematic illustrations. Thin heterojunction epitaxial layers in stacks of n-cap layer (GaAs:Si)/n-emitter layer (GaInP:Si)/p-base layer (GaAs:C)/n-collector layer (GaAs:Si)/n-sub-collector layer (GaAs:Si) were grown on a 500-nm thick sacrificial layer (Al<sub>0.96</sub>Ga<sub>0.04</sub>As) on a GaAs wafer. The fabrication process began by following conventional procedures to fabricate the HBTs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM865">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), followed by protective anchor patterning using a photoresist (PR). This will protect the devices and allow the devices to be tethered to the substrate after etching away the underlying sacrificial layer using a diluted hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution. Van der Waals contact with a soft elastomer stamp made of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to the device breaks the anchors on all four sides and easily picks up a single device. The devices are transfer printed in deterministic assembly onto a temporary Si substrate using ultrathin polyimide (PI, ∼1 μm) as an adhesive, followed by ground–signal–ground (G–S–G) RF interconnect metallization. PI is an excellent material for GaAs-based devices not only as an adhesive, but also as a passivating material that can suppress the high surface states of GaAs and prevent leakage current<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.

Compared with a typical GaAs MMIC, which only consists of a few HBTs on a large substrate, this pick-and-place method greatly reduces the usage of expensive and hazardous semiconductor materials. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref> presents a quantitative analysis on the amount of arsenic present in the corresponding device/transistor due to the usage of GaAs that may lead to adverse environmental impact.

This analysis shows that a significant amount of clean water can be saved or preserved using our deterministic assembly approach in making the GaAs-based electronics. The weight of arsenic was obtained by converting the measured volume of either conventional GaAs chip or our printed HBTs to weight. As an example, a conventional miniature GaAs HBT-based MMIC with 40 HBTs on a 1.15 × 0.75 mm<sup>2</sup> large and 100-μm thick substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup> was used as a reference for the comparison. Moreover, our single GaAs HBT with a volume of 5.04 × 10<sup>−6</sup> mm<sup>3</sup> was used. Assuming that there are six GaAs HBT-based MMIC chips in a typical cell phone, ∼138 l of water is required at minimum to meet the standards, whereas the same cell phone using our approach only requires 0.32 l of water. For a single conventional chip with 40 HBTs, 22.9 l of water is required, whereas only 0.054 l is required for the 40 HBTs fabricated using our method. This approach is even more advantageous where only a few HBTs are required. For instance, a single conventional chip with 40 HBTs and 20 HBTs would have similar weight because they are typically built on a similarly sized substrate; however, 20 HBTs printed using our approach would weigh exactly half of the 40 HBTs. In fact, a single printed HBT only requires 0.0013, l of water to meet the EPA standard for drinking water.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Microwave GaAs electronic devices on CNF substrates</title><p id="Par8"><xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c–e</xref> shows the electrical properties of a single finger (2 × 20 μm<sup>2</sup>) non-self-aligned HBT on a CNF substrate, which is optically shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>.

The combination of all of these thin-film form components into large scale integrated circuits on CNF substrates would provide ways to make many types of fully functional and ecofriendly electronics that could help reduce the accumulation of the massive amounts of persistent electronic waste disposed daily and dramatically reduce the consumption of non-renewable natural resource. At the system level, there have been on-going efforts to reduce the use of toxic materials like lead, mercury and arsenic that may be present in components such as batteries and displays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. These combined efforts will lead to a new generation of more ecofriendly electronics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Preparation of CNF paper</title><p id="Par14">The tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxy (TEMPO)-oxidized CNFs were refined in a microfluidizer processor (Microfluidics, Newton, MA), followed by filtering (Millipore Corporation, USA) under air pressure (0.55 MPa) with polytetrafluoroethylene membranes that have 0.1 μm pore sizes. Subsequently, the filter cake was separated from the membrane and sandwiched between layers of waxy coated paper, filter paper and caul plates at room temperature for drying, followed by further drying in an oven at 60 °C for several hours. The dried CNF film was then coated with a bisphenol A-based epoxy resin (56:24:24 mixture of low viscosity epoxy resin, flexible epoxy resin and amine-based curing agent, Dow Chemical Company) and pressed at 130 °C for 10 min under a pressure of 100 psi.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Characterization of CNF paper</title><p id="Par15">A contact angle goniometer (OCA 15/20, Future Digital Scientific Corp., USA) was used for the water contact angle measurements at ambient temperature. The volume of the water droplet was fixed at 4.0 μl, and the contact angle was determined 1 s after the water droplet was deposited on the surface of the CNF film. Three point flexural tests were conducted using a dynamic mechanical analyser (TA Instruments RSA III, USA). Rectangular epoxy-coated CNF film (with a length of 40 mm, a width of 13 mm and a thickness of 0.2 mm) was used for the flexural tests. The maximum flexural deflection was set at 5 mm for the tests. To measure transmittance, CNF film with a thickness of either 80 μm or 200 μm was loaded onto a spectrophotometer (5000 UV–vis-NIR, Cary). The system was set to transmission mode and the transmittance was recorded every 1 nm throughout the spectrum from 400 to 800 nm. The thermal stability of the epoxy-coated CNF films were characterized via TGA using a TGA/Q50 thermal analyzer (TA Instruments, DE, USA). Approximately 10 mg of the CNF films were heated from 30 to 600 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min<sup>−1</sup> in an N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed in an N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere using a DSC thermal analyzer (Auto Q20, TA Instruments) from 0 to 160 °C at a heating rate of 5 °C min<sup>−1</sup> and a N<sub>2</sub> flow rate of 20 ml min<sup>−1</sup>. The sample (∼8.0 mg) was stored in a sealed aluminium pan. To measure the electrical breakdown characteristics, metal (Ti/Au, 10/200 nm) was evaporated on both sides of a 200-μm thick CNF film via a shadow mask, with a pad of 300 μm in diameter. High voltage was applied using a voltage source (2410 High-Voltage Source Meter, Keithley) through standard DC probing while the current was monitored. To measure the dielectric constant and loss tangent, the microstrip transmission line-approximation-method was used. A square CNF film with an area of 17.64 cm<sup>2</sup> was attached with a copper film as the ground on the back side, and a 6-mm wide copper tape as the transmission line on the centre of the top side. S-parameters were collected through the SMA connectors as the RF signal was transmitted through the microstrip transmission line. The dielectric constant and loss tangent of the CNF film were then extracted according to the small signal circuit approximation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Fabrication of high speed GaAs HBTs</title><p id="Par16">The fabrication process began by depositing emitter finger metals (Pd/Ge/Au, 30/40/200 nm) using an electron-beam evaporator via a PR (AZ5214) lift-off process, followed by inductively coupled-reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE, BCl<sub>3</sub>/Ar=10/5 sccm, pressure=2 mTorr, plasma power=50 W, inductor power=500 W) of the cap and emitter layer.

Before ion implantation, 20 nm of thermal oxides (Tystar Oxidation Furnace) were grown on both n- and p-type SOIs for screen oxides. Uniform ion implantation was followed to slightly raise the doping concentration of the active region to minimize channel resistances and adjust the threshold voltage of the MOSFET. A short period of thermal annealing in a furnace was applied to recover the defects generated from implantation and activate the dopants. Heavy ion implantation was applied on the photolithography pre-defined source and drain region. Implantation details are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM865">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. After a second thermal annealing in the furnace, active regions on the SOI wafers were isolated using reactive plasma etching (Unaxis 790). The SOI wafers were then placed in a diluted HF (1:10) solution to etch the sacrificial buried oxide layer and release the membrane. PI (∼1 μm) was spin casted and cured on a 60-nm thick PMMA-coated Si wafer. A soft bake of 1 min at 100 °C dried out the solvent while maintaining the adhesive surface. Individually released membranes from each type of the SOIs were aligned and transferred separately onto the PI using a PDMS stamp mounted on a modified mask aligner, followed by hard bake at 300 °C for 1 h in a vacuum oven.

The measurement set-up of the network analyser was calibrated to the G–S–G probe tips using a standard Short-Open-Load-Thru (SOLT) calibration kit. HP 8350B Sweep Oscillator and 83592B RF Plug-in systems were used to provide RF power to the rectifier. The DC output signals were measured using a Rigol DS1102E oscilloscope with a 10 Ω resistor as the load.
