This technique is based on Raman scattering of incident light by phonons and can provide information on local changes of composition, strain and impurities via evaluation of corresponding lattice vibrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p>It is known since the 1930s (e.g., ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>) that the Raman scattering intensity from a crystal is influenced by the orientation of the crystal with respect to the directions of light incidence and signal observation. This influence is due to the fact that Raman scattering is based on the coupling of the electrical field of the incident light with the electric moments of the scattering medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Consequently, the Raman intensity is also dependent on the direction of the polarization of the incident and of the scattered light. The Raman effect in crystals was reviewed by, e.g., Loudon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p>The combination of Raman spectroscopy with an optical microprobe setup has allowed for determining local crystal orientations nondestructively on micrometer-sized specimen areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

Further work comprised Raman mapping with complementary electron microscopy analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, up to now, there has not been any effort to evaluate Raman maps on polycrystalline material systems quantitatively and it has been possible to identify only a few grains within the reported Raman intensity-distribution maps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Still, the presence of grains has not been verified at the same identical positions by means of an independent analytical method, such as electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD).</p><p>The present work raises Raman microspectroscopy to a new level as tool for the acquisition of orientation distributions of polycrystalline materials, showing that contiguous microstructure overviews on areas of several hundreds of μm<sup>2</sup> at the submicrometer level can be obtained, containing quantitative information on the local orientations of individual grains. As a model system, a CuInSe<sub>2</sub> thin film, applied as absorber material for solar cells, with an average grain size of about 1 μm, was used.

This is true since optical diffraction limits the spatial resolution of Raman microspectroscopy to few hundreds of nanometers, while the spatial resolution for EBSD maps is at least one order of magnitude lower and also since the material system under investigation needs to be Raman active. However, Raman intensity distribution maps containing superimposed contributions from various vibrational modes can provide, if measured on polycrystalline, multicomponent materials, not only orientation distributions, but also indicate (similar to EBSD maps) the presence and positions of secondary phases (e.g., ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). Moreover, Raman imaging is closely related to conventional light microscopy, basically needs not any extensive sample preparation (such as polishing or chemical treatments) and can be performed at ambient conditions. When using tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), highest spatial resolutions of approximately 10 nm have already been achieved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Corresponding improvements to the orientation-distribution analysis outlined in the present work can be expected when applying TERS to polycrystalline materials systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Orientation-distribution maps were acquired on polycrystalline CuInSe<sub>2</sub> thin films by means of Raman microspectroscopy.

The CuInSe<sub>2</sub> layer was prepared by co-evaporation of the elemental constituents from point sources in a vacuum system with a base pressure of about 1 × 10<sup>−7</sup> mbar. While the In, Ga and Cu cells were open cells, the Se cell was a Knudsen type cell.

A HeNe laser having a wavelength of 632.8 nm and a power of approx. 10 mW at the sample was used for excitation. The CuInSe<sub>2</sub> samples were investigated using a 100x/N.A. = 0.9 objective for both, excitation and collection. Spectra were acquired by dispersing the collected light with a grating having 1800 grooves mm<sup>−1</sup> (optionally, this can be replaced by a 300-mm<sup>−1</sup> grating) and using a 1024 × 256-pixel CCD detector (Symphony, Horiba Jobin Yvon, liquid-N<sub>2</sub> cooled, −126 °C operating temperature). With this configuration the spectral resolution is approx. 0.3 cm<sup>−1</sup>/CCD pixel (or approx. 2.5 cm<sup>−1</sup>/CCD pixel with the 300-mm<sup>−1</sup> grating) at the position of the most prominent (A<sub>1</sub>) mode of the CuInSe<sub>2</sub> spectrum. The laser power was attenuated to 1 mW by employing a neutral density filter, because sample damage was observed for laser powers exceeding 4 mW (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S1</xref>). Raman maps were obtained by step-wise movement of the sample through the laser focus by a sample-scanning stage and collection of the whole Raman spectrum at every spot within typically 3 to 5 s (controlled by the instrument’s LabSpec software). Typical step sizes (corresponding to pixel sizes of the resulting Raman maps) ranged from 200 to 250 nm in both lateral directions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Raman microspectroscopy data analysis</title><p>Raman mapping experiments resulted in 3D data matrices containing a Raman spectrum in each pixel of a two-dimensional sample area. The matrices were converted to 2D images by using own (T.S., BAM, Berlin, Germany) LabVIEW-based (National Instruments Corp., Austin, Texas) software. Data processing includes smoothing of each spectrum by applying a moving average of ±4 CCD pixels. The 2D Raman images show the distributions of individual band intensities integrated over ±1 cm<sup>−1</sup>. Further to smoothing of the resulting Raman map, integration compensates for small shifts of the wavenumber positions of the bands, which appear due to local strain. Spectra with spikes due to cosmic rays, which interfered with the evaluated integration ranges, were excluded from data evaluation. The spectra (or corresponding pixels of the Raman maps, respectively) were deleted. In a further step of the data evaluation procedure, the average intensity of the eight surrounding pixels was assigned to each deleted pixel.</p><p>In the raw data, intensity values (i.e. the color scales of Raman maps) are expressed in arbitrary units (i.e. detector counts), which are specific to our instrument configuration. In order to convert them into more generally comparable values, which can be related to the theoretical trends as well (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), each intensity value was normalized to the maximum detected intensity of the corresponding Raman band (174 cm<sup>−1</sup> or 214 cm<sup>−1</sup>). Therefore, as a first step the minimum intensity in the 200 × 200-pixel map shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> of 25 counts – corresponding to the background noise level – was subtracted from each signal intensity in all Raman maps presented in this study. The second step consisted of the normalization of the 174 cm<sup>−1</sup> intensities to the maximum intensity of this band of 399 counts found in the 200 × 200-pixel map and of the 214 cm<sup>−1</sup> intensities to the corresponding maximum value of 66 counts. Thus, each signal intensity – expressed in % – is related to the highest detected intensity of the corresponding band.</p><p>For comparison with the theoretical intensity values of these grains, experimental values of grain 1 and 2 (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>) were extracted from the maps shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> by calculating the average of 6 × 6 pixels located in a square area in the center of each grain, well separated from the grain boundaries by several pixels, in order to avoid interferences from surrounding grains. The error bars along the intensity axis in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> reveal three times the standard deviations of the 36 pixel values of each grain.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conduction of EBSD measurement</title><p>The EBSD analysis was carried out using a Zeiss Ultraplus scanning electron microscope equipped with an Oxford Instruments NordlysNano EBSD detector and Aztec as acquisition software. The measurement was performed at 20 kV acceleration voltage, at a probe current of about 50 nA and under 70° sample tilt. The map was acquired using a step size of 100 nm. With a square grid of 250 × 250 scanned points, a total area of 25 μm × 25 μm was mapped. The hardware binning of the EBSD detector was set to 4 × 4 to reduce the measurement duration and to avoid charging effects. Systematical misindexing, based on the pseudosymmetry of CuInSe<sub>2</sub> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>), was refrained by considering a quasicubic crystal structure. Noise and spikes of the EBSD data were reduced using HKL Channel5 post acquisition software. The position of the previous Raman measurement was marked with 4 spots by the HeNe laser at full power of 10 mW leading to visible morphological changes within 10 s laser irradiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S1c</xref>). Based on the measured orientations of the grains and the corresponding Euler angles, the required directions and planes were extracted for the two exemplary grains.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Schmid, T. <italic>et al.</italic> Orientation-distribution mapping of polycrystalline materials by Raman microspectroscopy. <italic>Sci.
