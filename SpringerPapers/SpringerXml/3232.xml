However, their low energy efficiency is still a challenge. A comprehension of metabolic constraints can result in finding strategies for efficiency enhancement. This study presents a systemic approach based on metabolic modeling to design a regulatory defined medium, reducing the intracellular constraints in bioelectricity generation of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC6803 through the cellular metabolism alteration. The approach identified key reactions that played a critical role in improving electricity generation in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC6803 by comparing multiple optimal solutions of minimal and maximal NADH generation using two criteria. Regulatory compounds, which controlled the enzyme activity of the key reactions, were obtained from the BRENDA database. The selected compounds were subsequently added to the culture media, and their effect on bioelectricity generation was experimentally assessed. The power density curves for different culture media showed the BPV fed by <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC6803 suspension in BG-11 supplemented with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl achieved the maximum power density of 148.27 mW m<sup>−2</sup>. This produced power density was more than 40.5-fold of what was obtained for the BPV fed with cyanobacterial suspension in BG-11. The effect of the activators on BPV performance was also evaluated by comparing their overpotential, maximum produced power density, and biofilm morphology under different conditions. These findings demonstrated the crucial role of cellular metabolism in improving bioelectricity generation in BPVs.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>12294</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2021_Article_91906.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Discovering the inherent capability of microorganisms to generate bioelectricity has opened a new era of renewable energy production. Regarding the emergence of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) as a system to extract electrons from the complex organic substrate during the anaerobic biodegradation process, the critical role of particular microorganisms as biocatalysts in wastewater treatment and energy generation has become crystal clear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Although the MFCs are highly in academic interests<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, the advantages of bio-photovoltaic devices (BPVs), which can operate without organic sources and carbon dioxide emission, reveal more benefits in comparison with MFCs encountering difficulties of supplying organic feed and carbon dioxide management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In BPVs, the oxygenic photosynthetic organism is being used as a bio-anode catalyst, deriving electrons from water photolysis under the light emission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Despite the high potential of BPVs as a promising power generator, the main bottleneck restricting the commercial way is the intense competition of intracellular pathways for energy resources and intrinsic metabolic losses resulting in low power outputs generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Therefore, numerous researches were undertaken to understand the intracellular electron pathways of photosynthetic organisms. Among unicellular photosynthetic organisms, <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC 6803 (henceforth referred to as <italic>Synechocystis</italic>), the well-known model organism, received a great deal of attention to investigate the electron transfer pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In this regard, investigation of inhibitors' effects on the photosynthetic metabolic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, creation of mutant strains to redirect electron flux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and eliminating photosystem II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, has been demonstrated in previously published studies to understand electrons generation mechanism in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>.</p><p id="Par4">Bombelli et al. investigated the use of classic inhibitors such as DCMU, DBMIB, and methyl viologen (MV), to identify the electron transfer chain suggesting that photo-electrons are originated from photolysis of water and end with the reducing form of PS I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Bradley et al. redirected electron flux from competing electron sinks by creating mutant strains of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> lacking respiratory terminal oxidase complexes and using ferricyanide as an electron acceptor. When terminal oxidase complexes were inactivated, 10% of the respiratory electron flux was redirected to ferricyanide in the dark condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Cereda et al. studied the effect of photosystem II (PS II) on electron generation through both inhibitor addition and gene deletion. It was also proved that the primary photocurrent generation requires the activation of PS II during water photolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Moreover, their case study on the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> revealed the incapability of transferring electrons to the electrode owing to numerous metabolic pathways facing fierce competition with the electrode for the electrons. Thus, extracellular photo-electrons are attributed to a small proportion of the total organism electron flux<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. This matter has been pointed out in Glazier's work that cellular metabolism used only 3% of electrons produced by photosynthetic light reactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and thus the metabolism has considerable potential for electricity generation. However, switching the cellular metabolism to the generation of NADH is required.</p><p id="Par5">Despite the careful investigations on the photosynthetic electron pathways, the importance of a system-oriented strategy applying metabolic modeling to uncover other metabolic pathways that may contribute to electrons production has been neglected. Mao and Verwoerd applied a metabolic network using flux balance analysis (FBA) to explore the inherent capacity of electron generation for <italic>Synechocystis</italic>; however, the lack of experimental works in their studies is evident<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Enhancing intracellular electron carriers such as NADH and NAD<sup>+</sup> can be considered a positive approach to enhancing energy generation in bioelectrochemical systems. In this regard, Han et al. regenerated NADH by genetically engineered <italic>Clostridium ljungdahlii</italic>, and increased the maximum power density of the MFC more than twofold <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, It was demonstrated that the electricity generation of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> depended on NADH production, which is profoundly affected by various metabolic pathways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Therefore, concerning the vital role of metabolic modeling to identify intracellular constraints and switch the cellular metabolism to the generation of NADH, a regulatory defined medium can be developed to shift the cell metabolism to the object of interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, a system-oriented strategy based on metabolic modeling is used to design a regulatory defined medium, reducing the intracellular constraints in the bioelectricity generation of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> via the cellular metabolism alteration to improve the NADH generation.

Consequently, the predicted reactions are regulated by adding enzyme regulators to the culture medium. These compounds regulate the enzyme activity of the target reactions and are found in the BRENDA database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Finally, regulators' effect on BPV performance is evaluated by comparing polarization and power density curves under various conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Metabolic model and in silico simulation</title><p id="Par8">A genome-scale metabolic network of <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, named iJN678<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, was used to investigate the metabolic pathways. The COBRA Toolbox and the GLPK package were applied to MATLAB 2017b to run the metabolic modeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Optimizing the intracellular electrons generation rates was done by defining the NADH production rates as the objective function. The lower bounds of intracellular reversible and irreversible reactions were applied to -1000 and 0 mmol/gDCW/h, respectively. Moreover, the upper bounds of all intracellular reactions were set to 1000 mmol/gDCW/h. Photoautotrophic conditions were simulated by constraining the photon uptake rate to 52 mmol/gDCW/h, and bicarbonate uptake rate was set to 3.7 mmol/gDCW/h as the only carbon source.

Besides, it was previously reported that the biomass concentration of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> in the electrochemical cell should not reduce significantly because it would lead to a low power generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>; therefore, reactions that their regulation causes a high reduction of the growth rate are not appropriate candidates for manipulation. According to this point, the optimal biomass formation rate was calculated using FBA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> (0.0884 h<sup>−1</sup>), and the growth rate was bound to 90% of the optimal growth rate in the metabolic model to ensure finding bottleneck genes in which manipulating their enzymes for overproduction of NADH does not result in a significant decrease in cell density. Moreover, a threshold of 10<sup>−8</sup> was considered to determine active reactions.

Herein, two crucial metabolic pathways for converting acetate (ac) to acetyl-CoA (accoa) that possessed a significant activity difference were selected. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C, acetate could be consumed via the acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) by converting ATP to AMP. Besides, this metabolite can also be used through a series of reactions, including acetate kinase (ACKr_f) and phosphotransacetylase (PTAr_b), by conversion of ATP to ADP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). Thus, acetate kinase and phosphotransacetylase were recommended to produce acetyl-CoA, which then enters the TCA cycle and causes NADH to form via malate dehydrogenase (MDH_f).</p><p id="Par18">The systemic approach also recommended that glycerol 3-phosphate (glyc3p) played a vital role in NADH generation. As demonstrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B, a red dashed line that starts with glyoxalate carboligase pathway (GLXCL) and ends with glycerol kinase (GLYK), consumed three moles NADH along with one mole of ATP to produce glycerol 3-phosphate. These pathways occur as a series of reactions that each reaction possesses the same flux through the metabolic network leading to 0 mmol/gDCW/h NADH generation (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Therefore, they are regarded as proper candidates to be down-regulated. Moreover, glycerol 3-phosphate could also be produced by glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PD2_b), which consumes only one mole of NADH without ATP consumption. Green arrows show this pathway in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B. Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase possesses the same reaction rates as the mentioned series reactions but leads to 2.1 mmol/gDCW/h NADH generation (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

To this end, LAMOS and BRENDA were applied for the initial screening of existing compounds for switching metabolism to improve NADH production, and therefore increase power density generation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). It is important to note that proposed system-oriented strategy is a screening that seeks to make suggestions from a large number of available components which the effect of their addition to the medium can be evaluated. This strategy suggested the components affect the enzyme of key bottleneck genes, and thus, increasing the chance of improving bioelectricity production. In this regard, LAMOS identified the reactions that had the highest potential in improving bioelectricity production, listed in Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>. Then, for each reaction, the potential regulators in the BRENDA database were searched. Besides, in addition to the experimentally reported effect of the regulator on the bottleneck genes, the regulator may be effective on some other enzymes; therefore, assessing the effect on the final product, which is the production of electrons, maybe the best solution. This method has also been implemented successfully in previous studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> leading to improved production.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Graphical abstract.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2021_91906_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p><p id="Par37">After an in-depth screening of all components in the BRENDA database, phosphotransacetylase, and glutamate dehydrogenase were selected to be experimentally investigated due to the following reasons. Firstly, since it is undeniable that regulators can affect other enzymes' activity as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>; thus, the adverse effect of regulators on other metabolic pathways in improving power generation was investigated. In other words, as it was shown in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>, ammonium chloride, which is an activator of phosphotransacetylase, did not have a substantial adverse effect on other critical metabolic pathways. However, potassium chloride, an activator of glutamate dehydrogenase, possessed an adverse effect on some critical metabolic pathways, including the inhibitory effect on oxidative phosphorylation pathways (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>). It was concluded that using the regulators that had an adverse effect on crucial pathways could decrease the bioelectricity production, albeit its positive effect on the targeted reaction. It is worth mentioning that the detailed effects of additives on cellular metabolism cannot be accurately evaluated, but with the aid of BRENDA, an attempt has been made to provide an estimate of the regulator’s effect on cellular metabolism, and components screening has been carried out based on this. Furthermore, for some enzymes, such as glycerol-3-phosphatedehydrogenase, no regulators were specified in the BRENDA database. Most recently, Lai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> also developed a recipe for BG11 (nBG11), compatible with the BPV operation. The nBG11 medium was modified by removing organic pH buffers (HEPES/TES), optimizing MnCl<sub>2</sub> concentration, and chelating trace metal mix solution (TMM) with EDTA. Optimizing culture medium using 1 mM ferricyanide as the mediator led to the long‐term photo‐current generation of about 20 µA from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> during repeated light–dark cycles for over 12 days. Similarly, in our study, redesigning the culture medium, particularly the supplementation of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, generated a longer stationary phase (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A), which shows a more stable current density. Moreover, Bombelli et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> were also supplemented BG-11 with NaCl to study bioelectricity generation of <italic>Synechocystis</italic>; therefore, the closest minerals to NaCl were obtained and studied.</p><p id="Par38">Our results demonstrate that adding activators could provoke the <italic>Synechocystis</italic> as a strain engaged in noticeable intrinsic metabolic losses to reduce its activation overpotential significantly and accelerate bioelectricity generation. The overexpression of the phosphotransacetylase by NH<sub>4</sub>Cl exceedingly facilitates electrons transfer and stimulates cell electrogenesis metabolic pathways, which brings about lower activation losses. Although KCl led to an increase in glutamate dehydrogenase activity, the experimental results showed that it could not be helpful in electrogenesis metabolism as much as NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. The investigation of overshoot occurrence in the BPV also demonstrated the culture medium used NH<sub>4</sub>Cl as an activator produced a better performance in compensating electron depletions. Furthermore, the addition of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl had a small effect on the biofilm morphology.</p><p id="Par39">Interestingly, our experimental studies showed that the addition of 40 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl resulted in a 49% decrease in optical density (OD750) in the strain culture, which is consistent with the previous study, representing a photodamage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. On the other hand, it was reported that ammonium chloride saves up to 30% of the reducing equivalents produced by the photosynthetic light reactions in cyanobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. More specifically, nitrate needs to be reduced to ammonium via two sequential reactions catalyzed by nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase to be assimilated by cyanobacteria.

Thus, although ammonium chloride was reported to cause photodamage and reducing cell density, its role in reducing intracellular constraints, saving reducing equivalents, and facilitating electrons transfer is undeniable.</p><p id="Par40">Additionally, this study focused on reducing intracellular constraints to enhance bioelectricity generation. However, some researches were conducted to minimize extracellular constraints to improve the BPV performance.

Thus, diminishing intracellular constraints by the method presented in this study together with optimizing the BPV to reduce extracellular constraints, would be a big step towards the industrialization of this technology.</p><p id="Par41">Future research should also aim to improve the electrogenesis metabolic pathways by implementing systems metabolic engineering approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.

A power density of 150 mW·m<sup>−2</sup> in a temporal separation setup was produced by implementing this method. Thus, unlike the addition of mediators such as potassium ferricyanide, which is unsuitable for large-scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, it is more interesting to implement the systemic approach to introduce novel microbial interactions capable of sustainable bioelectricity production.</p><p id="Par42">Besides, instead of supplementing the classic inhibitors such as DCMU and DBMIB, which were used to investigate the source of electrons in the photosynthetic organism, the addition of regulators identified by the systemic approach would bring about more benefits by improving electrical power generation. Finally, it is worth to mention that the produced power density of <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is still relatively lower than exoelectrogenic bacteria such as <italic>Shewanella</italic> or <italic>Geobacter</italic>. However, it would be interesting to implement this method to enhancing exoelectrogenic bacteria bioelectricity generation.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>H.F., M.M.M., and E.M. designed and performed research and wrote the paper.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par43">The authors declare no competing interests.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Slate</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Whitehead</surname><given-names>KA</given-names></name><name><surname>Brownson</surname><given-names>DA</given-names></name><name><surname>Banks</surname><given-names>CE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Microbial fuel cells: an overview of current technology</article-title><source>Renew.
