Originally, phenotyping approaches were limited by manual, often destructive operations, causing large errors. Plant imaging emerged as a viable alternative allowing non-invasive and automated data acquisition. Several procedures based on image analysis were developed to monitor leaf growth as a major phenotyping target. However, in most proposals, a time-consuming parameterization of the analysis pipeline is required to handle variable conditions between images, particularly in the field due to unstable light and interferences with soil surface or weeds. To cope with these difficulties, we developed a low-cost, 2D imaging method, hereafter called PYM. The method is based on plant leaf ability to absorb blue light while reflecting infrared wavelengths. PYM consists of a Raspberry Pi computer equipped with an infrared camera and a blue filter and is associated with scripts that compute projected leaf area. This new method was tested on diverse species placed in contrasting conditions. Application to field conditions was evaluated on lettuces grown under photovoltaic panels. The objective was to look for possible acclimation of leaf expansion under photovoltaic panels to optimise the use of solar radiation per unit soil area.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">The new PYM device proved to be efficient and accurate for screening leaf area of various species in wide ranges of environments. In the most challenging conditions that we tested, error on plant leaf area was reduced to 5% using PYM compared to 100% when using a recently published method. A high-throughput phenotyping cart, holding 6 chained PYM devices, was designed to capture up to 2000 pictures of field-grown lettuce plants in less than 2 h. Automated analysis of image stacks of individual plants over their growth cycles revealed unexpected differences in leaf expansion rate between lettuces rows depending on their position below or between the photovoltaic panels.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">The imaging device described here has several benefits, such as affordability, low cost, reliability and flexibility for online analysis and storage. It should be easily appropriated and customized to meet the needs of various users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Image analysis</kwd><kwd>Leaf area

id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par16">Crop breeding is considered as a major workaround to feed the growing world population, with a 9–10 billion people forecast by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Researchers and breeders therefore looked after relevant plant traits to improve crop yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Plant biomass logically predominated as a target trait directly related to net primary production. Several techniques have been developed to phenotype plant biomass with variable accuracy, easiness of use and cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The most straightforward method remains plant harvesting and weighing. However, besides its time and labour cost, this procedure is destructive and not compatible with analysis of growth dynamics on individual plants. Yet, sequential monitoring of individual plants proved to be efficient to unravel complex interactions between genotype and environment and to decipher genetic determinism of plant growth submitted to environmental constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Non-destructive methods for automated plant phenotyping (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.plant-image-analysis.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.plant-image-analysis.org</ext-link>) therefore received growing interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Plant imaging allows fast, non-invasive phenotyping to dynamically infer plant growth at high throughput [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It has benefited from recent advances in navigation, industrial automation and medical diagnostic techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Several methods combining image capture and analysis have been proposed with successful applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] but most were developed for specific environments. Since none of them elicited unanimity, their use in broad ranges of environmental conditions can be questioned. Most often manual and time-consuming parameterization of the image analysis process is required to correctly discriminate the plant from its background when leaf colour, light environment and background conditions are not stable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In some cases, re-parameterization is even not affordable since analysis has been implemented in non-publicly available software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Rather than looking for sophisticated analysis of standard images, stepping back and adapting the hardware to capture more suitable images can simplify the analysis and extend the domain of application. Usual detection of plant leaves on standard images relies on the ability of photosynthetic tissues to reemit visible light (VIS; 400–700 nm wavelengths) in specific, mostly green wavelengths which are not absorbed by leaf pigments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Imaging plants in an extended spectrum, including wavelengths where leaves exhibit specific spectral properties, could open new perspectives. In particular, leaf tissues re-emit solar radiation in the near infrared wavelengths (NIR; 700–1100 nm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These properties gave rise to the development of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]), initially based on images collected by the satellite Landsat 1 equipped with a multispectral scanner. NDVI compares red and NIR reflectances and ranges from negative values corresponding to non-vegetative soils to positive values, comprised between 0.1 and 0.7 and typical of plant covers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It has been correlated with several traits such as vegetation coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], green biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], nitrogen content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and grain yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. NDVI has been implemented in portable commercial solutions for field phenotyping (for example Greenseeker™, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]) but can also be derived from any camera able to detect signals in infrared (IR) or NIR wavelengths. High resolution, hyperspectral cameras are the most flexible ones as regards separation of specific wavelengths enabling to detect plant stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], but they remain quite expensive. By contrast, standard cameras are now available at very low cost but are equipped with infrared blocking filters to limit image capture in the VIS range.</p><p id="Par19">Here we examined how the spectral characteristics of plant leaves could be included in a low cost, portable and automated imaging system to determine isolated plant leaf area in a wide range of conditions. We describe such an efficient solution using the widely spread Raspberry Pi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] computer with a modified version of a standard camera module (Pi NoIR) where the IR filter was removed to extend light capture beyond the VIS range. A blue filter (provided by the manufacturer) was also added. Scripts were developed for the resulting images to determine the projected leaf area of plants. We demonstrate that plant segmentation with this new device is efficient for various species and background environments, while standard methods often fail to correctly estimate plant leaf area. Reliability in field conditions is illustrated by data obtained on lettuce plants grown below different configurations of photovoltaic panels (PVPs). The concept of growing plants in the partial shade of PVPs emerged in 1982 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] to cope with the detrimental impacts of climate change on plants and increase global land productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. At first glance, shading crops with photovoltaic panels is thought to severely hamper plant growth. However, an increase in plant efficiency to intercept radiation (radiation interception efficiency, RIE) has been reported for lettuce grown below PVPs due to the acclimation of leaf expansion to shade and resulting in growth maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. To get insights into these acclimation processes, we developed a field-phenotyping cart where several Raspberry Pi devices were chained to monitor leaf area for hundreds of lettuce plants grown below different configurations of PVPs. Compared to full sun conditions, lettuces grown at the vertical of free spaces separating PVPs had enhanced expansion rate of their projected surface and thus increased RIE. However, this acclimation of plants to shading conditions was not sufficient to maintain biomass at harvest. By contrast, plant biomass was closer to that observed in full sun conditions when lettuces were grown at the right vertical below PVPs, where expansion rate of plant surface and thus radiation interception was not significantly altered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods (can also be placed after Conclusions)</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Image acquisition system</title><p id="Par20">A fully programmable, infrared camera system was built assembling a compact, single-board computer (Raspberry Pi 2 model B) and an infrared camera (Raspberry Pi NoIR V1). The computer was run under Raspbian GNU/Linux operating system and scripts were developed in Python language to facilitate image capture automation and analysis. The camera was a regular module (OmniVision OV5647) where the infrared filter was removed, allowing for the capture of NIR wavelengths in addition to standard VIS light. A blue filter (Roscolux #2007 Storaro Blue) was also set in front of the camera lens to exclude green and red wavelengths and to transmit blue and NIR wavelengths higher than 700 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Overall, the light incoming to the camera lens was mainly composed of VIS light filtered for blue and NIR wavelengths which were recorded in the BLUE and RED channels, respectively.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Spectral properties of the blue filter and transmitted wavelengths to the camera sensor.

Source images were designed as VIS images when captured with this standard camera or (VIS + NIR)<sub>BF</sub> images when captured with the modified one as described above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Image capture and analysis</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Overall description</title><p id="Par22">Software for the automation of image capture, segmentation and analysis was developed in Python 2.7 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.python.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.python.org</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par23">A first python script was developed and uploaded in each Raspberry Pi to control image capture and storage in USB flash disks. Image analysis was performed with another, specifically developed python script based on Numpy (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.numpy.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.numpy.org</ext-link>) and OpenCV2 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://opencv.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://opencv.org</ext-link>) libraries. This step could be performed in Windows operating systems via an executable programme using py2exe (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.py2exe.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.py2exe.org</ext-link>). The script can batch process thousands of pictures in a few minutes on a standard personal computer, including storage of final images for rapid control of the procedure and saving the end results (leaf area) directly into a spreadsheet-ready CSV file.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Segmentation method</title><p id="Par24">The first step of image analysis was the transformation of the original picture into a new one using selected wavelengths specific to leaves. Leaf emission spectrum is largely determined by the photosynthetic pigments, mainly chlorophylls and carotenoids. As a consequence, most species exhibit green leaves, due to pigments absorbing blue and red regions in the VIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, these properties do not discriminate efficiently against many backgrounds. By contrast, the internal cellular structure of leaf cells is more specifically responsible for a high reflectivity of near-infrared light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Using the plant ability to absorb blue light and reflect near-infrared light, we developed a method able to extract leaf surface from its background. The source image needs to be taken with the camera system described above, associating the infrared-transformed camera and a blue filter. Colour image recording is usually split into BLUE, GREEN and RED channels corresponding to the output format of the camera (raw RGB). RED (mainly encompassing NIR wavelengths) and BLUE channels were sufficient to segment the plant from its background in our procedure. High intensity in the RED channel and low intensity in the BLUE one coincided with the presence of vegetation reflecting near-infrared wavelengths whereas near-infrared reflection was negligible for most other material around plants. By subtracting pixel values of BLUE channel to that of the RED one, non-vegetative pixel values were further attenuated, increasing the contrast between plant and background. A new image was thus created by subtracting the BLUE to RED channel intensity at each pixel according to Eq. (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>).<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ1_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>NEW</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.277778em"/><mml:mtext>CHANNEL</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>RED</mml:mtext><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mtext>BULE</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.277778em"/><mml:mfenced close=")" open="(" separators=""><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>with</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.277778em"/><mml:mtext>k</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.5</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

We therefore retained two different versions of the same camera, either standard for imaging in VIS wavelengths or transformed for (VIS + NIR)<sub>BF</sub> imaging as above described.

Lettuces were planted in boards of 6 rows, with 30 cm distance between rows and between plants within a row. Irrigation was provided by drip lines so as to ensure absence of water stress. Macronutrient fertilization was applied the day before planting and nitrogen status was then weekly controlled with a chlorophyllmeter (SPAD-502, Konica Minolta Inc., Japan) to verify that nitrogen was not limiting.</p><p id="Par34">Growth of individual plants was followed in different light conditions imposed by photovoltaic panels (PVPs) installed over the crop in addition to full sun conditions as a control. A similar experiment was previously carried out with fixed PVPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In the present study, we analysed a new system equipped with solar trackers which could move around North–South horizontal axes to track the daily course of the sun with technical limits of − 50 and + 50 degree angles with horizontal. They were programmed to adjust their position every time a 1 degree offset was detected between sun azimuth and the direction normal to panels so as to maximize interception of solar radiation. Photovoltaic panels were joined into 2 m wide and 19 m long, North–South strips and placed 5 meters above ground. PVP density was adapted to crop needs by leaving 4.4 m wide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], free spaces separating each PVPs strips (with horizontal panel orientation). The whole system generated strips of shade and sun at soil level moving from West to East throughout the day.</p><p id="Par35">Lettuces were planted on 21th of July 2015. Two plots were cropped under photovoltaic panels. The first one was located at the vertical below the PVPs (Below_PVPs treatment) and the second one below the free space leaved between two strips of PVPs (Between_PVPs treatment). As a consequence, plants of the two treatments were shaded at different periods of the day although they received quite similar levels of radiation over the whole day (see “<xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">Results</xref>”). The control (full sun) plot, where plants received much higher radiation, was positioned at the South of the two PVP treatments to prevent undesired shading by the panels.</p><p id="Par36">In order to characterise time changes of projected leaf area of plants at high-throughput, a set of 6 modified PYM devices was mounted onto a phenotyping cart (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). To fit the plantation design, the cart consisted of a light, metallic structure equipped with wheels so that it could be translated spanning over the 6 rows of the plantation boards. A camera was associated with each row, resulting in 6 cameras spaced by 30 cm as were the rows of lettuces. Cameras were fixed to a horizontal rod stepping at 1 m above the crop. Raspberry Pi computers (one per camera) were connected through GPIO pins to a single contactor triggering the 6 cameras simultaneously (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>). Pictures were directly stored into an USB flash disk. Portable power banks supplied power to the computers. Vertical alignment of the cameras over each line of 6 lettuces normal to planting rows was ensured by positioning the wheels of the cart on the same line as the imaged plants. On sunny days, a tissue shelter was installed on the cart over the cameras to project a uniform shade on the whole field of view of each camera. Throughout the growing period, 30–50 plants per treatment were photographed twice a week resulting in 9 pictures per plant recorded from 6 to 37 days after plantation. All pictures (78 per plot) were taken within 20 min starting at 10:00 a.m. For late developmental stages, overlapping between plants was occasionally detected on some images which required manual contour of individual plant leaf area including estimation of covered leaf surfaces when appropriate.</p><p id="Par37">Plants were harvested 37 days after plantation, at the same date for all treatments, corresponding to the commercial maturity stage for the full sun conditions (i.e. about 400 g fresh weight per plant). For each treatment, 18 plants were collected and rapidly washed to remove soil particles, then oven dried for 72 h at 60 °C to determine individual dry weights of whole plants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Microclimate in the field experiment</title><p id="Par38">A temperature and humidity probe (HMP45 AC; Campbell Scientific Inc., UK) and a radiation sensor (BF5; Delta-T Devices, UK) connected to a data logger were positioned in the control plot to monitor air temperature and global and diffuse radiations (400–700 nm). Global and diffuse radiations were used to compute radiative balance at the plant level for the different locations under the PVPs by applying a ray tracing algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] to a three-dimensional numerical representation of the whole photovoltaic system. Instantaneous, global incident radiation transmitted at plant level (Radiation<sub>inc</sub>) was thus computed every 3 min taking into account actual changes in sun position and orientation of the photovoltaic trackers.

Since Rosette Tracker operates with a regular version of the camera while PYM operates with a modified one, able to sense (VIS + NIR)<sub>BF</sub> wavelengths, paired, VIS and (VIS + NIR)<sub>BF</sub> images were captured for different plants using both configurations of the camera. Methods were tested with images of one same lettuce plant placed over three contrasted backgrounds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and segmentation was run using scripts developed in Rosette Tracker and PYM respectively. Both segmentation methods correctly estimated the projected plant surface area on a dark background with only a 1% deviation compared to the reference area estimated by manual contour of the plant on original, VIS and (VIS + NIR)<sub>BF</sub> images (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a1–a5). Automated segmentation of the plant (light green) placed over a clear background (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b1–b5) generated maximal error when using Rosette Tracker on VIS image, due to a general confusion between the plant and the background. By contrast, our method was able to detect the plant surface area with a deviation limited to 5% when compared to the reference area. When both substrates were mixed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c1–c5), error in estimating leaf area was strongly reduced with Rosette Tracker (2%) but was still higher than with our PYM method (less than 0.5%). Overall, Rosette Tracker performed successful segmentation as long as contrasts between plant and background were present in the VIS image. However, when brightness of the background was close to that of the plant, confusion between the two could be total. Conversely, our PYM method could detect the plant in all, tested conditions with a maximal 5% error on leaf area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Image segmentation with contrasted plant pigmentations</title><p id="Par46">To go further in challenging situations, we picked a dark coloured, red lettuce variety (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). As previously outlined with light plant and background, when both soil and plant have a dark colour, methods based on VIS images, largely fail to determine which pixel belongs to whom resulting in errors as large as 68% for plant leaf area (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b5). For some VIS images (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b1), it can even become tricky to trace the plant contour manually. Intermediary results were obtained on VIS images when the plant (and the background) consisted of a mix of clear and dark areas which generally resulted in underestimation of plant leaf area (by 39% in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c5).

It is affordable, flexible, accurate and stable across variable light and background conditions.</p><p id="Par57">Accuracy and stability of the method rest on 3 key developments. First, rather than focusing on image analysis, spectral specificities of the plant and background have been considered to adapt a low cost, standard camera where the infrared filter was removed and another one was added, transmitting only blue and near-infrared wavelengths. The resulting, new source image was much more appropriate for plant segmentation from the background since only plants have the ability to absorb blue and reflect infrared wavelengths. Inclusion of NIR wavelengths to detect leaf area was inspired by the widely used index NDVI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and is available or can be adapted with a large range of cameras. Contrary to analyses based on green detection in VIS images, emission of NIR wavelengths by leaves makes the method much less sensitive to different hues of green which may be due to nutrient status or genetic characteristics. Chlorotic spots in the vegetative area or even changes in leaf pigments with senescence or stress conditions could be detected in the NIR with our method. By contrast, green emission is typically dominated by other wavelengths in senescent leaves which preferentially degrade chlorophyll over carotenoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Analysis of VIS images in such cases typically requires adjustment by the user [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. It is also possible to detect a mixture of leaves or plants within a unique image even with spectral variability in green wavelengths emission.</p><p id="Par58">A second originality holds in the addition of the blue filter to better discriminate between plant and background which remains a major challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Most backgrounds reflect more blue light than do the plants. This specificity was implemented in our software analysis where, for each pixel, BLUE channel intensity was partly subtracted from RED channel one (mainly composed of NIR and IR wavelengths). As a result, a contrast could be found between plants and background in a large range of conditions using a unique script with stationary parameters for all image analyses. The value of “k” used in this manuscript to weigh BLUE values relative to RED ones was empirically optimized as a first approach, showing good correlation between manually and automatically estimation of plant leaf area. This correlation was hardly sensitive to variations of k between 0.4 and 0.6 when using our set of images. Mathematically optimizing the value of “k” by using a much larger set of images from different users could probably improve the method.</p><p id="Par59">Last, the hardware that we proposed is based on light, small sized and affordable (low cost and widely spread) materials. We used a Raspberry Pi computer for its small size, low power demand and very low cost (5$–25$). As a computer, it is fully programmable so that image capture can be controlled in multiple, flexible ways, for example with different time lapses. The camera (Pi NoIR camera) is also very cheap (25$) with a relatively high resolution sensor (5–8 Mega Pixels), bringing to 50$–75$ the total cost of the imaging including cabling and storage. The whole device can be easily replicated to increase phenotyping throughput when plants are not potted or cannot be moved to the sensor. It can be adapted to multiple types of crops or canopies provided that specific holders are developed, going from simple terrestrial tripods to drones. For field application on medium sized plants, we have adapted a phenotyping cart (approximately 200$) where several “infrared” cameras were paired. About 2000 pictures of lettuce plants could be captured in about 2 h. Image analysis was then batch processed and took only a few minutes to obtain segmented images and estimation of plant area in pixels and cm<sup>2</sup>. With 6 cameras running in parallel, the phenotyping cart drastically reduced the time needed for image capture and permitted to estimate leaf area of plants difficult to access, with minimal disturbance of soil surface. The distance between the ground and the cell of the camera remained constant during the different experiments allowing for stable calibration of the cameras although a graduated gauge could also be incorporated in the field of view. Moreover, by using accessible and adaptable codes in the PYM method, we provided future users with enough flexibility to customize image capture and storage depending on their specific experimental design. For example, the PYM method already proved itself in PHENOPSIS platform.</p><p id="Par60">The PYM method was developed to segment the plant from its background in challenging situations (field experiments). The only one trait we were interested in for lettuce was the projected area. But the method can now be plugged to another algorithms able to measure additional growth features, bases on high quality segmented pictures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Benefits of the method for field experiments</title><p id="Par61">Devices able to monitor dynamics of plant leaf growth at high throughput are critically needed for agronomical or breeding purpose. This derives from the widely used approach of Monteith [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] which places leaf surface as limiting for light capture at the centre of the analysis when exploring differences between species or growing conditions.</p><p id="Par62">We used this approach to explore the possible benefits of agrivoltaic systems where photovoltaic panels are combined with crops on the same land surface. Although the panels reduce the available light at the plant level, plant acclimation to shade can partly compensate for this limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This point was confirmed for the Below_PVPs treatment in our experiment where plant biomass was much less reduced (by about 15% compared to control) than mean daily radiation available at plant level under the PVPs (reduced by 34%). This indicates that plants acclimated to conditions below PVPs to make a better use of available radiation than control plants. Acclimation of shaded plants was even more marked for leaf area which was enhanced for the Between PVP treatment (by 14%) while mean daily radiation available at plant level was reduced by 30%. Shaded plants are able to intercept more light with more elongated and thinner leaves, thereby counterbalancing the reduction in available radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. A previous study also reported higher RIE for plants shaded by PVPs compared to full sun conditions while RUE remained similar for all conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, this absence of significant difference in RUE was mainly due to a large heterogeneity between plants that was also observed in our experiment. We solve this difficulty by developing a phenotyping cart allowing for high throughput imaging which increased the power of statistical tests. Thus, significant differences between light treatments were not only detected for projected leaf area and RIE, but also in RUE contrary to the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Specifically, RUE was higher for lettuces grown below PVPs compared to full sun conditions, while RUE was lower for plants grown between panels. As a result of these differences in RIE and RUE, Below_PVPs plants were the most efficient as regards radiation use for biomass production, displaying intermediate plant dry mass at harvest compared to control and Between_PVPs plants. This conclusion could guide future developments of agrivoltaic systems.</p><p id="Par63">The difference which was revealed between lettuces grown below the vertical projection of PVPs and under free spaces separating strips of PVPs was not expected since lettuces received quite similar levels of cumulated radiation at the whole day scale in both positions. Rather, we expected plants from Between_PVPs treatment to have accumulated more biomass due to their higher intercepting leaf area compared to plants grown at the vertical below PVPs. Furthermore, a slightly higher incident radiation at plant level for Between_PVPs treatment should have resulted in even higher biomass accumulation compared to Below_PVPs treatment. The lower dry mass at harvest for plants grown between PVPs more likely resulted from their lower RUE. In both treatments under PVPs, due to the South to North orientation of the plantation rows and the PVP strips, each lettuce was submitted to alternation of shade and full sun conditions with a different timing depending on the distance separating the plant from the vertical of the PVP strip axis. In our experiment, up to 1 h offset separated shading of the different rows depending on their position respective to PVPs. As a result, some rows may have been shaded when evaporative demand was maximal, notably those located below PVPs while Between_PVPs plants were exposed to full sun radiation and high evaporative demand which may have transiently limited growth and reduced RUE in this treatment.</p><p id="Par64">Higher RIE and RUE in shaded plants was critical for maintaining production below PVPs. Increase of RIE in shaded conditions has been reported as the result of a higher intercepting leaf area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In our experiments, striking differences in final plant leaf area were obtained between light treatments although with only slight differences in relative expansion rate at the beginning of plant development. This is typical of processes that follow exponential or even sub-exponential increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. It has to be noticed that estimation of leaf area was only based on horizontal photographs, and it is not known whether vertical development of plants was also modified under PVPs to help maximising light interception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Leaves typically get erected upon shading in most species but this probably has lower impact on light interception in oak leaf lettuce which exhibits very tortuous leaves, evenly oriented in all directions. An alternative explanation for the observed rise of RIE in plants shaded between PVPs is a possible increase of their specific leaf area, another typical response to shade in most species which reduce their leaf thickness to maximise leaf area per unit biomass. This may occur at the expense of RUE when the photosynthetic components per unit leaf area become limiting. This is a possible cause for the reduction in RUE observed in plants grown between PVPs which also exhibited the highest RIE in our experiment. Finally, it remains intriguing how plants grown below PVPs displayed higher RUE although higher photosynthesis efficiency has already been reported in shaded plants to better value intercepted radiation into biomass increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Perspectives</title><p id="Par65">Being based on spectral properties of leaf pigments and leaf cell structure, the presented method is relevant to all the plant species that we tested. Like for all other methods, weed control is very important to ensure that infrared reflection is only associated to the plant of interest. However, a combination of the PYM method with a more classical analysis of VIS images could possibly help discriminating between undesirable and targeted plants. Whenever possible, any undesirable materials (pots, sensors etc.…) in the field of view should preferably be selected as non-reflecting for NIR. Imaging environments are sometimes depleted in IR source light which can also be circumvented by adding an artificial source of IR light like LEDs illuminator (at a fixed wavelength, for example at 750 nm). Although not presented here, the procedure should be easily extrapolated to side-view images.</p><p id="Par66">Finally, Raspberry Pi computers offer enough flexibility to fit scripts to multiple applications. For example, the system can be used for remote sensing of plant growth even during the night, using infrared LEDs programmed to light up during image capture. To save memory during image capture, the script developed for image analysis could be uploaded in the Raspberry Pi so that leaf area only could be stored. Segmented images could also be easily controlled by adding a portable display. The PYM method could thereby be appropriate for very large applications or drone assisted ones were the weight of the whole device should be minimized. However, high storage capacity devices are now available at low prices and low weight and are more flexible for further analysis.</p><p id="Par67">Geopositioning of recorded pictures clearly extends the possibilities of plant phenotypic analyses. This is exemplified in the field experiment reported herein where moving the phenotyping cart along a predefined pathway and following a sequential naming of the pictures, made possible to automatically locate each recorded image with respect to PVP shading. Spatial effects could thus be tested and a difference was revealed between lettuces grown below the vertical projection of PVPs and below free spaces separating strips of PVPs. Similar procedure could apply to the analysis of any spatial structure that could have influenced crop growth like soil heterogeneity, distance from neighbouring trees in agroforestry or distance to drippers or sprinklers in irrigated systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par68">We elaborated a new imaging device associated with a robust image analysis routine to estimate plant leaf area in a large diversity of environments. The method took advantage of the spectral properties of leaves emitting in infrared wavelengths. The hardware was developed around the widely used Raspberry Pi computer and camera, resulting in a very low-cost device. Pairing several devices together, high throughput could be reached to reveal subtle differences in leaf growth when conditions induce scattering in plant growth. An application is presented in field conditions where the method revealed acclimation of lettuces plants to shading by photovoltaic panels via modifications in RIE and RUE. Low-cost, light maintenance and flexibility of the method can meet a growing demand for plant phenotyping with multiple purpose.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Authors’ contributions</title><sec><p>BV, TS and AC wrote this manuscript.
