The feature size, shape, composition, orientation and order all contribute to device efficiency and are simultaneously difficult to study due to poor contrast between carbon based materials. This study seeks to increase device efficiency and simplify morphology measurements by replacing the typical fullerene acceptor with endohedral fullerene Lu<sub>3</sub>N@PC<sub>80</sub>BEH. The metal atoms give excellent scattering contrast for electron beam and x-ray experiments. Additionally, Lu<sub>3</sub>N@PC<sub>80</sub>BEH has a lower electron affinity than standard fullerenes, which can raise the open circuit voltage of photovoltaic devices. Electron microscopy techniques are used to produce a detailed account of morphology evolution in mixtures of Lu<sub>3</sub>N@PC<sub>80</sub>BEH with the record breaking donor polymer, PTB7 and coated using solvent mixtures. We demonstrate that common solvent additives like 1,8-diiodooctane or chloronapthalene do not improve the morphology of endohedral fullerene devices as expected. The poor device performance is attributed to the lack of mutual miscibility between this particular polymer:fullerene combination and to co-crystallization of Lu<sub>3</sub>N@PC<sub>80</sub>BEH with 1,8-diiodooctane. This negative result explains why solvent additives mixtures are not necessarily a morphology cure-all.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep30915.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>14</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep30915" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep30915</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Organic photovoltaics (OPV) have been intensely studied over the past two decades and have steadily made progress increasing the device efficiency.

Improved understanding of the local ordering and morphology of the component materials has been a large contributor to this steady improvement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p>A commonly studied high performing a polymer device is composed of poly({4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl) oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b] dithiophene-2,6-diyl}{3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl] thieno[3,4-b] thiophenediyl}) (PTB7) and phenyl-C71-butric acid methyl-ester (PC<sub>70</sub>BM) with a processing additive diiodooctane (DIO) used for improved morphology and performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The DIO additive improves the power conversion efficiency (PCE) by at least a factor of two. The widely accepted reason for the improved performance is that the DIO decreases the component domain sizes from solution coating, thereby increasing interfacial area, exciton dissociation and the associated photocurrent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. DIO and other low volatility solvent additives have been widely reported in the OPV literature to decrease the polymer fullerene domain size by preventing liquid-liquid phase separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Reports on solvent mixtures always and without fail record an improvement in device function by use of a solvent additive. Due to the selection of positive results for published articles there are therefore no reports in which the use of a solvent additive results in poorer performance nor any analysis for why a solvent additive could result in a less advantageous morphology.</p><p>The nanoscale morphology of organic mixtures is very difficult to study due to lack of contrast between organic materials. Non-imaging techniques such as x-ray diffraction, neutron scattering, or various spectroscopies are typically used to infer average geometries and mixing ratios. Electron microscopy techniques are gaining popularity, but 2D images provide vertically averaged data. Tomography techniques can provide a 3D concentration map if sufficient contrast is available, if the reconstruction can avoid “missing wedge” artifacts and if the measurement can be performed without significant beam damage. We recently used electron tomography determine the relative location and volume of three distinct phases in an P3HT:fullerene OPV device with resolution of 1.5 × 1.5 × 1.5 nm. However, in order to create sufficient contrast for the measurement, an endohedral fullerene, Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH (ethyl-hexyl), was used as a replacement for PCBM (see <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> for structure)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH has a lower electron affinity (EA) than PC<sub>70</sub>BM which results in increased open circuit voltage (V<sub><italic>OC</italic></sub>) and high device efficiencies in mixtures with the donor polymer P3HT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In addition, Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH is an excellent contrast agent for tomography measurements allowing for detailed nanoscale morphology measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Molecular structures of PTB7 and Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep30915_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>Unfortunately, when combined PTB7 and Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH yielded very low PCE devices. In fact, Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH has been reported to produce poor OPV device efficiency with all OPV polymers other than P3HT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The question is why? Several reports in literature report reduced PCE in polymer mixtures with the low EA acceptor ICBA and attribute the reduced efficiency to a reduction in charge separation driving force<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Other reports show that mixtures of ICBA mix more intimately with PTB7, which could increase the charge recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Alternatively, it is reported that PC<sub>70</sub>BM forms a more favorable morphology with PTB7 than PC<sub>60</sub>BM, which could be an argument that a larger fullerene structure is desired for mixtures with PTB7. This article investigates the morphological changes due to the substitution of the endohedral fullerene as well as due to different processing additives using annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) combined with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), electron tomography (ET) and grazing incidence x-ray diffraction.</p><p>Since this article focuses on several electron microscopy techniques, we briefly review the origin of contrast and refer the reader to these references for more complete information. A transmission electron microscope (TEM) sends focused electrons through a thin sample and records a change in the intensity or energy of the electrons as a function of position. For a TEM the electrons are columnated over a area while for a scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) the electrons are focused into a &lt;1 Å spot and rastered over the surface. For both techniques one can measure the bright field (total forward intensity), annular dark field (intensity of electrons scattered to high angle), or energy loss image (energy loss in a specific energy region) as a function of lateral position. The intensity in an ADF image scales approximately with the square of the atomic number so heavy atoms can be used as the contrast agent with heavier atoms appearing with higher intensity. A STEM-EELS image looks at the electron intensity at specific energy losses that correspond to specific elements. For our samples we use the energy loss for the Sulfur L-edge and for the Carbon K-edge, starting at 165 and 285 eV, respectively. EELS has a much lower signal to noise that ADF and so each pixel of each image takes more acquisition time. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplemental Information Figure S1</xref> shows a comparison of a STEM-EELS sulfur map, carbon map and ADF image P3HT/Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH. This film was chosen because of the small features. In a typical STEM, each electron is accelerated to 200–300 keV which upon collision with the sample causes damage by impact. This type of beam damage causes vertical shrinkage of the film due to protons being “knocked off” of the sample, referred to as “knock on” damage. The other type of beam induced damage is caused by the electrons directly breaking chemical bonds, referred to as radiolysis, this effectively causes cross-linking in polymers. Finally ET refers to the process of taking many images of the same location at different angles with respect to the beam. The images are numerically reconstructed into a 3D volume. For ET, beam damage is a serious issue because the same area is imaged over 100 times. However, due to the high signal to noise of STEM-ADF imaging, the beam current and overall dose can be drastically reduced compared to conventional TEM-ET. While our group has measured high levels of beam damage for samples imaged using STEM-EELS-ET and previous reports of TEM-ET show vertical shrinkage of 30–50%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, measurements of shrinkage from STEM-ADF-ET are &lt;1% for STEM-ADF-ET imaged samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Film morphology as a function of fullerene size</title><p>The standard “high efficiency” PTB7/fullerene OPV devices is spin coated from a 97:3 vol% mixture of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and DIO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The DIO preferentially solubilizes the fullerene during the film drying process and results in a smaller scale phase separation. Chloronaphthalene (CN) is also a commonly used solvent additive in OPV mixtures. Like DIO, it has a low volatility and therefore evaporates slowly from the film. However, CN solubilizes both components and is reported to allow the polymer more time to crystallize, thus leading to more pure polymer phases, the opposite effect of DIO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. We compare films of 1:1 by wt. PTB7:PC<sub>60</sub>BM, PTB7:PC<sub>70</sub>BM PTB7:PC<sub>80</sub>BEH with spin coated from DSC with the CN and DIO additives.</p><p><xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> show STEM-EELS sulfur maps and ADF-STEM images of PTB7:PC<sub>70</sub>BM and PTB7:PC<sub>60</sub>BM films, respectively. In both figures, films processed with DIO and CN additives are compared. The sulfur maps show brighter intensity where polymer content is higher and darker regions where fullerene content is higher because only the polymer has sulfur in its structure. Conversely, the ADF-STEM images show higher intensity where fullerene content is higher and lower intensity where polymer content is higher because the fullerene has higher volumetric electron density than the polymer. These images reveal that the fullerene domains are indeed ∼50 nm when DIO is used as an additive, where the CN additive causes much larger fullerene domains. Additionally, the PC<sub>70</sub>BM breaks up into smaller domains than the PC<sub>60</sub>BM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This could be another reason PC<sub>70</sub>BM typically performs better than PC<sub>60</sub>BM in devices, in addition to increased optical absorption. Our measurements confirm that there is fullerene contained in the polymer-rich regions, but, the amount was not quantified here because this has already been published<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.

Upon further investigation, it was determined that these fullerene aggregates are, at least, partially crystalline. This is contrary to what was found with the other PTB7:Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH additive films as well as P3HT:Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH where the fullerene always remained amorphous, despite extended annealing or solvent annealing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

The figure inset shows increased contrast in a dark region that consists of (within measurement limits) pure PTB7. The pure PTB7 film has ∼100 nm holes that correspond to thin spots. In our previous analysis of P3HT with various endohedral fullerenes, we showed that Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBM crystallizes out of P3HT with heating and leaves behind similar thin-spots. In the previous study, we assumed that fullerene crystal formation occurred through Ostwald ripening of the crystal and simultaneous depletion of the amorphous fullerene domains. However since the diffusion rate of small molecule fullerenes is much higher than entangled polymers, the pattern of thin-spots in the polymer film indicates the pattern of depleted (removed) fullerene domains. The Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH did not crystallize under any thermal conditions including long time solvent annealing with DCB and long time heating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

This pattern suggests that Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH also initially formed small domains with PTB7 upon spin coating from a mixed solvent but then later the Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH was removed through an Oswald ripening process.</p><p>In <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, a higher magnification image of the Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH crystallites is presented.

The formation of Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH crystals was very unexpected due to the previous inability of the fullerene to crystallize as a pure substance, cast and annealed with various solvents in P3HT, or cast and annealed with various solvents in PTB7<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In our study of Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH with P3HT, the film was heated above the melting temperature and slow cooled for over 2 hours.

On a first view, the corresponding intensities in the GIXD data of the sample with DIO additive seem to be enhanced dramatically. However, a closer view reveals that the azimuthal intensity distribution of the higher order peaks 200 and 300 are inhomogeneous. Furthermore, it turns out that the inhomogeneous intensity distribution is significantly different for the 200 and the 300 reflections. The scattering intensity maximum of the 300 peak are observed at 45° whereas the maximum of the 200 peak is observed at 0°.

Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH is particularly interesting because (1) its reduced EA compared to other fullerenes, which could increase the V<sub><italic>OC</italic></sub> of OPV devices and (2) the metal center gives scattering contrast for electron microscopy that would allow nanoscale morphology measurements and (3) PTB7 showed better mixing with PC<sub>70</sub>BM than PC<sub>60</sub>BM which suggests that larger fullerenes could be an advantage.</p><p>Like many high performance co-polymers, the performance of OPV device mixtures with PTB7 and fullerenes is greatly improved by using a solvent additive in the casting mixture and in particular DIO. We show here that Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH forms a co-crystal with DIO that causes the Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH to be leeched out of the polymer film and thereby destroys the layer morphology. The inset to <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref> provides insight into the mechanism for the crystal formation. The polymer film is shown to have thin spots that most likely were formed during the film formation process by the presence of Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH rich domains. The domain size is typical of PC<sub>70</sub>BM fullerene films solution cast with a DIO additive. In other words the DIO additive seems to initially work as an emulsifier for Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH into PTB7. DIO has a much lower vapor pressure than the main solvent, DCB and so as the film dries, the DIO content is enriched. Typically (and also here) the film is placed onto a hot plate at ∼50 °C to drive off the solvent more quickly. At this time it appears that crystals of Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH nucleate. The orientation of the crystals is the same as the PTB7 polymer (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) and so it is likely (though not proven) that these co-crystals nucleate on the PTB7 polymer. The co-crystals of Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH and DIO are enlarged by transport of the Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH through film that is swollen with DIO. The PTB7 is depleted of fullerene leaving behind thin spots where the Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH clusters initially formed. Since the PTB7 is only solvated by the DCB solvent and its T<sub><italic>g</italic></sub> is greater than 50 °C, it does not diffuse. This formation process of Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH/DIO co-crystals explains why Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH does not make good devices with most co-polymers that use DIO as a solvent additive. This is also a clear example that shows that DIO is not always an advantageous addition as it can lead to the formation of co-crystals.</p><p>We also examined the use of CN as a solvent additive. This solvent additive increased the miscibility of Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH with PTB7 but phase separation on the micrometer length scale is still evident. As previously reported, the PTB7 polymer does not form pure polymer domains, but instead forms a mixed polymer/fullerene phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> shows that PTB7 rich-domains are ∼40% fullerene by volume, which is theoretically enough to assure percolation of electrons to the electrodes. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure 8</xref> shows that the Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH forms clusters within the PTB7 that may not be connected. The CN additive films had significantly lower fluorescence quenching than films without additive, but the improvements in J<sub><italic>SC</italic></sub> were only moderate and the V<sub><italic>OC</italic></sub> is reduced. These results suggest that recombination between PTB7 and Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH is high and dominates the IV characteristics. One reason for high recombination could be that electrons are trapped in Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH domains that do not connect to electrodes. Another could be poor charge separation due to insufficient electronic driving force. Finally, the Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH rich domains dominate over 50% of the surface and have very little (∼20%) PTB7 content, so at least half of the film is not an effective photovoltaic device.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The morphology of mixed layers of the high-performance polymer PTB7 and an endohedral fullerene, Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH, were investigated. The device performance was found to be inferior to PTB7:PCBM (either C<sub>60</sub> or C<sub>70</sub>), even when using the widely accepted performance enhancing additive, diiodooctane. Electron microscopy studies revealed that in films with diiodooctane added, the fullerene strongly aggregated into micrometer sized crystals. Further investigation shows that the DIO initially solvates the Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH but as the DIO slowly evaporates, co-crystals of Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH and DIO form and ripen. The solvent additive chloronaphthalene causes the Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH to partially disperse in the polymer matrix, but only in small, poorly connected clusters. The poor connectivity reduces the charge collection ability of the mixture compared to PC<sub>70</sub> and PC<sub>60</sub>BM. Additionally, Lu<sub>3</sub>N@C<sub>80</sub>-PCBEH is less miscible with PTB7 than smaller fullerenes, leading to less effective quenching of PTB7 fluorescence than with a similar volume of PC<sub>60</sub>BM.</p><p>This work demonstrates important aspects of component mixing in organic photovoltaic mixtures. In particular, it is necessary that the fullerene component not crystallize because crystallization coupled with low vapor pressure solvents leads to phase separation of polymer and fullerene.

The final reconstruction was determined by minimizing the projection error using two gray levels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>GIXD</title><p>The samples were measured with the highly customized Versatile Advanced X-ray Scattering instrument Erlangen (VAXSTER) at the chair for Crystallography and Structural Physics (Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The system was equipped with a Cu K<sub>α</sub> (λ = 1.5418 Å;) Microfocus X-ray source (GeniX, 30 W, Xenocs, Sassenage, France). The beam was collimated by two automated double slit systems (aperture sizes 0.7 × 0.7 mm<sup>2</sup> and 0.4 × 0.4 mm<sup>2</sup>) with a distance of about 1.2 m. The second slit system consists of four scatterless silicon single crystal blades. The sample was positioned inside the fully evacuated beam path in front of the 2D Pilatus3 300 K detector (Dectris Ltd., Baden, Switzerland). All GIXD measurements were performed at 22.2 °C. The collimation line was tilted and shifted with respect to the horizontal plane allowing grazing incidence angles which maximizes the scattering volume and enhances the scattered intensity. The incident angle α was set to 0.21 ± 0.032° which is just below the critical angle of total reflection of the substrate. The sampledetector distance was calibrated to 178.5 mm using a silver behenate standard, providing a beam size of about 0.5 × 15 mm<sup>2</sup> at the sample position.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Roehling, J.
