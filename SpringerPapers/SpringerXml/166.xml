A major objection to this hypothesis is that hysteresis can be reduced by changing the interfacial contact materials; however, this is unlikely to significantly influence the behaviour of mobile ionic charge within the perovskite phase. Here, we show that the primary effects of ion migration can be observed regardless of whether the contacts were changed to give devices with or without significant hysteresis. Transient optoelectronic measurements combined with device simulations indicate that electric-field screening, consistent with ion migration, is similar in both high and low hysteresis CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> cells. Simulation of the photovoltage and photocurrent transients shows that hysteresis requires the combination of both mobile ionic charge and recombination near the perovskite-contact interfaces. Passivating contact recombination results in higher photogenerated charge concentrations at forward bias which screen the ionic charge, reducing hysteresis.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Ion migration has been related to hysteresis in perovskite solar cells, but not all perovskite cells exhibit a hysteresis.

Migration of ionic defects in the perovskite phase, ferroelectric polarization or trapping of electrons at the interfaces have all been suggested as mechanisms for the accumulation of this charge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, it is not clear that ferroelectric polarization can persist in these materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

There is strong direct and indirect evidence that slow drift and diffusion of ionic defects at room temperature is the dominant mechanism underlying hysteresis in CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, a significant objection to this hypothesis is that the degree of hysteresis is highly dependent on the interface properties and choice of contact materials, which appear to control the interfacial trap density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. For example, when a ZnO cathode top layer is replaced with phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in a CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> device with an otherwise identical architecture, hysteresis at room temperature is significantly reduced (see Fig. 1c and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). To a first approximation, ionic defect concentration and mobility in the bulk of the perovskite phase are not expected to be strongly influenced by the contacts, although the possibility that PCBM blocks ion migration at grain boundaries has been proposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Superficially, these observations appear to undermine the viability of the ion transport model for explaining hysteresis because the effect seems to be controlled by the contact material. However, recent simulations suggest that <italic>J–V</italic> hysteresis could only be reproduced if both ion migration and recombination via interfacial traps were present in devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Here we present transient optoelectronic measurements that probe the direction of the internal electric field in operating devices. The measurements directly indicate that ionic migration appears in devices both with and without hysteresis. Our simulations reproduce the transient device behaviour over all relevant timescales (10<sup>−8</sup>–10<sup>2</sup> s). The results show that hysteresis is only observed in cases where high rates of recombination exist in the perovskite/contact interfacial regions of devices. During the forward <italic>J–V</italic> scan a reverse electric field in the bulk perovskite layer drives electrons and holes away from their respective transport layers and high concentrations of minority carriers build up at these interfaces. Where these interfaces act as recombination regions, the charge collection efficiency of the device is adversely affected. Instead, if recombination at the interfaces is reduced, then the build-up of photogenerated charge carriers contributes to efficient collection of diffusive currents during the forward scan. Low hysteresis is thus primarily an artefact of low interfacial recombination and resultant high photogenerated carrier populations at forward bias, despite the presence of ion migration. Our evidence experimentally confirms the prediction of van Reenen <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and indicates that the stability of photocurrents and photovoltages in a device can be controlled by changing the interfacial recombination properties, without necessarily requiring a change in ion concentration or mobility within the perovskite phase. These observations resolve a significant concern about the origins of hysteresis in this material.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Optoelectronic measurements</title><p id="Par6">We examined CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> solar cells with two device architectures (see Methods for details): one showing limited <italic>J–V</italic> hysteresis at room temperature (herein referred to as ‘top cathode’ cells—see <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,c</xref>) and the other showing significant hysteresis in the photovoltaic performance at room temperature (referred to as ‘bottom cathode’ cells—see <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b,d</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Measured and simulated device current–voltage characteristics.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Top cathode and (<bold>b</bold>) bottom cathode perovskite solar cell device architecture stacks.

Immediately after illumination, the distribution of mobile ionic charges is as shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref> since they have not had time to move in response to the changed electric fields. In the presence of a photovoltage, this ionic charge distribution results in spatial electrostatic potential minima at the perovskite/contact interfaces, which we will refer to as ‘valleys’. However, in the top cathode device, high concentrations of photogenerated electrons and holes rapidly redistribute to fill these valleys, resulting in screening of the initial E-field induced by ion accumulation (see <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c,d</xref>). Over a period of tens of seconds ions migrate away from the p-type region. This migration is a result of both the high ion concentration gradient at the interfaces and the reversal of the field direction, which now drives ions in the opposite direction to that during equilibration at short circuit (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). There is an accompanying redistribution of the electrons and holes throughout this time.

From the simulated energy and charge distribution diagrams shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5e,f</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref> (detail), it is apparent that potential valleys are also formed immediately following illumination. In this case, however, photogenerated electrons and holes collected in the valleys rapidly recombine due to high rates of recombination in the n- and p-type contact regions, and the electric field associated with ionic charge remains unscreened. Since the presence of the photovoltage partially negates the built-in potential, the concentration of ionic defects at the contacts decreases as the defects migrate away, until the E-field in the bulk of the cell is once again zero, consistent with recent scanning Kelvin probe observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. At this point, the <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> reaches a plateau. The evolution of <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> during this time is dictated by (1) ion migration, (2) electronic charge rearrangement in response to ionic migration and (3) an increase in the concentration of photogenerated charge carriers due to redistribution away from fast SRH recombination centres in the contacts. An opposite process occurs for a bottom cathode device relaxing from forward bias preconditioning (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). These processes are also responsible for the difference in <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> between forward and reverse scans in the <italic>J–V</italic> curve (see <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1g,h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Figs 5a,b</xref> show that the potential profiles and ion distributions are similar for both bottom cathode and top cathode simulations at low forward bias. However, recombination of carriers driven to the interfaces by the reversed E-field during the forward scan results in a significant loss of photocurrent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Fig. 5d</xref>). The valleys are not present for the reverse scan, so charge collection is more efficient. The simulated <italic>J–V</italic>s showed similar hysteresis indices (HIs) for the same scan speed and similar scan protocol (see Methods), with HIs of 0.00 and 1.84 compared with measured values measured for these devices of 0.05 and 1.71 for the top cathode and bottom cathode architectures, respectively. The effects of series resistance were not included accounting for the discrepancy in fill factor between experiment and simulation: the maximum power in the reverse scan would show a greater relative reduction than the forward scan due to higher current densities. We note that the degree of hysteresis observed in a <italic>J–V</italic> measurement is sensitive to the voltage scan rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, since this determines whether mobile ionic defects have time to react to the changing applied potential as has recently been simulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. If the ratio of the scan rate to ionic mobility is very large the ions will appear ‘frozen’ in place during the scan, alternatively if the ratio goes to zero then ions will reach an equilibrium distribution for each voltage in both scan directions, and no hysteresis will be seen in either case.</p><p id="Par23">Our simulations also reproduce the anomalous transient photovoltage behaviour observed at early times during the <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> evolution (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f,h</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref> for the dark +1 V preconditioning). The negative transients are explained by the drift of the additional photogenerated charges to the valleys during the laser pulse (a positive internal photocurrent). Once the light pulse ends, the associated positive internal photocurrent stops and the excess electrons and holes then contribute to a positive deflection of the transient photovoltage in the normal way. This excess then decays away on a timescale reflecting the recombination kinetics of the device in its current state. The details underlying the photovoltage decay time constants are considerably more complex than the zero-dimensional model mentioned above (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Note 1</xref>), owing to the spatial separation of electrons, holes, and recombination regions.

Other possible recombination schemes in the presence of ion migration were also investigated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Note 3</xref>). These indicated that the recombination type in the contact regions did not need to be specifically SRH to reproduce the experimental results, and that high band-to-band recombination rates throughout the device or in the perovskite layer alone cannot reproduce the results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).

The illumination intensity was adjusted to be equivalent to 100 mW cm<sup>−2</sup> using a using a calibrated filtered Si photodiode (Osram BPW21). The <italic>J–V</italic> measurement protocol was as follows for both the light and the dark measurements. The cell was left at −1 V in the dark for approximately 30 s. In the case of the light measurements the solar simulator shutter was then opened. The applied voltage was then swept from −1 to +1.2 V at a rate of approximately 40 mV s<sup>−1</sup> (forward scan) and the current density measured, the optical shutter was then closed. The cells were then held at +1.2 V for a few seconds before the shutter was opened and the voltage swept back to −1 V at 40 mV s<sup>−1</sup> (reverse scan). As means to compare the degree of hysteresis between devices, we define a hysteresis index (HI=[<italic>P</italic><sub>max,r</sub>/<italic>P</italic><sub>max,f</sub>]−1) for a given scan rate in terms of the maximum power points on the reverse scan, <italic>P</italic><sub>max, r</sub>, and the forward scan, <italic>P</italic><sub>max,f</sub>. This differs slightly from the HI introduced by Kim and Park<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.

The two measurements were performed simultaneously (see <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> for the experimental timeline). The fast voltage transients were collected every second for approximately 45 s, averaging approximately 20 curves over approximately 200 ms. The white bias light was provided by an array of cool-white LEDs (Luxeonstar), calibrated to 1 sun equivalent with a silicon photodiode. The 500 ns laser pulse was provided by a digitally modulated Omicron PhoxX+638 nm diode laser, with 100 Hz repetition rate. The laser spot size was expanded to cover the active pixel and the continuous wave intensity over the cell pixel area was approximately 550 mW cm<sup>−2</sup> during the pulse.

The turn off time of the 735 nm LED was ≤200 ns as measured by a fast silicon diode and a GHz oscilloscope. Turn on time for the LED was ≤3 μs. The pulse intensity gave an absorbed photon flux approximately equivalent to 0.5 suns. Applied potential was supplied by a National Instrument USB-6251 multi-function DAQ board.

Note that neither the mobile nor the static ionic defects were modelled to induce doping effects that could liberate free electrons and holes in the conduction and valence bands, so the only role of the mobile defects in the simulation is to allow the distribution of charge in the device to change. Equilibrium and doping electron and hole densities were calculated using Boltzmann statistics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Note 2</xref>, equations (23)–(25)).</p><p id="Par36">To simulate current–voltage scans and current transients, a p-type/intrinsic/n-type (p-i-n) structure device (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Fig. 11a</xref>) was used with an increasing or decreasing series of fixed potential difference boundary conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Note 2</xref>, equations (29)–(34)) for each time step. The scan protocol used in the <italic>J–V</italic> simulations was similar to that used experimentally (with a scan rate of 40 mV s<sup>−1</sup>), and the final state of the device after the forward scan was used as the starting condition for reverse scan. The effects of series resistance were not included in the simulation.</p><p id="Par37">Conventionally, the open circuit voltage is found by using Newton’s method to solve for zero current at the boundaries. In order to accelerate calculation times and enable direct readout of the open circuit voltage, we used the method of image charges and devised a symmetric p-i-n (s-p-i-n) cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Fig. 11b</xref>). This approach enables simple Dirichlet boundary conditions to be employed by setting the potential at both boundaries equal to zero (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Note 2</xref>, equations (39) and (40)). Since charge densities in the two cells are a mirror of one another, the current and electric field at the mid-point of the device go to zero. However, the potential at the mid-point is free to change in response to changes in carrier density profiles in accordance with Poisson’s equation. Provided that the depletion widths at the intrinsic/doped layer interfaces are significantly less than the layer thicknesses themselves, the doping concentrations in the n- and p-type layers generate the built-in voltage in the device. The <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> of the cell is obtained by taking the difference in electron quasi-Fermi energy, <italic>E</italic><sub>Fn</sub> at the mid-point of the device (cathode) and the hole quasi-Fermi energy, <italic>E</italic><sub>Fp</sub>, at the left-hand boundary (anode) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Note 2</xref>, equation (26)).

Examples of data calculated with other grid spacings are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>; we chose 0.67 nm as a compromise between numerical accuracy and calculation time.</p><p id="Par39">To further accelerate calculation times, generation in the active layer was uniform, and adjusted to yield an absorbed photon flux equivalent to 16 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> (2.5 × 10<sup>21</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). Voltage transients and current transients were taken using fluxes of 16 and 3.2 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> ,respectively. In simulating the top cathode device, SRH recombination was switched off, while for the bottom cathode devices, an SRH recombination was implemented in the contact regions with a time constant of 2 × 10<sup>−15</sup> s. The band-to-band recombination coefficient was chosen (10<sup>−10</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) such that the time constants for the transient photovoltage decays in the top cathode device were similar those observed experimentally (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). While unrealistic, including SRH recombination throughout the thickness of the contact regions rather than solely at the interfaces circumvented numerical inaccuracies resulting from the combination of a high potential gradients and high recombination currents at the perovskite contact interfaces. Using this method approximately 75% of the total SRH recombination takes place within the first 10 nm of the contact region (e.g. between 190 and 200 nm in the p-type region), yet the same <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> was obtainable using an order of magnitude higher recombination time constant than when a 5 nm recombination layer was used at the interface.</p><p id="Par40">In the bottom cathode device, both the SRH time constant and trap energies determine the overall rate of SRH recombination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2176">Supplementary Note 2</xref>, equation (28)). In the absence of data regarding possible trap energies, the levels were chosen arbitrarily to be shallow (0.2 eV below the conduction band and 0.2 eV above the valence band for the n and p-type regions, respectively). Since deeper trap energies combined with a lower recombination time constant yield similar behaviour, our simulations do not provide an estimate for the SRH time constant in real devices.
