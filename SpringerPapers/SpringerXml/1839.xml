Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels are emerging as essential cellular switches that allow animals to respond to their environment. In particular, the Vanilloid Receptor 1 (TRPV1), besides being involved in the body temperature regulation and in the response to pain, has important roles in several neuronal functions, as cytoskeleton dynamics, injured neurons regeneration, synaptic plasticity. Currently available tools to modulate TRPV1 activity suffer from limited spatial selectivity, do not allow for temporally precise control, and are usually not reversible, thus limiting their application potential. The use of optical excitation would allow for overcoming all these limitations. Here, we propose a novel strategy, based on the use of light-sensitive, conjugated polymers. We demonstrate that illumination of a polymer thin film leads to reliable, robust and temporally precise control of TRPV1 channels. Interestingly, the activation of the channel is due to the combination of two different, locally confined effects, namely the release of thermal energy from the polymer surface and the variation of the local ionic concentration at the cell/polymer interface, both mediated by the polymer photoexcitation.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>28</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_8541.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Cellular functions are primarily mediated by ionic channels, a class of integral membrane proteins found in all cells of the body. Selective and rapid regulation of specific channels is key to the understanding of physiological processes, the development of novel therapeutic strategies and the implementation of specific drugs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. One of the largest groups of ion channels is represented by the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels superfamily, which has been very intensively investigated in recent years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. TRPs are widespread in eukaryotes, from yeast to mammals, they are characterized by remarkable diversity in ionic selectivity and activation mechanisms, and they are sensitive to a wide range of chemical and physical stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Importantly, they have many functional roles in both excitable and non-excitable cells, some of which are still to be completely elucidated. In more detail, TRPs behave as essential cellular switches that allow organisms to respond to a variety of environmental stimuli, and are at the base of the perception of pain, warm and cold temperatures, noxious and pungent chemicals, and pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The Vanilloid Receptor 1 (TRPV1) is by far the most studied channel belonging to the TRP super family. Besides being involved in the regulation of the body temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and in the response to painful stimuli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, it also has important functional roles in the neurogenic inflammatory response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. It has been demonstrated that upon nerve injury, changes in TRPV1 expression occur in damaged nerve fibers and cell bodies within sensory ganglia, leading to enhanced spontaneous excitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. TRPV1 is also believed to be involved in forms of synaptic remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, to potentiate glutamatergic signaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and to contribute to cytoskeletal remodeling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Notably, the expression of TRPV1 channels in retinal ganglion cells positively influences their survival in the presence of optical neuropathies, stress events, such as ischemia, and neurodegenerative diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Overall, the ensemble of the recent experimental evidences justifies the high interest for both activating and inhibiting agents of TRPV1, as novel physiological probes and powerful pharmacological targets. Both TRPV1-antagonist and -agonist therapies are under intense investigation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. TRPV1 can be activated by several chemical/physical stimuli, including voltage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, heat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, chemical compounds such as capsaicin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and spider toxins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, acid pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, several fatty acids such as the endocannabinoid anandamide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, or by some of their possible combinations. Most common activation protocols, relying on the application of a transmembrane potential, administration of capsaicin to the cell medium, and heating of the extracellular bath above the threshold temperature of 43 °C, all suffer from limited temporal and spatial resolution and are often irreversible, thus requiring frequent washing outs of the cell media. Use of optical excitation would allow for overcoming the limitations of existing methods and gaining spatially selective, temporally precise and reversible control of TRPV1 channel activity. Very recently, two different, light activated methods have been proposed, based on the use either of photoswitchable compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, composed by capsaicin derivatives linked to azobenzene molecules, or of light sensitive nanoparticles with high photothermal conversion efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Both of them exploited the synergistic combination of visible light with specific stimuli, fatty acids activators and heat, respectively.</p><p id="Par4">Here, we propose an alternative strategy, based on the use of light sensitive, conjugated polymers thin films. We demonstrate that illumination of the polymer leads to reliable, robust and temporally precise control of TRPV1 channel activity. Interestingly, the activation of the channel can be interpreted on the base of the combined action of two different effects, both of them localized at the polymer surface: the release of thermal energy from the excited photoactive material, and the variation of the ionic concentration in the cleft niche, mediated by photoexcitation and accumulation of photo-generated negative charges at the interface between the polymer and the extracellular bath.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Realization of the bio/polymer interface</title><p id="Par5">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> shows a sketch of the polymer/cell interface developed for activation of TRPV1 channels. A thin film (approximate thickness, 250 nm) of regio-regular poly-3(hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is deposited by spin coating on top of a glass substrate. P3HT is characterized by a wide optical absorption spectrum peaking at 520 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), excellent optoelectronic properties when used as the active, light absorbing and charge generating material in solar cells and organic photodetectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and outstanding biocompatibility properties when used in combination with living cells, as recently demonstrated in both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Moreover, P3HT was recently reported to efficiently sustain thermally-mediated depolarization and hyperpolarization effects in a number of different biological systems, including primary hippocampal neurons, excised retinal tissues and epileptic brain slices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. As the biological counterpart of the bio/polymer interface, we use Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK-293) cells stably transfected with the human TRPV1 channel (HEK-293T). HEK-293T cells were cultured directly on top of the polymer surface, as well as on control glass substrates, for 48 h. Both polymer and glass substrates were pre-treated by deposition of a fibronectin adhesion layer. The tetrazolium salt (MTT) assay has been used to obtain a quantitative colorimetric evaluation of cell survival and proliferation up to 4 days <italic>in vitro</italic>. Cells cultured on top of the polymer surface show good viability properties, even though their proliferation rate is slightly slowed down respect to control glass substrates (Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Polymer photoexcitation is provided by the emission of a green led light source (emission peak, 544 nm; photoexcitation density in the range 26.1–343.9 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>), impinging on the polymer sample from the glass side. It is important to notice that, due to the high absorbance of the polymer layer, the actual optical power density impinging on the cultured cells is reduced and falls within the range 3.48–86.96 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> (see Methods section for details).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Sketch of the experimental set-up for optical stimulation of living cells.

Visible light pulses (wavelength excitation peak, 544 nm; photoexcitation density, 202.4 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>) lead to a remarkable increase of the outward current (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3a</xref> for 100 ms- and 20 ms- light stimuli duration, respectively). Figures <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3c</xref> report the average current increase due to the photoexcitation, as obtained by averaging current values immediately before the light onset (in black), and immediately before the light offset, where the maximum current is recorded (in red), over 5-ms temporal windows (represented in panel a as dashed lines). In particular, at the maximum applied voltage (+100 mV), the positive variation of the current amounts at +84% and +26%, for 100 ms- and 20 ms- long pulses, respectively. We notice that the response amplitude (249 ± 41 pA/pF for 100 ms pulses) is comparable to the one obtained upon capsaicin administration at 50 nM concentration (224 ± 27 pA/pF, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>), which is considered to be of physiological significance for pharmacological treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Control measurements were carried out both on HEK-293T cells cultured on glass substrates and subjected to the same illumination protocols (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3b</xref>), and on HEK-293T cultured on polymer substrates, but kept in dark conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). In both cases no significant signal variation is recorded, thus indicating that the effect observed in cells cultured onto polymers is due to an optically-mediated process. I–V characteristics (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>) upon optical stimulation at different photoexcitation densities, varying within the range 26.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> − 343.9 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, show that the reversal potential (defined as the value of the potential at which the current density changes its sign) shifts towards more positive values at increasing light intensities (see inset), from −41 mV at 26.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> up to −10.4 mV at 343.9 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, consistently with the possible activation of cationic channels. A linear dependence of the current from the light photoexcitation density is observed, at both positive and negative voltages (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref> for two representative examples, at +80 mV and −40 mV).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Outward current increase in HEK-293T cells upon photostimulation with 100 ms light pulses.

Altogether, these data first indicate that the recorded signal may be attributed to the excitation of the TRPV1 channel.</p><p id="Par9">Light-induced changes to the plasma membrane potential have been further investigated by whole-cell recordings in current-clamp (<italic>I</italic> = 0) mode (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Data have been reported as relative variation of the membrane potential; no alteration in the resting membrane potential values were detected (see data reported in the SI section, Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>, for cells cultured on P3HT and on control glass substrates). The comparison with non-transfected cells is once more instructive. In HEK-293 cells cultured onto P3HT samples and subjected to the same photoactivation densities, a cell membrane depolarization followed by a hyperpolarization signal is observed (see Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref> for a representative example of the variation of the membrane potential). The sign reversal occurs over an average temporal scale of few tens of milliseconds. Both these signals have been recently characterized and interpreted on the base of thermal phenomena, namely a variation of the membrane capacitance and the Nernst potential values, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Conversely, in HEK-293T cells the depolarization signal is recorded over much longer timescale, and it continuously increases over the whole considered stimuli duration of 100 ms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The initial, fast depolarization signal is still present (see a magnification in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, inset, and measurements acquired over a shorter timescale of 20 ms, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>), but its dynamics is partially overlapped with a much stronger, longer activating signal. Even though it is not possible to completely disentangle the two signals, we estimated the build-up time constant in the order of 48 ± 0.3 ms, 105 ± 1.7 ms and 225 ± 22 ms for 343.9 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, 202.4 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> and 122.6 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively, by fitting the membrane potential variation with a single exponential curve within the temporal range 115 ÷ 200 ms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, grey symbols). Moreover, the hyperpolarization observed in non-transfected cells is completely overwhelmed in HEK-293T cells by the longer-activating depolarization signal. Cells seeded on bare glass substrates and subjected to the same photostimulation protocols do not show any response, exception made for the highest photoexcitation density, where a small (&lt;−0.7 mV) hyperpolarization signal is recorded (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>). The average variation of the membrane potential shows a statistically significant difference respect to the value recorded on illuminated control samples (without the polymer) over the same temporal window (Student’s t-test, p &lt; 0.001 in all cases). The maximum membrane potential variation linearly scales with the photoexcitation density (linear regression coefficient R<sup>2</sup> = 0.98), Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>. Importantly, the photo-induced depolarization effect is highly repeatable and reliable. In fact, no significant changes are detected neither in the peak value nor in its temporal dynamics, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e and f</xref>, respectively, for 16 subsequent light pulses.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>HEK-293T cells depolarization mediated by polymer optical excitation.

Thus, we first investigate the role of a locally confined, photothermal effect due to the heating of the bath in the close proximity of the polymer surface, as the most plausible origin of the observed channel activation. The temperature variation of the extracellular bath in the close proximity of the polymer absorbing layer has been evaluated by using the method of the calibrated pipette resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Thanks to the wide optical absorption spectrum of the polymer, different excitation light sources in the visible range may be also used, leading to a different temperature increase (see Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref> for an example).

This is in line with a recent work by our group, in which we demonstrated that illumination of P3HT thin films immersed in water leads to a progressive acidification of the solution in the close proximity to the polymer surface, due to accumulation of photo-generated electrons, progressively charge balanced by the local formation of an electron-poor (acidic) layer of polarized water molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16">In a further experiment, we examine the possibility to optically activate TRPV1 channel in different pH conditions of the extracellular medium (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Interestingly, the increase in the proton concentration turns out into a response less intense than the one observed at physiological and slightly basic pHs. This can be interpreted on the base of a pre-activation of the channel, before the light onset, due to the acid pH of the bath, as also supported by the observed shift of the resting membrane potential (V<sub>m</sub>) towards more positive values (V<sub>m pH 6.0</sub> = −3.9 ± 1.2 mV; V<sub>m pH 5.0</sub> = −3.4 ± 2 mV) compared to physiological pH (V<sub>m pH7.4</sub> = −12.8 ± 4.4 mV). The photo-activated depolarization signal is possibly due to a further, supra activation of the channel. Conversely, in the case of basic pH, we can assume that the channel is completely closed before the light onset. Basic extracellular conditions usually hamper effective TRPV1 sensitization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Upon photoexcitation, however, two local effects act concomitantly at the polymer surface, in the close proximity of the cell membrane, namely the acidification of the extracellular bath and the increase of the temperature. This makes it possible to activate the channel at temperatures below the theoretical threshold and despite the basic pH conditions of the bulk extracellular bath. Measurements under physiological pH at two different molar concentrations of the buffering agent confirm this picture: higher buffering capability (10 mM) leads to a reduced depolarization signal, being able to more efficiently counter-balance the effect of the pH variation optically induced by the organic polymer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Time constant extracted by fitting the activation curves in different pH conditions with an exponential growth curve are in agreement with this picture. At acid pH, TRPV1 channels are efficiently opened already before the light onset, so that optical stimulation has only a limited, supra-threshold effect (longer dynamics). At physiological pH and upon 343.9 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> photoexcitation density, activation dynamics are dominated by temperature effects, possibly coupled to a local, fast acidification of the extracellular environment.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Effect of the extracellular pH.

As evidenced by current- and voltage-clamp analysis, we obtain robust and reliable activation of the channel in physiological-like conditions (i.e., at the resting membrane potential), at temperatures well below the nominal activation threshold, and even in basic pH conditions. We identified two light-driven effects leading to channel activation, namely photo-thermal heating and a local pH variation. Both of them are locally confined at the interface between the conjugated polymer and the extracellular bath, thus offering enhanced spatial resolution as compared to other existing activation techniques, ideally even at the level of cell sub-compartments. Besides, existing methods to modulate the extracellular pH and to elicit TRPV1 activity are based on pharmacological assays, which most of the time lack temporal reversibility. Further engineering of the biopolymer interface will be needed to quantitatively disentangle the two mechanisms and further exploit this peculiar advantage. Moreover, at variance with other optical methods based on the use of infrared light sources, the use of visible light (only weakly absorbed by water) avoids detrimental, unlocalized and hardly controllable over-heating of the extracellular bath. Importantly, we did not observe any deleterious effect of the photostimulation protocols on cell viability, even at the highest photoexcitation densities. Here, we used green light excitation, properly matched to the P3HT absorption spectrum, but the demonstrated technique may be easily transferred to any other wavelength in the visible range simply by employing different active, organic semiconductors. Thus, also in virtue of its inherent simplicity, the reported method may be easily coupled to any electrophysiological set-up, equipped with standard fluorescence light sources, for <italic>in vitro</italic> studies.
