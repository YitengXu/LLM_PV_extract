First, dry reforming of methane (DRM) can enable certain green chemical production pathways in the circular chemical economy as carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and (CH<sub>4</sub>) can be sourced from the anaerobic digestion of organic wastes, or captured from emission points to produce synthesis gas, the mixture of hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and carbon monoxide (CO) gas that results from DRM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> and is used industrially to produce megaton-scale commodity chemicals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Second, making use of sunlight to drive DRM photocatalytically can replace or reduce the amount of thermal or electrical energy required to drive the reaction, which itself has high energy demands due to both high endothermicity (ΔH<sub>rxn</sub> = 247.3 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>) and endergonic nature below temperatures of approximately 700 °C. When these energy requirements are met in the traditional manner by supplying heat from fossil fuel combustion, the potential carbon savings afforded by consuming CO<sub>2</sub> as feedstock are negated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Electrical heating using renewable electricity is a possibility to alleviate this issue; however, it has been shown that the US electrical grid would need to be not only retrofitted to be emission-free, but the capacity would have to be increased by almost 75% (from 15 to 26 EJ in the United States) to meet the current thermal energy demands of the industrial sector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Because of these potential benefits, using sunlight to assist the dry reforming reaction via photocatalytic pathways is an attractive proposition to aid in the energy transition and has received significant attention in the last two decades.</p><p id="Par4">In addition to the high energetic demands of the dry reforming reaction, it faces operational challenges due to its complex reaction network, which can limit the selectivity of the system towards the desired dry reforming reaction. This deviation from ideal selectivity is observable in the H<sub>2</sub>:CO ratio in the product gas mixture, as well as through the propensity of the dry reforming reaction system to produce solid carbon that leads to catalyst deactivation. The reverse water gas shift reaction (CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> ⇌ CO + 2H<sub>2</sub>O) is thermodynamically favored over the main dry reforming reaction at temperatures below ~700 °C, and leads to the consumption of H<sub>2</sub> and increased production of CO and can lead to H<sub>2</sub>:CO ratios in the product gas mixture of less than 1 (See Supplementary Information: Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>). Similarly, another potential competing reaction is the steam methane reforming reaction (CH<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O ⇌ CO + 3H<sub>2</sub>) which has the potential to consume water produced and increase the H<sub>2</sub>:CO ratio in the product gas mixture. Solid carbon can be deposited onto the surface of the photocatalyst by two main avenues: pyrolysis (CH<sub>4</sub> ⇌ C + 2H<sub>2</sub>) and the Boudouard reaction (2CO ⇌ CO<sub>2</sub> + C), which both consume carbon monoxide and can increase the H<sub>2</sub>:CO ratio in the product gas mixture. The Boudouard reaction is thermodynamically favorable at temperatures below approximately 700 °C, while pyrolysis is the thermodynamically favored pathway at higher temperatures.</p><p id="Par5">To date, a substantial portion of the work on the photocatalytic dry reforming reaction has focused on the development of more advantageous catalyst materials that can serve to alleviate these economic drawbacks. Photocatalyst compositions, including a CeO<sub>2</sub> component, have been particularly dominant in the academic literature surrounding the development of dry-reforming photocatalysts, due to the well-documented ability of CeO<sub>2</sub> to mitigate photocatalyst deactivation by virtue of the Ce<sup>3+</sup>/Ce<sup>4+</sup> redox couple which enables the material to shuttle oxygen through its lattice and oxidize adsorbed carbon species to prevent their accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Several CeO<sub>2</sub>-based thermal dry reforming catalysts have been reported with long-term stability. A table indexing these literature examples and others, along with their performance metrics, is provided in the Supplementary Information (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">In the present work, we demonstrate enhanced photocatalytic dry reforming performance through surface basicity modulation of a Ni-CeO<sub>2</sub> photocatalyst by selectively phosphating the surface of a CeO<sub>2</sub> nanorod support. An optimum phosphate content is observed, which leads to negligible activity loss and carbon deposition over a 50-h reaction period. The enhanced activity is attributed to the Lewis basic properties of the PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup> groups which improve CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption and facilitate the formation of small metal clusters on the support surface, while providing mechanical stability. A hybrid photochemical-photothermal reaction mechanism is demonstrated by analyzing the wavelength-dependent photocatalytic activities. The photocatalyst activities, turnover numbers, quantum efficiencies, and energy efficiencies are shown to be on par with other dry-reforming photocatalysts that use noble metals such as Pt, Ru, or Rh, representing a significant step forward for more economical ignoble nickel-based dry reforming photocatalysts. The challenges associated with comparing photocatalysts reported in the academic literature are also commented on.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Physical and optical properties of the Ni-CeO<sub>2</sub>-CePO<sub>4</sub> photocatalyst</title><p id="Par7">Ni-CeO<sub>2</sub>-CePO<sub>4</sub> photocatalyst samples, whose physical morphology consisted of a nanorod heterostructure comprised of a CeO<sub>2</sub>-CePO<sub>4</sub> backbone decorated with Ni nanoparticles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref> in the Supplementary Information), were prepared with nominal Ni loadings of 10 at.%.

The type of response displayed by the catalytic activity in response to increasing irradiance has been noted to be indicative of the underlying photocatalytic pathway at play<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> An exponential increase in photocatalytic activity with respect to increased radiative flux is likely due to photothermal effects since an increase in reaction temperature is known to produce this Arrhenius-type kinetics (<italic>k</italic> = <italic>A</italic><sup><italic>−Ea/RT</italic></sup>). In contrast, if an incident photon does not increase the temperature experienced by the system, it is possible that the work done to accomplish the surface chemical reaction is done by the photochemically generated electron-hole pair. In this scenario, since the absorption of a photon destined to do photochemistry can be assumed to create one electron-hole pair, or a single value of one of the other excited state modes previously described, a more linear dependence in reaction rate to a radiant flux of photons absorbed by the catalyst is expected. As photon-induced pathways become saturated at a high photon flux, the reaction rate may taper off, resembling a root law dependency. A combination of the two pathways may appear as a supra-linear dependency of the reaction rate on radiative flux.</p><p id="Par21">To probe the nature of the light-induced photocatalytic mechanism, the photocatalytic activity under specific wavelengths of light was measured at varying light intensities, using four LED lamps with light spectra confined to a specific segment of the UV- and visible light spectra (UV, blue, red, and green). For these tests, three of the four LED lamps were held at 100% power while the fourth LED lamp, representing the light wavelength under examination, was then varied over a range of irradiances (See Supplementary Information: Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S8</xref>). This allowed for the observation of the change in photocatalytic activity resulting from an increase in irradiation from that specific wavelength range of light, while considering the interactions that may exist between light-induced pathways, since electronic excitations leading to either photochemical activity or local heating on the catalyst surface occur simultaneously and act synergistically such that the measured activity is likely not a strict superposition of the two effects, and the two effects may not be definitively and quantitatively decoupled, which is an existing issue in the field.</p><p id="Par22">The response in photocatalytic activity with increased irradiance was observed to follow different trends depending on the wavelength being varied, providing insight into the potential photochemical or photothermal nature of the photocatalyst’s response to that wavelength of light. The results shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c–f</xref> indicate that blue light (425–515 nm) and green light (475–600 nm) have the largest impact on the photocatalytic activity, as when they are at 0%, the photocatalytic rate is low, despite the other lamps being held at 100%. In contrast, when the red (575–650 nm) and UV (350–425 nm) lamps are off, the photocatalytic rate is already significant. The corresponding catalyst temperature was observed to increase by the largest amount when the blue light was varied, followed by the UV, green, and red lights. This differed from the increase in rate observed with each wavelength, which increased most as the blue light intensity was increased, followed by the green, UV, then red, further indicating the presence of a mixed photothermal-photochemical activity.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Wavelength dependence of the observed photocatalytic activity.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> Optical absorption spectra for the CeO<sub>2</sub>-CePO<sub>4</sub> support and nickel-loaded samples with varying P:Ce ratio. <bold>c</bold>–<bold>f</bold> Wavelength-specific activities and catalyst temperatures of Ni-CeO<sub>2</sub>-CePO<sub>4</sub> photocatalyst with a P:Ce ratio of 0.65, a reactor temperature of 350 °C.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2023_36982_Fig3_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par23">Modulation in the intensity of the UV light produced a linear change in the observed reaction rate, whereas changing the intensity of the blue light produced an exponential response, the change in the green light produced a concave shape, and the change in red light resulted in a linear response, indicating that the nature of the photocatalytic pathway may differ depending on the energy of the photon absorbed. While it is common in the academic literature to ascribe photocatalytic activity to one of these pathways, it is observed that each is present and contributes to the photocatalytic activity uniquely.</p><p id="Par24">The increase in blue light intensity resulted in an exponential-type response, indicative of a dominant photothermal effect in this region, whereas the response to illumination with UV light appears to be photochemical.

These values were comparable to the Ni-CeO<sub>2</sub>-CePO<sub>4</sub> photocatalyst when run at a higher pressure of 4 atm (TOF<sub>app</sub> = 1.08 × 10<sup>−3</sup> mol m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>) but were not surpassed by the stable 1 atm operation, which displayed a TOF<sub>app</sub> of 5.23 × 10<sup>−5</sup> mol m<sup>−2</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>, although it displayed comparable efficiencies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Catalyst synthesis and characterization</title><p id="Par34">The Ni-CeO<sub>2</sub>-CePO<sub>4</sub> photocatalyst was produced by first synthesizing a mixed CeO<sub>2</sub>-CePO<sub>4</sub> support using an aqueous room temperature synthesis followed by the addition of Ni to the structure using the incipient wetness technique. An amount of Ce(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O (99% pure, trace metals basis) was dissolved into deionized water, and a stoichiometrically appropriate amount of H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (85 wt%) was added to the solution, at an amount that reflects the percentage of the dissolved cerium that is intended to form CePO<sub>4</sub>. Ammonia was then added dropwise until the pH of the solution reached 9. The mixture was then stirred at room temperature for 2 h and aged at room temperature for an additional 24 h. The resulting product solution was then centrifuged and washed with deionized water repeatedly until the pH of the supernatant liquid reached 7. The separated powder samples were then dried at 80 °C in air, and then calcined for 3 h at 450 °C. Ni was loaded onto the support via an aqueous Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> solution using the incipient wetness technique, followed by calcination for 3 h at 450 °C. The samples were then reduced at 650 °C under a 10% H<sub>2</sub>/Ar mixture for 3 h.</p><p id="Par35">Physical characterization of the catalyst material was carried out as follows. An FEI Quanta FEG 250 scanning electron microscope equipped with STEM and EDAX detectors was used to determine the structure and composition of the resulting Ni-CeO<sub>2</sub>-CePO<sub>4</sub> catalysts with varying support compositions. The morphology of the catalyst before and after reduction was examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi HT7700) under 100 kV. An aqueous dispersion of the catalyst was applied to form var-coated 200 mesh copper TEM grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences). X-ray diffraction was carried out on a Bruker D2-Phaser X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation generated at 30 kV. The BET surface area of the samples was measured using a FlowSorb analyzer from Micromeritics. Optical absorbance was measured using a Lambda 1050 UV-vis spectrometer equipped with a 150 mm integrating sphere. Catalyst powder samples were loaded onto borosilicate filter paper for measurement. CO<sub>2</sub> Uptake (adsorption) measurements were performed in a TGA discovery instrument. Initially, each sample was preheated in a CO<sub>2</sub> (20 mL min<sup>−1</sup>) atmosphere at 120 °C to remove any dust, moisture, and impurities from the sample surface for 30 min, followed by a ramp of 30 °C min<sup>−1</sup> up to 400 °C. The sample was then equilibrated until 60 °C and held isothermally for 30 min. During this step, the CO<sub>2</sub> is adsorbed on the surface of the sample and was measured by a mass weight difference. Several cycles of the above procedure were performed to evaluate the stability of the sample under CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.</p><p id="Par36">Quantitative analysis of carbon on the spent catalysts was performed using thermogravimetric analysis. The weight loss was measured by loading the mass in µg of the sample. The sample was oxidized by increasing the temperature to 1000 °C at 10 °C/min under a flow of dry air (3.5 L min<sup>−1</sup>). The amount of coke is calculated from the following equation: (Amount of coke) = (sample weight at 23 °C)- (sample weight at 1000 °C)/(sample weight at 23 °C)</p><p id="Par37">In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) spectrums were collected on a Thermo Scientific iS50 series Fourier transform infrared (FT‐IR) equipped with a liquid nitrogen‐cooled MCT detector, to study the nature of intermediate species formed during the dry reforming reaction over the Ni-CeO<sub>2</sub>-CePO<sub>4</sub> catalyst under dark and light-assisted reaction conditions (10 W white LED irradiation). The catalyst was placed into the holder of a Harrick reaction chamber and pre-reduced at 400 °C under 5% H<sub>2</sub>/Ar flow of 20 mL/min for 30 min, then purged in 20 mL/min Ar gas for 1 h to remove the residual H<sub>2</sub> from the cell and cooled down to different temperatures (30–350 °C). The background spectrum was recorded in Ar at different temperatures. A dry reforming reaction was performed in 20 mL/min of gas mixture (10 sccm Ar + 5 sccm CO<sub>2</sub> + 5 sccm CH<sub>4</sub>) at different temperatures. Each measurement was recorded after 30 min in isothermal conditions and followed by purging in Ar for 30 min to remove the excess water molecules. Spectra were recorded from 4000 to 649 cm<sup>−1</sup> with a step of 1 cm<sup>−1</sup>.</p><p id="Par38">To investigate the magnitude of heating produced by the illumination of the catalyst with light, infrared thermography using a forward-looking infrared camera (FLIR) was carried out to estimate the global temperature of the catalyst bed when illuminated under different light intensities. A thermal imaging camera (Therma- CAM EC320 FLIR) was directed at the sample through the reactor window while it was being simultaneously irradiated with light. For these measurements, the catalyst sample was placed in the reactor at the focal point of the light, the same approximate distance from the light source as within the reactor. The LEDs were focused on the sample. Then, the FLIR camera is pointed at the sample to measure the radiated heat caused by the concentrated light.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Catalytic activity measurements</title><p id="Par39">The laboratory-scale photoreactor used to conduct the experiments presented in this work was comprised of a Harrick HTC-3 High-Temperature Cell fitted with a fused silica window. Pressure in the reactor was controlled by tightening or loosening an in-line diaphragm and monitoring the pressure using an Omega pressure transducer. The catalyst sample is placed on a steel mesh, underneath which is an electrical resistance heater. The temperature setting of the electrical resistance heater is noted as the “reactor temperature” and does not necessarily represent the catalyst temperature under reaction conditions and when illuminated with light. The catalyst sample was illuminated by an array of four Prizmatix LEDs (UV (UHP-T-365-MP), Blue (UHP-T−460-DI), Green (UHP-T−520-DI), and Red (UHP- 625-DI)), as well as a beam combiner. The power output of each lamp can be modulated independently. The power output for each LED was measured using a power meter at the same position as the sample within the reactor. The irradiance produced by the Prizmatix LEDs was measured using a light meter. For the present examples, a nominal flow rate of 10 mL min<sup>−1</sup> was used, with the reactant feed consisting of equal parts CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> (2.5 mL min<sup>−1</sup> each) with a balance of 5 mL min<sup>−1</sup> Ar. The evolution of reaction products was measured using an in-line SRI 8610c gas chromatography.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank our colleagues T.
