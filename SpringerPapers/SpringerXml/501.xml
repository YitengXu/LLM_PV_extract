This isotropic emission corresponds to a significant entropy increase in the solar cell, with a corresponding drop in efficiency. Here, using a detailed balance model, we show that limiting the emission angle of a high-quality GaAs solar cell is a feasible route to achieving power conversion efficiencies above 38% with a single junction. The highest efficiencies are predicted for a thin, light trapping cell with an ideal back reflector, though the scheme is robust to a non-ideal back reflector. Comparison with a conventional planar cell geometry illustrates that limiting emission angle in a light trapping geometry not only allows for much thinner cells, but also for significantly higher overall efficiencies with an excellent rear reflector. Finally, we present ray-tracing and detailed balance analysis of two angular coupler designs, show that significant efficiency improvements are possible with these couplers, and demonstrate initial fabrication of one coupler design.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ResearchSummary"><title><bold>Solar cells: trapping light</bold></title><p id="Par2">A new light-management design could allow single-junction GaAs solar cells to reach power-conversion efficiencies as high as 38%.

However, concentrators do not realize all the potential gains from reducing the angular spread of emitted light because as the sunlight concentration and current density rise increased series resistance and heating degrade the efficiency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup><fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photon entropy in concentrator and angularly restricted systems.

In the Stuart and Hall formalism, we account for parasitic absorption in the radiating modes of the cell to find the expressions given in the supplemental. We note that the expression for parasitic absorption of emitted light is applicable in both the planar and light trapping cases, as radiative emission randomizes the light in a planar cell.

In <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>, we have calculated efficiencies for a 98% reflective rear surface, as is typical for smooth reflective silver coatings.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> While the benefits of limiting emission angle persist, the maximum achievable efficiency is reduced. In contrast to the ideal reflector case, thicker cells now give better performance. This indicates that, despite the high back surface reflectivity, the reduced reflector losses with increased thickness outweigh the increased Auger recombination. While these results demonstrate the feasibility of the scheme, they also indicate the benefits of a highly reflective back surface, particularly for thin cells.</p><p id="Par18"><xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> gives analogous results for a planar, rather than light-trapping, cell geometry. As we expect, thinner cells have lower efficiencies in a planar geometry owing to poor absorption of incident light. Thus, with an ideal back reflector, the light-trapping geometry gives a significant overall efficiency gain, because very thin cells can give full light absorption while minimizing Auger recombination, as EquationÂ (2) indicates. Note that any bulk non-radiative recombination process, such as ShockleyâReadâHall recombination, will scale with thickness as Auger recombination does, allowing for a similar advantage. However, with a non-ideal back reflector, performance is very similar between thick, fully absorbing, planar and light-trapping devices. Thus, when back reflector losses dominate bulk non-radiative processes, the light-trapping geometry allows for much thinner cells but has little effect on maximizing overall efficiency.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Effect of angle restriction in a planar GaAs cell.

While there has been some discussion in the literature about possible strategies for designing such a coupler, we are not aware of designs whose performance has been optically analyzed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> Other than the design of an emission angle limiting coupler, our scheme relies largely on existing technologies, such as tracking and high-quality GaAs cells.

A double close-packed array of cones, separated by a perfect, broadband reflector with small holes at the cone bottoms completes the coupler design. While total internal reflection serves for the relatively collimated incoming light, it will not serve for the isotropically emitted light from the solar cell, thus necessitating the broadband reflector. Unlike a single array of these cone type structures, the double array gives uniform, near normal illumination of the cell, minimizing reflection losses and improving device performance. A similar end to end double CPC structure was used in the COBE satellite measurement of the cosmic microwave background.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> This coupler is naturally broadband, because it functions on ray optics principles.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Coupler designs and performance.

Since this coupler is based on ray optics, it can be built on any scale much larger than the wavelength. To minimize the coupler height, we set the scale so that the reflector openings are in the ray optic limit (4Â Î¼m diameter). As the maximum CPC acceptance angle decreases, narrowing the allowed angles, the optimal height of the cone structure increases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> Thus, to more strictly limit the emission angle, we must either tolerate a thicker coupler structure or truncate from the optimal CPC height.</p><p id="Par22">In <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>, we compare three designs limited to 1Â mm in height. For the design marked 3.7Â°, with the least angular restriction, there is no truncation, while for design with maximal restriction, marked 2Â°, the shape is truncated to approximately 30% of its optimal height. Owing to the large size of the coupler relative to the wavelengths of interest, we analyze the coupler performance using ray tracing with silicon nitride dielectric structures. We see excellent angular cutoff, and a broadband response, as illustrated by the curves for 300 and 870Â nm. For the more truncated designs, the angular cut-off is less abrupt but begins at smaller angles.</p><p id="Par23">The ray tracing results can then be incorporated into the detailed balance calculation. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref> shows currentâvoltage curves for the three different coupler designs on a 250-nm-thick cell with Auger recombination and an ideal back reflector, as well as results for cells with no angularly restricting coupler. We see that the most significantly truncated design performs the best, with a four absolute percent efficiency increase over a thicker cell with no coupler, and a seven absolute percent increase over a no-coupler cell of the same thickness. While there is an approximately 100-mV increase in open circuit voltage, the short circuit current only increases by about 3Â mA cm<sup>â2</sup>, so there should be no significant heating or series resistance effects, as in concentrator systems. Thus, this coupler design could be used to experimentally demonstrate significantly improved performance due to limited emission angle.</p><p id="Par24">In <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4eâh</xref>, we analyze a similar coupler that is easier to fabricate, and show an initial fabrication of the shape <italic>via</italic> two-photon lithography. This coupler has a single, rather than double, array and uses metal coated cups rather than total internal reflection in a dielectric. To limit degradation in device performance, the illuminating holes at the bottoms of the cups should be spaced by a distance equal to or less than the carrier diffusion length, so the coupler CPCâs must have a relatively small diameter while remaining ray optical. Assuming 98% metal reflectivity and neglecting the gaps between cups, ray tracing results coupled to the detailed balance model suggest a significant performance increase despite the short circuit current losses in the metal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par25">Developing a detailed balance model for a thin, light trapping GaAs solar cell with limited emission angle, we have found efficiencies above 38% may be achievable with a single junction solar cell. We identify a regime of efficiencies significantly higher than those previously predicted for realistic cells with limited emission angle by maximizing both light trapping and photon recycling effects. A light trapping geometry, high-quality material, an excellent back reflector and a very thin cell are critical to reaching the highest single junction efficiencies. Furthermore, this design is tolerant to the use of a non-ideal, metallic back reflector and conversion efficiencies above 35% are possible. These results suggest that limiting emission angle with a light trapping GaAs cell could provide a new route to achieving high efficiencies without a tandem or third generation cell. Furthermore, this scheme relies almost entirely on existing technology, with the exception of a low-loss, broadband, angularly specific concentrator. We therefore analyzed two possible coupler designs, found that these couplers could produce significant performance increases, and demonstrated initial fabrication of one design. Thus, we have identified a new regime of very high efficiencies achievable by limiting emission angle, laid out the critical factors necessary to realizing these efficiencies, and considered designs for the angularly restrictive coupler required.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thanks to D Callahan, M Sheldon and J van de Groep for insightful discussions and advice on the manuscript.
