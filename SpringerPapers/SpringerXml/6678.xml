In this work Quinoa seeds have been subjected to air plasma treatments both at atmospheric and low pressure and improvements found in germination rate and percentage of success. Seed water uptake by exposure to water vapor, although slightly greater for plasma treated seeds, did not justify the observed germination improvement. To identify other possible factors contributing to germination, the chemical changes experienced by outer parts of the seed upon plasma exposure have been investigated by X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDX). XPS revealed that the outer layers of the Quinoa plasma treated seeds were highly oxidized and appeared enriched in potassium ions and adsorbed nitrate species. Simultaneously, SEM-EDX showed that the enrichment in potassium and other mineral elements extended to the seed pericarp and closer zones. The disappearance from the surface of both potassium ions and nitrate species upon exposure of the plasma treated seeds to water vapor is proposed as a factor favoring germination. The use of XPS to study chemical changes at seed surfaces induced by plasma treatments is deemed very important to unravel the mechanisms contributing to germination improvement.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_6164.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Coming from the Andes, Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa, Willd) is a native food crop tolerant to high stress conditions such as high altitudes (up to 4000 m.o.s.l.), drought, extreme temperatures, high salinity (40 mS cm<sup>−1</sup>) and sandy soil with very low levels of nutrients. Due to its high nutritional value, associated with a high content of vitamins (B1, B9, C and E) and healthy lipids, Quinoa is deemed a key plant against famine in regions affected by crop failure. Moreover, very likely because its excellent protein amino acid balance very adequate for celiac individuals, Quinoa has become a fashionable food in developed countries where it has reached prices (around 10 euros per kilogram) surpassing that of other cereals. All these features have contributed to gradually spread the Quinoa farming all over the world, even though the development of suitable agricultural practices according to market trends and climate change is still a challenge.</p><p id="Par3">Quinoa seeds are spherical with a mean diameter of 1.4–1.6 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Their outer parts are formed by a two-layered pericarp and a seed coat, which is bitegmic (constituted by a testa and a tegmen) and has a thickness varying between 34 µm for wild forms and 15.85 µm for cultivated ones. Inside, a peripherical curved embryo surrounds a large central perisperm made of starch and covered by integuments. A micropylar endosperm in the form of a cone surrounds the radicle tip. This embryo consists of a characteristic hypocotyl-radicle axis with two cotyledons. Protein and lipid bodies are located in the embryo and endosperm.</p><p id="Par4">Seed germination is a process where a multitude of biochemical changes occur. Germination starts by water uptake, followed by radicular emergency that, for the quinoa in Andean regions, occurs 6–10 h after imbibition when the seed water content increases from 41 to 45%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In the seeds of some species, coat controls germination by acting as a physical barrier that prevents radicle protrusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and imposing a mechanical restraint that interferes in the water imbibition. Thus, environmental conditions may greatly influence seed release rate with high temperatures and long photoperiods favoring the occurrence of dormant seeds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. These conditions are common in Europe, particularly in the South, where they will become more frequent in parallel to the progression of climate change. This will provoke that, in the future, a smaller number of quinoa varieties may be successfully cultured in these regions.</p><p id="Par5">During the last years, different techniques using plasmas have been proposed to improve the germination efficiency of seeds and subsequent plant growth. For example, Park <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> proposed the plasma treatment of the water used to irrigate the seeds as a means to enhance plant growth and to reduce considerably the amount of required water. Similarly, the direct exposure of the seeds to non-thermal plasmas is a relatively modern practice that has been demonstrated rather efficient to accelerate or improve germination of a large number of plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, despite the numerous evidences of germination and plant growth improvement available in literature, a general explanation to account for these beneficial effects of plasma is not yet available. Besides, finding a general explanation for plasma induced germination faces an additional problem in the sense that the term “non-thermal plasmas” encompasses a large variety of plasma procedures with quite significant differences in operational parameters, working pressure, concentration of active species, electron density, magnitude of electrical field, etc. In general, two main factors have been claimed to account for the generally observed improvement of germination (although this result is by no means universal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>): i) increase in the water uptake through a partially etched seed coat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and ii) the sterilization of the plasma treated seeds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Other evidences such as the conversion of the surface state of the plasma treated seeds in hydrophilic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> or the occurrence of coat plasma etching observed by electron microscopy analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> have been also encountered.</p><p id="Par6">In the present work, in addition to classical methodological approaches utilized in the literature to investigate the effect of plasmas on seeds, we propose the use of the X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) to study the surface chemistry of the Quinoa seeds exposed to plasma and then to water vapor to promote their germination. The obtained results evidence that the surface chemistry of these seeds experience great transformations that might be related with the observed increase in germination capacity (for this analysis a seed has been considered as germinated when root and cotyledons emerged). These results have been complemented with other by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (SEM-EDX) that provide both laterally resolved chemical information and the capacity to investigate inner layers of the seed (i.e., embryo, radicle and perisperm). For this study we have used two types of air plasmas: an atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and a low pressure radiofrequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> (RF) plasma. Although differing in treatment time, these two plasma treatments produced an improvement in the germination capacity of the Quinoa seeds and induced similar transformations of surface chemistry after plasma and then water vapor exposures. As a result of these investigations, the segregation of potassium and other mineral elements to the outer zones of the seed and the formation of surface nitrate species during DBD plasma treatment are proposed as possible factors contributing to enhance the germination of the Quinoa seeds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Germination and plasma treatments</title><p id="Par7">A general result of the plasma activation experiments was a germination improvement for the plasma treated seeds with some differences depending on the type of plasma and treatment time. A compilation of percentages of germinated Quinoa seeds as a function of seeding time for increasing periods of plasma treatment times is gathered in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> shows that, in comparison with untreated seeds, those treated with RF plasmas for 10 s experienced an improvement in germination, reaching almost 100% after five days. Plasma treatment times of 60 s produced a germination success rate of 80% after 8 or more days. However, a considerable decrease in germination percentage was obtained for seeds treated for 180 s, indicating that, as found by others, an excess of RF plasma might be deleterious for seed germination (see in supplementary information, Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>, the surface damage induced on seeds that were RF treated for long periods of time)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Plots of germination percentages as a function of seeding time for quinoa seeds plasma treated for the indicated periods of time in the RF (top) and DBD (bottom) reactors.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2017_6164_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par8">Unlike the short treatment times required with RF low pressure plasmas, much longer treatments were required when using DBD plasmas to enhance the germination rate of Quinoa seeds. The compilation of results reported in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> clearly reveals that treatments for 10 s are rather inefficient to increase germination and that treatment times as high as 900 s are required to achieve 100% germination 8 days after sowing. For intermediate plasma treatment times, the germination rates found ranged between those of the untreated seeds and the longest treatment times.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Water uptake</title><p id="Par9">One of the factors proposed in literature to explain the increase in germination rates usually found for plasma treated seeds is an enhancement in water uptake when the seeds are exposed to water vapor or immersed in liquid water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. A first control experiment with untreated seeds immersed in liquid water showed that the weight increase during the first 48 hours followed a sigmoid curve (see supplementary information Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). This evolution suggested a period of rapid uptake between 0 and 5 hours followed by a slower uptake that reached saturation after 48 hours with a maximum water uptake of 165%. A more detailed analysis of the water uptake by the untreated and plasma treated seeds was carried out by exposure to saturated water vapor at room temperature. The results of this series of experiments are reported in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The bar diagrams in this figure reveals that the treated plasma seeds increase their weight by only a slightly higher amount in comparison with the untreated plasma seeds (square dots). Although this result indicates an easier hydration of the plasma treated seeds, the little differences found do not seem sufficient proof to link the increase in germination rate reported in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> with an enhancement of water uptake after plasma treatment.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Relative variation of weight for the untreated and plasma treated seeds as a function of exposure time to water vapor for the indicated periods of time.

This surface sensitive technique provides information about the chemical state of the elements present in the outer layers of the investigated samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> (average depth of analysis of approximately 2 nm). Surface composition in atom percents of the XPS analyzed seeds before and after DBD and RF treatments for various periods of time and for the treated seeds exposed to water vapor are reported in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. In this table, the atomic percentages of the untreated seeds reveal that the surface is rich in carbon, has a certain amount of oxygen and much smaller percentages of nitrogen and potassium. These percentages are similar to those expected for the outer coat of this kind of seeds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The variations in atomic percentages reported in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> prove that the surface chemistry of the pericarp is much affected by both the plasma treatment and the posterior exposure to vapor pressure. Exposure of the original seeds to water vapor for 24 h did not induce any significant modification in surface composition except for a small increase in nitrogen. Exposure of the seeds to the plasma for a short period of time (i.e., 30 s DBD or 10 s RF) induced a significant increase in the content of oxygen and nitrogen in detriment of carbon and a small increase in the content of potassium (c.f., Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A similar increase in the oxygen and nitrogen contents was monitored by SIMS for various seeds exposed to RF air plasmas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. For longer plasma exposure times (i.e. 900 s DBD or 60 s RF) changes were even more drastic with additional increases in the percentages of oxygen, nitrogen and potassium. A first assessment of these changes in surface composition suggests that the air plasma produced an important oxidation of the outermost layers of the seeds as evidenced by the increase in the surface oxygen content after the treatment. This is an expected effect due to the highly oxidative character of the excited species in air plasmas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> (i.e., atomic oxygen (O<sup>*</sup>) as reported by Kuzminova <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> for this kind of plasmas, and very likely other charged species, such as O<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>) and the ozone simultaneously formed during DBD plasma treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Similar surface oxidation effects have been described for different seed grains exposed to RF air plasmas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and for polymers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> graphites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and other carbon reach materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> where affectation thicknesses up to 100 nm have been induced by similar plasma treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Unlike the negligible effect of water uptake on the surface composition of untreated seeds, plasma treated seeds underwent additional changes upon water vapor exposure. According to Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, some potassium disappeared from the surface and the atomic percentage of oxygen varied differently depending on plasma treatment.

Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the series of C1s (including the K2p signal) and N1s XPS spectra that were recorded after various DBD and RF treatments. O1s spectrum was also recorded but its shape and the peaks binding energies (530 eV) was little affected in the curse of these experiments and will not be further discussed here (see supplementary information Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). The C1s/K2p and N1s spectral regions reported in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> provide additional information on the chemical changes affecting the seed surface coats when subjected to the plasma/water vapor experiments. The C1s spectrum of the original sample was characterized by a very intense signal at 284.6 eV attributed to C-C and C-H bonds typical of an organic membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. A small contribution at around 288 eV revealed the presence of C-O (and C-N) functional groups in the analyzed surface layers as expected for a pericarp formed by proteins and other organic macromolecules. According to the C1s spectra of the plasma treated seeds, exposure to plasma produced a progressive increase in the region around 288 eV which we attributed to an increase in the surface concentration of C-OH and C-O-C functional groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, and a significant decrease in the C-C/C-H contribution. This evolution proves the progressive plasma/ozone oxidation etching of the outer layers of the coat, already evidenced by the increase of oxygen atomic percentage reported in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Similar effects in the C1s peak shape are common for organic materials exposed to oxidant plasmas where the said treatments have been claimed to induce surface hydrophilicity both on organic materials and seed surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In addition to this extensive surface oxidation, the C1s/K2p spectra confirm the already mentioned increase in potassium. Tentatively, we assume that the diffusion of this cation from the interior of the seed to its outer layers might be driven by the polar character of the oxidized functional groups formed at the surface upon plasma exposure and/or to changes in surface potential during plasma activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In parallel to these changes, the N1s spectra provide other clues on surface chemistry that might be related with the observed improvement in germination. In the spectra reported in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b and c</xref> there is a common signal at 399 eV that can be attributed to N-H or N-C functionalities present in the macromolecules of a biological membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In addition, another rather intense signal at 406 eV appeared in the spectrum of the seeds treated with the DBD plasma for 900 s (the intensity of this signal depended on treatment time and had very little intensity for RF plasmas). This peak, attributed to the formation of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> and/or NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> functionalities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, disappeared after water vapor exposure, while the component at 399 eV significantly increased. We attribute the formation of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>/NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> groups after air plasma treatment to either the oxidation of the N-H, N-C groups in the organic chains of the coat and/or to the adsorption of NO<sub>x</sub> molecules formed in the air plasma by combination of excited oxygen and nitrogen species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. This latter possibility would be supported by previous results with DBD air plasmas working in ozone mode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> (see method section) showing the production of a certain amount of NO<sub>x</sub>, although in our experiment the amount should be very little or negligible because we were unable to detect either NO<sup>*</sup><sub>x</sub> species in the plasma by optical emission spectroscopy or stable NO<sub>x</sub> molecules by gas analysis (see experimental section and supplementary information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>).

At this low magnification no significant differences could be appreciated in surface morphology before or after plasma treatments. However, the EDX potassium maps showed variation in the distribution of this element as evidenced Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> by changes in the intensity and homogeneity of color distribution. For the original seeds, the comparison between maps a1, b1 and c1 clearly show an increase in color intensity for b1 map (i.e. after 15 min DBD plasma treatment) and a more heterogeneous color distribution in c1 (i.e., after 50 min treatment). It is interesting that these changes could be partially reverted by exposure of the plasma treated seeds to water vapor (see supplementary information Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref>). In line with the XPS results in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, these changes support that plasma treatment promoted the enrichment of potassium at the external layers of the seed (note that the EDX average observation depth is around 1 micron, while for XPS is only 2 nm). The maps taken for sections of the seeds before and after plasma treatments (i.e. a2–c2 and a3–c3) confirm this tendency, as well as a preferential enrichment in potassium at the embryo and the radicle tip (see yellow arrows in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Left) Low magnification SEM micrographs for a Quinoa seed in its original form (top) and for two sections along transversal (center) and longitudinal (bottom) planes.

The chemical nature of these agglomerates is still unknown because no specific compositional features associated to them could be detected by SEM-EDX analysis.

According to Sigstad and Prado<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> water uptake is a first step for germination, a process that concludes with radicle emergence. Qualitatively, the time evolution of water uptake found here for Quinoa (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Supplementary information Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>) follows a similar trend than in the majority of seed germination works. Therefore, in line with these previous studies, we attribute the first period of rapid uptake to a simple wetting of the seed tissues, and the slower final uptake to metabolic causes. Between these two stages no lag phase seems to exist for the case of the rapidly germinated Quinoa seeds (e.g., after 48 hours a 7.1% of seeds had already germinated, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In Chenopodium species in general, and particularly in Quinoa, dormancy is usually attributed to a coat effect that, as demonstrated by Ceccato <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, can be avoided by perforation. These authors also proposed a relation between thickness of the seed coat and dormancy break in different Quinoa accessions.</p><p id="Par18">In the present work we have shown that plasma treatments positively influence germination and extensively affect the external parts of seeds. Our XPS and SEM-EDX results have shown the occurrence of chemical and morphological effects, likely resulting from the etching and damage of the pericarp surface. It seems likely that the observed improvements in germination are linked with the plasma etching of the coat surface (see for example the work of Bellmanm <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>) and/or to other biochemical processes triggered by this etching and resulting in the formation of new functional groups at the outermost coat layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, and the enrichment of minority elements at these external zones. These series of effects would favor water uptake and/or induce the seed diffusion of chemicals beneficial for the germination process. Recent studies (Seashore Paspalum, Andean blueberry and Cinchona pubescens) have shown that soaking different seeds into a nitrate water solution favors germination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. The effect is similar when seeds are soaked in plasma treated water, a procedure well-known to generate nitrate, peroxide and other chemicals in the solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The XPS and SEM-EDX results reported here have shown that the chemistry of the outer coat layers is drastically affected by the plasma and that long plasma treatments promoted the incorporation of oxidized functional groups that, as reported in numerous studies on seed plasma treatments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, must transform the surface state in hydrophilic. In addition, without discarding other possible factors, we propose that the observed surface enrichment in potassium and nitrogen functional groups, particularly NO<sub>x</sub><sup>−</sup> groups, clearly observed after DBD plasma treatments might play a role in the enhancement of germination. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows a schematic of the chemical processes taken place on the seed surface after DBD plasma and water exposure treatments (note that etching and segregation effects observed by SEM are not taken into account here). According to this scheme potassium and NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>/NO<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> species once diffused/formed to/at the surface are removed after water exposure, likely by diffusion to the interior of the seed through the partially etched and oxidized outer layers of the coat membrane. We proposed that diffusion of nitrate functional groups to the interior of the seed may contribute to improve germination in a similar way that for seeds soaked in nitrate rich water. It is likely that plasma treatments enhance this diffusion ability by disrupting the chemical bonds at the large macromolecules forming the outer layers of the seed coat.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic diagram of the chemistry of the seed surface of original seeds (<bold>a</bold>), after treatment with DBD air plasmas (<bold>b</bold>) and posterior exposure to water vapor.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2017_6164_Fig6_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par19">A significant difference between DBD and RF plasma regarding germination is the need of increasing plasma exposure time when using atmospheric pressure plasmas.

In addition, regarding the chemical state after RF plasma, XPS has shown that seeds surface state is similar as far as potassium and carbon are concerned, but differ in the much lower amount of NO<sub>x</sub><sup>−</sup> species formed at the surface after RF plasma treatment, indicating that the contribution of processes as those schematized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> should be much lower or negligible in this case.

The improvements in germination found after these treatments have been related with the occurrence of specific surface chemical transformations due to the plasma treatments and the posterior modifications induced by the exposure to water vapor. Oxidation of the outer layers of the seed coat and pericarp, formation of oxidized nitrogen species and diffusion of potassium (and other mineral elements to the seed coat) are some of the most significant effects induced by plasma treatment. We have concluded that diffusion phenomena for- and back-wards the seed core are favored due to the polar character of the partially oxidized and etched outer surface layers. In particular, we have proposed as a hypothesis that migration of potassium and, when formed, nitrate species to the interior of the seeds upon water vapor exposure contributes to improve the germination of Quinoa. Beyond these particular inferences from the present experiments, another general conclusion of this work is that applying chemical speciation techniques sensitive to the plasma affected outer zones of the seed coat and/or pericarp is essential to unravel the factors contributing to enhance germination of seeds subjected to plasma treatments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Quinoa seeds</title><p id="Par21">Mature seeds were harvested from plants of Chenopodium quinoa, Willd. var. atlas growing in the Vitrosur S.L.U. fields.

Both discharges were operated in a continuous wave mode. The DBD reactor consisted of two parallel-plate circular metal electrodes covered by quartz plates acting as dielectric barriers. Diameter of metal electrodes was 8 cm, while dielectric disc one was 10 cm, avoiding arching formation due to border effects. Inter-electrode distance was fixed at 4.2 mm, and seeds were situated on the gounded electrode (bottom one), as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7a</xref>. The active electrode was connected to a high voltage power supply (Trek, Model PD05034) and a function generator (Stanford Research System, Model DS345).

EDX maps were adquired with a Bruker-X Flash-4010 working at 20 kV (aprox. depth analysis of 1 micron).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank EU-FEDER funds and the MINECO (projects MAT2013-40852-R, MAT2016-79866-R, MINECO-CSIC 201560E055) and RECUPERA 2020 and Junta de Andalucía (project P12-2265 MO) for financial support.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>A.G.-R. and C.L.-S. performed the experiments with the DBD and RF plasma reactors, respectively.
