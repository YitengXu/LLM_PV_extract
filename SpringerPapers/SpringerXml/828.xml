Anthropogenic arsenic contamination of paddy soils exacerbates arsenic toxicity in rice crops resulting in substantial yield losses. Here, we report the identification of the gain-of-function <italic>arsenite tolerant 1</italic> (<italic>astol1</italic>) mutant of rice that benefits from enhanced sulfur and selenium assimilation, arsenic tolerance, and decreased arsenic accumulation in grains. The <italic>astol1</italic> mutation promotes the physical interaction of the chloroplast-localized <italic>O</italic>-acetylserine (thiol) lyase protein with its interaction partner serine-acetyltransferase in the cysteine synthase complex. Activation of the serine-acetyltransferase in this complex promotes the uptake of sulfate and selenium and enhances the production of cysteine, glutathione, and phytochelatins, resulting in increased tolerance and decreased translocation of arsenic to grains. Our findings uncover the pivotal sensing-function of the cysteine synthase complex in plastids for optimizing stress resilience and grain quality by regulating a fundamental macronutrient assimilation pathway.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Contamination of paddy soils can lead to toxic arsenic accumulation in rice grains and low levels of the micronutrient selenium.

Widespread contamination of paddy soils with As due to mining activities and irrigation of As-laden groundwater not only increases As accumulation in rice grain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, but also results in As toxicity in rice plants and substantial yield losses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Worryingly, future climate changes are likely to exacerbate both the problems of As accumulation in rice grain and yield loss induced by As toxicity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. It is therefore important to develop rice crops that are more resistant to As and accumulate less As in the grain.</p><p id="Par4">A key mechanism of As detoxification in plants is via the complexation of arsenite [As(III)] by thiol compounds, such as glutathione (GSH) and phytochelatins (PCs), and subsequent sequestration into the vacuoles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. This mechanism also reduces As translocation to rice grain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The metal(loid) stress-induced production of GSH and PCs is limited by the availability of its precursor cysteine (Cys) in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Cys is synthesized in all subcellular compartments with own protein biogenesis by a two-step pathway: the formation of <italic>O</italic>-acetylserine (OAS) from serine and acetyl CoA catalyzed by serine acetyltransferase (SAT) and the condensation of OAS and sulfide to Cys catalyzed by <italic>O</italic>-acetylserine(thiol)lyase (OAS-TL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This two-step pathway is conserved in bacteria, alga, and higher plants, and serves as a checkpoint for the integration of sulfur, carbon, and nitrogen. The enzymatic functions of three isoforms of OAS-TL (OAS-TL A, B, and C in the cytosol, plastids, and mitochondria, respectively) in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and a cytosolic OAS-TL A in rice have been characterized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Knockout of each of the three isoforms of OAS-TL in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> did not affect growth, because the substrates for Cys biosynthesis can be exchanged efficiently between the cytosol and the organelles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. SAT and OAS-TL form the hetero-oligomeric cysteine synthase complex (CSC), and SAT is active only within this complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The product of SAT, OAS, has a dissociation effect on the CSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, thus providing a feedback inhibition on SAT activity. Synthesis of OAS by SAT is also the rate-limiting step of Cys biosynthesis, whereas the total activity of OAS-TL is in excess of that required for Cys biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The association of the CSC stimulates the SAT activity and thus provides a mechanism for metabolic regulation of Cys biosynthesis by sensing the supply of the carbon/nitrogen-containing precursor OAS and the sulfur precursor sulfide.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we isolated a gain-of-function <italic>arsenite tolerant 1</italic> (<italic>astol1</italic>) rice mutant. We show that <italic>ASTOL1</italic> encodes the chloroplast-localized OAS-TL. Surprisingly, the <italic>astol1</italic> gain-of-function mutation (S189N) inactivates the catalytic activity of OAS-TL by inhibiting OAS binding. We provide direct evidence that the inactive ASTOL1 protein forms a non-dissociable CSC, which permanently stimulates endogenous SAT activity explaining the dominant inheritance of the <italic>astol1</italic> mutation. Uncoupling of the OAS-sensing function of the plastidic CSC from its regulatory impact on SAT resulted in (1) enhanced S uptake and assimilation, (2) increased tolerance to As and (3) decreased As accumulation in rice grain. Moreover, the OsASTOL1<sup>S189N </sup>mutation significantly enhanced the rice grain content of selenium (Se), an essential micronutrient for which up to a billion people worldwide have insufficient dietary intake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Besides the potential biotechnological applications, our findings uncover the pivotal sensing-function of the plastid CSC in the regulation of S and Se metabolism and tolerance to metalloid toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Screening and characterization of the <italic>astol1</italic> mutant</title><p id="Par6">We screened more than 4000 individuals derived from an EMS-mutagenized library of the rice cv.

These results suggest that Ser189Asn mutation does not destabilize the OsASTOL1<sup>S189N </sup>protein but impairs its enzymatic activity.</p><p id="Par14">OAS-TL proteins are highly conserved in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). In particular, the Ser189 of OsASTOL1 is conserved in all analyzed OAS-TLs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). In order to compare the OAS-TL activity of the mature OsASTOL1 and the mutated OsASTOL1<sup>S189N</sup>, we deleted the 87 amino acid residues encoding the transitpeptide and expressed them in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Because AtOAS-TL A has been well characterized in enzymatic analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> and is highly homologous to OsASTOL1 protein (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>), it was applied as a positive control for a canonical OAS-TL enzyme (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Expression of AtOAS-TL A in <italic>E. coli Cys-</italic> auxotrophic strain NK3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, which lacks the cysteine synthase gene and consequently is unable to grow on medium without cysteine supplement, restored its growth in Cys-free medium within 2 days of incubation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12a</xref>). In comparison, expression of OsASTOL1 restored the growth of NK3 strain in Cys-free medium after 7 days of incubation, whereas OsASTOL1<sup>S189N </sup>failed to complement NK3 strain (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12a</xref>). Moreover, the purified mature OsASTOL1 protein clearly displayed OAS-TL activity, but its specific activity was only about 1/4 of AtOAS-TL A (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). In contrast, the mutated OsASTOL1<sup>S189N</sup> displayed no OAS-TL activity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). This is consistent with the complementation assay in NK3 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12a</xref>). Moreover, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis shows that both the OsASTOL1 and OsASTOL1<sup>S189N</sup> were present as dimers as other OAS-TLs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12b</xref>). Furthermore, the replacement of the corresponding Ser102 in AtOAS-TL A with Asn fully inactivated the OAS-TL A<sup>S102N</sup> mutant protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). The protein crystal structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> of AtOAS-TL A indicates that Ser102 is located at the opening of the binding site for the substrate OAS (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13a, b</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">To investigate the role of this conserved Ser, we changed the Ser189 of OsASTOL1 to different amino acid residues by site-directed mutagenesis and determined the in vitro OAS-TL activities of the respective protein mutants (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14a, b</xref>). All mutation alleles lost their enzymatic activity, except OsASTOL1<sup>S189T</sup> that displayed 41% of the ASTOL1 activity (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14b</xref>). Because both the mutation alleles of S189A (a constitutively nonphosphorylable form) and S189D (a mimic of the constitutively phosphorylated form) lost the OAS-TL activity completely, it is unlikely that phosphorylation of S189 is required for the enzyme activity. Thus, we conclude that the conserved Ser189 in OsASTOL1 is crucial for OAS-TL activity, and mutation of this residue in OsASTOL1<sup>S189N</sup> leads to a total loss of OAS-TL activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Loss of OAS-TL activity is irrelevant to <italic>astol1</italic> phenotype</title><p id="Par16">To investigate the causal relationship between the phenotypes of the <italic>astol1</italic> mutation and the OAS-TL activity in the mutant, we generated CRISPR lines and overexpression lines of <italic>OsASTOL1</italic> in the WT background.

In this study, we show that Ser189Asn mutation in OsASTOL1<sup>S189N</sup> serves as a molecular switch in the sulfur assimilation pathway to produce multiple desirable consequences, including increased As tolerance, decreased As accumulation in the grain and increased Se accumulation in the grain. These phenotypes can be explained by improved uptake and assimilation of sulfate and selenate, and the enhanced synthesis of thiol compounds. This reinforced capacity to synthesize PCs allows for improved complexation of As<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, facilitates the vacuolar sequestration of As-thiol complexes and, consequently, reduces As mobility to rice grain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Increased synthesis of thiol compounds is more pronounced in the roots than in the shoots of the mutant, which is consistent with roots being the main tissue for As sequestration. A radioactive <sup>73</sup>As tracer experiment showed that approximately 90% of the arsenite taken up by rice roots is sequestered in the roots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.

The Ser189Asn mutation in OsASTOL1<sup>S189N</sup> specifically impairs its affinity towards the substrate OAS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), but surprisingly does not impact its physical interaction with the SAT5C10 peptide (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). In fact, the CSC complex formed from OsASTOL1<sup>S189N</sup> and SAT becomes much more resistant to the dissociation of OAS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–c</xref>), which may also result from the loss of binding of OAS to OsASTOL1<sup>S189N</sup>. The increased stability of the CSC complex leads to a significantly higher SAT activity in the <italic>astol1</italic> mutants, because SAT is substantially activated in the CSC complex due to release from cysteine inhibition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Because production of OAS is the rate-limiting step, increased OAS drives Cys biosynthesis catalyzed by other isoforms of OAS-TL either in the chloroplast or in the cytoplasm, as proposed in the model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Moreover, OAS is a signaling molecule that can induce the expression of genes involved in S uptake and assimilation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Indeed, several genes in the sulfate uptake and reduction pathway were significantly upregulated in the <italic>astol1</italic> mutants (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). In addition to sulfate, many sulfur-containing metabolites are also increased in the <italic>astol1</italic>(+/−) mutant, indicating that sulfate reduction and assimilation are enhanced (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Increased biosynthesis of OAS, Cys, and other elevated thiol compounds in the <italic>astol1</italic> mutants causes a higher demand for carbon. Consequently, norm light conditions in paddy fields helped the mutants to overcome the imposed challenge for the enhanced synthesis of the diverse carbon and sulfur-containing metabolites. The relatively poor growth of the mutants under low light intensity in growth rooms might be also partially explained by a misbalance of enhanced level of sulfur-containing defense compounds in the artificial absence of stresses, e.g., high light and pathogens, which demand sulfur-containing defense compounds. However, in open paddy fields the potentially defense-primed <italic>astol1</italic>(+/−) mutants performed as well as the wild type, since the wild type was also challenged with environmental cues inducing sulfur-defense metabolite synthesis.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Proposed working model for the regulation of OsASTOL1 in sulfur metabolism in rice.</title><p>Schematic overview of enzymatic reactions (black arrows) and metabolites involved in the sulfur metabolism and its regulatory mechanism.

These effects control the flux of S towards cysteine synthesis in vivo. However, in the <italic>astol1</italic> mutant, the mutated OsASTOL1<sup>S189N</sup> protein is difficult to be dissociated from the CSC by OAS (dotted red line), which results in SAT being constitutively active and producing more OAS.

Taken together, the specific Ser189Asn mutation in OsASTOL1<sup>S189N</sup> enables it to act as a regulatory protein of Cys biosynthesis, even though the mutant protein is inactive as an OAS-TL enzyme. It is remarkable that a single amino acid mutation in OAS-TL can trigger such an overwhelming impact on the uptake and assimilation of the macronutrient sulfur, albeit plastidic OAS-TLs is dispensable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15c–e</xref>). The full conservation of Ser189 in all known plant OAS-TLs suggests that the herein identified mechanism to trigger S and Se accumulation in grains will also be applicable in other plant species. As a proof of concept, we generated an OsASTOL1<sup>S189N</sup>-like mutation in cytosolic AtOAS-TL A (AtOAS-TLA<sup>S102N</sup>), which, indeed, caused the identical biochemical properties as observed in the plastid-localized OsASTOL1<sup>S189N</sup> protein of rice (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16e–i</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">In the reference plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, cysteine synthesis takes place in all subcellular compartments that are capable of protein biogenesis, which is the dominant sink for cysteine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Remarkably, these subcellular compartments are also equipped with a CSC, which is supposed to regulate the OAS precursor biogenesis by controlling the SAT activity in these compartments. Since 80% of total SAT activity is localized in mitochondria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, the mitochondrial CSC is supposed to efficiently regulate cellular OAS synthesis in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.

In contrast to OAS biosynthesis, the S-precursor for cysteine biosynthesis is exclusively generated in plastids in a photosynthesis-dependent manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The uncoupling of the OAS-sensing function of OAS-TL from its regulatory role inside the CSC stimulated sulfate uptake from the soil and its reductive assimilation in plastids significantly. It remains to be shown if the CSCs in other subcellular compartments contribute to the coordination of S-flux into cysteine with translation demand or have distinct features (e.g., coordination with supply of other macronutrients, or coordination with stress responses). The OsASTOL1<sup>S189N</sup> mutation provides a versatile tool to dissect these potential regulatory functions of the individual CSCs in each of these compartments by allowing specific engineering of CSCs at the subcellular level.</p><p id="Par29">In conclusion, our study demonstrates that S assimilation can be effectively controlled by engineering the sensitivity of the CSC against dissociation by OAS, highlighting the physiological importance of the regulatory function of the CSC. Triggering of S assimilation in rice has multiple beneficial impacts on the food security (sustainable growth) and the nutritional value of rice since it enhances the tolerance of rice towards arsenic and heavy metals, and positively affects Se content but limits As content of grains. The key to optimization of the beneficial traits is to adjust the balance between the wild type like and the OsASTOL1<sup>S189N</sup>-like OAS-TL protein, as too much-mutated protein had a deleterious effect on plant growth possibly through disturbance in the balance between C, N, and S metabolism.
