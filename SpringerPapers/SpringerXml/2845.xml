The development of new and renewable forms of energy that emit less CO<sub>2</sub> may not materialize quickly enough or at a price point that allows people to attain the standard of living they desire and deserve. As a result, a parallel path to sustainability must be developed that uses both renewable and clean carbon-based methods. Hybrid microgrids are promoted to solve various electrical and energy-related issues that incorporate renewable energy sources such as photovoltaics, wind, diesel generation, or a combination of these sources. Utilizing microgrids in electric power generation has several benefits including clean energy, increased grid stability, and reduced congestion. Despite these advantages, microgrids are not frequently deployed because of economic concerns. To address these financial concerns, it is necessary to explore the ideal configuration of microgrids based on the quantity, quality, and availability of sustainable energy sources used to install the microgrid and the optimal design of microgrid components. These considerations are reflected in net present value and levelized energy cost.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">HOMER was used to simulate numerous system configurations and select the most feasible solution according to the net present value, levelizied cost of energy and hydrogen, operating cost, and renewable fraction.

Energy is critical in modern society, and conventional fossil fuels are rapidly depleting because of rapid industrialization and population growth. Notably, fossil fuels such as gasoline, natural gas, and coal used to generate electricity have contributed significantly to global climate change, affecting millions of people daily. Additionally, the 2015 Paris climate change summit emphasized the importance of all countries decreasing carbon emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Fossil fuel depletion, environmental concerns, and the dangers associated with nuclear energy all compel the international community to embrace renewable energy (RE) sources, primarily the isolated mode in nonelectrified areas where grid extension is costly. Otherwise, the intermittency of renewable resources is managed.</p><p id="Par46">The exponential rise in global energy demands and the utilization of conventional energy resources are the primary reasons for the extreme increase in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The most efficient way of solving this problem is to utilize RE resources such as solar photovoltaic (PV), wind, and hydro or combine conventional and RE resources. Using hybrid systems such as PV and wind energy is viewed as complementary. These hybrid energy systems fulfill energy demands with the least GHG emissions and contribute to the global cause of environmental protection. The utilization of solely RE resources for energy generation is a better option, but the high prices of renewable systems are making this option unsuitable for places such as the Middle East, where fuel prices are much lower than those in other areas, and using hybrid systems is viable in this area. H<sub>2</sub> technology has acquired increased popularity in recent years as a result of the advancement of fuel cells (FCs) and is anticipated to have a bright future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The use of H<sub>2</sub> to energize FCs indicates that H<sub>2</sub> outperforms diesel generator systems, which are typically utilized for long-term storage. FCs constitute a low-maintenance, high-performance, emission-free technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. H<sub>2</sub> can be created via electrolysis and stored in H<sub>2</sub> tanks; this is referred to as RE storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The H<sub>2</sub> tank, as an energy storage system, captures extra energy via the electrolyzer and injects it into the FC to compensate for generation shortfalls. The addition of FC to hybrid RE systems reduces the BT size, increases the BT lifespan, and enhances the overall system performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Thus, regarding RE systems, whether stand-alone or grid-connected, the primary difficulty is scaling the system components and developing an effective energy management strategy (EMS) that meets the intended objectives without jeopardizing system performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In other words, component size and EMS are the primary determinants of the RE system's operational and start-up expenses.</p><p id="Par47">Hybrid microgrid systems (HMGs) have become critical for rural electrification. Numerous studies (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]) have investigated and proposed a hybrid renewable energy system (HRES). These studies provide all the required information for designing isolated HRESs. The authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] discuss the design and financing of a microgrid on the tiny island of Koh Jik. HOMER software application was utilized to gain insight into the techno-economic environment. Similarly, lead–acid and lithium-ion battery technologies were compared regarding their impact on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and renewable portions.</p><p id="Par48">The authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] provide an overview of the characteristics of energy system models and the available tools for optimizing multi-energy systems. The authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] provide an overview of new optimization techniques for addressing operational costs and minimizing overall network losses. The authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] provide an overview of system optimization and energy management strategies for PV, wind turbine, and fuel cell energy sources. Another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] describes the development of microgrids in seaport areas. Similarly, the authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] provide an overview of the fundamental difficulties surrounding HRES adoption and a study of the various RE sources that can be combined in isolated and grid-connected modes. The authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] present a study of HRES design optimization methods, limitations, and battery types. Finally, the authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] created a cost-effective microgrid system for the Saudi Arabian city of Yanbu. Their design uses the optimal microgrid configuration while minimizing net present cost (NPC) and LCOE under certain technical conditions such as the probability of power supply failure and the availability index. The author of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] proposes a novel application of the equilibrium optimizer (EO) for designing a hybrid microgrid to supply electricity to Dakhla, Morocco, a remote area. EO was chosen to design the microgrid system due to its high effectiveness at quickly determining the optimal solution. EO is utilized for the purpose of determining the optimal system design that minimizes cost, increases system stability, and covers the load under a variety of climate conditions. The results indicate that the proposed EO achieves the optimal system design, with RE sources (PV and wind turbine [WT]) accounting for 97% of the annual contribution and EO exhibiting fast convergence characteristics. The best NPC, LCOE, and LPSP are achieved through EO at $74,327, $0.0917/kWh, and 0.0489, respectively. The author of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] used a microgrid to serve a load installed in a remote area of Saudi Arabia's Aljouf region using a social spider optimizer (SSO) to determine the optimal size of a HRES integrated microgrid (MG) consisting of PV solar panels, WT, a battery, a diesel generator (DG), and an inverter. With a cost of energy (COE) of $0.1349/kWh and a LPSP of 0.01714, the proposed SSO provides the optimal architecture for a HRES integrated microgrid.</p><p id="Par49">This current study is conducted to investigate and select the best hybrid energy generation system in the region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), where the main target is the least carbon emissions while maintaining economic viability and producing hydrogen. Different system configurations are considered in this study to find the optimal energy generation system with a total generation capacity of approximately 1 GW. KSA generates more electricity than any other country in the Middle East, with an estimated 362 terawatt hours in 2019, roughly the same as in 2018. From 2000 to 2015, power generation increased at an average annual rate of 6%, but growth slowed significantly as the population grew. Economic growth slowed from 2016 to 2018; energy efficiency and demand-side management measures were implemented, and electricity prices increased.</p><p id="Par50">According to data from BP's Statistical Review of World Energy 2021, power generation fell by 1% in 2020 due to the economic slowdown brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Due to pandemic-related lockdowns and restrictions, residential energy consumption increased, but commercial and government electricity sales decreased. KSA currently has a generation capacity of 79.67 GW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and electricity demand continues to grow at a rate of 3000 megawatts per year. In comparison to other countries, this annual growth rate is relatively high. Currently, the cost of producing electricity is $0.10/kWh, and the average price of electricity is approximately $0.03/kWh. The question here is whether the low prices are subsidized or simply low prices. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), governments spend fuel subsidies to keep fuel prices lower than the cost of production for their citizens. Government funds cover the difference between prices and costs. These continuous high price subsidies impose an economic burden on the government. Thus, integrating RE resources with the current power generating system can be an excellent solution because they consume no fossil fuel, which eliminates the need for subsidies. As a result, a great deal of the costs could be saved as they would not be consumed as subsidies. RE power systems have high initial costs, but return this initial investment with free green energy generation for many years. KSA, in general, is an excellent location for solar energy. KSA receives approximately 250 w/m<sup>2</sup> of solar radiation annually, nearly double the amount received in most of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This also equates to 105 trillion kWh per day or roughly 10 billion barrels of crude oil in energy terms.</p><p id="Par51">Solar energy is booming due to Saudi Vision 2030s economic diversification plans. KSA has committed to installing 27.3 GW of RE by 2023, the majority of which (20 GW) will be solar PV, while the remaining 7.3 GW will be wind and concentrated solar power (CSP). By 2030, solar PV, wind, and CSP will total 40 GW, 16 GW, and 2.7 GW, respectively. This target corresponds to approximately 32% of the current peak power consumption in KSA (estimated at 61.743 GW in 2018). This high level of solar generation is possible due to the significant decrease in the cost of solar PV technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition to the ambitious renewable plans, KSA is building its first green hydrogen plant, which is expected to cost SR19 billion ($5 billion). The plant will be located in Neom—the planned city being constructed in the Tabuk province of northwestern KSA—and powered by 4 GW of wind and solar energy; it is scheduled to begin production in 2025 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">Microgrid design and power management are examined in this article for five configurations—generator–PV–wind–battery, generator–wind–battery, generator–PV–battery, generator–battery, and generator only—to supply an isolated area in KSA’s Yanbu region. A load of around 1.2 GW is taken to generate constant 1 GW while compensating for power system and transmission losses. The grid was not integrated as we aimed to have a 100% RE system with the least carbon emissions, and we also wanted to generate hydrogen through pure RE. The load-following strategy was used in the paper as a control strategy. The primary objective aimed for in this paper is to minimize NPC while considering technical constraints such as the integration of solar PV, wind, or a combination of both into a conventional diesel power plant to create a generating system with the least carbon emissions. In this work, we aim to study the feasibility of using an integrated RE system and traditional power plants to find the optimal system configuration. The system configuration with the highest renewable penetration and minimum fuel consumption is selected as the best system. The overall performance of the optimal system configuration can be enhanced further by utilizing any excess energy generation that is not consumed by the load into hydrogen production, thus increasing the overall system efficiency and reliability.

The sector's emissions must be significantly reduced even as demand for electricity increases as other sectors transition from fossil fuels to electricity to reduce their carbon emissions. Since 2008, the power sector has been decarbonizing at an average annual rate of 3% due to increased generation from natural gas, wind, and solar. Under a business-as-usual scenario, electricity generation is projected to increase by 24% by 2050. Decarbonizing the power sector requires a multifaceted approach that may include a continued substitution of zero- or low-emission energy sources, continued improvements in end-use efficiency, increased grid flexibility and storage, and continued use of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) in the remaining fossil fuel-based generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions from the U.S. electric power sector were 1447 million metric tons (MMmt) in 2020, accounting for approximately 32% of total U.S. energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of 4575 MMmt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].

Moreover, it presents a strong case for green hydrogen adoption, given that the country has abundantly available land and a high capacity factor for the deployment of renewable energy. This renewable energy can be used for clean hydrogen generation, supplying consumers with clean or low-carbon electricity. The decrease in renewable energy costs may also impact the costs of green hydrogen. In addition, hydrogen gas can be utilized as a fuel in transport vehicles or as a feedstock for industrial processes. Ammonia can also be generated from this clean hydrogen which Saudi Arabia can then export with global green hydrogen demand. The cost of green hydrogen and blue hydrogen are influenced by the costs and efficiency of electrolysis and carbon capture technology, respectively.

This article discusses the design and implementation of three hybrid microgrid systems in the Yanbu region. The NPC for this project is $10.6 billion, and the LCOE is $0.155/kWh while LCOH is $25.6/kg H<sub>2</sub>. Different system configurations are analyzed in the study to find an optimal system with the least GHG emissions and least costly parameters. The PV–WIND–GEN–ESS–FC–HL system configuration is selected as the optimal system configuration with better environmental and economic benefits than any of the others considered in this paper. This study reveals that optimum configuration can generate up to 32,132 tons of hydrogen per year (tH<sub>2</sub>/year), and 380,824 tons per year of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can be avoided. By 2030, 10% of installed capacity (250 GW) is expected to be converted to hydrogen fuel, resulting in an annual increase in hydrogen demand of 120–170 million tons. Compared to today's hydrogen consumption of 70 million tons per year, the enormous potential of the future hydrogen market is apparent.</p><p id="Par122">Future work's primary focus will be developing and implementing novel optimization algorithms and microgrid system configurations that incorporate efficient algorithms and effective power management aids in creating a cost-effective microgrid system with hydrogen production and CO<sub>2</sub> capturing facilities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>AA designed the analysis, collected the literature, processed the data, and wrote the manuscript.
