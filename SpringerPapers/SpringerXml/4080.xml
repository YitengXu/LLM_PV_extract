Herein, the transcriptomic changes in a model microalga, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, in a high-CO<sub>2</sub> milieu (20%) are evaluated. The primary toxicity mechanism consists of aberrantly low expression of plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (PMAs) accompanied by intracellular acidification. Our results demonstrate that the expression of a universally expressible PMA in wild-type strains makes them capable of not only thriving in acidity levels that they usually cannot survive but also exhibiting 3.2-fold increased photoautotrophic production against high CO<sub>2</sub> via maintenance of a higher cytoplasmic pH. A proof-of-concept experiment involving cultivation with toxic flue gas (13 vol% CO<sub>2</sub>, 20 ppm NO<sub>X</sub>, and 32 ppm SO<sub>X</sub>) shows that the production of CO<sub>2</sub>-based bioproducts by the strain is doubled compared with that by the wild-type, implying that this strategy potentially enables the microalgal valorization of CO<sub>2</sub> in industrial exhaust.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Microalgae used for CO<sub>2</sub> removal in an industrial exhaust gas stream usually has low CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance.

To address the issues caused by increasing anthropogenic emissions, various carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies have been developed for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. Microalgae-based CO<sub>2</sub> conversion, <italic>inter alia</italic>, is considered one of the most promising and self-sustainable technologies because the relevant CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration process (i.e. photosynthesis) can be directly and entirely powered by solar energy and the level of productivity is significantly greater than that obtained with other biological technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The wide range of product portfolios is another merit of this platform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Despite their promising potential, the low tolerance of microalgae to high concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> is one of the crucial thresholds that precludes the real-world application of microalgae for CO<sub>2</sub> removal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In particular, this issue of CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance becomes more serious if phototrophic microalgae cultivation occurs in concert with an industrial exhaust gas stream, which is the most economically and energetically efficient biological process for removing CO<sub>2</sub> from air based on a life-cycle perspective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> because the proportion of CO<sub>2</sub> in waste streams is commonly higher than 10%, a level that can significantly inhibit algal growth and unavoidably deteriorate the biological CO<sub>2</sub> conversion efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. According to previous investigations, severe cytoplasmic acidification has been considered the principal reason for the impaired cell reproduction rate observed under high concentrations of acidic gas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In recent decades, various efforts have been attempted to overcome the fatal weaknesses of microalgae. For instance, several microalgal species have been newly isolated from native environments, and studies have indicated that these species may be able to thrive under very high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, the selection process is time-consuming and laborious, and these algae hold low economic potential compared with other competitive strains due to insufficient information on the strain characteristics and a lack of species-tailored gene modification tools, which could block further strain improvements. Adaptive laboratory evolution approaches for improving the ability of algae to withstand high CO<sub>2</sub> environments through gradual acclimation have been performed and represent efficient methods, but the arduous and lengthy processes involved in this strategy are also problematic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. As an alternative, tolerance-enhancing trials based on genetic engineering represent a game-changing technology with a high potential to confer unprecedented improved tolerance, which can alleviate high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration-derived acid stress. However, limited successful cases have been reported, and the tolerance enhancement effect has only been verified under moderately high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (5% CO<sub>2</sub>), which is too low to directly address industrial exhaust gases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Therefore, CO<sub>2</sub>-tolerant microalgal cell lines and relevant strain improvement methods must be developed to expedite the realization and valorization of microalgae-based CO<sub>2</sub> reduction technologies and products. Here, we show a genetic engineering-based strategy to improve the CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance of microalgae that could be broadly applied to various species. Based on the results of the transcriptional profiling of a model microalga, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, under extremely high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, we identify the genetic principle of CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance. We demonstrate that the overexpression of a single PMA gene resulted in greater than two-fold increases in the algal biomass and lipid productivities by directly converting flue gas containing CO<sub>2</sub> and various acidic gases. We show that this strategy improves the microalgal CO<sub>2</sub> fixation performance, lowers the biomass production cost, and eventually contributes to the establishment of profitable microalgae-based CO<sub>2</sub> conversion technologies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Transcriptome landscaping during high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions</title><p id="Par6">We first performed an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based transcriptome analysis of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> under extremely high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (i.e. a 20% CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched condition) to investigate its cellular response to a high CO<sub>2</sub> environment and identify a gene candidate that could augment CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In addition, transcriptome profiling of algae grown in a CO<sub>2</sub>-independent acidic environment (i.e. pH value of 5.0) was also carried out. The stress-imposing conditions were determined according to the results from preliminary condition screening experiments to determine the exposure levels of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sup>+</sup> that reduce the algal growth rate by 50% (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The RNA-seq analyses were then performed using six biological replicates of each condition (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Because H<sup>+</sup> is known to play a key role in CO<sub>2</sub> poisoning under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions and decrease the viability of algal cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), the latter analysis was conducted as a benchmark to potentially elaborate the H<sup>+</sup>-related CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance mechanisms even though they are unlikely to share the exact same genetic response mechanism (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>, and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The assay of the specific growth rate under several high CO<sub>2</sub>-mimicking conditions (i.e. conditions with CO<sub>2</sub>-independent low pH and a high concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); details are provided in Supplementary Note 1) indeed suggested the existence of subtle differences in the cellular responses to acidic conditions depending on the presence and absence of CO<sub>2</sub>. The results showed that the decrease in the pH of the extracellular environment caused by high CO<sub>2</sub> levels could be a minor toxic factor, although it was not the only direct cause of the reduced cell viability. This finding strongly implies that the interaction between intracellularly absorbed CO<sub>2</sub> and cellular activity would aggravate intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) acidification and thereby amplify the toxicity (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Namely, CO<sub>2</sub> intoxication seemed to be synergistically caused by an influx of H<sup>+</sup> from the acidic extracellular space as well as the intracellular generation of H<sup>+</sup> via CO<sub>2</sub> hydration (facilitated by the activities of cellular enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrase; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Notably, the toxicity of high [DIC], which could be accompanied by high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions and trigger dose-dependent stresses, such as osmotic pressure, was also evaluated, but the analysis revealed that it was not a toxic factor.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Transcriptome landscapes of the CO<sub>2</sub> intolerant algal species <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> (WT) exposed to extremely high CO<sub>2</sub> (20%) and low pH (pH 5.0) conditions.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Growth of the WT strain under high CO<sub>2</sub> and low pH conditions.

In this context, the modulation of HSP expression is also an important response during acclimation to high CO<sub>2</sub>-derived acidic conditions since the denaturation and aggregation of key proteins (i.e. enzymes) by excessively generated H<sup>+</sup> negatively contribute to cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Overall, 3867 and 1487 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; log<sub>2</sub>fold change (FC) &gt; 1, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) were identified from the high CO<sub>2</sub> and low pH sets, respectively. Among these DEGs, 15.9% of the significantly upregulated and 18.1% of the downregulated genes in the high CO<sub>2</sub>-treated cells were commonly found in the low pH-treated cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">1</xref>). These overlaps indicate that the algae may manage high CO<sub>2</sub>-derived stress in a similar but not equal manner to counteract the stress attributed to low pH condition, and this conclusion is likely because the two inhibitory conditions may not exert identical toxic effects on the cell, as was experimentally revealed in this study (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">Prior to the detailed inspection of individual gene expression levels, a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis was performed to extract and identify the biological processes (BPs) that are sensitively regulated in response to high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. From the 55 enriched GO terms, diverse modes of cellular responses for enduring the high CO<sub>2</sub> condition were determined (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">2</xref>). Among the upregulated gene clusters under the high CO<sub>2</sub> condition, GO-BP terms associated with the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (GO:0019725, GO:0006873, GO:0030003, and GO:0055082) were enriched, which may be attributed to heightened cellular efforts for minimizing the radical change in the intracellular condition caused by the extracellular condition. The enrichment of GO-BPs relevant to carbohydrate metabolism (GO:0044262, GO:0016051, and GO:0034637) was likely a response to the increased cellular activities against the high concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> because carbohydrates are known to not only help adjust the intracellular osmotic pressure but also act as protective agents for maintaining cellular homeostasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Additionally, under the high CO<sub>2</sub> treatment, protein and amino acid metabolism-related GO-BP terms (GO:0006520, GO:1901605, GO:0009072, GO:0006551, GO:0009100, GO:0006528, GO:0030163, GO:0006511, GO:0019941, GO:0044257, and GO:0051603) were also found to be overrepresented, which was likely due to the activated cellular responses related to catabolizing proteins and amino acids that may lead to the production of NH<sub>3</sub> and the reduction of intracellular H<sup>+</sup> through deamination and decarboxylation, respectively, both of which are widely known as pivotal cellular mechanisms for microbial resistance to intracellular acidification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">Subsequently, the expression levels of the tolerance-related essential genes were assessed to verify the response behavior of the genes individually and to predict the detailed genetic cause of the low tolerance of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> to high concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> by comparing the purported cell responses with the actual gene expression patterns (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">3</xref>). As expected, a majority of essential genes that constitute the CCM were significantly downregulated (16 out of 21 investigated genes) under extremely high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions as a counteraction to the increased environmental DIC concentration. Because an increased extracellular DIC concentration can trigger a series of reactions that ultimately results in excessive endomembrane acidification by the accelerated inward flux of DIC species and their intracellular hydration, which promotes additional generation and accumulation of H<sup>+</sup> in the cytoplasm, this gene regulation seems to be an example of a cellular endeavor against high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Countertrends were found for CAH2, RHP1, and RHP2, and the plausibility of this hypothesis has been previously validated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Interestingly, although the expression of CCM genes has been known to be mainly influenced by the external CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, our findings showed that many CCM components (CAH1, CAH4, CAH5, HLA3, LCIA, CCP1, CCP2, LCID, and LCIE) expressed in response to low pH conditions showed similar patterns (i.e. downregulated) to those found under the high CO<sub>2</sub> condition, which likely indicates that several CCM genes are also related to the response to CO<sub>2</sub>-independent low pH conditions. Regarding the determinants of cell components, the expression of key enzymes involved in controlling the composition of the cellular membrane appears to be regulated under extremely high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. For example, upregulated expression was observed for SQD3, which contributes to a decrease in the membrane fluidity of the cell envelope by increasing the composition ratio of saturated membrane lipids. In addition, the results showed increases in the expression levels of Cre08.g365950, Cre08.377300, Cre12.g521650, and DGTT1, which are responsible for converting unsaturated lipids in intracellular and plasma membrane (PM) regions into triacylglycerol (TAG), a typical energy storage sink synthesized under various stress conditions. Consequently, these responses may inhibit the entry of H<sup>+</sup> into the cell, which decreases passive proton influx and eventually leads to stress evasion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Additionally, as expected, under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, various HSPs from a wide range of HSP subfamilies were highly expressed. These increases in the expression levels of stress-inducible molecular chaperones may contribute to the turnover and refolding of proteins that are denatured and aggregated by excessive H<sup>+</sup>-derived oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, a higher expression of a number of building blocks for ATP synthase was also observed under harsh conditions. In particular, mitochondrial ATP synthase-associated (ASA) proteins, such as ASA1, ASA3, and ASA4, which are involved in the dimerization of ATP synthase, showed 1.93-, 1.59-, and 1.63-fold upregulation (all <italic>p</italic> values were less than 0.01), which in turn can result in increased ATP synthesis activity of the ATP synthase complex<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. These changes may correspond to cellular activity to increase ATP synthesis because acidic conditions lead to the consumption of ATP for the operation of H<sup>+</sup>-pumps and the activation of ATP-dependent HSPs, among other processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">Under extremely high external CO<sub>2</sub>, the CO<sub>2</sub>-intolerant species <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> struggles to maintain its cytosolic neutrality by dynamically modulating genes associated with CCM, cell composition modification, protein recovery, and ATP synthesis in addition to previously elucidated CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance mechanisms. In contrast, the gene expression of H<sup>+</sup>-pumps (e.g. PMAs, vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase – V-ATPase, and H<sup>+</sup>-pyrophosphatase)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> profiled under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions reveals that H<sup>+</sup> sequestration from the cytoplasm to the extracellular region or contractile vacuole does not seem to be adequately regulated (i.e. not significantly upregulated) in the microalga, which is clearly different from previously reported expression trends observed with acid- and CO<sub>2</sub>-tolerant microalgal species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Rather intriguingly, a decrease in the expression of the PMAs – PMA2 (Cre10.g459200; slightly downregulated) and PMA3 (Cre03.g164600; highly downregulated with statistical significance) – was observed under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, which is an important finding because PMAs play a crucial role in life support during exposure to various acidic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The reproducibility of the gene expression results at the transcriptomic and translational levels under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions was verified by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6a–c</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), respectively, which implies the mRNA-protein expression correspondence and, at the same time, suggests that the downregulation can directly influence the congenital low tolerance. Although their distinctive functions have not yet been explicated, PMA2 and PMA3 are two PMA proteins identified in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> with a sequence similarity of 47.4%, and both of these proteins have highly conserved regions that are generally found in well-characterized PMAs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">Since PMA is a key and primary molecular workhorse located at the forefront of the cell and responsible for adjusting the intracellular H<sup>+</sup> concentration by pumping out H<sup>+</sup> into the extracellular region, which results in controlling the pH<sub>i</sub> and generating an electrochemical gradient to offer an H<sup>+</sup>-mediated driving force for various secondary transport proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, the atypical expression of PMAs under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions may limit the discharge of excessive H<sup>+</sup> out of the cell, which would lead to undesired H<sup>+</sup> accumulation, even more acidification of the intracellular region, and disruption of the proton gradient for nutrient and ion transport. All of these changes can inhibit normal cell propagation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Therefore, we conjectured that the CO<sub>2</sub> intolerance of the alga can be attributed to insufficient expression of PMA genes and the concomitant low ability of the cell to extrude the excessive H<sup>+</sup> generated under external CO<sub>2</sub> conditions. We thus hypothesized that the overexpression of PMAs would improve the CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance of the alga by increasing proton efflux and improving the ability of the alga to maintain its endomembrane pH at near neutrality even under high CO<sub>2</sub> environments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Construction of microalgal strains with high CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance</title><p id="Par12">To augment the CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> by compensating for the low expression of H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, the overexpression target was a typical PMA, i.e. plasma membrane H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase isoform 4 (hereafter referred to as PMA4) from <italic>Nicotiana plumbaginifolia</italic>, and its features have been well characterized and successfully expressed in various bioplatforms, such as other plants and yeasts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. If this pump can be activated in algal systems, the exogenous gene expression strategy can provide several merits. Because of its host-independent property, the expression of PMA4 holds the potential to be a versatile approach for various microalgal species suffering from stagnant H<sup>+</sup> extrusion and consequent CO<sub>2</sub> intolerance, which is a general but critical issue that interferes with the practical application of microalgae-based CO<sub>2</sub> conversion technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

The transgenic cells were named PMA4ΔCter-V4 and PMA4ΔCter-V10 according to the order of their isolation. Due to the lack of an efficient homologous recombination method for <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, the inserted gene was randomly intercalated into the genome. Gene insertion leads to disruption of the original genome sequence, which can impact transgenic cell phenotypes. To clarify the cause of the phenotypic changes (<italic>vide infra</italic>), insertion site analysis was performed on the isolated strains by next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based whole-genome sequencing using HISAT2 software (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>; see Supplementary Method 2 for details). In the PMA4ΔCter-V4 strain, only one insertion site was identified in chromosome 7, and this mutation deleted 23 base pairs (bps) from the genome and disrupted a predicted protein-encoding gene (Cre07.g331114). In PMA4ΔCter-V10, one inserted gene was also found on chromosome 6. During the insertion process, an approximately 5.5-kbp truncation of the genome occurred, and three protein-encoding genes, tail-specific protease 2 (TSP2; Cre06.g265850), a predicted protein (Cre06.g265900), and dynein heavy chain 3 (DHC3; Cre06.g265950), were unintentionally lost. The insertion site revealed by NGS was visually confirmed by PCR using appropriate primers (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">c</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Given the annotations of the disrupted genes (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) and previous reports on their functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, it is unlikely that the gene deletion events directly affected the ability of the transgenic strains to maintain their pH<sub>i</sub> against acid-derived CO<sub>2</sub> stress, which implies that the phenotypic modifications described below are generally not associated with the lost genes but rather caused by exogenous PMA expression. Following this analysis, the expression of the inserted gene was confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>) using a designed primer set (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and Supplementary Method 3), and the successful transcription of mRNA encoding PMA4ΔCter-V in the transgenic strains was confirmed by cDNA amplification. Moreover, no expression of PMA4ΔCter-V was detected in the wild-type (WT) strain. The expression of the protein of interest was then verified by Western blotting, and a band at approximately 130 kDa (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>), which is located near the expected molecular weight of the PMA4ΔCter-V protein (120.81 kDa; estimated from its sequence), was visualized only with the transgenic strains when the same amount of protein is loaded (i.e. 20 μg), which reveals PMA overexpression properly occurred in the mutants (see Supplementary Method 4 for details)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par15">In addition to molecular-level expression tests, whether the protein is expressed in the intended subcellular part (i.e. PM) should be determined before evaluating the cellular performance because the protein must be localized appropriately before it can pump H<sup>+</sup> into extracellular space<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The localization of the protein was examined with the aid of a fluorescent tag protein (i.e. mVenus) (see Supplementary Method 5 for details). For precise fluorescence comparison, a transgenic microalgal cell line expressing only mVenus (referred to as V8) was constructed using a separate insert cassette (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8d</xref>) as a fluorescence reference strain. The integration of the transgene was genotypically verified (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8e</xref>). First, the quantitative fluorescence of the cell lines was estimated by flow cytometry using BD Accuri<sup>TM</sup> C6 Plus software and Flowjo software (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). The results showed that mVenus expression induced significant shifts in the fluorescence peaks toward a higher intensity in the transgenic algal strains, including PMA4ΔCter-V4, PMA4ΔCter-V10, and V8 (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9e</xref>). Subsequently, the localization of the fluorescence source in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> was specified by confocal microscopy. The image-based assessment visually demonstrated that bright fluorescent proteins were preferentially concentrated near the PM of PMA4ΔCter-V4 and PMA4ΔCter-V10, whereas no notable concentration of fluorescence in the specific subcellular region was detected in the WT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9f</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">i</xref>). This result indicated that the chimeric protein was successfully situated at the targeted position, namely, the PM, and ensures that the minimum requirement for proper protein function was met. In the fluorescent reference strain, V8 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9i</xref>), a strong fluorescence signal was observed throughout the cytoplasm, which suggested that the fluorescent proteins were floating freely without showing any specific localization. Compared with the fluorescent reference strain, the PMA-expressing cell lines exhibited relatively weak fluorescence, which can be primarily explained by the C-terminal truncation-derived lower stability and higher turnover of the expressed protein, as reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Another possible reason is that the protein expression level may not be that high because excessive protein expression can be harmful to the host, and in particular, excessive expression of PMA proteins can impose a huge burden on cells and consequently adversely affect their viability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Either way, the pump protein was deemed to be sufficiently expressed at the posttranslational level to confer tolerance to H<sup>+</sup>-related stresses without having a notable negative influence (<italic>vide infra</italic>). To further corroborate the localization of the protein, the fluorescent tag protein was probed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the PM-enriched fraction isolated with the two-phase partitioning method.

The evaluation of the pH tolerance of the algal cells was conducted under two independent cultivation modes: mixotrophic and autotrophic conditions. For the mixotrophic culture of the facultative autotroph, acetic acid was applied as an organic carbon source. At a pH value of 5.5, the transformed cell lines showed a clear difference in growth performance compared with the WT cells. In particular, under mixotrophic cultivation at pH 5.5 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref>), the proliferation rate of the WT cells was significantly stunted, and the productivity of the transgenic strains was high, which indicated that the acid tolerance of the mutants was successfully augmented. Because the growth of the transgenic strains at this low pH was comparable to that at neutral pH (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11a</xref>), this constitutive PMA overexpression strategy did not appear to have a negative effect on the cells. In the photoautotrophic acidic cultivation, the exogenous PMA-expressing mutants also exhibited a relatively improved growth performance under the same acidity (pH 5.5) but did not show a dramatic growth difference compared with the results obtained with the corresponding mixotrophic culture (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10b, c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11b, c</xref>). This trophism-dependent growth performance difference can be ascribed to the fact that the membrane-permeable weak acid protonated acetate (i.e. acetic acid), which was added to create the mixotrophic conditions, may exacerbate intracellular acidification by generating additional H<sup>+</sup> in the microalgal cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. In this context, the acetic acid-supplemented pH 5.5 environment can inflict markedly higher levels of acid stress on the cells than a medium with an identical pH but without acetic acid, and this higher stress will eventually lead to the apparently dramatic difference in tolerance observed between the two different carbon regimes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11a</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">c</xref>).

According to the entire batch culture result, eventually, the WT showed 0.66-fold decreased maximum biomass production while exhibiting 1.09-fold increased productivity under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (by Day 6) compared to those under ambient CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (by Day 17) during reaching their maximum cell growths (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11c</xref>). The higher productivity is mainly attributed to the relatively shorter cultivation period because of the rapid cell death by high-CO<sub>2</sub> stresses. However, the slight increase would be hardly meaningful in terms of the CO<sub>2</sub> removal because the autotrophic growth rate that is not correspondingly increased against the elevated supply of CO<sub>2</sub> to the algal culture, inevitably causes the generation of unfixed CO<sub>2</sub>, which significantly lowers the overall CO<sub>2</sub> reduction efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Moreover, the dramatically reduced maximum cell density would also be unfavourable from the same point of view, because the final biomass concentration is one of the most influential factors affecting the economic feasibility and energetic efficiency — which is intimately related to the net CO<sub>2</sub> removal ability of CO<sub>2</sub> conversion processes — from the life-cycle perspective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par18">On the contrary, the transgenic microalgal strains exhibited noticeable improvements in any photosynthetic production metrics, including maximum biomass productions and rates, even in a culture system to which an extremely high level of CO<sub>2</sub> was provided. Their maximum biomass productions were considerably above that found for the WT strains under identical CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, and 3.22- and 3.03-fold improvements were found for PMA4ΔCter-V4 and PMA4ΔCter-V10, respectively (upper panel of Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The accumulative productions and the rates of the transgenic strains under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (by Day 7) were also much higher (rather 1.12- and 1.09-fold improvements in the accumulative biomass productions and 2.77- and 2.62-fold improvements in the productivities for PMA4ΔCter-V4 and PMA4ΔCter-V10, respectively) than those under ambient CO<sub>2</sub> conditions (i.e. autotrophic pH 7.0) (by Day 17) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11c</xref>), which illustrates that the PMA-expressing mutants can even beneficially utilize excessive CO<sub>2</sub> while attenuating the intracellular acidification effect. This growth improvement also indicates that the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation obtained with each mutant during the culture period was substantially improved compared with that found for WT under conditions with high CO<sub>2</sub> provision (lower panel of Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). In terms of the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, PMA4ΔCter-V4 and PMA4ΔCter-V10 showed 3.23- and 2.99-fold increased R<sub>CO2</sub> values compared with the WT strain, respectively, during their exponential growth phases when their effective CO<sub>2</sub> fixations occur (between Day 2 and 6). Taken together, this tolerance improvement strategy raises the mutants’ maximum biomass concentrations during a shorter culture period under high CO<sub>2</sub> supply conditions and improves their CO<sub>2</sub> removal rates and efficiencies, all of which are requisites of microalgal strains for efficient CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration and economically feasible CO<sub>2</sub>-derived product productions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par19">In parallel to the growth assessment, the per-cell basis photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution of the cell lines exposed to high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions was evaluated (see Supplementary Method 6 for details). Consistent with the productivity data, the high CO<sub>2</sub>-grown WT strain exhibited a lower gross photosynthetic rate (i.e. O<sub>2</sub> evolution plus dark respiration) than the WT strain cultivated under ambient conditions (approximately 50.4% decrease), which implies that the algal photosynthetic apparatus was severely impaired by the high CO<sub>2</sub> condition. In contrast, the PMA4ΔCter-V4 and PMA4ΔCter-V10 strains grown under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions showed increased photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution rates in comparison to those found during growth under atmospheric conditions (approximately 58.6% and 37.3%, respectively) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Based on observations from previous reports and the results of this study, this excess CO<sub>2</sub>-related photosystem impairment is likely the primary reason for the growth retardation observed in the presence of high levels of CO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Moreover, the increased O<sub>2</sub> evolution observed with the transgenic cells is attributable to the activation of oxygenic photosynthesis-related enzymes under tolerably high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions to facilitate biological CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation, as has been well documented<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Thus, <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>, which is a congenitally CO<sub>2</sub>-intolerant microalga, became resistant to high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions via PMA expression and its activated core machinery for photosynthesis was thereby able to generate an increased amount of oxygen.</p><p id="Par20">To probe whether PMA expression indeed improves photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution and biomass productivity by providing cells with the ability to maintain their pH<sub>i</sub> near neutrality, we next monitored the time-lapse cytoplasmic pH changes after high CO<sub>2</sub> treatment using a membrane-permeable pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, BCECF, AM (2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5 (6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester) (see Supplementary Method 7 for details)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. To eliminate the background signal, including the autofluorescence of the cells (for all strains) and the fluorescence of the fluorescent probe (i.e. mVenus for the transgenic algal lines), from the fluorescence of interest emitted by the pH<sub>i</sub>-sensitive dye, the pH<sub>i</sub> of each algal strain was calibrated independently (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>). Consequently, the WT strain showed a dramatic decline in their pH<sub>i</sub> during 2 h of exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub> (a median pH<sub>i</sub> value of 6.56), whereas the transgenic cell lines showed a better ability to robustly maintain a near-neutral pH<sub>i</sub> under acidic conditions (median pH<sub>i</sub> values of 6.65 and 6.78 were obtained for PMA4ΔCter-V4 and PMA4ΔCter-V10, respectively) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>), which demonstrates that high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions largely affect the viability of microalgae by lowering the cytosolic pH and that PMA expression in algae results in a positive response to CO<sub>2</sub>-derived intracellular acidification. Given that the photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> fixation system and O<sub>2</sub> evolution machinery are highly sensitive to the pH and CO<sub>2</sub> conditions of the surroundings as well as to the cytosolic and subcellular pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, the differences in the ability of the cells to maintain their pH<sub>i</sub> under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions appear to be the fundamental cause of the tolerance gap between the WT and transgenic strains.</p><p id="Par21">In the final stage of the cell performance characterization, we investigated the H<sup>+</sup> pumping ability of the algal cells determined by the activity of ATPase on the PM region to determine the CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance conferred to the mutants by exogenously expressed PMA via the H<sup>+</sup> extrusion function of the cell. This ability was comprehensively evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. In the in vitro ATPase activity test, the PM fraction-enriched protein sample, which is identical to that isolated for assessment of its localization (i.e. ELISA), was used (see Supplementary Method 8 for details)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. As expected from the results of the previous performance tests, PMA4ΔCter-V4 and PMA4ΔCter-V10 exhibited approximately 2.5- and 2.6-fold higher ATPase-mediated ATP hydrolysis performance than the WT strain, respectively, which demonstrates that the transgenic strains have substantially higher H<sup>+</sup> translocation activity in their PM regions than the WT strain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). The greater ATPase activity in the mutants could cause higher ATP consumption, which may lead to additional energetic costs associated with the exogenous ATPase. However, given algal growth under neutral conditions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11a, c</xref>), the viability of the algal cells was not significantly affected. An in vivo assay was performed to confirm the algal H<sup>+</sup> extrusion performance at the cell level and the direction of the H<sup>+</sup> flux using a chemical pH indicator, bromocresol purple (see Supplementary Method 9 for details). The colourimetric assay visually demonstrated that the H<sup>+</sup> flux was appreciably improved in the PMA-expressing mutants, as can be inferred from the color change on the perimeter of the cells caused by the expelled H<sup>+</sup> and the accompanying extracellular acidification (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>), and this result also provides direct evidence of the outward flux direction of H<sup>+</sup>, namely, from the intracellular region to the exofacial space, and hints that the H<sup>+</sup> pumping protein was properly localized and oriented as desired. On balance, the data clearly show that the expression of the H<sup>+</sup>-pump imbued the algal transformants with markedly improved H<sup>+</sup> efflux and an augmented ability to maintain their pH<sub>i</sub> against factors causing severe intracellular acidification (e.g. membrane-permeable organic acids and CO<sub>2</sub>); thus, the algae showed enhanced tolerance to extremely high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Directly utilizing coal-fired flue gas for fuel production</title><p id="Par22">To estimate the real-world practicality of the engineered algal strain as a CO<sub>2</sub>-derived biofuel production platform<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, we grew the PMA4ΔCter-V4 strain, which showed remarkable productivity under the high CO<sub>2</sub> level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), in the presence of actual coal-fired flue gas discharged from the Taean thermal power station complex unit 5 boiler of Korea Western Power Co., Ltd.

We observed that PMA4ΔCter-V4 exhibited a markedly improved phototrophic growth rate than the WT strain (2.28-fold higher) and beneficially converted the high concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> included in the noxious gas stream. The increased biomass productivity in the transgenic algal strain led to the enhancement of other essential parameters, including the microalgal CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rate (by 2.23-fold), total lipid productivity (by 2.21-fold), total fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) productivity (by 4.68-fold), and calorific productivity (by 2.20-fold) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>, and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>).

Due to the lack of comprehensive analyses of the mechanisms underlying the intolerance of microalgae, previous approaches only focused on resolving the incidental causes of vulnerability; thus, the resulting improvements did not meet the requirements for practical applications with various types of industrial flue gas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, we thoroughly inspected the global gene expression patterns of microalgae in response to extremely high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions using the model microalga <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> to specify the immediate reason for its susceptibility to acidic gas. The investigation revealed that the representative intolerant species exhibited a relatively low expression level of the core H<sup>+</sup> pumping system, which is inconsistent with the previously reported response mechanisms to high CO<sub>2</sub>-derived stress observed in CO<sub>2</sub>-tolerant microalgae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Notably, PMAs, which regulate the pH<sub>i</sub>, were rather downregulated (PMA2 was slightly downregulated and PMA3 was significantly downregulated); thus, we postulated that aberrant expression of the H<sup>+</sup>-pumps is the main factor for the ongoing intracellular acidification, which ultimately leads to a severe decline in cell viability. The reason for the unpredicted gene expression levels may not be clearly explained only by the investigations performed in this study, but one speculation — regardless of the exterior acidity (i.e. both high CO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>-independent low pH conditions impose acidic stress on the cell), the expression of the PMA genes in the CO<sub>2</sub>-intolerant alga is always negatively regulated by the abundance of extracellular CO<sub>2</sub> as if the genes are constituents of CCM – could provide evidence of the condition-dependent gene expression patterns detected in this study (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">b</xref>). A possible dependence of PMA expressions on the extracellular CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations was also suggested by a recent comprehensive proteomic study of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The results showed that PMAs (both PMA2 and PMA3) of the alga may be subordinate to the CCM and intimately interact with its core elements (e.g. HLA3 and LCI1). Since the gene regulation of CCM and its components is heavily influenced by the external CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, the functional relevance exhibits the possibility of an effect of exterior CO<sub>2</sub> on PMA expression. However, additional studies are needed to precisely conclude the association of the two machineries (i.e. the H<sup>+</sup>-pump and carbon concentrating system). In parallel, characterization of the distinctive biomolecular properties of algal PMAs, such as their putative 14-3-3 protein-independent autoinhibitory mechanisms, merits further study to provide a better understanding of the proteins and furthermore the organism, which would ultimately facilitate the greatest use of the microorganism’s potential abilities (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">As predicted from the transcriptomic analysis, we introduced a typical PM-bound H<sup>+</sup> transporter, whose expression is initiated by a strong constitutive promoter to enable continuous PMA expression with the low possibility of intervention by the host’s gene expression controlling mechanisms (e.g. CCM, <italic>vide supra</italic>), into congenital CO<sub>2</sub>-susceptible microalgae to ameliorate the intolerance problem and rigorously verified the characteristics of the generated transgenic microalgae. The WT strain showed a reduced autotrophic growth rate under high CO<sub>2</sub> conditions compared with that under ambient conditions, which may be attributed to its high CO<sub>2</sub>-labile pH<sub>i</sub> property and the resulting damage to its photosynthetic activity. In contrast, the CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance of both mutant strains was clearly augmented, which resulted in markedly increased biomass productivity even under harsh conditions by facilitating H<sup>+</sup> efflux, thereby reinforcing the pH<sub>i</sub> maintenance ability and contributing to the activation of oxygenic photosynthetic apparatuses in combination with sufficient DIC from the surroundings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. In the proof-of-concept experiment, microalgal biofuel production using a coal-fired flue gas with a high level of CO<sub>2</sub> was investigated, and the engineered algal strain exhibited over twofold increases in CO<sub>2</sub>-originated biomass and biofuel productivities without any process intervention, which may negate the reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> efficiency of the overall system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. These findings demonstrate the applicability of microalgae as a practical platform for the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> in the flue gas to produce diverse sustainable products. Strain improvement technology can mediate the utilization of highly cytotoxic waste streams as a fully serviceable carbon source for microalgal cultivation and will thus aid the use of microalgae as a biological platform for practical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction.</p><p id="Par26">In addition to the environmental benefit, the enhanced tolerance and resulting improvements in biomass and lipid productivity can contribute to promoting the economic feasibility of microalgal systems, including the realization of the price of biofuel. According to previous studies, 2.28- and 4.68-fold increases in biomass and biodiesel-convertible lipid (i.e. FAME) productivities could result in 58.6% and 74.3% decreases in the biodiesel cost, respectively. These decreases can be approximated from the estimation that the productivities and resulting biofuel costs are anticipated to decline by exponential factors of 1.07 and 0.88, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The upgraded productivities will undoubtedly serve as a catalyst for lowering the production cost of microalgal biofuel in various forms, expanding the market base of biofuel, and ultimately valorizing the overall microalgal industries. The need to use closed cultivation systems (i.e. PBRs) for biocontainment to prevent undesired dissemination of genetically modified (GM) microalgae to the environment and the resulting increase in production costs can be a concern. Even though the cultivation of GM algae in open environment does not seem to be accompanied by greater environmental risks than expected, public concerns are not negligible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Therefore, PBR systems should be inevitably exploited for the cultivation of GM algae. In fact, according to an extensive techno-economic analysis study of microalgal cultivation, PBRs can be used as equipment for moderating the price of products in the near future with ongoing technical developments. Their use obviously ensures better photosynthetic efficiency and shorter light paths, which are key parameters lowering the production costs of biomass. These properties eventually contribute to improving the economic feasibility of the process by counterweighting the costs related to the installation and operation of PBR<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. In addition, considering the goal of the cultivation — practical CO<sub>2</sub> reduction with phototrophic microalgal culture — PBRs constitute the most suitable platform for serving the purpose of enabling intensive bioconversion of CO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, harnessing well-designed and cost-effective PBR systems may simultaneously guarantee thorough containment of GM organisms, efficient CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and high biomass productivity while securing economic competitiveness.</p><p id="Par27">We found that the expression of exogenous PMA is beneficial for algae because it significantly improves their tolerance to acidic conditions (i.e. low pH and high CO<sub>2</sub>) and does not compensate for growth under neutral pH conditions. The simple structure of PMAs — i.e. the protein comprises a single polypeptide — seems to play a pivotal role in successful PMA expression and concomitant tolerance enhancement without burdening the transgenic cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. By virtue of this structural property, it is likely that the desired augmentation was directly achieved by overexpression of a single protein unit. In contrast, straightforward tolerance enhancement would have been quite challenging if the overexpression target was a gene encoding a subunit of a multisubunit H<sup>+</sup> pumping protein such as V-ATPases. Since such proteins are congenitally composed of several subunits and normally function only when the complex is well organized with the proper quality and quantity of subunits, a possible approach that involves the overexpression of several specific subunits would lead to protein malfunction due to abnormal subunit assembly and ultimately thwart the improvement attempt<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. A strategy that aims at overexpressing an entire protein complex (i.e. individual overexpression of an entire subunit) could also be problematic because multigene overexpression may impose an enormous genetic burden on the transgenic cell line. Despite the expected difficulty and intricacy, uncovering the V-ATPase function in CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance remains an interesting topic for future work because V-ATPases are also known to play an important role in the maintenance of the pH<sub>i</sub> against extracellular acidic conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par28">Another advantage of this strategy is that the single H<sup>+</sup>-pump can be universally expressible in various organisms and causes a dramatic increase in the algal CO<sub>2</sub> tolerance. Thus, this simple but highly effective improvement strategy is likely applicable to multiple algae and not limited to a particular species. In particular, the ability to enhance robustness will be greatly effective for programmable microalgal chassis because potential cell factories can be easily transformed to photoautotrophically produce various CO<sub>2</sub>-derived sustainable products by additional transformation but are generally unable to tolerate environmental stresses at practical levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>.

Mix RM-5 (all of which were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were adopted as the FAME reference standard. Helium and a mixture of hydrogen and high purity air were used as the carrier gas and fuel gas for FID, respectively. The GC operation conditions were as follows: injected volume, 1 μL; split ratio, 1:50; inlet temperature, 250 °C; detector temperature, 280 °C; and oven temperature, maintained at 50 °C for 1 min, increased to 175 °C at a rate of 25 °C min<sup>−1</sup>, increased to 230 °C at a rate of 4 °C min<sup>−1</sup>, and maintained at 230 °C for 5 min<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. The evaluation of calorific value (in LHV) of the biomass was performed using a 5E-C5500 automatic bomb calorimeter (Changsha Kaiyuan Instruments, China).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Statistics and reproducibility</title><p id="Par41">The replicates of all experiments were indicated in the corresponding figure legends. The results are represented as the mean values and error bars, which show the standard deviations of the mean (mean ± SD). Where necessary, a two-tailed Student’s <italic>t-test</italic> was conducted to determine whether statistically significant differences existed between the mean values of the two groups. In the analysis of RNA-seq data, the genes with |log<sub>2</sub>FC|&gt; 1 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 were considered DEGs. The statistically significant differences were determined by the generalized linear model (GLM) likelihood ratio (LR) test. Overrepresented GO terms were determined based on a cutoff value of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 using Fisher’s exact test method. The pH<sub>i</sub> values of the engineered strains and WT control strain were compared with box and whisker plots to demonstrate the median values, maximum and minimum points, and interquartile ranges. Gel and blot images, including PCR and immunoblotting results, were obtained from a single replicate. In quantitative analysis of protein expression levels, comparison among the protein samples is performed within the same gel. Confocal images were acquired from three biologically independent samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Reporting summary</title><p id="Par42">Further information on research design is available in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM7">Nature Research Reporting Summary</xref> linked to this article.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful for the funds provided by Korea Carbon to X R&amp;D Center (2020M3H7A1098295) and the National Research Foundation (NRF-2019R1A2C3009821 / NRF-2020R1A5A1018052) of the Ministry of Science and ICT of Korea.
