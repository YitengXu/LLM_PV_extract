For instance, concerns about market and policy responses that could lead to new lock-ins, such as investing in liquefied natural gas infrastructure and using all available fossil fuels to compensate for Russian gas supply cuts, may hinder decarbonization efforts. Here we review energy-saving solutions with a focus on the actual energy crisis, green alternatives to fossil fuel heating, energy saving in buildings and transportation, artificial intelligence for sustainable energy, and implications for the environment and society. Green alternatives include biomass boilers and stoves, hybrid heat pumps, geothermal heating, solar thermal systems, solar photovoltaics systems into electric boilers, compressed natural gas and hydrogen. We also detail case studies in Germany which is planning a 100% renewable energy switch by 2050 and developing the storage of compressed air in China, with emphasis on technical and economic aspects. The global energy consumption in 2020 was 30.01% for the industry, 26.18% for transport, and 22.08% for residential sectors. 10–40% of energy consumption can be reduced using renewable energy sources, passive design strategies, smart grid analytics, energy-efficient building systems, and intelligent energy monitoring. Electric vehicles offer the highest cost-per-kilometer reduction of 75% and the lowest energy loss of 33%, yet battery-related issues, cost, and weight are challenging. 5–30% of energy can be saved using automated and networked vehicles. Artificial intelligence shows a huge potential in energy saving by improving weather forecasting and machine maintenance and enabling connectivity across homes, workplaces, and transportation. For instance, 18.97–42.60% of energy consumption can be reduced in buildings through deep neural networking. In the electricity sector, artificial intelligence can automate power generation, distribution, and transmission operations, balance the grid without human intervention, enable lightning-speed trading and arbitrage decisions at scale, and eliminate the need for manual adjustments by end-users.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Energy saving</kwd><kwd>Energy

purification, communication, and others (Kalt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2019</xref>; Vahidi and Sciarretta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR236">2018</xref>). Global population and economic expansion have contributed to increased energy use over time. The efficiency of energy end-use services has gradually improved due to technological advancement and energy efficiency legislation. Nevertheless, this improvement has not always been adequate to offset the increase in demand for energy services, such as the production and consumption of commodities. In addition, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has caused an energy crisis that has directly affected the heating, cooling, and transportation energy costs of households. In 2021, the European Union imported over 45% of its gas and nearly 40% of its total gas consumption (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2022a</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Indirectly, this crisis has increased the prices of additional goods and services across global supply chains. In addition to the current energy crisis, the predominant source of carbon dioxide emissions, the primary greenhouse gas responsible for global warming, is the widespread use of fossil fuels to produce energy (Farghali et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2022</xref>). Therefore, scholars and decision-makers generally agree that carbon neutrality by the middle of the century and other climate targets outlined in the Paris Agreement can only be achieved by gradually reducing global energy demand to a sustainable level as well as using negative emissions technologies.</p><p id="Par4">Energy savings from energy efficiency and conservation offer additional co-benefits and contribute to national energy supply security and climate change mitigation. These include reducing local pollution, enhancing business competitiveness, lowering household energy costs, boosting productivity, enhancing occupant health in buildings, and helping to lower energy poverty. A change in the behavior and way of life of energy end-users is required to achieve additional energy savings by reducing the need for services, which goes beyond investments in energy efficiency technologies, given the stringency and urgency of the climate target and the current global increase in energy demand. Energy performance criteria for vehicles, appliances, buildings, and financial incentives for new technology, and others have historically been the primary targets and promoters of energy efficiency innovations, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Strategy for energy saving. The review discusses current and new policies that address energy sufficiency and conservation, including progressive home appliances, buildings, and vehicle standards. First, the energy crisis and the potential of renewable energy as providing energy sources are examined. Second, we discuss how to save energy from buildings and vehicles, as well as the uses of electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles in energy saving. Lastly, we identify the role of artificial intelligence in maximizing energy efficiency and achieving significant savings across multiple sectors</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10311_2023_1591_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par5">In 2016, the combined building and transportation industries of the European Union consumed over 652.1 million tons of oil equivalent, accounting for more than 60% of total energy consumption (European-Environmental-Agency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2018</xref>). Reducing energy usage and increasing efficiency in these two sectors is crucial for achieving the European Union’s 2050 roadmap goals, which require an 80% reduction in overall emissions from 1990 levels. Therefore, the review examines current and potential policy instruments to promote energy sufficiency and conservation, including progressive home appliances, buildings, and vehicle standards. The review also examines the energy crisis and explores the potential of renewable energy sources to address it. It focuses on how energy can be saved in buildings and vehicles, including the use of electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. In addition, the review investigates the role of artificial intelligence in assisting energy saving initiatives in various industries. Furthermore, case studies of successful energy saving initiatives and technical solutions for energy storage are included in the review. The overall scope of the review encompasses a comprehensive strategy for optimizing energy consumption and lowering emissions in the building and transportation sectors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Current status of the energy crisis</title><p id="Par6">Energy is one of the most crucial aspects of modern society, powering economies, transportation, and daily life. Over the years, the world has relied on various energy sources, including coal, oil, natural gas, and renewable sources like wind, solar, and hydro. However, as the global population continues to grow, energy demand has increased, leading to an energy crisis that has far-reaching impacts on the environment, economy, and society. In addition, the Russian invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 abruptly ended the recovery in global energy consumption after the pandemic-caused decline in 2020. This invasion also stoked inflationary pressures and slowed economic growth. Market tensions were present before Russia invaded Ukraine but have been significantly exacerbated. This has caused energy prices to fluctuate and spike sharply, especially for natural gas in European markets, and the threat of further supply disruption looms large.</p><p id="Par7">Renewable energy growth has done well despite this unrest. As a result of the crisis, many nations have had to reevaluate their needs for energy security. The crisis has shattered energy relationships with Russia that were based on the premise of trust and reliable supplies. The energy trade and investment landscape are being profoundly recast due to this. It has already sparked several actions to enhance energy security, such as funding for developing domestic manufacturing capacity in essential industries. One important open question is whether the current crisis will speed up energy transitions or whether a confluence of unstable economic conditions and hurried policy decisions will cause momentum to slacken (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2022b</xref>). Record-high fossil fuel prices and rising emissions provide compelling arguments for reducing or eliminating our reliance on these fuels. In addition, concerns about energy security might encourage renewed investments in the infrastructure and supply of fossil fuels. The impact of various policy options is taken into account in this outlook.</p><p id="Par8">In 2021, following the war, the European Union imported over 380 million cubic meters of gas per day, equivalent to around 140 billion cubic meters, from Russia via pipeline. In addition, 15 billion cubic meters of liquefied natural gas were also delivered. These imports from Russia accounted for about 45% of the European Union’s gas imports and nearly 40% of its total gas consumption in 2021 (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2022b</xref>). The European Union is confronted with an additional challenge in this unsettling situation. This challenge is the potential disruption of natural gas imports from Russia. As a result of this disruption, the security and affordability of the bloc’s energy supply are seriously threatened, causing Member States to make plans for a sharp decline in gas demand by late 2022 (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">2023</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">The prices of many fossil fuels fell to their lowest levels in decades due to the historic decline in global energy consumption in the early months of the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. The price rebounds, however, have been incredibly swift since mid-2021. After briefly falling in 2020, oil prices have since rebounded to around or above $100 per barrel. In 2020, the worldwide energy supply was 584,523,552 EJ (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), while energy consumption accounted for 400,819,444 EJ in 2020 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). The cost of coal has risen to record levels. On an energy-equivalent basis, spot natural gas prices in Europe have routinely exceeded $50 per million British thermal units, more than twice the price of crude oil. Due to tight gas and coal markets, electricity prices have been unusually high in many markets. The global energy crisis has had a negative impact on individuals, businesses, and entire economies around the world.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Worldwide energy supply from 1990 to 2020. In 2020, the global energy supply was 584,523,552 EJ, of which 29.47% was derived from oil, 26.80% from coal, 23.68% from natural gas, 9.84% from biofuel, and 5.21% from renewables (<bold>a</bold>). Additionally, energy consumption accounted for 400,819,444 EJ in 2020 (<bold>b</bold>), with 30.01% used by industry, 26.18% by transport, 22.08% by residential, 7.92% by commercial and public services, 2.15% by agriculture, and 1.77% for other uses. <italic>Source</italic>: (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2022c</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2023</xref>) used a global multi-regional input–output database and detailed household expenditure data to model rising energy prices’ direct and indirect impacts on 201 expenditure groups across 116 countries. Through various energy price scenarios, they found that household energy costs would increase by 62.6–112.9%, resulting in a 2.7–4.8% increase in household expenditures. Energy cost burdens varied across household groups due to differences in consumption patterns, supply chain structure, and energy needs. The escalation of living costs may potentially push an additional 78 million to 141 million people into extreme poverty. To alleviate the energy crisis, targeted energy assistance can support vulnerable households with a particular focus on necessities such as food.</p><p id="Par11">The energy crisis, including economic, political, and environmental factors, significantly impacts society. One of the most visible impacts is the high energy cost affecting both developed and developing countries, which has a ripple effect on the economy. For instance, transportation costs have risen due to high fuel prices, leading to higher prices of goods and services. This, in turn, leads to inflation and reduced purchasing power for consumers, thus impacting the economy negatively. Moreover, energy is critical in various industries, including manufacturing, agriculture, and construction. Therefore, the energy cost directly impacts production, reducing business profit margins. This, in turn, can lead to reduced investment, lower growth, and higher unemployment rates.</p><p id="Par12">The energy crisis has had far-reaching impacts on the environment. Where over-reliance on fossil fuels, which are finite resources, has led to increased greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. The combustion of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases, trapping heat in the atmosphere and leading to global warming (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2022</xref>; Farghali et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2022</xref>). Moreover, the extraction and transportation of fossil fuels have also led to environmental degradation. For instance, oil spills have destroyed marine life and ecosystems, while coal mining has resulted in soil erosion, deforestation, and air pollution (Worlanyo and Jiangfeng <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR247">2021</xref>). The environmental impact of the energy crisis is not limited to fossil fuels but also extends to renewable energy sources. The construction of wind turbines and solar panels can lead to habitat destruction, soil erosion, and pollution, impacting the environment negatively (Osman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">2022a</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">The energy crisis has had significant social impacts, particularly in developing countries. The lack of access to energy, particularly electricity, has reduced many people’s quality of life (Cantarero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>). For instance, lack of electricity limits accesses to modern healthcare, education, and communication, hindering social and economic development. Moreover, the energy crisis has also led to social inequality, with marginalized communities often having limited access to energy resources. In some developing countries, people rely on biomass, such as wood and charcoal, for cooking and heating, leading to deforestation and health issues. The energy crisis has also led to the displacement of communities, particularly in areas with high energy demand. For instance, the construction of hydroelectric dams has led to the displacement of indigenous communities in many parts of the world (Osman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">2022a</xref>). In Africa, people living without electricity increased by more than 15 million (or 3%) between 2019 and 2021, reversing almost all the gains made over the previous five years.

In addition to being a low-carbon heating technology, wood pellet heating can be more cost-effective for those with limited budgets. They can be purchased in small quantities, easing the burden on those with limited incomes. However, biomass heating systems, such as boilers or stoves, have various drawbacks related to necessary space, efficiency, emissions, and maintenance.

The primary focus is optimizing passive design strategies, building energy-efficient systems, and developing intelligent energy monitoring and analysis systems to reduce energy consumption. Four case studies demonstrate different strategies used for residential buildings from 2016 to 2021 in China, Iran, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. China employs two strategies: the smart grid big data analytics framework and the energy saving decision-support system. Iran uses five techniques: green roofs, roof ponds, wind catchers, underground houses, and light shelves.</p><p id="Par46">On the other hand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia uses two strategies, namely solar energy and highly efficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems from China and Iran (Chua et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2013</xref>). As heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems account for most energy consumption in buildings, they are considered one of the best measures to reduce energy consumption. However, the economic viability of these measures needs further analysis.</p><p id="Par47">Furthermore, as shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, the four residential building energy saving strategies effectively reduce energy consumption, with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia achieving up to a 32% reduction (Almushaikah and Almasri <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2021</xref>). However, the promotion and economic evaluation of solar energy in some parts of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia still require further exploration (Tlili <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR229">2015</xref>). The table also highlights the potential of the smart energy efficiency decision framework to save energy by scheduling the operating hours of appliances. Still, its application in residential buildings and the accuracy of its energy analysis remain to be determined (Chou and Ngo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>). Passive strategies, such as light shelves, green roofs, roof ponds, wind catchers, and underground houses, can also reduce energy losses in building maintenance structures. Still, engineering limitations exist, such as the ineffectiveness of underground houses built one meter underground in saving energy in buildings (Ebrahimi-Moghadam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2020</xref>; Goudarzi and Mostafaeipour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par48">For commercial buildings, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> analyses various strategies used to reduce energy consumption in commercial buildings across the USA, Singapore, and Qatar from 2016 to 2021. Six energy saving strategies were employed in the USA, including material selection, building envelope improvements, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems, retrofitting lighting systems, retrofitting occupancy loads, and application of renewable energy sources. While these passive design strategies and optimized energy-efficient building systems can effectively achieve net-zero energy goals, their economic costs require further analysis as they are currently in the experimental phase (Aksamija <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2016</xref>). Additionally, two case studies in Singapore demonstrate the effectiveness of optimizing multi-chiller plants and smart-token-based scheduling algorithms in reducing building energy consumption. However, these strategies may not achieve energy savings in other regions due to differences in building types and regional influences (Png et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">2019</xref>; Thangavelu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR227">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par49">Additionally, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents an analysis of a 7000-square-meter office building in Qatar where the optimization of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems and loads was implemented to reduce the building’s energy consumption. However, the study found that the payback period for these strategies was relatively long (Alns and Sleiti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2021</xref>). Therefore, selecting appropriate strategies for reducing or saving energy in buildings will depend on the building type, country, and region. Strategies such as optimizing passive design, energy-efficient building systems, and developing intelligent energy monitoring and analysis systems can be effective for achieving energy saving goals. Optimizing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems is one of the most effective measures for reducing energy consumption in buildings (Aram et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2022</xref>; Taheri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR226">2022</xref>; Yao and Shekhar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR259">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par50">In this section, we examine the various strategies used by residential and commercial buildings across different countries and regions to effectively reduce or save energy consumption in buildings. Our analysis highlights that adopting passive design strategies, energy-efficient building systems, and developing intelligent energy monitoring and analysis systems are practical approaches to achieving energy savings in buildings. Additionally, optimizing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems is one of the most effective measures currently available to reduce energy consumption in buildings. However, it is crucial to select appropriate strategies for each building type, depending on the country and region where it is located. To facilitate the early achievement of net-zero energy and the Paris Agreement goals in buildings, conducting a thorough economic evaluation of these strategies and studying their engineering applications is vital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Applications of renewable energy sources for energy saving</title><p id="Par51">The rapid depletion of energy supplies, environmental concerns, growing energy prices, and rising energy consumption have all drawn attention to energy saving in recent years (Allouhi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2015</xref>; Bah and Saari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>; Shahsavari and Akbari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">2018</xref>). Urbanization and industrialization increased energy use and air pollution problems, where cities account for approximately 70% of global energy consumption and 71% of carbon emissions (Lin and Zhu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2019</xref>). Therefore, achieving energy sustainability in cities requires increasing energy saving concepts (Martos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">2016</xref>), growing cities’ energy efficiency through innovative city development (Cai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2019</xref>), and applying a carbon reduction strategy (Sodiq et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">2019</xref>). The low-voltage distribution system in buildings (Sodiq et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">2019</xref>) and public lighting systems (Ruparathna et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">2016</xref>) have recently received much attention as potential energy savings options. Since building energy consumption is constantly rising, particularly in industrialized nations, deploying energy saving in structures is crucial. This rise in energy consumption also exceeds energy use in the industrial and transportation sectors (Pérez-Lombard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">2008</xref>; Sadeghian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">2021</xref>). According to the International Energy Agency, energy in the building sector accounts for 36% of worldwide final energy use (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2019</xref>); hence transition and energy conservation in buildings is crucial to lowering energy and greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p id="Par52">Many efforts have been made to replace the energy consumed by buildings with renewable energy, which increased globally (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2022b</xref>) by installing various renewable energy systems, such as photovoltaic systems, geothermal heat pumps, and solar-assisted heat pumps in buildings (Hong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2017</xref>; Jeong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2018</xref>; Koo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2018</xref>). As a result, on-site renewable energy production on buildings has rapidly increased to achieve the energy transition and create net-zero energy buildings (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2022b</xref>; Kong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2020</xref>; Marszal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">2012</xref>). In addition, several nations have already implemented laws requiring the installation of renewable energy systems in new construction. For instance, in the USA, building owners must install a 1 kW photovoltaic system for every 10,000 square feet of new commercial or residential space. Furthermore, by 2025, all new federal buildings in Canada will be powered entirely by 100% clean electricity according to the Canadian greening government strategy (Kong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2020</xref>). In Spain and Scotland, 10–12% of the total power consumed in new and renovated buildings larger than 1000 m<sup>2</sup> should come from on-site renewable energy sources (Kong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2020</xref>). Following South Korea’s mandatory installation for public building policy, public buildings larger than 1000 m<sup>2</sup> must supply 30% of their operating energy from on-site renewable energy sources (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par53">Numerous studies have investigated the feasibility of switching from conventional to clean energy sources following these national policies (Buonomano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2016</xref>; Madessa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2015</xref>; Tripathy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR232">2017</xref>).

This makes improving efficiency and reducing energy consumption in these sectors crucial for achieving the European Union’s goals outlined in the 2050 roadmap. The roadmap calls for an overall emissions reduction of 80% from 1990 levels by 2050. The building and transportation sectors must reduce their equivalent emissions to 90% and 60% of 1990 levels, respectively (Cao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2017</xref>).

Their study aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They evaluated the impact of a novel onboard cold energy utilization system on the parasitic power consumption of a liquid hydrogen heavy-duty fuel cell truck. Simulation results showed that the total parasitic power consumption could be reduced by up to 15% under steady-state conditions. Yang et al.

The United States Department of Energy has created a multi-year strategy with ambitious goals and benchmarks for developing hydrogen infrastructure, storage technologies, and fuel cells (Hamad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2014</xref>; Lehmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2017</xref>). The cost of hydrogen is expected to range between 2 and 4 US dollars per kilogram, equivalent to one gallon of gasoline (Sazali <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">2020</xref>). Australia also increasingly favors hydrogen manufacturing, especially exportation (Boretti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>). By splitting water molecules and coal gasification, hydrogen could be implemented in production using excess wind and solar energy. However, there are numerous obstacles to overcome in hydrogen production.

Due to its potential as an energy-efficient alternative source, researchers are studying hydrogen’s potential in various industries. It has been chosen as one of the options for primary sources in the automotive industry, particularly for fuel cell electric vehicles with a low-polluting structure (Sazali <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">2020</xref>). The electric vehicle industry also has various energy systems, such as rechargeable metal batteries with low environmental impact and high energy density lithium-selenium (He et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par68">The polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell is the most practical method for generating electricity through an electrochemical reaction in fuel cell electric vehicles.

Hydrogen can be stored in gaseous or liquid form for use in automobiles (Sazali <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">2020</xref>). Many vehicles, such as Ford Zetec 2.0 L, Toyota Mirai fuel cell electric vehicles, FM fuel cell electric vehicles, Electro Van, GM HydrogenGen3, BMW 750 hl, and BMW Mini Hydrogen, use gaseous or liquid hydrogen as their primary fuel. Hybrid electric vehicles are the next generation of vehicles powered by hydrogen. However, their systems are different because, in internal combustion engines, the pressure created by the combusted hydrogen propels the system in a circular motion. In contrast, the hydrogen-based engine in hybrid electric vehicles rotates the wheels and recharges the vehicle’s batteries.</p><p id="Par69">On the other hand, fuel cell electric vehicles operate differently from internal combustion engines as they solely rely on hydrogen fuel cells to produce electricity for vehicle batteries (Sazali <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">2020</xref>). Furthermore, there are reported differences in the volatile organic compounds’ emissions between internal combustion engines, hybrid electric vehicles, and fuel cell electric vehicles, with the latter having the lowest emissions (Ugurlu and Oztuna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR234">2020</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2023</xref>) conducted a study on the feasibility of using hydrogen directly in all energy sectors through hourly energy system analysis for a 100% renewable energy system for Europe in 2050. The results indicated that using hydrogen for heating purposes is not cost-effective and inefficient. While hydrogen for electricity production can reduce biomass consumption, the high system losses result in increased costs. Hydrogen is more expensive than liquid e-fuels and electrified transportation in the transportation sector due to high infrastructure costs and low energy efficiency. However, hydrogen could benefit the industrial sector by decreasing biomass consumption at a lower cost than other energy sources. Still, electrification and e-methane may be more practical alternatives. From a systems perspective, hydrogen will be crucial for future renewable energy systems, primarily serving as an e-fuel feedstock rather than a direct end-fuel in industries that are challenging to regulate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Artificial intelligence for sustainable energy systems</title><p id="Par73">The emergence of digital technologies has the potential to significantly transform the way we generate, trade, and consume energy.

The Energiewende goals include increasing the share of renewable energy in final energy to 60% and electricity demands to 80% by 2050 while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80–95%.</p><p id="Par87">Targets have also been set for decreasing primary energy demand and electricity, heat, and transportation needs (Pregger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">2013</xref>). However, previous strategies have focused more on creating an Energiewende policy than designing the energy infrastructure to meet the emission targets. This underscores the crucial role of policies in shaping future energy development. Additionally, the current legal framework does not facilitate the transition to Energiewende aims, particularly in the heating market (Bauermann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par88">Many studies have focused on various aspects of Germany’s Energiewende.

Similarly, Lehmann and Nowakowski (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2014</xref>) examined three scenarios for constructing the future renewable electricity industry, emphasizing the electrical sector. These scenarios included a decentralized, centralized, and pan-European strategy for incorporating more renewable energy sources. Additionally, Gullberg et al.

Other studies have identified technical obstacles qualitatively by highlighting bottlenecks that must be addressed before a successful energy transition is possible (Scholz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR215">2014</xref>). To address this gap, Schroeder et al.

Their scenario includes using various renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures to achieve the Energiewende targets. Other studies developed a model-based approach to assess the feasibility of the Energiewende targets and identify the necessary technological and policy measures for achieving them. They concluded that a comprehensive energy system transformation is required, including electrifying the heating and transportation sectors and expanding the electricity grid. These studies highlight the importance of taking a holistic, multi-sectoral approach to the Energiewende to identify effective solutions for achieving the ambitious climate and energy targets (Henning and Palzer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2014</xref>; Pregger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par90">Henning and Palzer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2014</xref>) proposed a transition to 100% renewable energy in the heating and electricity sectors while keeping energy system costs comparable to current prices.

The heating sector has significant energy saving potential; additional savings are also possible in the industrial and electrical sectors. Moreover, various technologies, such as heat pumps, electrolyzers, and electric vehicles, increase the energy system’s flexibility and efficiency and facilitate the integration of more renewable electricity sources. Given the widespread electrification of all energy sectors, all available renewable electricity resources should be installed. However, the biggest challenges in achieving this transition are related to the limited availability of biomass resources. Even when all variable electricity potentials are installed, the 100% renewable energy scenario with the lowest biomass demand depends on hydrogen for thermal plants' transportation, gasification, and electro-fuel production. Nevertheless, this scenario is only slightly above the specified biomass threshold of 400 TWh/year, and the primary obstacle is the limited availability of biomass resources. Alternative scenarios that involve meeting all transportation needs with electricity, utilizing second-generation biofuels, bio-electro-fuels, or carbon dioxide electro-fuels require higher biomass consumption due to increased electricity needs or fuel production.</p><p id="Par93">Additionally, limitations on excess electricity production lead to a significant rise in biomass demand. Balancing between high biomass consumption and excess electricity production from variable sources is a necessary compromise. However, some of these scenarios are speculative and require significant technological advancements and infrastructure modifications to be feasible in a future energy system. As a result, constructing a 100% renewable energy system in Germany still poses significant challenges.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Compressed air energy storage in China</title><p id="Par94">Managing energy generation and load demand, adjusting to peak load demand, and providing backup power in case of power supply breakdowns are all critical roles of energy storage in power systems (Venkataramani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR238">2016</xref>). Compressed air energy storage has emerged as one of the most efficient techniques for large-scale energy storage, alongside pumped hydro energy storage (Argyrou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>). Compressed air energy storage technology was initially developed as an alternative to pumped hydro energy storage, primarily for storing off-peak electricity and transferring it to peak load hours.

Pumped hydro energy storage comprises 99% of China’s total installed energy storage capacity, with electrochemical energy storage rapidly developing in recent years. However, most electrochemical energy storage projects and pumped hydro energy storage stations are concentrated in central and eastern China (Tong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR231">2021</xref>).

The traditional compressed air energy storage system operates on a simple principle. During the charging process, the compressor converts excess electrical energy into the internal energy of high-pressure air for storage. During discharge, the high-pressure air is released to power the turbine generator, transforming the internal energy of the compressed air back into electrical energy (Budt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>). This method is known as adiabatic compressed air energy storage. The compression heat is dissipated through air cooling, and fuel combustion is necessary to heat the compressed air at the expander’s input. The cycle efficiency of adiabatic compressed air energy storage is approximately 50% (Rogers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">2014</xref>).

They identified opportunities for reducing carbon emissions by replacing sustainable building energy equipment. Installing solar energy panels had the most significant positive impact on the environment, reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 2926.81 tons annually and improving photometric performance and users' well-being. Replacing the lighting system resulted in the most substantial reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, amounting to 5387.00 tons. To achieve the best energy efficiency, installing variable frequency drives can effectively regulate the operation of fans and pumps according to seasonal changes, thus minimizing the risk of mechanical failure (Viholainen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par119">A study by Bartolozzi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2017</xref>) compared the effectiveness of geothermal heat pumps and biomass systems with natural gas boiler systems for centralized heating and conventional stand-alone electrical systems. The results showed that biomass wood chip stoves offered the most significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, with a 46% decrease. Ground source vertical closed-loop geothermal heat pump systems followed with a 34% reduction. On the other hand, the natural gas boiler-adsorption chiller system displayed the highest potential for reducing acid emissions, with a 33.4% reduction. These findings demonstrate the environmental sustainability potential of alternative renewable heating and cooling methods.</p><p id="Par120">Paraschiv et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">2020</xref>) suggested an enhancement to the original natural gas boiler system by incorporating a solar air heating system onto the walls of the building. This integration led to a maximum reduction of 44 tons/year in emissions during the operational lifespan, highlighting the effectiveness of renewable energy sources in decreasing energy consumption in buildings. Furthermore, the authors proposed the installation of photovoltaic plants on each building’s rooftop, allowing users to connect to a mini-grid (physical or virtual) and share energy services without any financial incentives. This approach also enhances social acceptability. Moreover, integrating the photovoltaic array through an external producer into the building’s energy strategy reduces 55.6 tons/year (54.1%) of emissions compared to electricity generated by linking to the grid, making it a more environmentally sustainable option.</p><p id="Par121">According to Vares et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">2019</xref>), using solar collectors and photovoltaic panels for on-site renewable energy production can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions when connected to the grid, with a reduction potential of 50.8%. This can be particularly beneficial for energy saving buildings. Fitó et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2021</xref>) compared the carbon reduction performance of ground source heat pumps and air source heat pumps. They found that ground source heat pumps perform better environmentally due to their ability to replace gas and grid-driven boilers. However, the environmental advantage of photovoltaic panels is insignificant in the absence of energy storage, making their performance almost equivalent to that of solar collectors.</p><p id="Par122">Casanovas-Rubio and Armengou (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2018</xref>) compared the environmental impact of different types of collectors for domestic hot water systems, including condensing gas boilers and electric water heaters. They found that serpentine flat plate collectors offer the most significant environmental benefits, resulting in a 5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, these collectors have a smaller footprint and less space, providing users with a more comfortable experience without compromising visual aesthetics. The design solutions also ensure that the collectors are not installed on external walls or sloped roofs, reducing the risk of worker injury during installation and maintenance.</p><p id="Par123">Geothermal heating can provide a more comfortable thermal environment for sedentary residents by directly utilizing sustainable geothermal energy to heat the foot regions to a greater degree, resulting in lower power consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (Zhao and You <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR272">2020</xref>). Lin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2016</xref>) tested radiant heating systems in three offices and found that users were most satisfied with the geothermal system. This is due to its ability to provide a more balanced moderate airflow (19%) and minimize large temperature swings and steep temperature gradients, thus reducing the likelihood of drafts and localized complaints of discomfort from the foot.</p><p id="Par124">In summary, energy-efficient system technologies can effectively support the reduction of carbon emissions by minimizing electrical and thermal energy waste during system operation. This helps to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide generated. Moreover, these technologies enhance visual and thermal comfort while reducing safety risks associated with system maintenance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par125">The energy crisis significantly impacts society’s economic, political, and environmental factors. Russia supplies nearly half of the European Union’s gas imports and 40% of its total gas consumption in 2021, threatening energy security and affordability. To address this, member states plan to reduce gas demand sharply. Green alternatives like air and ground source heat pumps, biomass boilers, solar thermal panels, infrared heating panels, and geothermal heating can also make residential heating systems more sustainable and energy-efficient. Renewable energy sources offer the possibility of a solution to the crisis. To reduce energy demand, building codes and regulations should prioritize energy-efficient design and construction practices. Passive design strategies, including orientation, shading, natural ventilation, and high-performance building envelopes, can reduce the demand for active heating and cooling systems. Nevertheless, location, climate, the size of the house, and the availability of renewable energy sources influence the selection of the most suitable green heating solution.</p><p id="Par126">We can achieve a more efficient and effective low-carbon energy system by integrating different sectors and optimizing their interactions. Energy-efficient appliances, smart building technologies, and renewable energy systems like solar and geothermal can reduce waste. Smart grid technologies like demand response and dynamic pricing can optimize energy use. This multi-sector approach creates sustainable growth opportunities. To achieve a sustainable and resilient future, we need a systemic approach recognizing that reducing energy demands and promoting renewables are only part of the solution.</p><p id="Par127">The electrification of transportation systems, such as passenger vehicles and public transportation, can substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve air quality. Installation of charging infrastructure, such as public electric vehicle charging stations and battery-swapping stations, is crucial to facilitate this transition. Incorporating intelligent mobility technologies such as ride-sharing and self-driving cars can also optimize transportation needs and reduce traffic.</p><p id="Par128">Multiple sectors, including building management, heating, ventilation, air conditioning systems, industry, information and communications technology, lighting, power grids, renewables, and transportation, can benefit from optimizing energy conservation through artificial intelligence. Individual actions such as using energy-efficient appliances, improving insulation and windows, adopting sustainable transportation, and utilizing renewable energy sources are emphasized in the plan for reducing energy consumption and carbon footprint. Other measures include conserving water, reducing food waste, planting trees for shade, and promoting energy conservation awareness. These changes in behavior can immediately save a substantial amount of oil, gas, and electricity annually. In general, energy-efficient building design, the electrification of transportation, and the increased use of renewable energy can reduce carbon emissions and improve energy sustainability. We must adopt intelligent building and mobility technologies, energy storage, and grid optimization systems to support this shift.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Dr. Ahmed I.
