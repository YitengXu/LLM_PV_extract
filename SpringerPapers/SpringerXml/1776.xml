The use of HEAs as feedstock for coating processes has advanced due to reports of their exceptional properties in both bulk and coating forms. Emerging reports of thermal sprayed HEA coatings outperforming conventional materials have accelerated further exploration of this field. This early-stage review discusses the outcomes of combining thermal spray and HEAs. Various synthesis routes adopted for HEA feedstock preparation and their properties are discussed, with reference to the requirements of thermal spray processing. The HEA feedstock is then compared and correlated with coating microstructure and phase composition as a function of the thermal spray processing route. Subsequently, the mechanical behavior of thermal spray HEA coatings is summarized in terms of porosity, hardness, and tribological properties, along with their oxidation and electrochemical properties, followed by their potential applications. The thermal spray methods are contrasted against laser cladding and surface alloying techniques for synthesizing thick HEA coatings. Furthermore, HEAs that have displayed excellent properties via alternative processing routes, but have not been explored within the framework of thermal spray, are recommended.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>coatings</kwd><kwd>high-entropy alloys (HEAs)</kwd><kwd>mechanical

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The performance of a material in industrial applications is associated with its surface characteristics. The wide availability of surface modification technologies permits an economic substitution of a poor base material with a coating that exhibits more desirable surface characteristics and performance. Surface modification is highly valuable in conditions involving corrosive environments, wear protection, thermal insulation, or severe stress applications. For instance, in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs), yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) is used as an overlay protective coating to shield the nickel or cobalt based superalloys from extreme high temperature conditions. Thermal spray coating (TSC) is a versatile and rapidly growing surface modification technology.</p><p id="Par3">Thermal spraying is a line-of-sight process, wherein feedstock material, in the form of powder, wire, rod, or suspension, is fed into a spray torch and heated up to a molten or near-molten state and propelled toward a base material (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). Thermal spray (TS) processes are classified into three prime categories: (1) use of combustion heat sources, for example detonation gun or high-velocity oxygen fuel spray (HVOF); (2) plasma or arc formation using electrical energy, for example atmospheric plasma spray (APS); and (3) low-temperature processes that use energy evolving from gas expansion, for example cold spray (CS). Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>) illustrates the flexibility offered by TS in terms of the wide spectrum of flame temperature–particle velocities available. Plasma spray (atmospheric and vacuum), high-velocity arc spray, HVOF, warm spray, and cold spray have been employed to synthesize thermal sprayed HEA coatings.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Spectrum of thermal spray processes across particle velocity and flame temperatures attainable (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2020_1047_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par4">Atmospheric plasma spray (APS) is the most versatile thermal spray technique that holds few limitations concerning the materials that can be sprayed. Therefore, APS is well established at the industrial level (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). A feedstock (powder or wire) is introduced into the plasma stream where complete or partial melting may occur, eventually depositing as lamellar splats onto the substrate. Numerous process parameters, of which the prime ones are gas flow rate, power input, carrier gas flow rate, stand-off distance, and powder feed-rate, are crucial in determining the coating density, quality, and uniformity. APS is economically attractive since this manufacturing process is performed under ambient conditions, with the primary drawback being in-flight oxidation (IFO) of feedstock particles. APS is best suited for forming ceramic coatings with porosity of less than several percent but can be optimized to reduce oxidation of metal powders. The alternative is to spray with an inert gas shroud, or in a soft vacuum/reducing atmosphere, but the cost of employing a vacuum system, e.g., by low-pressure vacuum spraying, increases by an order of magnitude.</p><p id="Par5">HVOF falls under the ambit of combustion spray processes. A hydrocarbon fuel (C<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>H<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>; typically, kerosene, methane, propane, propylene, acetylene or natural gas) is ignited with an oxidizer (air or oxygen). The temperature and pressure so generated then heat and accelerate feedstock particles towards the substrate. Laval nozzles are used to further accelerate the particles up to speeds of 2000 m/s. Although particle temperatures are lower than those achieved in plasma spray (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), higher particle speeds result in lower IFO and better coating densities, with porosity that may be less than 1 percent.</p><p id="Par6">Cold spray (also termed as ‘kinetic spray’) accelerates feedstock particles by means of a high-pressure gas that passes through a de Laval nozzle (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). One advantage of CS is that the feedstock is not heated significantly, thus avoiding melting and any temperature-dependent phase transformations or IFO.</p><p id="Par7">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>) illustrates the spread of particle size, temperature, and velocity offered by TS processes. Using this scheme, an appropriate processing window can be identified based on the nature of the feedstock material (metallic/ceramic) and the desired coating microstructure, such as density and phase content. For example, for ceramic coatings with a predetermined porosity requirement, such as hydroxyapatite coatings for orthopedic applications, APS would be preferred. However, for depositing dense metal coatings, such as coating aluminum alloys on magnesium parts for corrosion protection, cold spray would be the preferred method.</p><p id="Par8">TS technology has seen developments in feedstock materials across metal alloys, composites, intermetallics, ceramics, and cermets, the exact choice depending on the final application. High-quality feedstock, with respect to particle size distribution (referred to as the ‘cut’) and particle morphology, is vital to produce high-quality coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). The simultaneous surge in harsh industrial conditions and incremental development in conventional materials has pushed materials research toward the development of new alloys, for instance high-entropy alloys (HEAs). The adoption of these new HEA feedstocks will potentially allow novel surface engineering solutions that are tailored for demanding industrial environments.</p><p id="Par9">HEAs are defined as solid solution alloys of five or more elements in equi- or near-equi-atomic ratios (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>). Indeed, research on HEAs has demonstrated that they have outperformed conventional materials, not only at room and high temperature, but also at cryogenic temperatures (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">A current major focus of HEA research has been directed to decoding the science governing the fundamental nature of these multicomponent alloys. The stabilization of solid solution phases at elevated temperatures arises due to a combination of mixing enthalpy, higher configurational entropy, and similar atomic characteristics (atomic radius, valency, crystal structure) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>) that favors the formation of solid solutions such as FCC or BCC over intermetallic compounds (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>). The combined interactions among all the integral elements, termed as ‘cocktail effects’ (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>), promote these distinctive attributes of HEAs. This is reflected in the development of bulk HEAs with wear resistance (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>), oxidation (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>) and corrosion resistance (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>), and mechanical properties (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>) that have outperformed traditional materials. These technical advantages are now being translated to coatings via thermal spray, laser cladding, and sputtering processes.</p><p id="Par11">Laser cladding, also termed as laser surface alloying, involves preparing a powder bed of feedstock slurry (generally, blended unalloyed elemental powders) onto the substrate and scanning it with a focused laser beam. In another variant of the process, termed ‘direct laser deposition’, feedstock powder is propelled coaxially with the laser beam, instead of preplacement as slurry. In both processes, melting of the substrate surface along with the feedstock slurry occurs, followed by rapid solidification and generation of a coating. While laser clad/surface-alloyed coatings are usually defect free and exhibit good metallurgical bonding with the substrate, the drawbacks include a heat-affected zone, extreme residual stresses, and possible deterioration of the HEA coating and substrate properties due to elemental dilution (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>). When pre-alloyed HEA powders are used as feedstock for laser cladding, the coating often consists of multiple alloy and intermetallic phases that may require further processing before the desired properties are achieved (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">Another prevalent technique for generating HEA coatings is via sputtering or vapor phase deposition in which the HEA is atomically deposited layer-by-layer (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>). These processes result in thin films, and are increasingly being used to generate HEA carbide/nitride/boride films that exhibit excellent tribological properties (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). Reviews discuss these coating categories (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>); however, a comprehensive review of HEA coatings manufactured by thermal spray methods is not available.</p><p id="Par13">Thermal sprayed HEA coatings offer potential applications where novel HEA compositions can be explored. TS technology is well established at the manufacturing scale, for example, in generating reproducible and prime-reliant coatings for aerospace and power generation industries. In addition, several HEA compositions have been demonstrated to be competitive alternatives to conventional materials where there is a strong need for new protective coatings to address extreme engineering environments.</p><p id="Par14">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the number of research articles published on HEA thermal spray coatings in peer-reviewed journals where the rise in total citations per year is also illustrated. The first report on thermal sprayed HEAs arose in year 2004, when Huang et al. atmospheric-plasma-sprayed AlSiTiCrFeCoNiMo<sub>0.5</sub> and AlSiTiCrFeNiMo<sub>0.5,</sub> and analyzed the oxidation and wear resistance of these coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>).

A major part of TS HEA research is focused on wear and oxidation resistance of coatings. Thus, “<xref rid="Sec17" ref-type="sec">Properties of TS HEA Coatings</xref>” section concentrates on those properties of HEA coatings as well as on their electrochemical performance. “<xref rid="Sec23" ref-type="sec">Applications</xref>” section addresses the targeted applications as well as suggestions for other potential HEAs not yet processed via thermal spray. “<xref rid="Sec29" ref-type="sec">Future Trends: An Optimistic Future for HEAs</xref>” section summarizes the state of the art of knowledge on TS HEA coatings and makes recommendations concerning the future scope for this growing technology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Elemental Selection Statistics of High-Entropy Alloys</title><p id="Par16">High-entropy alloys tend to demonstrate complex and unique characteristics due to interactions of multiple elements and their diverse processing routes. The additional exposure to high temperature and then rapid solidification during thermal spray generates HEA characteristics that are challenging to understand. The screening of a specific HEA TS feedstock that will engender desirable properties that target a particular application for thermal spray process is a demanding undertaking. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> analyzes 30 peer-reviewed articles and depicts the relative occurrence of elements that have been employed in HEA feedstocks for TS processing. The majority of HEAs have a base comprising CrFeCoNi,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> with the primary addition of Al, Si, and Ti. The inclusion of Mn, Cu, Nb, and Mo has also been explored. The selection of these alloys for HEA feedstocks has been influenced by their performance in other processing routes such as casting and other deposition techniques.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Elements selection occurrence in high-entropy alloys used as a feedstock for different thermal spray processes</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2020_1047_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par18">The final microstructure and, hence, properties of the coatings not only depend on the thermal spray process but also on the synthesis routes and composition of the HEAs. It is notable that identical alloy chemistries, prepared via different feedstock synthesis techniques and thermal spray process parameters, resulted in different coating characteristics. This need not necessarily be a disadvantage, since knowledge concerning the physical metallurgical behavior guides the selection of the HEA elements for an intended application; for example, Al, Cr, Ti, Si for oxidation resistance; Cr for corrosion resistance; B2-forming Al-Ni/Co/Fe, for wear resistance; and Co/Ni-based FCCs for enhanced plasticity are appropriate alloy constituents for HEAs. Multiple compositions can simultaneously be explored for their phase composition and expected properties using high-throughput experiments and computational techniques as demonstrated by Senkov et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>). The diversity of TS processes provides a tool to manipulate the characteristics of HEAs as coatings and tune them for specific applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>HEA Feedstock: Synthesis and Properties</title><p id="Par19">Four synthesis routes have been reported to construct HEA feedstocks for TS: (1) blending, (2) arc melting followed by mechanical milling, (3) mechanical alloying, and (4) gas atomization. Each technique imparts unique implications on the powder phase and characteristics and, therefore, on the coating microstructure and properties. The following discussion will focus on the particle size and morphology; extent of alloying and homogeneity; powder yield; and flowability, since these factors influence the TS processing.</p><p id="Par20">Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> outlines the particle size distributions with respect to the synthesis techniques as reported in the TS-HEA literature. It is evident that each process has a characteristic output size range, which further depends on the synthesis process parameters. Gas atomization provides the widest cut, that can then be tailored to the thermal spray process by sieving. On the other hand, mechanical alloying results in a much finer cut that exhibits nanocrystallinity.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Particle size ranges of high-entropy alloys obtained from various powder synthesis techniques</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2020_1047_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Blending</title><p id="Par21">Blending involves mixing the powders without promoting any bonding or alloying.

It reveals imaging contrasts that arise from atomic number differences from the individual elements that are either in elemental or in oxidized states. In another case, AlTiCrFeCoNi HEA powder was first mechanically alloyed and then blended with larger, spherical Ni60 (0.63 C, 2.97 B, 4.50 Si, 5.31 Fe, 16.20 Cr, Bal. Ni; all in wt.%) powders (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>) in a 7:3 HEA/Ni60 ratio.

Then, the alloy button is crushed into smaller pieces, which is followed by ball milling into powder. The need for alloying at an elemental level is achieved by processing in the liquid state, while the requirement for the appropriate particle cut is accomplished by pulverization. Complex non-equiatomic compositions can be created by arc melting without incurring significant contamination from ball milling by this route.</p><p id="Par25">Out of the four reports that employ this method, three reported ball milling to less than 44 µm particle size, while one is &lt; 34 µm, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Information regarding milling parameters adopted, such as rotation speed, duration, milling media, quantity of powder charged, and other essential experimental data, is not available. However, from the authors’ experience, it is estimated that up to 90% of the powder weight charged would be recovered in this process, thereby making it a high yield process. The particle shape is irregular since the particles are fragmented pieces of the cast button. Hence, the powder flowability is likely to be influenced adversely; but the spray parameters can be adjusted to take this into account. The coating microstructure that evolves from these powders is relatively homogeneous in terms of the phases observed since alloy formation has already occurred during the casting procedure.</p><p id="Par26">Huang et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>) were the first to generate thermal sprayed HEA coatings, and AM-MM was their method of choice. These coatings, as well as those documented by Hsu et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>), exhibited excellent oxidation resistance, which depends largely on both, the alloy composition, and the microstructural homogeneity of the feedstock.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Mechanical Alloying (MA)</title><p id="Par27">Mechanical alloying (MA) is a well-established synthesis technique in HEA literature. Elemental powders are subjected to high-speed rotation and high-energy impacts, causing them to undergo repeated cold welding and fracturing, resulting in ‘mixing’ at an atomic scale (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>). Over 200 reports, reviewed by Vaidya et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>), indicate that while this route assures alloy formation, the alloy phase formation is subject to multiple process parameters, e.g., the milling medium, milling atmosphere, process control agent (PCA), milling duration, and rotation speed. Each of these prime factors influences the extent of alloying, implying that there is no single distinct recipe for synthesizing an HEA via MA, unlike arc melting.</p><p id="Par28">Another drawback concerns the particle size and morphology. The ‘wet’ MA route, which uses organic solvents such as toluene as PCAs, results in finer particles of irregular shape, &lt; 30 µm after 10 h of milling (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>). In contrast, the ‘dry’ MA route, usually performed under argon atmosphere and at much higher rotation speeds, results in larger particles (20-75 µm) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>) with a wide particle size distribution and exhibiting a flake-like nature (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>), as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(a) Typical powder morphologies observed in mechanically alloyed high-entropy alloys milled in (a) argon (dry milling): flaky (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>); and (b) toluene (wet milling): irregular (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2020_1047_Fig6_HTML.jpg" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par29">Dry milling of metals and alloys leads to excessive cold welding and, hence, derives larger particles that are flaky in nature. In contrast, wet milling results in finer, spherical-like particles due to the presence of the liquid surrounding the particles, which prevents excessive agglomeration of particles. However, contamination in wet milling is a concern, and dry milling is preferred when it is necessary to avoid contamination from the milling medium. Higher milling speeds allow for higher impact energy input into the material. It must be noted, however, that ball milling and mechanical alloying is a highly stochastic process with multiple controlling parameters (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">The powder characteristics influence powder flowability during its injection in TS, which generally prefers atomized prealloyed powder feedstock (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>). There is also the issue of contamination from organic solvents and/or from the milling medium (e.g., stainless steel, tungsten carbide, zirconia) that may affect feedstock composition. As reported by Praveen et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>), the use of toluene as process control agent in MA of AlCrFeCo resulted in the formation of M<sub>23</sub>C<sub>6</sub>-type carbides on subsequent processing. While it was an unsolicited addition of carbon to the alloy, it improved the sintered alloy’s thermal stability and mechanical properties, thereby illustrating both the advantages and deficiencies of this method.</p><p id="Par31">Finally, mechanically alloyed particles are nanocrystalline in nature with a grain size &lt; 15 nm, which can be leveraged depending on the thermal spray process and intended application. For example, Anupam et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>) cold-sprayed MA HEA powders on Ni-based superalloy substrate and, after 25 h of isothermal oxidation, observed the diffusion of molybdenum from the substrate into the coating, which may be attributed partly to nanocrystalline grain boundary diffusion. On the other hand, TSCs generated for MA feedstock are largely homogeneous, with a possibility of greater IFO promoted by the powder nanocrystallinity, especially if the process is associated with a high temperature as experienced in APS.</p><p id="Par32">A variation of the MA/MM process has been used by Srivastava et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>) to develop HEA feedstock for HVOF processing. Starting with milling elemental powders for 2 h in toluene, followed by drying in Ar, the powders were compacted into green pellets and subjected to pyrolysis in argon at 1100 °C for 1 h. Alloying is expected to have occurred at this stage. The pellets were then crushed and sieved. Spray drying in a 6 wt.% polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) suspension was carried out to agglomerate the fine powders. This method, while protracted, avoids the nanocrystallinity and contamination incurred from MA, as well as conferring the desired particle size. However, care must be exercised to confirm alloy formation and homogeneity throughout the process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Gas Atomization (GA)</title><p id="Par33">Inert gas atomization is the preferred technique for manufacturing feedstock for TS. It has gained popularity in the HEA coating community and is the most used synthesis method. Gas atomization involves forcing the liquid alloy through a nozzle under high pressure within an inert gas environment. The liquid stream fragments into spherical droplets that rapidly solidify (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>). Faster cooling allows phase separation to occur only at very fine scales, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>), and can usually be mitigated during spraying or annealing after coating. Gas atomization is appealing because it results in spherical particles with good flowability and homogeneous alloy formation. The wide size ranges of particles can be sieved to desired size cuts.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Typical gas-atomized high-entropy alloy particles with (a) spherical morphology and satellite particles, and (b) dendritic growth discernible at higher magnifications (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2020_1047_Fig7_HTML.jpg" id="MO7"/></fig></p><p id="Par34">In summary: GA is tailor made for synthesizing feedstock for thermal spray processes and is suitable for HEAs. Mechanical alloying presents a strong alternate method, although requiring milling parameter optimization and being time intensive. Arc melting followed by mechanical milling is suitable for laboratory-scale studies, while blending can only be used as a post-alloying technique to further enhance feedstock properties.</p><p id="Par35">It is also imperative to mention that while most of the studies synthesized their own feedstock in a laboratory setup, there are reports of two commercially available sources for HEA powders: (1) F.J. Broadmann &amp; Co., L.L.C., USA, for mechanically alloyed powders (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>), and (2) Vilory Advanced Materials Technology Ltd., China, for gas-atomized powders (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>). While this points toward a growing future for thermal sprayed HEA coatings, it must be borne in mind that the quality of the feedstock defines the coating quality. Thus, care must be exercised when selecting either laboratory or commercially produced HEAs.</p><p id="Par36">In contrast to usual prealloyed feedstock for thermal spray processes, laser cladding with HEAs is carried out with blended elemental powders mixed into a binder to form a thick slurry, which is preplaced on the substrate and exposed to the laser beam. The slurry melts under the laser beam to form a melt pool that allows mixing and alloying of the blended powders. The melt pool solidifies rapidly at 10<sup>3</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> K/s after passing of the laser beam and supersaturated solid solutions and intermetallic phases are often observed. There are several reports of laser clad HEA coatings using alloy powders synthesized via mechanical alloying (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>) or gas atomization (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>) rather than employing elemental blends. In another variation of laser cladding, termed ‘laser surface alloying’, the alloy coating is formed by mixing elements of the feedstock and the molten substrate. This transforms the otherwise detrimental problem of elemental dilution from the substrate (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>) into a benefit. Several process parameters, primarily laser power, defocus distance, scanning speed, and track overlap, must be optimized for desirable results. This has been discussed further in the “<xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">Post Processing of TS Coatings</xref>” section.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Microstructural and Phase Composition Aspects</title><p id="Par37">The microstructure of a TSC depends strongly on the type of TS method, the specific TS parameters, and the nature of the feedstock. The TS technique includes a multitude of coating parameters that are designated within ‘spray tables,’ e.g., plasma current and voltage; primary and secondary gas flow rates for plasma spray; carrier gas flow rate; stand-off distance; and design and dimensions of the nozzle for HVOF, D-gun, and cold spray processes. The HEA feedstock characteristics also govern the coating microstructure, which is strongly related to the feedstock synthesis technique (described in the previous section). Therefore, both the feedstock and TS process must be optimized to achieve a repeatable coating that is free from undesirable phases and adverse microstructural artifacts. This section delineates the effects of the TS technique used with respect to the as-sprayed microstructure of HEAs.</p><p id="Par38">It is important to note that depending on the feedstock processing route and TS route chosen, the alloy may be prone to phase transformations. For example, HEA powders synthesized via mechanical alloying result in metastable and often supersaturated solid solution phases. These powders, when sprayed by relatively high-temperature HVOF or APS processes, will undergo melting and rapid solidification, once again resulting in supersaturated solid solution phases. There is also a possibility of in-flight oxidation (IFO) resulting in a composite alloy–oxide splat microstructure. On the other hand, coatings produced via low-temperature techniques such as cold spray or warm spray will tend to retain the feedstock phases. There is further scope to induce phase changes in the coating microstructure by post-processing, by thermal treatments and/or laser remelting of the coating surface, as is elucidated in “<xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">Post Processing of TS Coatings</xref>” section.</p><p id="Par39">Compositions of HEAs are traditionally based on either the transition element quartet of Co, Cr, Fe, and Ni, or refractory elements such as W, Mo, Ta, and Nb. Additions of Al, Mn, Ti, Si, Cu, V, Hf, and Zr have been included in bulk HEAs and their microstructure and properties reported. This section charts the development of certain alloy families that have transitioned from the bulk form to TS coatings and that have been optimized for desired applications.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Early Work</title><p id="Par40">The earliest published work on thermal sprayed HEAs is by Huang et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>) and is among the first reports on high-entropy alloys as a concept. Their report on air plasma-sprayed AlSiTiCrFeCoNiMo<sub>0.5</sub> and AlSiTiCrFeNiMo<sub>0.5</sub> initiated the field of TS-HEA coatings, buoyed by initial but promising results on the improved oxidation and wear resistance of the coatings <italic>vis</italic>-<italic>à</italic>-<italic>vis</italic> traditional materials. The effect of synthesis route on the HEA’s microstructures is reflected from the phases observed. While the as-cast alloys consisted of B2 + FCC1 + FCC2 phases and a typical dendritic microstructure, only single-phase BCC splats along with several unidentified oxide phases were detected in the coatings. This is attributed to the melting followed by rapid solidification in the APS process, resulting in a supersaturated solid solution. Another aspect introduced by APS processing concerns IFO, which is a major issue when dealing with oxygen-sensitive materials. In this case, Al, Cr, Ti, and Mo are all oxygen active elements and likely constitute the many oxides detected by x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) of the coating. Nevertheless, the coating showed encouraging wear and oxidation resistance in comparison with traditional materials and laid the groundwork for the field of TS-HEA coatings.</p><p id="Par41">It is worthwhile to mention that reducing the extent of IFO of traditional materials during APS by varying process parameters has been researched (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>). A major theme of these articles is that addition of a shrouded environment vastly reduces the IFO of the feedstock. Azarmi et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>) in an experiment designed to delineate the effects of process parameters on the oxide content and porosity of APS Alloy 625 coatings found that the primary gas flow rate, particle size, and stand-off distance most affected the extent of IFO. In the field of APS-HEAs, as will be discussed in “<xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">AlCrFeCoNi Coatings</xref>” section, IFO has been found to depend strongly on the feedstock synthesis route, particle size, distribution, and the primary gas flow rate during spraying.</p><p id="Par42">Liang et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>) reported CrFeCoNiCu(B) coatings synthesized by high-velocity arc spraying. The feedstock consisted of blended HEA powders extruded into cored wires and used as consumable electrodes with opposite polarities. An arc is struck between these electrodes, thus melting the wire ends, and compressed air flow is used to atomize and propel the molten droplets toward the substrate where they solidify and form the coating. A dense (&lt; 5% porosity) coating, consisting of FCC phase splats and a dark phase that maybe oxide or an unidentified interstitial solid solution, was formed that exhibited a good interface with the substrate. The novelty of this work lies in the addition of boron in the alloy, which they credit to prevent IFO because boron acts as a sacrificial oxygen getter. These coatings exhibited good hardness and bond strengths, lending confidence to this TS method for synthesizing HEA coatings. However, there have been no further reports on high-velocity arc-sprayed HEA coatings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>AlCrFeCoNi Coatings</title><p id="Par43">The AlCrFeCoNi family of alloys has been researched extensively in the bulk form (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>). The alloy system’s chemical (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>) and mechanical properties (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>) have illustrated its excellent candidacy for many applications, which has been further targeted for TS-HEA coating developments. Yue et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>) generated AlCrFeCoNiCu coatings, a composition studied widely in bulk form for their fundamental behavior and property correlation, via low-velocity APS. Both CrFeCoNiCu(B) coatings discussed above and the AlCrFeCoNiCu coatings were developed for Mg substrates that are characterized by a low melting point. TS methods are a suitable alternative to laser surface modification, allowing surface property enhancement without deteriorating the substrate. Using gas-atomized alloy powders as feedstock, Yue et al. generated APS coatings with a BCC + FCC + oxide lamellar microstructure, in contrast to the B2 + BCC + FCC phases seen in the bulk form (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>). These cast alloys are further characterized by phase separation and spinodal decomposition occurring at nanolength scales, which are absent in the TS coatings and attributable to rapid solidification.</p><p id="Par44">This was followed by Ang et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>), Bhattacharya et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>), and others who explored compositions in the AlCrFeCoNi family. Ang et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>) sprayed mechanically alloyed AlCrFeCoNi via APS and reported significant IFO that transformed the two-phase MA powder into a multi-phase alloy–oxide composite coating. This was attributed to the fine particle size and nanocrystalline nature of the feedstock, which intensified the alloy powder’s interaction with the atmosphere during spraying. The coating exhibited a homogeneous lamellar microstructure with good anisotropic mechanical properties.</p><p id="Par45">In 2017, the same composition was sprayed via ‘supersonic air plasma spray’ by Lin et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>). Blended elemental powders were used as feedstock that formed the coating in addition to attendant oxides. Complete alloying was not possible, and it was not deemed to be an HEA coating in the as-sprayed form, although lamellar splats were observed. Annealing the coatings at 600 and 900 °C allowed interdiffusion and phase transformations resulting in BCC, Ni<sub>3</sub>Al, and Cr-O phases. Post-processing treatments will be discussed at the end of this section.</p><p id="Par46">Cheng et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>) systematically studied AlCrFeCoNi APS coatings using gas-atomized powders as feedstock, analyzing the effect of particle size and spray parameters (e.g., plasma current and argon primary gas flow rate) on the coating phases. They demonstrated the phase adjustable nature of TS-HEA coatings by controlling the above-mentioned parameters. First, the phase evolution in the particles as a function of temperature was analyzed. The starting phases in the as-atomized condition were B2 Ni-Al-rich dendritic and BCC Fe-Cr interdendritic microstructures. The BCC phase transformed to FCC at 600 °C and then to σ phase at 800 °C. Further annealing at 1000 °C revealed dissolution of the σ phase and reappearance of FCC.</p><p id="Par47">The powder particles were also observed to melt far below the melting temperature of 1362 °C of the cast alloys, manifesting as B2 + BCC phases after heat treatment at 1200 °C. Subsequently, the GA powders were sieved into two cuts, small (10-60 µm) and large (60-90 µm) and sprayed under several plasma current and argon gas flow conditions. Increasing the plasma current increases the temperature of the plasma, as does raising the primary Ar gas flow, and thus the particle temperature rises. Smaller particles gave rise to a major BCC with minor FCC + oxide microstructure at lower plasma powers, which transformed to FCC becoming the major phase at higher plasma power.</p><p id="Par48">Three of these coatings are illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and highlight the differences in coating microstructures as a function of spray parameters. These microstructures are reminiscent of those in Ang et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>)—MA-APS coatings, which also reported major FCC + minor BCC + oxides. While Ang et al. attribute the FCC phase formation to the depletion of Al from the HEA due to IFO (Al is a BCC stabilizer in Al<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>CrFeCoNi at <italic>x</italic> ≥ 0.8), Cheng et al. attribute the FCC phase stabilization to particles being annealed. A combination of both factors could be in force since significant oxidation occurs in the case of Cheng et al.’s low-energy input coatings. Interestingly, the larger particles, which could retain more heat and remain molten longer than smaller particles, did not transform to FCC. Coatings generated using higher-energy inputs and larger particle sizes exhibited good melting and splat behavior, with negligible IFO, albeit with some interlamellar cracking.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Coating microstructures achievable by using the same feedstock material and varying the coating parameters: (a) plasma current <italic>I</italic> = 500 A, Ar flow rate (<italic>f</italic>) =35 l/min result in BCC + FCC + oxides + unmelts, (b) <italic>I</italic> = 600 A, <italic>f</italic> = 50 l/min results in lower FCC content and fewer unmelts, and (c) <italic>I</italic> =750 A, <italic>f</italic> = 50 l/min results in single-phase BCC coating with nearly no IFO (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2020_1047_Fig8_HTML.jpg" id="MO8"/></fig></p><p id="Par49">Another point of comparison for AlCrFeCoNi TS coatings is available in the work of Mu et al.

Particle deformation into splats was observed, although former particle boundaries were still obvious as the new inter-splat boundaries and attributed to the brittle nature of the BCC alloy particles.

The first AlTiCrFeCoNi coatings were synthesized by Tian et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>) via APS using MA feedstock. Single-phase BCC in the HEA powder transformed to B2 + BCC + FCC + oxide phases in the coating owing to APS processing conditions that gave rise to a combination of thermally triggered phase transformations and IFO reactions. A dense coating with little or no interlamellar or vertical cracks and with a good bond strength of 50 ± 8 MPa was realized. This multi-phase nature was also reflected in the coating cross section, by light and dark phase contrasts corresponding to phases lean and rich in Al, respectively. In a continuation of the same work, Tian et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>) postulated the bonding mechanisms operating in these MA-APS coatings. Metallurgical bonding arising from solidification of molten particles on impact, along with some remelting of the previously deposited layers on impact of fresh particles, were credited for the high bond strength exhibited by these coatings.</p><p id="Par56">This composition was further studied by Lobel et al.

The conclusion was that gas-atomized powders resulted in reproducible dense homogeneous coatings with acceptable quantities of oxide inclusion and porosity. In a subsequent work, Lobel et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>) studied HVOF coatings of the same composition, starting again with GA powders. In comparison with the APS coatings, HVOF HEA coatings were observed to be denser with some scattered porosity. The phases transformed from B2 + BCC in the feedstock to one FCC + two BCC phases. Some degree of IFO was also observed that is attributed to the higher content of fines in the feedstock.</p><p id="Par57">Chen et al.

Two BCC phases, one NiAl-rich and the other Fe-Cr-rich, constituted both the powder and the coating, although in slightly different fractions. Peak broadening in XRD was observed for the coating <italic>vis</italic>-<italic>à</italic>-<italic>vis</italic> the powder and is attributed to rapid cooling in HVOF and attendant strains induced during solidification.

The blended powders were sprayed via APS and resulted in a non-homogeneous lamellar microstructure with larger splats of Ni60 and finer, more oxidized splats of the HEA. This microstructure may be correlated directly with differences in the feedstock; that is, HEA particles synthesized via mechanical alloying were finer, irregular, and nanocrystalline. Prealloyed Ni60 particles were larger and spherical and thus behaved differently in-flight than the HEA particles. Nevertheless, reinforcement was achieved as evidenced by an improvement in the coating’s wear resistance <italic>vs.</italic> the HEA-APS coating.

The APS coating was reportedly inhomogeneous, exhibited larger oxide and porosity content, and was rejected in favor of the denser HVOF coatings for subsequent oxidation studies. Interestingly, two ‘layers’ were observed in the HVOF coating, the lower layer appearing denser than the top one. This morphological effect may be due to a tempering and shot-peening-like treatment experienced by the bottom layers during deposition of the top layers. This study is novel because the authors used thermodynamically calculated phase diagrams to choose the TS-HEA alloy composition.

Oxide splats were also detected in the coating cross section along with porosity and interlamellar cracks. Thus, while some supersaturation may be achieved in-flight during plasma spray, it is not the recommended method for alloying using blended powders. It is noted, on the other hand, that supersaturation may be achieved in laser cladding since the time at temperature is significantly greater.</p><p id="Par61">The effect of Al content on phase formation and wear behavior was examined by Xiao et al.

The extent of the IFO was more under APS, and both high-temperature processes resulted in the formation of a supersaturated solid solution with lesser degrees of Cr<sub>3</sub>Si precipitation than in the as-cast form. Post-spraying heat treatment was used to optimize coating microstructures and will be discussed separately toward the end of this section.</p><p id="Par64">Learnings from previous studies on these compositions were used by Hsu et al.

Warm spray is a modification of the HVOF process, where the gas flow rates are controlled to regulate the combustion rate and therefore the temperatures experienced by the feedstock particles (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>). In terms of particle temperatures experienced, warm spray falls between cold spray and HVOF (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), hence the eponym. BCC + FCC + Cr<sub>3</sub>Si + oxide phases were observed in all the coatings. One major difference was that the feedstock was gas-atomized powder, as opposed to the AM + MM powders used earlier, likely due to better flowability and higher yield offered by GA. Typical lamellar microstructures were observed in all three coatings, with salient differences appearing in the phase fractions and degree of IFO (Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>). For instance, precipitation of the Cr<sub>3</sub>Si phase, which was observed in the as-cast and GA states, was subdued in APS and HVOF due to higher process temperatures that promoted the formation of supersaturated solid solutions.<fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig. 11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Microstructures obtained using the same feedstock and several thermal spray processes: (a) atmospheric plasma spray (APS), (b) high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF), and (c) warm spray (WS) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2020_1047_Fig11_HTML.jpg" id="MO11"/></fig></p><p id="Par65">Process temperatures in warm spray were sufficiently low to avoid phase transformations and allow retention of the BCC + Cr<sub>3</sub>Si phase constitution of the feedstock, but high enough to allow particle deformation and improved inter-splat bonding.

The combined advantage of higher process temperatures and no IFO was critical in WS HEA coatings exhibiting better oxidation resistance than their HVOF and APS counterparts. Warm spray, thus, has also demonstrated excellent capability for spraying oxygen- and temperature-sensitive materials, which opens opportunities for the development of TS-HEA coatings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>CrFeCoNi (Mn/Nb/Mo) Coatings</title><p id="Par66">Other compositions based on CrFeCoNi have also been explored via the TS route.

Nano-oxide reinforcement of the APS coating due to IFO was also observed. It has been noted that for the same spray parameters, the deposition efficiency of CrFeCoNiMo was lower than that for AlCrFeCoNi, due to the higher melting point of the former alloy, resulting in fewer instances of melting and splatting.</p><p id="Par67">Wang et al.

The FCC particles of dendritic morphology did not undergo any phase transformation, nor was there oxidation of the coating. The coatings were dense, aided by the ductile nature of the alloy, which is advantageous since bonding in CS depends on plastic deformation of feedstock particles. The coating also exhibited significant grain refinement from strains generated from particle deformation on impacting the substrate. Wang et al.

However, APS coatings exhibited porosity and inter-lamellar cracking. To mitigate this, laser remelting was conducted, as elucidated in the following section. In contrast, Xiao et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>) reported similar microstructures for GA-APS CrMnFeCoNi, but with a fluffy, porous top surface.

The first is to relieve strains incurred during rapid solidification and allow densification to occur. The second is to promote phase transformations such as precipitation from supersaturated alloy phases. Annealing can also be used to promote limited interdiffusion between the coating and substrate to improve bond strength without deteriorating the substrate properties. Annealing can also be used to homogenize coating chemistries that undergo low-temperature TS processes, as in the case of cold-sprayed AlCrFeCoNi coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>).

By controlling the laser parameters such as laser energy and scan rate, melting is limited to the top few tens of micrometers of the TS coating, effectively avoiding element dilution from the substrate. The alloy melt pool so formed is followed by rapid solidification, resulting in a dense and nearly defect-free coating. A columnar and dendritic (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>) microstructure with supersaturated solid solutions, governed by the rapid cooling rates, is often observed, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>. Laser remelting assists in fluxing out oxide splats that are formed during IFO during the APS/HVOF process, thereby resulting in an oxide-free top layer of HEA coating (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>).

As mentioned previously, LC usually employs blended powders as feedstock, which melt under the laser beam and the alloy rapidly resolidifies into a characteristic dendritic structure.</p><p id="Par76">Although there are more than 60 reports on laser clad HEA coatings, this section will focus on those studying the same HEA composition for corresponding TS HEA coatings, thereby permitting equivalent comparisons.</p><p id="Par77">The AlCrFeCoNi family of alloys has seen significant attention in the laser cladding community. The literature has reported several phase combinations over a range of laser processing parameters for the same HEA composition. Katakam et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>) and Chao et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>) studied the effect of increasing Al content on the coating microstructure. They reported the presence of multiple solid solution (BCC, B2, FCC) and intermetallic (Al<sub>8</sub>Cr<sub>5</sub>, Al<sub>3</sub>Ni) phases. Two-phase microstructures with a dark-appearing matrix and bright-appearing precipitates were observed. The precipitate morphologies were observed to transform from equiaxed for lower Al content, to dendritic, and finally to Widmanstätten plate morphology for higher Al contents.</p><p id="Par78">Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref> illustrates microstructures observed for laser clad Al<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>CrFeCoNi (<italic>x</italic> = 0.3, 0.5, 0.8). Shon et al.

Zhang et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>), by controlling the laser parameters, were able to generate a single-phase BCC coating for the equiatomic composition, whereas Li et al.

He et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>) studied the systematic addition of titanium to the equiatomic alloy coating. Eutectic BCC + FCC microstructure was observed in the alloy without titanium, whereas the FCC phase formation was restrained with titanium addition. Two BCC phases were stabilized, one Fe and Cr rich, and the other Ni and Al rich. Sha et al.

In contrast, laser clad HEA coatings are characterized by equiaxed or columnar dendritic morphologies and are practically defect free. Argon shielding during laser scanning is a standard practice with laser cladding to avoid oxidation of the melt pool. Both coatings are prone to supersaturated solid solution formation due to higher cooling rates. Additionally, grain refinement is observed for laser clad HEA coatings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Properties of TS HEA Coatings</title><p id="Par82">The following section focuses on the properties exhibited by TS HEA coatings, many of which have outperformed traditional materials.

The lamellar microstructure consists of porosity, micro-cracks, oxides (if any), and unmelts. Ang et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>) indicated that the lamellar microstructure of thermal sprayed HEA coatings confers anisotropic mechanical properties. Porosity is the key artifact found within the lamellar microstructure and, other than the thermal spray process, is a major factor that restricts the mechanical properties of these coatings. The overall performance of the HEA coatings can be highly influenced by controlling the size and amount of the pores as well as their location within the 3-D structure of a coating.</p><p id="Par84">Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> presents the porosity data for thermal sprayed HEA coatings. The HEA coatings produced by cold spray exhibit noteworthy low porosity compared to APS and HVOF processes. The ability of imparting high kinetic energies to particles, leading to large impact velocities, led to low porosity in the cold-spray-processed coatings. HVOF coatings, although processed at lower particle velocities than cold spray coatings, also revealed lower porosity, whereas APS HEA coatings, processed at lower velocity and high particle temperatures, resulted in higher-porosity coatings that exhibited phase transformations.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Compilation of porosity level and possible

A nearly twofold increase was noted in both coatings after annealing at 800 and 1100 °C for 250 h. These values are much higher than those observed for CoNiCrAlY-based coatings, which imply better wear resistance for the HEA coatings.</p><p id="Par88">Another study (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>) explored HEAs as alternatives to bond coats; MA AlCrFeCoNi and CrMnFeCoNi HEAs were coated onto a mild steel substrate via APS. Vickers hardness values (HV0.3<sub>kgf</sub>) of 4.13 GPa (421 HV)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> and 4.42 GPa (451 HV) were reported for AlCrFeCoNi and CrMnFeCoNi, respectively. On the other hand, the conventional bond coat materials exhibited a hardness of 2.45 GPa (250 HV). The higher hardness of plasma sprayed HEA coatings was attributed to the formation of multicomponent BCC and FCC solid solutions and oxide phases. The lamellar, composite microstructure is responsible for the anisotropic mechanical behavior in these HEA coatings. High values of Weibull modulus (<italic>m</italic><sub>AlCrFeCoNi</sub> = 12.24 and <italic>m</italic><sub>CrMnFeCoNi</sub> = 10.30) indicate that microstructural flaws were not concentrated within the coatings.</p><p id="Par90">AlCrFeCoNi APS coatings were also fabricated by Cheng et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>) using atomized feedstock. The average coating hardness was higher when a coarse cut (60-90 µm) was used as feedstock in comparison with the fine cut (10-60 µm), peaking at 427.9 HV<sub>0.3</sub>. For the same composition coated via cold spray, slight lower hardness values (measured at load of 25 gf), 3.8 GPa (388 HV), were reported (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>). The hardness variation between APS and CS coatings may be attributed to the additional reinforcement of alloy phases (FCC + minor BCC) with harder oxide phases in the APS coatings, which is absent in cold spray, i.e., the cold spray coating reveals only BCC phase and no oxides.</p><p id="Par91">Nanoindentation studies of plasma sprayed AlCrFeCoNi HEA coatings indicated that the presence of oxides and mixed oxides within the coating microstructure significantly enhances the coating’s hardness (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>). With a slight modification in the nickel HEA chemistry, Srivastava et al.

A crack-free indentation profile was observed with increasing load, thus suggesting a high fracture toughness for this HEA coating.</p><p id="Par92">As mentioned previously, addition of titanium to cast AlCrFeCoNi-based HEA systems increased the hardness and wear resistance of the alloys (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>). This has prompted investigation of AlTiCrFeCoNi-based HEAs employing TS techniques (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>).

This value was higher than that for the spark plasma-sintered alloy, which has been attributed to an integrated outcome of lattice distortion of the dominant BCC phase caused by larger aluminum and titanium atoms, and the formation of hard oxides within coating. In another study on AlTiCrFeCoNi by Lobel et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>), feedstock was synthesized separately by powder blending, high-energy milling, and inert gas atomization (GA), and sprayed onto steel substrates by APS. The homogeneous coating using GA feedstock exhibited the highest hardness of 599 HV<sub>0.1</sub> in comparison with APS coatings of the same composition manufactured using MA (476 HV<sub>0.1</sub>) or blended feedstock (354 HV<sub>0.1</sub>).</p><p id="Par93">Tian et al.

The Ni60 reinforcement increased the hardness from 642 HV<sub>0.2</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>) to 676 HV<sub>0.2</sub> due to a combined effect of solution hardening and dispersion hardening. Moreover, a much higher microhardness of 730 ± 82 HV<sub>0.1</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>) was achieved for atomized AlTiCrFeCoNi HVOF coatings when compared against their APS coating counterparts (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>). Likewise, the microhardness (measured with a load of 0.982 N) of the GA-HVOF Al<sub>0.6</sub>TiCrFeCoNi HEA with a lower aluminum content was found to be 789 ± 54 HV<sub>0.1</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>).</p><p id="Par94">Li et al.

Cross-sectional hardness (measured with a 2 N load held for 10 s) of the composite coating was 620 HV, which further augmented to 740 HV post-treatment in air for 1 h at 750 °C. A combination of oxidation and precipitation hardening was responsible for the hardness enhancement. Overall, HVOF-sprayed AlTiCrFeCoNi-based HEA performed better than APS-sprayed HEAs in terms of coating hardness.</p><p id="Par95">On the other hand, addition of Si to AlCrFeCoNi by MA produced APS coatings with an average hardness of 612 ± 41 HV<sub>0.2</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>).

The AlSiCrFeCoNi achieved the highest hardness of 439 ± 63 HV<sub>0.2</sub> among the three coatings due to the presence of a major BCC phase with a minor FCC phase. Moreover, the hardness increased to 666 ± 55 HV<sub>0.2</sub> after heat treatment at 800 °C for 2 h in nitrogen atmosphere. The increase in hardness was attributed to development of additional Cr<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>5</sub>Si<sub>2</sub> intermetallic phase along with a major BCC phase.</p><p id="Par96">Hsu et al.

The WS coatings of both HEAs achieved higher hardness (470-490 HV) in the as-sprayed state, than both APS and HVOF coatings (400-440 HV). The high hardness in WS coatings was attributed to its dense structure and the degree of Cr<sub>3</sub>Si precipitation compared to the supersaturated solid solutions for the other two spray processes. However, heat treatment at 800 °C for 10 h allowed Cr<sub>3</sub>Si precipitation to occur in the APS and HVOF coatings, thereby increasing their hardness over that of the warm-sprayed coating.</p><p id="Par97">The HEAs that contain the quaternary metals of CrFeCoNi in the bulk state exist as an FCC solid solution and possess a superior combination of corrosion resistance, thermal stability, high ductility, and fracture toughness.

(Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>), MA AlCrFeCoNi HEA coatings were fabricated by supersonic APS and the influence of post-treatment on the structure and properties was investigated. The post-coating treatment included vacuum heat treatment at 600 and 900 °C for 10 h and then laser remelting at a power of 300 W. The average hardness (measured with a 1.96 N load and 10 s of dwell time) of the as-spayed coating was 177 HV<sub>0.2</sub>, which increased to 227 and 266 HV<sub>0.2</sub> post-vacuum heat-treated at 600 and 900 °C, respectively. Laser remelting of the as-sprayed AlCrFeCoNi coating enhanced the hardness significantly from 177 to 682 HV<sub>0.2</sub>, owing to the existence of a single-phase solid solution and AlNi<sub>3</sub> phase in the coating. In addition, hardness values were relatively stable throughout the coating surface. Mu et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>) examined APS AlCrCoFeNi reinforced with nano-oxides that improved the coating hardness to 573 ± 19 HV<sub>0.1</sub>, notably higher than the as-sprayed value of 177 HV<sub>0.2</sub> reported by Lin et al.

(Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>) investigated CrFeCoNiMo<sub>0.2</sub>-based HEA coatings generated by APS and HVOF. An average microhardness of 356 and 390 HV<sub>0.2</sub> was observed for the APS and HVOF coatings, respectively. The homogenous microstructure with low oxide and defects content in the HVOF coating was responsible for their higher microhardness, although it should be noted that the statistical error in these measurements is unknown and variations of ±15 hardness units are typical. In contrast, APS coatings of CrFeCoNiMo HEA doped with nano-oxides achieved a hardness of 319 ± 10 HV<sub>0.1</sub>, as reported by Mu et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>).

The hardness of the HEA coating ranged between 310 and 325 HV<sub>0.5</sub>. The increase in hardness was attributed to lattice strains from size mismatch between Nb (145 pm) with Co (135 pm), Cr (140 pm), Fe (140 pm), and Ni (135 pm), resulting in solution strengthening, and also to strengthening from ordered Laves phase precipitation in the coating. More importantly, an approximately 500-µm-thick coating exhibited only slight variation in hardness throughout the coating entire microstructure, thus emphasizing the stability and uniformity of the HEA coating. Cold-sprayed CrMnFeCoNi reported by Yin et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>) credited an increase in dislocation density and number of grain boundaries for the observed microhardness values of 332.91 ± 34.74 HV<sub>0.1</sub>. However, a similar HEA system sprayed using APS attained microhardness value of 273 ± 35 HV<sub>0.2</sub>, which increased marginally to 332 ± 43 HV<sub>0.2</sub> after annealing at 800 °C for 2 h in an argon atmosphere. Note that large and overlapping statistical scatter of these data is typical of coatings formed by APS. Post-annealing, an increase in cohesive strength among splats and the oxides content were stated as the major factors responsible for the microhardness (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>) increase. Cold-sprayed Co-free equiatomic CrMnFeNi sprayed at different powder feed rates and gas feed pressures exhibited a peak hardness of 304 ± 10 HV<sub>0.3</sub> under a low feed rate (1 rpm) and high gas feed pressure (60 bar). The overall increase in hardness was observed due to work hardening from the high particle deformation characteristics of cold spraying (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>).</p><p id="Par101">As stated in earlier sections, laser cladding (LC) has been widely used to develop thick HEA coatings. Figure <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref> shows the hardness data of pertinent laser clad HEA coatings. A comparison between the mechanical properties of TS and LC coatings in terms of hardness (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref> and <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>) revealed both techniques to be complementary. For example, Zhang et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>) synthesized AlCrFeCoNi-based HEA coatings using laser surface alloying that achieved a microhardness of around 5 GPa (510 HV), which has been attributed to solid solution strengthening and lattice distortion. Similarly, He et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>), Li et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>), and Liu et al.

These values are comparable to the TS AlCrFeCoNi coatings summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>. The observed increase in LC coating hardness has been achieved either by the addition of another element or by the dispersion of different hard phases. For example, the addition of Ti to the AlCrFeCoNi (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>), or reinforcement with ceramic NbC or TiC particles (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>), improved significantly the hardness of LC coatings. The improvement in hardness for both coatings is attributable to solid solution strengthening and precipitation hardening.<fig id="Fig15"><label>Fig. 15</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Hardness comparison of laser-cladded coatings with respect to high-entropy alloy composition</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2020_1047_Fig15_HTML.png" id="MO15"/></fig></p><p id="Par102">In summary: Among all TS processes used to fabricate HEA coatings, HEAs sprayed with HVOF achieved the highest average hardness: 789 ± 54 HV<sub>0.1</sub>, in the case of atomized Al<sub>0.6</sub>TiCrFeCoNi HEA feedstock, as depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>. Numerous reports on the mechanical behavior of bulk HEAs attribute their outstanding properties to strains arising from ‘lattice distortion,’ one of the four core effects thought to govern the behavior of HEAs. However, recent reports have found that the strains arising from the ‘mismatched’ lattice are not significantly different from those experienced by traditional solid solution alloys (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>). Thus, it is more appropriate to attribute the observed high hardness and strength values to supersaturated solid solution strengthening, precipitation hardening, and other mechanisms induced by the processing technique. Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> summarizes the hardness and the possible strengthening mechanisms operating in TS-HEA coatings. Both properties are observed to depend strongly on the processing route of the feedstock, HEA composition, and TS route.</p><p id="Par103">High-temperature TS processes invariably result in supersaturated solid solutions, while intermediate cooling rates and/or process temperatures allow fine second-phase precipitation to occur. Low-temperature TS processes on the other hand rely on substantial plastic deformation of particles, resulting in grain refinement, to improve the mechanical properties of coatings. There is further latitude for tuning these properties by post-coating thermal treatments. Combining these process tools with the extensive scope of applying physical metallurgy concepts to the HEA materials hyperspace, such as tuning the microstructure to allow strain hardening to occur due to load-induced phase transformations, e.g., TWIP/TRIP effects, opens technological potential for the future of TS-HEA coatings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Tribological Assessment</title><p id="Par104">TS-HEAs have demonstrated microstructural stability and high hardness; thus, they are promising candidates for extreme environment applications.

Tests at room temperature resulted in a volume wear rate of 0.77 ± 0.01 × 10<sup>−4</sup> mm<sup>3</sup>/N-m, much lower than 316 stainless steel (2.55 ± 0.31 × 10<sup>−4</sup> mm<sup>3</sup>/N-m). On the other hand, at 500 °C, the volume wear rate increased to 0.93 ± 0.02 × 10<sup>−4</sup> mm<sup>3</sup>/N-m due to a hardness decrease and operation of a more severe adhesive wear mechanism than at room temperature. Major adhesive wear with minor abrasive wear were indicated as the prevalent mechanisms from the wear surface morphology. Also, the wear surface was observed to have oxidized slightly at 500 °C compared to that at 25 °C. Wear volume rate at 700 °C was measured as 0.23 ± 0.02 × 10<sup>−4</sup> mm<sup>3</sup>/N-m, which increased further at 900 °C. The wear mechanisms at both temperatures were tribo-oxidation wear and abrasion wear. In summary, APS AlTiCrFeCoNi HEA coating exhibited excellent wear resistance at 700 °C compared to stainless steel due to the development of tribofilms and the formation of a hard and brittle σ-CrFe precipitate phase during high-temperature wear testing.</p><p id="Par107">Lobel et al.

Coatings obtained using atomized feedstock exhibited the highest wear resistance in both the ball-on-disk and oscillating wear tests owing to the homogenous microstructure and higher hardness of GA-APS coatings. In contrast, the coating deposited using MA powder performed better in scratch testing compared to blended and atomized powder. Lobel et al.

Morphological analysis of wear tracks depicted that both abrasion and fatigue wear contributed to coating wear. However, severity of both wear mechanisms increased with an increase in test temperature. Moreover, the difference between wear rates at 300 and 500 °C was not significantly high due to the formation of an oxide layer on the wear track at 500 °C. XRD analysis revealed that no phase changes occurred after friction testing at different temperatures, and the coating exhibits the BCC phase, i.e., the same as in the as-sprayed state. The fracture toughness of the as-sprayed coating obtained was 8.4 MPa m<sup>1/2</sup>, which further decreased to 5 MPa m<sup>1/2</sup> post-heat treatment at 800 °C due to the precipitation of σ-CrFe phase, signifying increased coating brittleness due to heat treatment.</p><p id="Par109">Tian et al.

Further analysis of wear tracks revealed that adhesive wear and tribo-oxidation wear as well as slight abrasion wear were active mechanisms.

SEM analysis of the wear surface displayed the formation of grooves, micro-pits due to spalling of splats, and micro-cracks at the interface of splats, which all suggest abrasive wear as the main wear mechanism. In contrast, the wear rate under water sliding conditions was lower than under dry sliding conditions due to lubricating as well as cooling effects promoted by the water media. However, the addition of aluminum to HEA and heat treatment had little influence on wear rate under these conditions as opposed to dry sliding conditions.</p><p id="Par111">Tian et al.

The HEA-Ag composite coating exhibited a lower friction coefficient than the HEA coating at 25-400 °C due to the lubrication effect of silver. However, at high temperature (600 and 750 °C), the silver lubrication effect seems negligible since the wear mechanism changes to adhesion and oxidative wear, leading to a further decrease in the friction coefficient for both coatings.

The superior wear resistance of APS coating was due to the lubrication effect created by the formation of an oxide layer during wear.

(Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>) for their oxidation behavior. Oxidation rates decreased with an increase in Al content and the concurrent formation of (Al,Cr)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The formation of a TGO Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layer was the major reason for enhancement of the high-temperature oxidation resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Electrochemical Properties</title><p id="Par131">Corrosion protection to the advanced engineering materials, especially under highly aggressive environments, such as marine applications and chemical processing industries, is generally furnished by a coating system with superior electrochemical performance. Coatings with high corrosion resistance under different environments act as a barrier to the engineering component, and enhance the component lifetime. Thermal sprayed HEA coatings are not yet widely investigated with respect to their corrosive behavior in comparison with their laser clad and cast counterparts (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>). Two reports have been published concerning of the corrosion behavior of HEA coatings formed by a thermal spray process (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>).</p><p id="Par132">Wang et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>) examined the corrosive behavior of vacuum-plasma-sprayed (CrFeCoNi)<sub>95</sub>Nb<sub>5</sub> HEA coatings in a 3.5 wt.% NaCl solution. Polarization curve analysis showed that (CrFeCoNi)<sub>95</sub>Nb<sub>5</sub> HEA coatings possessed a higher corrosion potential (− 0.37 V) and lower current density (7.23 × 10<sup>−6</sup> A/cm<sup>2</sup>) compared to other similar HEA systems, thus representing better corrosion resistance. SEM analysis of coating after electrochemical treatment indicated that selective corrosion occurred, with the formation of tiny dish-shaped pits and large pits on the coating surface. The interdendritic phases rich in Nb and Cr were more susceptible to corrosion compared to the Co-, Ni-, and Fe-rich dendritic phase. Formation of stable oxides such as Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> in the passivation film promoted the corrosion resistance of the coating, as detected by XPS analysis.</p><p id="Par133">The second report by Vallimanalan et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>) analyzed the corrosion behavior of HVOF-sprayed AlCrCoNiMo HEA coatings and compared it with a conventional NiCrSiB-based HVOF coating. Corrosion rate calculation using a Tafel plot suggested that the HEA coating demonstrated a lower corrosion rate (0.00276 mm/year) compared to NiCrSiB coating (0.018 mm/year), thus concluding higher corrosion resistance for this particular HEA coating.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Applications</title><p id="Par134">A coating provides improved properties in the working environment without compromising the properties of the engineering component, thereby increasing the lifetime of the part and providing economic and efficiency gains over the lifetime of the engineering assembly.</p><p id="Par135">A prime example is thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) on superalloy blades in turbines. Superalloys have evolved through several generations and exhibit excellent creep properties and oxidation resistance under extreme harsh environments. However, oxidation resistance comes at the expense of creep performance. Thus, rather than compromising the superalloy creep resistance by adjusting compositions to benefit thermal stability, a suitable TBC can be designed to mitigate the oxidation and thermal resistance. The outcome is that the turbine blade lasts longer with lower maintenance. The coating is sacrificial in nature and can be stripped and replaced periodically, which is much more economical than replacing the superalloy blade.</p><p id="Par136">The potential of high-entropy alloys lies in the unexplored materials hyperspace, as summarized by Miracle et al. in their review (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>). New HEA compositions are being discovered that exhibit exceptional properties. This knowledge may be used to design HEAs for specific applications, which can be translated into coatings using the versatile thermal spray processes.</p><p id="Par137">TS coatings are primarily developed for (a) wear, (b) oxidation, (c) corrosion, (d) biomedical, and (e) electronic applications, each of which is open for TS-HEAs.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Wear and Abrasion Resistance</title><p id="Par138">The sheer number of industries requiring wear- and abrasion-resistant coatings is staggering. From earth-moving and mining equipment to agricultural machinery such as harvester blades, and from transmission, steering, and suspension components in automobiles to wear plates in bottling and canning industries, there are ample opportunities for developing HEA TS coating solutions for each case-specific scenario.</p><p id="Par139">In addition to traditional industries, there is also scope in the renewable energy sector, for example in wind energy where turbine blades need abrasion resistance from dust and hail, as well as being lightweight yet strong—an ideal case for coatings. Wear resistance HEA coatings have been a focus of the TS HEA community, as is detailed in “Tribological Assessment” section. The AlCrFeCoNiX family exhibits good wear resistance at room and elevated temperatures, relying on solid solution strengthening and, in some cases, precipitation hardening and operating via oxidative wear mechanisms. On the other end of the HEA spectrum, refractory HEAs (RHEAs) have excellent wear and abrasion resistance in cast and laser clad forms (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>), though they have not been fully exploited by TS manufacturing methods.</p><p id="Par140">There is also scope for generating metal matrix composites as illustrated by Mu et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>), where ceramic particles are incorporated into a metallic binder. Other variants, such as replacing metallic binders with ductile FCC HEAs (i.e., the CrFeCoNi alloy family), and the ceramic with B2 phase or refractory HEAs, may be viable. Precedent exists from Zhu et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>) in the form of Ti(C,N) cermets using FCC AlCrFeCoNi alloy as binders, which exhibited better oxidation resistance than conventional materials. It is also possible to adjust spray parameters to generate high-entropy ceramics in situ for wear resistance applications. Extensive literature on thin-film HEA-C/N/B/O compositions exists (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>); therefore, there is similar potential to develop thick coatings via TS processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Oxidation Resistance</title><p id="Par141">As detailed in “Oxidation Behavior” section, there has been a focus on exploring HEAs as alternatives to MCrAlY bond coat materials (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). Compositions with varying quantities of Al, Cr, Si, Ti, and Ni have shown promising results. Besides bond coats, oxidation resistance is required at lower temperatures (&lt; 700 °C) in power generation industries, where Fe and Cr would be the primary oxidation-resistant elements. Furthermore, RHEAs, which are known to be limited by poor oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures, can be tuned with the addition of Al, Ti, etc., as evidenced by reports on cast RHEAs (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>). Processing these coatings by vacuum plasma spray (VPS) or controlled atmospheric plasma spray (CAPS) is recommended to avoid IFO while promoting particle melting and splat formation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Corrosion Resistance</title><p id="Par142">Protection from corrosion is an important and viable area for application of TS HEA coatings. Practically, all areas of industry operating in non-ambient conditions require some form of corrosion resistance. The market for thermal sprayed corrosion-resistant coatings is extremely large: from oil and gas/petroleum industries, chemical and metal processing industries, to marine environments—offshore oil rigs, naval applications in ships and submarines; and from food processing industries to powder generation—hydro, thermal, geothermal, and land-based turbines. Each industry has specific stringent working environments for which TS HEA coatings can be tailored. Whereas there is a growing body of work on the corrosion behavior of TS HEA coatings, there is a rich body of literature exploring and proving the promise of corrosion-resistant HEAs in the cast or laser clad form (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>). These compositions can be adopted by appropriate TS methods where it will be necessary to optimize the coating thickness and density for optimum performance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Biomedical Applications</title><p id="Par143">Thermal spray is also a popular method for developing titanium and hydroxyapatite coatings for orthopedic applications (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>). TS processing provides the right balance between coating density and defect (pores, cracks) distribution required for osteointegration. APS is the favored method for spraying biomaterials.</p><p id="Par144">Developing biocompatible HEAs for drug delivery and other related applications is a major focus of the HEA research community. For example, Alagarsamy et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>) have investigated Al<sub>0.1</sub>CrFeCoNi for application in peripheral vascular stent implants. Popescu et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>) have explored the TiFeZrNbTa system for biomedical applications as dental or orthopedic implants. It is imperative to mention that currently the metallic implants are formed or machined, and the TS coating on them is polymer or composite in nature. However, there is scope for biocompatible wear-resistant TS HEA composite coatings. Sputtered HEA carbide coatings have been under investigation by Vladescu et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>) due to their biocompatibility and mechanical properties, and such materials processing data can spearhead applications for in situ HEA ceramics generated by TS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Electronics</title><p id="Par145">Thermal spray coatings are applied in the electronics industry for EMI/RFI (electromagnetic interference/radio frequency interference) shielding. These coatings prevent noise and interference associated with the operation of electronic equipment. Typically, materials with high electrical conductivity and/or high values of magnetic constant and dielectric constant are preferred for EMF shielding via reflection and absorption, respectively.</p><p id="Par146">Nanocrystalline ferromagnetic alloys containing Fe, Co, and Ni have been suggested as promising candidates for EMF shielding. Yang et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>) were the first to explore the EM wave absorption properties of AlCrFeCoNi (70 wt.% powder dispersed with paraffin matrix) synthesized by mechanical alloying. They report an effective absorption bandwidth of 2.7 GHz, indicating the powders’ excellent EM wave absorption properties. Zhang et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>) also studied the AlCrFeCoNi/epoxy system, focusing on the effect of different powder morphologies and sizes on the EM absorption properties. They conclude that finer (0.2-7 µm) wet milled HEA exhibited higher total shielding due to enhancement of absorption, vis à vis larger flaky alloy particles, and are excellent candidates for microwave shielding applications. This nature of HEA particles can be translated to TS coatings by low-temperature cold spray processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Future Trends: An Optimistic Future for HEAs</title><p id="Par147">‘The 2016 Thermal Spray Roadmap’ by Vardelle et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>) does not mention the evolving technical area of HEAs, but presents an overview of thermal spray technology. In an alike fashion, editorials on ‘We Never have Enough Energy’ (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>) and ‘Finding the ‘Magic Pudding’ in the Thermal Spray Industry’ (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>) state the pervasive need for materials technology, specifically thermal spray, to master critical current and emerging societal needs. High-entropy alloys present technical and commercial opportunities that address these needs. High-entropy alloys in the form of bulk alloys, thin films, and coatings have already been exploited throughout the recent timeline of discovery, especially in traditional technologies such as casting, laser cladding, and sputtering.</p><p id="Par148">High-entropy alloys are still an emerging class of materials where fundamental science is not keeping pace with their practical engineering application. This deficiency is magnified in the area of using HEAs as functional coatings, wherein traditional thermal spray technology can play a major role. Alternative thermal spray and other processing techniques, such as cold spray and high-speed laser cladding, have gained importance. Herein lie opportunities for scientific discoveries that will enable databases of physical properties that can further be exploited for high functional performance.</p><p id="Par149">The near-future developments of TS-HEAs lie in the sub-topics of (1) feedstock preparation, (2) TS process optimization, (3) mechanical, chemical, and thermal testing of HEA coatings, (4) initiation and normalization of HEA databases, and (5) qualification and industrial adoption of bespoke HEA coatings for specific extreme environments.</p><p id="Par150">Feedstock preparation: “HEA Feedstock: Synthesis and Properties” section reviewed the existing TS-HEA alloys that have been documented. Future TS-HEA feedstocks that mimic the traditional materials growth process are (1) high-entropy ceramics (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>), (2) refractory high-entropy alloys (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>), (3) high-entropy amorphous alloys (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>), and (4) HEAs as binder materials for composite coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>). The process technologies for these sub-categories of potential feedstocks have been described in “HEA Feedstock: Synthesis and Properties” section. However, other preparation methods such as aerosol technology and solgel methods are also viable. There has been no TS-related work on high-entropy polymers presumably because the excessive TS thermal environment causes adverse material damage.</p><p id="Par151">TS process optimization: Atmospheric plasma spraying is the current method of choice in forming TS-HEAs since it is economical and relatively simple. Cold spray (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>) has been used with success for HEAs but will be limited to ductile materials. Other TS methods of specific relevance include (1) solution thermal spray (STS) such as suspension plasma spray (SPS) and solution precursor plasma spray (SPPS) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>), (2) controlled atmosphere plasma spray (CAPS) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>), and (3) vacuum plasma spray (VPS) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>). These three classes of TS processing will come on line when HEAs are proven and qualified by APS, since they enable the creation of more precise chemistries and refined microstructures that mimic traditional HEA routes.</p><p id="Par152">The process optimization will be guided by the implementation of advanced diagnostic systems that allow real-time monitoring of the particle flux conditions (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>) during the spray process.</p><p id="Par153">Mechanical, chemical, and thermal testing of HEA coatings: This review compiles and summarizes the known literature on HEAs. It is critical to indicate that there are deficiencies in some reports. For example: (1) testing conditions are not fully documented, and (2) replication of test results has not been universally implemented within individual studies. It is recommended that future studies will follow documented metallographic practice (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>), mechanical testing procedures (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>), and thermal tests (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">141</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>).</p><p id="Par154">Initiation and normalization of HEA databases and modeling studies: The results from the previous section can be formalized into an intelligent database (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>) that will enable quick determinations of HEA coating solutions. As well, the work by Senkov et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>) is important since it provides a pathway to ‘identifying promising compositions for more time-intensive experimental studies.’ These conjoint approaches, i.e., database approach with alloy selection, are mutually validating since they accelerate the development of HEA exploration. This approach can be extended to novel materials that are suggested in the ‘Feedstock preparation’ paragraph above.</p><p id="Par155">Qualification and industrial adoption of HEA coatings: HEAs are on the verge of adoption in industries that address extreme environments that need to address wear and thermal environments (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>). Market expansion will arise where other functional properties are desirable, e.g., high-entropy alloy-based solar absorber coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>). Therefore, the unrealized potential of HEA applications will be more openly revealed as the unique materials properties of HEAs are discovered.</p><p id="Par156">A final comment concerning ‘Future Trends’ relates to the changing environment concerning the research method as it progresses from Technological Readiness Level 1 through to 9 (TRL1-9). HEA technology, overall, is approaching TRL7-8. TS-HEA technology is at TRL4-5, hence implying their optimistic future (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>). The mechanism that will support this growth is found on inter-disciplinary cooperation since there are many unknowns that need to be uncovered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Summary and Conclusions</title><p id="Par157">Thermal sprayed HEA coatings exhibit unique and outstanding properties in comparison with traditional materials and have established a positive commercial outlook in surface engineering within a short time span.</p><p id="Par158">This early-stage review on thermal sprayed HEA coatings focuses on HEA as feedstock and its synthesis routes with their properties, coating phase compositions along with microstructural development, and mechanical and oxidation behavior of HEA coatings.

Gas atomization (GA) is the leading processing route for HEA feedstocks. Blending, mechanical alloying (MA), arc melting followed by mechanical milling (AM-MM) are the other major HEA feedstock synthesis routes. While gas atomization delivers the widest particle size range, mechanical alloying results in a finer particle size of nanocrystalline character.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par163">The microstructural advancement of the APS, HVOF, WS, and CS HEA coatings is described in conjunction with their phase composition development. As reported, thermal sprayed HEA coating microstructures are composed of one or more solid solution phases. In some cases, mainly APS, oxides are also reported. The prime feature of the TSC is a lamellar microstructure with development of complementary phases that are revealed by atomic number contrasts.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par164">Mechanical behavior of the thermal sprayed coatings in terms of porosity, hardness and wear, along with oxidation resistance, is discussed. HVOF HEA coatings, with their dense microstructure, achieved the highest hardness. However, in most cases the hardness and wear resistance were superior to conventional materials due to the development of supersaturated multicomponent phases and different strengthening mechanisms. Excellent oxidation resistance of the thermal sprayed HEA coatings has displayed potential in replacing conventional bond coat materials.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par165">The major focus of the thermal sprayed HEA coatings has been to develop wear- and oxidation-resistant coatings, especially for high-temperature applications. In contrast, there are only two reports available on analyzing the corrosion behavior of TS-HEA coatings. Therefore, the corrosion-resistant applications for TS-HEAs have not been fully exploited. Also, fracture toughness, being an important mechanical property, to evaluate the flaw behavior within coating during deformation, has only been reported in one article. Thus, future studies that discover vital properties including not only fracture toughness but also creep, fatigue, and tensile strength are required for the formal establishment of thermal sprayed HEA coatings for different applications.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par166">Thermal sprayed HEA coatings have shown immense potential of being next-generation coatings within their relatively brief time span under development. TS-HEAs have demonstrated promise, especially for applications in extreme engineering environments. There is further scope to study their properties in situ by methods such as higher temperature nanoindentation.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par167">One of the major proponents of surface engineering is its ability to elevate the lifetime of an inferior part using a high-performance surface coating. High-entropy alloys are a recent addition to this field, with the potential to replace several traditional coating materials on the basis of their excellent properties. To this end, selection of elements and the proportion in which to alloy them is of great importance. Although HEAs were initially defined as equiatomic alloys exhibiting single solid solution phases, recent literature has evidenced superior strength–ductility properties derived from multi-phase non-equiatomic compositions. TS-HEAs have followed a similar developmental path, for example, incorporating post-processing treatment to enhance wear properties of the coating.</p><p id="Par168">The most commonly used base elements that confer high operational performance and phase stability consist of Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Mo and Ni, of which Co, Mo, and Ni are considered as strategic materials that are not only regulated by government policies but are expensive raw materials. The advantage of the thermal spray manufacturing route is that only a coating of 50-300 µm thickness is required, thus saving the need for expensive feedstocks. Likewise, experimenting with additional principal or trace elements, for example Ti and W, reduces quantities of these costly elements to achieve performance.</p><p id="Par169">The advantage of TS manufacturing revolves around their ability to have rapid buildup of an engineered surface in comparison with vacuum-based film technology such as physical vapor deposition (PVD). The costlier alternatives of vacuum or low-pressure plasma spray are currently adopted for spraying oxygen-sensitive alloys.</p><p id="Par170">The cost of an APS TS installation is moderate and either factory or field operations have been established globally for local niche markets. TS-HEA research is thus focused on employing APS while controlling the extent of IFO by optimizing composition and coating process parameters, to engineer desirable coatings economically. Additive manufacturing by cold spray is another venture for exploiting the advantages offered by HEAs without being uneconomical.</p><p id="Par171">Therefore, the feasibility of producing a HEA coating by TS within a production environment has been proven to be economically viable with many case histories documented (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>) for specific industries that use non-HEA feedstocks.</p><p id="Par172">Thermal sprayed high-entropy alloy coatings are in the initial stage of exploration.
