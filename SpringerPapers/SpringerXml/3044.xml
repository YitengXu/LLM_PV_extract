It has achieved its pre-eminence because it is cheap and widely available. Coal has been used as a source of energy for over 4000 years, but electricity production from coal only began at the end of the nineteenth century. Initially, it was based on steam engines, but with the development of the steam turbine, coal became the major means of electricity<index-term id="ITerm5"><term>Electricity generation</term></index-term> generation during the twentieth century. Many nations have built their prosperity based on coal. The largest users of domestic coal for power generation are China, the United States, and India.</p><p id="Par7">Currently, natural gas power accounts for 23.23% of total electricity<index-term id="ITerm6"><term>Electricity generation</term></index-term> generation and is forecasted to grow constantly. Due to the growth of global carbon emissions and the intensification of greenhouse effects around the world, several countries are actively taking measures to abate emissions. These have frequently used natural gas to replace coal, as its associated carbon dioxide emissions are 54% of those originating from coal-fired plants on average.</p><p id="Par8">In a gas-fired power station, air goes through a compressor, is mixed with natural gas in the combustion chamber, and burned. The hot combustion gases expand, driving the gas turbines and turning the generators to produce electricity. The waste gases are emitted to the atmosphere through the stack but can also be recycled in a steam generation unit so as to run a steam turbine in parallel. (This is called a combined cycle gas turbine plant, or CCGT.)</p><p id="Par9">Oil can be used for power generation in a plant very similar to a natural gas one.</p><p id="Par10">Whether it is coal, natural gas, oil, or biomass energy, they all have a common feature, that is, they turn the turbine through combustion so that thermal energy can be converted into mechanical energy and then further converted into electric energy, thus realizing the transition from primary to secondary energy. Natural gas can be recycled through air cycling and condensation.</p><p id="Par11">From the environmental protection point of view, natural gas and biomass are cleaner than coal concerning CO<sub>2</sub> emission. However, from the perspective of the total<index-term id="ITerm7"><term>Total cost</term></index-term> cost of electricity produced, a coal plant is the cheapest, and a gas-fired plant comes just after, because gas is more expensive to produce, transport, and store, even though it is the most efficient among all other types of power plants.</p><p id="Par12">In the following, we discuss the power generation process of these different types of power plants in details.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Alternative Electricity Generation Options</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Coal Power Plants</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>The History of Coal-Fired Power Generation</title><p id="Par13">The use of coal<index-term id="ITerm8"><term>Electricity generation</term></index-term> for power<index-term id="ITerm9"><term>Coal power plants</term></index-term> generation began in the United States in the 1880s, based on the same technology that was then used to create mechanical power from the steam engine. Coal was burned to raise steam and the steam used to drive an engine, which in turn drove a dynamo or alternator, which produced electricity. The first fully commercial electric power station was the Pearl Street station in New York, which was built by Thomas Edison and started operating in 1882. The Pearl Street plant used a Porter Allen reciprocating steam engine and dynamo to produce a direct current, which supplied power only for lighting.</p><p id="Par14">The next major advancement was the steam turbine, which was invented by Charles Parsons in 1884. Steam turbines allowed more efficient energy conversion and higher outputs. During the twentieth century, coal-fired power stations using steam turbines became the most important source of electricity across the globe. They remain the single most important source of electricity in the second decade of the twenty-first century.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Global Coal-Fired Electricity Generation</title><p id="Par15">World coal production increased in 2018 by 250 Mt., an increase of 3.3%, driven by increases in steam and coking coal production.</p><p id="Par16">Global coal production increased by 4.3% in 2018, significantly above the 10-year average of 1.3% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">6.2</xref>).

China has been the world’s leading coal producer since 1985 and retained the top spot in 2018, producing 3550 Mt. of coal in total, 4.5% higher than in 2017.

In 2019, the United States gas power generation accounted for 27% of the world’s total generation from gas, and for 6% of world’s total power generation.</p><p id="Par21">Russia is also rich in natural gas resources and suitable for gas power generation but ranks second in the world. Ranked third, Japan uses imported liquefied natural gas to boost its gas power generation, which itself has stimulated the development of the global LNG industry. However, Japan has the largest number of gas-fired power stations, which began using imported liquefied natural gas to generate electricity as early as the 1970s.

The share of natural gas in power generation is the highest in the Middle East (around 63%) followed by the CIS countries (mainly Russia and Ukraine). Due to the great differences in oil and natural gas reserves among different countries, the proportion of natural gas power generation in each country is also quite different (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">6.3</xref>).

Countries such as Argentina and the Netherlands, despite their high natural gas production, have other sources of electricity, and around 50% of their electricity is produced by gas. Countries with 20% to 40% of power production from gas are the United Kingdom, Japan, and Italy, while countries such as South Korea and Hungary account for 10% to 20%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Future Plans</title><p id="Par24">The trend of global natural gas power generation in the future may depend on the policy adjustment of countries to deal with global climate change and the flexibility of natural gas power generation required by the instability of new renewable sources (wind and solar), but the price of natural gas is high and discourages its larger application to power generation.</p><p id="Par25">On the whole, natural gas power generation has many advantages, such as energy saving and emission reduction, improving power supply security, cutting peaks and filling valleys of power and gas supply, and promoting the development of a circular economy, which is an irreversible trend in the field of modern energy. With the growth of global power consumption in the future, the absolute amount of natural gas consumption for power generation is bound to grow further. Although the growth rate has slowed, it will still account for the largest share of added power generation capacity in the world in the next decade or so.</p><p id="Par26">According to multiple scenarios, the overall rise in global electricity demand drives the rise in natural gas demand; notwithstanding the fact that the proportion of natural gas in the power industry is likely relatively flat at about 20%.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Biofuel-Based Power Generation</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Current Situation</title><p id="Par27">Biomass, which is a renewable energy source that has the potential of being CO<sub>2</sub> neutral, is normally used for power generation in association with other fuels in so-called co-firing systems.</p><p id="Par28">There are several successful co-firing projects in many parts of the world, particularly in Europe and North America. However, despite their remarkable commercial success in Europe, most of the biomass co-firing in North America is limited to demonstration levels.</p><p id="Par29">Biofuels can be divided into four categories. First-generation biofuels can be produced from rapeseed, grains, potatoes, sugar beets, and canes. These biofuels are made from oil-based plants, starch crops, and sugar. The fuel industry has to compete with the nutrition and fodder industries for these products. On the other hand, the production of second-generation biofuel is essential for limiting food versus fuel competition by using non-edible oil feedstock such as agricultural waste and residues. Second-generation biofuels are produced from non-nutrition products, mainly from straw, miscanthus, sedges, and energetic plantations, mostly from agriculture and forestry residues. The third-generation biofuels derived from oleaginous microorganisms have also gained attraction recently as the potential feedstock in generating fuel for energy production. They do not compete with food crops on arable land. Algae can be cultivated in wastewater and other residual water. Finally, fourth-generation biofuels are produced from genetically modified (GM) algae to enhance biofuel production. Although GM algae biofuel is a well-known alternative to fossil fuels<index-term id="ITerm11"><term>Fossil fuel</term></index-term>, the potential environmental and health-related risks are still of great concern.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Process and Technology Status</title><p id="Par30">Co-firing is regarded as the most attractive short-term option for power generation from biomass. It is defined as the blending and simultaneous combustion of biomass with other fuels, such as coal or natural gas, to raise steam and generate electricity. Biomass co-firing in coal power plants<index-term id="ITerm12"><term>Coal power plants</term></index-term> is by far more widespread and extensively proven than in gas-fired plants. Co-firing can play an important role in increasing the share of biomass and renewable sources in the global energy mix and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It also creates opportunities in industries like forestry, agriculture, construction, manufacturing, food processing, and transportation to better manage large quantities of agricultural and wood waste. The cost of adapting an existing coal power<index-term id="ITerm13"><term>Coal power plants</term></index-term> plant to co-fire biomass is significantly lower than the cost of building new systems relying only on biomass. Although a biomass dedicated plant offers significant environmental benefits, relying solely on biomass is risky due to unpredictable feedstock supply. Other constraints of generating power solely from biomass are the low heating values and the fuel’s low bulk densities, which create the need to transport large volumes of biomass.</p><p id="Par31">Co-firing includes three major technologies: direct, indirect, and parallel. The approaches differ in terms of the boiler system design as well as the percentage of biomass to be co-fired.</p><p id="Par32">Direct co-firing is the simplest, cheapest, and commonest option. Biomass can either be milled jointly with the coal (i.e. typically less than 5% in terms of energy content) or pre-milled and then fed separately into the same boiler. Common or separate burners can be used, with the second option enabling more flexibility with regard to biomass type and quantity. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">6.4</xref> shows that in direct co-firing technology, biomass is fed directly into the furnace after being milled either together with the base fuel or separately.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 6.4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Direct biomass co-firing technologies</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/474175_1_En_6_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par33">Indirect co-firing is a less common process in which a gasifier converts the solid biomass into a fuel gas that is then burned with coal in the same boiler. Though more expensive because of the additional technical equipment (i.e. the gasifier), this option allows for a greater variety and higher percentages of biomass to be used. Gas cleaning and filtering is needed to remove impurities before burning, and the ashes of the two fuels remain separate.</p><p id="Par34">Finally, parallel co-firing requires a separate biomass-fired boiler that supplies steam to the same steam cycle. This method allows for high biomass percentages and is frequently used in pulp and paper industrial facilities to make use of by-products from paper production, such as bark and waste wood. In parallel, biomass co-firing technology, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">6.5</xref>, biomass pre-processing, feeding, and combustion activities are carried out in separate biomass burners. Parallel co-firing involves the installation of a completely separate external biomass-fired boiler in order to produce steam used to generate electricity in the power plant.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 6.5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Parallel biomass co-firing technologies</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/474175_1_En_6_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Oil-Fired Power Stations</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Role at Present</title><p id="Par35">Similar to natural gas, oil is burned at power<index-term id="ITerm14"><term>Oil power plants</term></index-term> plants to create heat, which is then used to raise steam and turn turbines and create electricity. There are three kinds of oil products mostly used as power plant<index-term id="ITerm15"><term>Oil power plants</term></index-term> fuel: crude oil, diesel oil, and heavy fuel oil.</p><p id="Par36">Crude oil is extracted directly from the oil well in the purest condition. It forms the basis of all petroleum products, and it has more than 500 components. According to its sulfur content, crude oil can be “sweet” (low sulfur content) or “sour” (high sulfur content).</p><p id="Par37">Diesel oil is a blend of different middle distillates derived from the crude oil refining process. It is usually composed of light and heavy gas oil, light and heavy cycle oil, as well as vacuum gas oil.</p><p id="Par38">Heavy fuel oil (HFO), also known as “residual fuel oil”, is based on the high viscosity, tar-like mass, which remains after the distillation and subsequent cracking of crude oil in the refining process. As a residual product, HFO is relatively inexpensive—it typically costs 30% less than distillate fuels and less than crude oil.</p><p id="Par39">Oil-fired power plants commonly emit nitrous and sulfur oxides, methane, mercury compounds, and significant amounts of carbon dioxide. Similar to gas-fired and coal-fired plants, oil-fired plants require large quantities of water for the production of steam and for cooling. The use of oil at power<index-term id="ITerm16"><term>Oil power plants</term></index-term> plants also results in residues called sludge that are not completely burned and therefore require disposal in landfills.</p><p id="Par40">Roughly, 70% of oil-fired electric generating capacity that still exists today was constructed prior to 1980. Utility-scale generators that reported petroleum as their primary fuel comprised only 3% of total electric generating capacity at the end of 2018 and produced less than 1% of total electricity generation.</p><p id="Par41">Power plants<index-term id="ITerm17"><term>Oil power plants</term></index-term> that burn petroleum liquids (such as distillate or residual fuel oils) are generally used for short periods during peak electricity demand. Otherwise, oil-fired power plants operate mostly at low capacity factors because of the high price of petroleum relative to other fuels, air pollution restrictions, and lower efficiencies of their aging generating technology. Most oil-fired generators are either turbines or internal combustion engines used to supply power only at peak electric power demand or when natural gas prices rise due to local natural gas demand.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Oil-Fired Plants in Different Countries</title><p id="Par42">In the United States, more than 68% of the 36.4 GW of domestic oil-fired generating capacity is located in 10 states, primarily in coastal states with access to marine ports. When these plants were built around the 1970s, coal-fired generators were the main sources of electricity. However, coastal states (e.g. Florida) are relatively far from coal production areas. Since coal is primarily transported by rail, the cost of long-haul coal transport may not be competitive in these areas compared with oil delivered by marine modes. A fundamental shift in the perception of oil as a utility fuel occurred not only in the United States but in the whole world during the 1970s, when world oil markets experienced sharp price increases. Supply shortages during the main oil shocks (Arab Oil Embargo, the Iranian Revolution, and the Iran-Iraq war) also discouraged oil-fired electricity generating capacity additions globally.</p><p id="Par43">However, in Saudi Arabia, the Shoaiba oil-fired power facility, located on the Red Sea coast, is the largest oil-fired power plant and second largest thermal<index-term id="ITerm18"><term>Thermal power plant</term></index-term> power plant in the world. The Shoaiba project is a distinctive Saudi Arabian one. As a matter of fact, currently, very few countries are building oil-fired power plants, in part because of environmental concerns as oil burning is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. They are also unpopular because of price and supply uncertainty, which is not at all the case of Saudi Arabia, with huge domestic oil supplies.</p><p id="Par44">Iran, possessing significant fossil<index-term id="ITerm19"><term>Fossil fuel</term></index-term> fuel resources, has also consequently invested in utilization of thermal systems for electricity generation.

Base-load generators (the majority of coal power<index-term id="ITerm31"><term>Coal power plants</term></index-term> plants) are useful where there is a steady demand and a stable source of fuel, such as coal or gas, to power the generators. Electricity peaking stations (Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">6.5</xref>), also called peak-lopping plants, are power plants designed to help balancing the fluctuating power requirements of the electricity grid. Peaking stations typically operate in standby mode, and when there is a peak in demand for power from the electricity grid, they receive a signal to commence operation. Due to their flexibility and robustness, they are able to provide a rapid response to fluctuating demand. They are then turned off as demand declines.</p><p id="Par89">For example, oil-fired generators tend to be used to meet electricity demand during peak hours, and they generally have lower capacity factors and higher heat rates than most other types of power plants. They are installed in places where there is no easy access to alternative power sources and are mainly used as backup for uninterrupted power supply whenever there are outages. Moreover, these plants require only a small area to be installed and offer higher thermal efficiency compared to coal-fired power plants.</p><p id="Par90">In general, liquid fuel power plants have great dispatchability to supply electricity to the grid within seconds and can reach full capacity in minutes. Additionally, they have tremendous fuel flexibility, with the possibility of running with heavy fuel oil, light fuel oil, crude oil, emulsified fuels, or liquid biofuel. Some oil-fired power plants are capable of switching between fuels, potentially complicating the calculation of capacity factors. For instance, plants that normally burn natural gas may choose to burn oil (or oil products) during times of high natural gas demand.</p><p id="Par91">Natural gas power stations are also very flexible and their ramping time (from zero to full capacity) is short. The operation of single cycle mode, in which only one gas turbine is running, takes only about 10 minutes from start-up to full load and the combined cycle (running simultaneously both gas and steam turbines) takes 40–50 minutes. A natural gas<index-term id="ITerm32"><term>Gas power plants</term></index-term> power plant has good regulation performance and can operate in the range of 25% to 100% output without any problem. For example, a GE HA class gas combined cycle plant with an installed capacity of 570 megawatts can start in less than 30 minutes and increase or reduce the load at a rate of 60 megawatts per minute. Under some load conditions, provided that the load is at least 200 MW, it can still meet the emissions standard and stabilize the power supply and can also form a reliable backup with intermittent sources (e.g. wind &amp; solar) to promote the rapid growth of renewable energy. Besides, it can operate as flexibly as a liquid fuel power plant. It is also available in multi-fuel versions. When the gas supply is uncertain, or prices are volatile, it is possible to switch from gas to liquid fuel, and vice versa, even during operation.</p><p id="Par92">It is worth to mention that at present, gas power generation has some unique advantages compared to all other source of electricity. An example is the world’s first battery-gas turbine hybrid power generation system deployed by GE and Southern California Edison. It integrates a 10-megawatt lithium-ion battery energy storage system and a LM6000 aviation gas turbine, as well as the corresponding control system, allowing the gas turbine to be in rotating standby mode without using fuel and responding immediately to changing power dispatching requirements. When peak shaving is not needed, the gas turbine is in a rotating standby state (connected to the battery), and when the peak shaving is required, the gas turbine is immediately awakened from the rotating standby state through the advanced control system, and the gas turbine is quickly started with load, and the power is immediately transmitted to the power grid.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Location</title><p id="Par93">Coal power generation location is more restrictive compared to other technologies because coal is a solid and its transport cost is high, while its combustion efficiency is lower than for other technologies. Usually coal plants are located near coal mines and the choice of different means of transport will affect the location of the plant area as well as the size and form of the required land plot, especially for a large power plant. The transportation mode should allow for large volume, low freight, high speed, and flexibility, which will make the location of coal plant all the more difficult.</p><p id="Par94">On the contrary, oil is easy to transport with multiple transportation options including by pipeline and by ship; therefore, oil-fired plants are usually located in coastal areas. A gas-fired power plant is characterized by little land occupation and is very suitable for countries and areas with dense population and scarce land resources. Compared with coal-fired power plants, gas power generation equipment is more compact and does not occupy a large area. Besides, it consumes one-third of the water needed for a coal-fired power plant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Expected Service Life</title><p id="Par95">Thermal power<index-term id="ITerm33"><term>Thermal power plant</term></index-term> plants are designed for an economic lifetime of 30 to 40 years, but some plants have been also used beyond their design life in certain areas. The critical components are the boiler and the turbine. The operation of thermal power generation is faced with both tangible and intangible aging processes. Tangible or physical aging refers to the equipment operating under high pressure and temperature, and bearing mechanical stress, resulting in physical and chemical changes, such as wear, creep, corrosion, and so on, gradually making the equipment unable to continue operating safely under the required design parameters. Invisible aging refers to technological progress. The advent of more efficient or less labor-intensive production equipment means that older equipment will operate under less and less economic conditions. The physical aging of some equipment (such as condenser copper pipes, heater pipes, boiler heating surface pipes, turbine blades, furnace walls, etc.) can be removed during overhaul. However, it is often the aging of these important equipment components that determines the technical and consequently economic lifetime of thermal<index-term id="ITerm34"><term>Thermal power plant</term></index-term> power plants. Operating experience shows that the service life of equipment operating under 450 °C is between 40 and 50 years. For equipment operating at temperatures above 450 °C, the operating hours could even be reduced to 100,000 hours.</p><p id="Par96">Both gas and steam turbines are devices that drive the rotor to rotate at high speed through high-pressure gas with high temperature and humidity. The difference is that the pressure and temperature of gas in the gas turbine is higher than in the steam turbine. Taking the GE PG9351FA Class F gas turbine as an example, the gas temperature entering the turbine from the combustion chamber is 1327 °C and the exhaust gas temperature is 609 °C. This working environment at such high temperature and thermal stress aggravates the periodic damage to gas turbines. The material of thermal parts is deformed due to low cycle fatigue<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> and thermal stress, which increases the failure probability of different components and seriously affects the service life of the equipment. Moreover, for two-shaft peak shaving generators, frequent start-up and shut-down is also one of the main causes of shorter life. For gas-steam combined units, the life of the gas turbine, waste heat boiler, and steam turbine could be seriously affected by peak shaving operation. Finally, we should mention that the reliable operation and reasonable maintenance of gas turbine affects not only the safety but also the economy of the whole unit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par98">This chapter illustrated the fundamentals of power generation economics from different fossil sources.

The conclusion that can be drawn from the above discussions and the related recommendation is as follows:</p><p id="Par99">While general technology cost assessments can provide rough estimates, the actual cost of each technology is highly dependent on project-specific factors. Power sector planners should not underestimate the level of uncertainty when it comes to technology costs or future operating costs. Country-level analysis can provide a more accurate picture of the relative costs of each technology, but even then any forecast should be treated with care. Rather than attempting to pick the “best” technology, they should instead determine which technologies and fuels are well suited to their particular circumstances and then seek to create a diversified portfolio of options. Doing so can protect against major disruptions in any technology or fuel and help to balance capital and operational costs while mitigating environmental impacts.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>I would like to take the opportunity to thank those people who have provided helpful suggestions and data for this chapter, particularly my graduate students, Di Peng, Yao Xuebing, and Zou Zhiqin.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>Bibliography</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Valdemaras</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Astrida</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Tatiana</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Natalia</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Tadas</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">The impact of biofuels production development in the European Union</article-title><source>Agricultural Economics (Zemědělská ekonomika).</source><year>2018</year><volume>64</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>170</fpage><lpage>185</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.17221/285/2016-AGRICECON</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Agbor</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">A review of biomass co-firing in North America</article-title><source>Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews.</source><year>2014</year><volume>40</volume><fpage>930</fpage><lpage>943</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.rser.2014.07.195</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Washburn</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Pablo-Romero</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Measures to promote renewable energies for electricity generation in Latin American countries</article-title><source>Energy Policy.</source><year>2019</year><volume>128</volume><fpage>212</fpage><lpage>222</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.enpol.2018.12.059</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Freitas</surname><given-names>FF</given-names></name><name><surname>De Souza</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferreira</surname><given-names>LRA</given-names></name><name><surname>Otto</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name><name><surname>Alessio</surname><given-names>FJ</given-names></name><name><surname>De Souza</surname><given-names>SNM</given-names></name><name><surname>Venturini</surname><given-names>OJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Ando Junior</surname><given-names>OH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">The Brazilian market of distributed biogas generation: Overview, technological development and case study</article-title><source>Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews.</source><year>2019</year><volume>101</volume><fpage>146</fpage><lpage>157</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.rser.2018.11.007</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bórawski</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Bełdycka-Bórawska</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Szymańska</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Jankowski</surname><given-names>KJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Dubis</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Dunn</surname><given-names>JW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Development of renewable energy sources market and biofuels in The European Union</article-title><source>Journal of Cleaner Production.</source><year>2019</year><volume>228</volume><fpage>467</fpage><lpage>484</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.242</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR6"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Borychowski, M.
