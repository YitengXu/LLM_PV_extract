frequency protection for an islanded microgrid (MG) considering high penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs). In such MGs, the reduction in system inertia due to integration of large amount of RESs causes undesirable influence on MG frequency stability, leading to weakening of the MG. Furthermore, sudden load events, and short circuits caused large frequency fluctuations, which threaten the system security and could lead to complete blackouts as well as damages to the system equipment. Therefore, maintaining the dynamic security in MGs is one of the important challenges, which considered in this paper using a specific design and various data conversion stages of a digital over/under frequency relay (OUFR). The proposed relay will cover both under and over frequency conditions in coordination with LFC operation to protect the MG against high frequency variations. To prove the response of the proposed coordination strategy, a small MG was investigated for the simulation. The proposed coordination method has been tested considering load change, high integration of RESs. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of the presented technique was examined by varying the penetration level of RESs and reducing the system inertia. The results reveal the effectiveness of the proposed coordination to maintain the power system frequency stability and security. In addition, the superiority of the OUFR has been approved in terms of accuracy and speed response during high disturbances.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Digital frequency relay</kwd><kwd>Load frequency control (LFC)</kwd><kwd>Microgrid</kwd><kwd>Renewable energy sources (RESs)</kwd><kwd>Dynamic</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41601_2018_Article_93.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Systems</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In past, several cascaded blackouts happened in electrical power systems due to frequency instability in case of the imbalance between the electrical load and power supply or N-1 contingency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Nowadays, this problem increased after the growing of renewable energy sources (RESs), which have several impacts on the dynamic security of the islanded microgrids (MG). The dynamic security of MG is the ability of electric grid to maintain the system synchronism when subjected to various transient disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the dynamic security issues of MG. One of these issues is the lack of system inertia due to the high integration of RESs. Consequently, increase the voltage and frequency fluctuations, loss of generation source, forced load shedding, and short circuit faults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, RESs exchange electrical power to MGs through power electronic inverters, which cause higher power fluctuations than the traditional synchronous generators. Hence, if the RESs penetration becomes larger, the islanded MGs might become insecure as the stabilizing in system frequency and voltage is difficult in that situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, there will be unbalanced between the generation and load due to the variable nature of RESs. These changes lead to the appearance of challenges for the MG dynamic security such as, nature transient variations in MG. These variations are highly affected by the operation mode of MG whether grid-connected or stand-alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, the selection and coordination of conventional protective relays became more complex due to the frequent bidirectional power flow in connection feeders of MGs to utility grids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Regarding to the previous challenges, the stability and protection coordination issues have become interested and must be highlighted. Therefore, this work proposes a coordination of LFC and digital OUFR for maintaining the dynamic security of an islanded MG.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The microgrid dynamic security issues</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41601_2018_93_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par3">The frequency control and protection of the electrical systems are the two main sides to investigate the dynamic security of the MG system. There are several studies have dealt this problem from the control side such as conventional controllers with different algorithms and optimization techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], intelligent control, (i.e. Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and robust control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. X. Tang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] proposed a novel technique of frequency control, which is V/f droop control (VFDC) and P/Q droop control (PQDC) combined for islanded MG based on different energy storage devices. While, Sedghi and Fakharian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] used the coordination of robust control and fuzzy technique to address the frequency control issue in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Model Predictive Control (MPC) based LFC for MG based on the coordination of wind turbine and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) is proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] by Jonglak et al. Furthermore, Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] studied and analyzed the voltage security issue for MG using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).</p><p id="Par4">On the other side, the protection systems have changed significantly from the bygone decade and will change continuously as a result of the advancement of technology. Therefore, power systems designers are seeking to apply digital devices to handle the increasing complexity of power system, which improve the cost and usability. Subsequently, the digital technology has appeared in the protection system of microprocessor relays since 1980 and developing to those with communications interfaces in the a990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Today, digital relays have featured with high speed communication, which helped in replacing wires for safety interlocking, control and also circuit breakers tripping action. Furthermore, there are many applications of digital relays in transmission and generation system protection due to their flexibility, high performance level, and capability of operating under different temperatures compared to the classical electromechanical relays. Therefore, this study focuses on the digital protection device, (e.g. OUFR) to be coordinated with LFC for MG dynamic security. There are several studies have dealt this problem from the short circuit fault side only such as, the optimized time-based coordination of conventional over-current relays; which is the earliest protection technique for utility grids including micro-grids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This method has a limit in its ability of multi-relay protection because of its high sensitivity to components parameters in high fault levels. Sheng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] presented a multi-agent method depend on assumptions of high fault current levels. However, this method has been developed to island the MG for any fault in the utility grid and also disconnecting most of distributed generations (DGs) for faults within the MG. Furthermore, some studies handled the frequency protection problems such as; Laghariet et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] applied an intelligent computational technique for load shedding of the power system under faulted conditions. Moreover, Komsan and Naowarat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] discussed the same issue by using the rate of change under frequency relay to improve the load shedding scheme in MGs. Further, Freitas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] presented a comparative study of the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and vector surge relays for distributed generation applications. However, they faced a very hard task in relays coordination as their design may not detect the islanded conditions within the required time. Teimourzadeh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] introduced a new Region of Attraction (ROA) based protection zone for the detection of MG security status. However, the proposed approach is an efficient index for providing a quick detection of MG security status. Jose Vieira et al. in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] proposed the coordination of ROCOF and under/over frequency relays. However, this presented coordination has a drawback, which it did not compensate the frequency fluctuations within the allowable frequency limit due to the action of the relay is energized when the system frequency become out of the allowable limit. Such a problem can be overcome by designing the proposed coordination strategy of LFC and digital OUFR for an islanded MG system dynamic security.</p><p id="Par5">According to authors’ knowledge, some gaps still need to be filled in the MG dynamic security issue. Therefore, this paper proposes a design of digital over/under frequency relay coordinated with the LFC for the dynamic security of an islanded MG system, which consist of thermal power plant, PV, wind power generation (WPG), and domestic loads. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed coordination in protecting the MG against frequency variations, it has been tested under different scenarios of disturbances such as, high penetration level of RESs, reducing system inertia, and sudden load variations. The remaining of this paper is arranged as follows, Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> discusses the problem description. The structure of the studied MG system with the state equations are presented in Section <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref>. The coordination of control and protection methodology is described in Section <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">4</xref>. Section <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">5</xref>. shows the simulation results of the proposed coordination which applied to the MG. Finally, the last section concludes the results and advantages of the proposed method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Problem formulation</title><p id="Par6">The dynamic security issue is one of the most critical issues, which face the power system designers. Dynamic security refers to the ability of the electrical power system to maintain the synchronism when subjected to a sever trainset disturbance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, the dynamic security deals with disturbances that impose momentous changes into the system variables. Among these are short-circuit faults, loss of a dominant generation source, and loss of a large load. The system response to these disturbances includes large deviations in the system variables such as voltage magnitudes and angles, generator speed, and system frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Hence, the balance between the input mechanical power and the output electrical power is disturbed. And then, the mismatch makes the synchronous generators (SGs) either accelerate or decelerate.</p><p id="Par7">On the other hand, preserving dynamic security is different between the bulk power systems and MGs. In the case of the bulk power systems, the conventional synchronous generators are considered the source of the dynamics. Likewise, in MGs, the RESs are the host of dynamics. Moreover, most of the available methods for preserving the dynamic security of the bulk power systems are considered inefficient for MGs due to these methods are devised based on the features of the bulk power system, which are significant inertia constant and rather slow dynamics. Therefore, this research studies the dynamic security issue in the microgrids. In the MGs, the RESs exchange power to the MGs through inverters/converters. The power electronic interface-based RESs are static devices without any rotating mass so that the associated inertia constant is roughly zero. On the other hand, synchronous generators-based RESs are small-scale generators with noticeably low inertia constants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Such a low inertia constant renders the MGs more vulnerable to the transients than the bulk power systems. Furthermore, the power generation from RESs are unpredictable and variable, results in more fluctuations in power flow and frequency in the MG, which significantly affects the power system operation. Also, the randomly changes in load power demand caused a bad response to the PCC voltage, active, and reactive powers transfer. To solve the dynamic stability problems, it must be determined the effective factors, which steer the MGs toward the insecurity. These factors include a low inertia constant, frequent fault occurrence, and inadequacy of existing protection schemes. Moreover, the performance of the protection system is one the most significant factors which imperils the dynamic security of the μGs. Therefore, the stability and protection coordination issues have become a center of interest especially for power system researchers. Hence, this research proposes an efficient coordination of secondary frequency control (i.e., LFC) and the digital OUFR for an islanded MG security considering high penetration of RESs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>System overview and modeling</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Microgrid system</title><p id="Par8">The MG is a small power system, which consisted of Distributed Generators (DGs), domestic loads, energy storage systems (EES), and power conditioning units. The MG is distributed through low voltage distribution systems and the electric power is mainly generated by DGs such as photovoltaic (PV), wind turbines (WT), hydropower plant, fuel cells, etc. This research focuses on the islanded MG, which includes 20 MW of Thermal power plants, 6 MW of a wind farm, 4.5 MW of a solar farm, and 15 MW of domestic loads. The simplified model of an islanded MG with influence of the proposed coordination, the coordination of LFC and digital protection is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The studied model of the islanded microgrid with the coordination strategy</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41601_2018_93_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">In this study, some physical constraints effects are taken into consideration for modelling the actual islanded MG such as; the speed governor dead band (i.e., backlash) and Generation Rate Constraints (GRC) of power plant. Whereas, backlash is defined as the total magnitude of sustained speed change. All speed governors have a backlash, which is important for primary frequency control in the presence of disturbances. The GRC limits the generation rate of the output power, which is given as 0.2 pu MW/min for non-reheat power plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

The normal frequency deviations can affect the power systems efficiency and reliability, while large deviations can destroy the equipment, overload transmission lines and cause interference with the system protection. Therefore, the frequency control is divided into three main operations based on the size of the frequency deviations. The frequency deviation ranges and their control actions are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Whereas, the normal frequency deviations up to <italic>∆f</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub>, the power requirement is balanced by attenuating these deviations by the governor natural autonomous, which named primary control. If the frequency deviations more than <italic>∆f</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub> up to <italic>∆f</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub>, the secondary control (i.e. LFC) must recover the system frequency to its steady-state condition within the limits of standard time deviations. However, in case of large frequency deviations such as <italic>∆f</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub> and over, which lead to imbalances in active power during the fault periods, the LFC cannot maintain the system frequency. In that situation, the protection devices (i.e. frequency relays) may be activated and trip generators. This action will interrupt power system supply. Hence, there must be an accurate coordination of LFC or emergency control and protection scheme.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Frequency and control/protection actions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>Frequency deviation</p></th><th><p>Condition</p></th><th><p>Action</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>∆f1 (0.3 Hz)</p></td><td><p>No contingency or load event</p></td><td><p>Primary Control</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>∆f2 (1 Hz)</p></td><td><p>Generation /Load event</p></td><td><p>Secondary Control</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>∆f3 &gt; (2 Hz)</p></td><td><p>Large Separation event</p></td><td><p>Protection operation</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Protection scheme</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Modelling of digital frequency relay</title><p id="Par15">The frequency relay is a member of the protection devices group. It is used to protect the power system from a blackout in case of load loss, generation loss, or N-1 emergency. Furthermore, it is used in the MG network to detect the islanding operation, which occurs in case of DGs because of losing of mains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Moreover, the main threat occurs when a DG reconnected to the rest of the system without synchronizing operation at first. In the past, DGs are directly disconnected from the system due to over or under frequency problems. Recently, the continuous operation of DGs to supply domestic loads in islanded condition become necessary. Therefore, the use of digital relays has spread and become more widely used in the MGs as the digital relays can change their settings according to the abnormality conditions. Furthermore, recently, there are many applications of digital relays in transmission and generation system protection due to their advantages such as; flexibility, high performance level, and capability of operating under different temperatures compared to the classical electromechanical relays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The digital relay is a basic component in the digital protection system, which includes optical instrument transformer and a digital communication bus as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The current and voltage values are measured by the instrument transformer and sends the discrete-time data obtained from the data conversion system to the digital relay, which processes the data using algorithms such as for over/under frequency protection and overcurrent protection. When an abnormal condition is detected, the relay trips a circuit breaker and make triggering for an alarm.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A simplified digital protection

Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9(c)</xref> shows the frequency response of the studied islanded MG. Although, the dynamic response fluctuates beyond the allowable frequency limits at 600 s when shedding of a large load, the LFC can readjust the frequency to its normal value and the digital frequency relay does not trip as seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9(b)</xref>. This is because the integrator output value does not exceed the set value. Therefore, the LFC succeeded to readjust the frequency to its normal value.

On the other hand, the digital LFC was unable to control the frequency when the heavy load of 40% is applied at time <italic>t</italic> = 700 s as the system frequency fluctuated out of the given digital relay setting limits. Furthermore, the integrator output exceeds the integrator set time K. Therefore, the digital relay is energized and sending a trip signal to the generator circuit breaker.

The effect of half microgrid inertia through the proposed coordination of LFC and digital OUFR is investigated for the microgrid dynamic security.

Whereas, the LFC could withstand the fluctuations and return the frequency to its nominal value at initial time, and 100 s. However, it fails to restore the system frequency at 300 s with more load shed due to the two conditions for energizing the digital OUFR are achieved, which are the system frequency beyond the allowable frequency control limits, and the integrator output reaches quickly to the threshold value (5 s). Hence, the digital protection device quickly trips the generation units in this scenario to maintain the equipments from damage as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12(b)</xref>.<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Case D (<bold>a</bold>) Load disturbance, (<bold>b</bold>) Relay status, (<bold>c</bold>) Frequency response of MG</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41601_2018_93_Fig12_HTML.png" id="MO12"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par34">This paper proposed a coordination strategy of Load Frequency Control (LFC) and digital Over/Under Frequency Relay (OUFR) protection for an islanded microgrid system security considering high penetration of RESs. This coordination strategy is proposed for supporting the frequency stability and protecting the islanded MG against high-frequency deviations, which increased recently due to high penetration of (RESs), random load variations, and system uncertainty. These changes threaten the MG dynamic security and can cause under/over frequency relaying and disconnect some loads and generations, which may lead to cascading failure and system collapse. The simulations results proved that the proposed coordination has been achieved an effective performance for maintaining the MG dynamic security. Whereas, the LFC has been succeeded to readjust the frequency deviations to its allowable limits under different conditions of transients, load disturbances, and RESs penetration levels. However, in some cases of large disturbances and high RESs penetration, the LFC cannot maintain the frequency stability as the frequency fluctuates beyond the normal limits. In that case, the digital frequency relay trips the generation units. Furthermore, the results confirmed that the digital OUFR has superiority in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and wide range controlling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Nomenclature</title><p id="Par35"><def-list><def-item><term><italic>LFC</italic></term><def><p id="Par36">Load frequency control</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>MG</italic></term><def><p id="Par37">Microgrid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>∆f</italic></term><def><p id="Par38">Frequency deviation of the microgrid (Hz)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>D</italic></term><def><p id="Par39">Microgrid damping coefficient (pu MW/Hz)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>H</italic></term><def><p id="Par40">Microgrid system inertia (pu MW sec)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>T</italic><sub><italic>g</italic></sub></term><def><p id="Par41">Time constant of governor (sec)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>T</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub></term><def><p id="Par42">Time constant of turbine (sec)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>∆P</italic><sub><italic>C</italic></sub></term><def><p id="Par43">Regulating the system frequency (Hz)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>GRC</italic></term><def><p id="Par44">Generation Rate Constraint, % (pu)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>R</italic></term><def><p id="Par45">Droop constant (Hz/pu MW)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>T</italic><sub><italic>WT</italic></sub></term><def><p id="Par46">Time constant of wind turbines (sec)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>T</italic><sub><italic>PV</italic></sub></term><def><p id="Par47">Time constant of solar system (sec)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>RES</italic></term><def><p id="Par48">Renewable energy sources</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>OUFR</italic></term><def><p id="Par49">Over/Under frequency relay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>V</italic><sub><italic>U</italic></sub></term><def><p id="Par50">Maximum limit of valve gate (pu MW)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>V</italic><sub><italic>L</italic></sub></term><def><p id="Par51">Minimum limit of valve gate (pu MW)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>∆P</italic><sub><italic>M</italic></sub></term><def><p id="Par52">Change in Mechanical power</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>δ</italic></term><def><p id="Par53">Rotor Angle</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>∆P</italic><sub><italic>d</italic></sub></term><def><p id="Par54">Change in demand power</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>K</italic><sub><italic>I</italic></sub></term><def><p id="Par55">Integral control variable gain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>K</italic></term><def><p id="Par56">Integrator set time</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>F</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub></term><def><p id="Par57">Maximum frequency limit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>f</italic><sub><italic>min</italic></sub></term><def><p id="Par58">Minimum frequency limit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>ω</italic><sub><italic>o</italic></sub></term><def><p id="Par59">Synchronous speed</p></def></def-item></def-list></p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par60">This paper is funded by the higher ministry of education in Egypt.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par61">Data sharing not applicable to this article as no datasets were generated or analysed during the current study.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>About the Authors</title><p id="Par62">Emad A.
