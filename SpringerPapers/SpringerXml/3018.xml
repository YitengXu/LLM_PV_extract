organic–inorganic hybrid lead–halide perovskite (PS) solar cell, has attracted tremendous interest because of its combined advantages of high conversion efficiency, low-cost processing and the use of earth-abundant materials, which are critical factors for large-scale deployment of solar energy. The solar–electrical conversion efficiency of PS solar cells has been greatly improved to &gt;20% in a few years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In contrast, it took more than two decades of research and development to reach similar conversion efficiencies for first-generation crystalline silicon and second-generation inorganic thin-film solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, which are the main conversion technologies in the solar industry today. The PS material has organic–inorganic hybrid characteristics in many aspects of material science and device physics. It has a well-defined crystalline structure and energy bandgap, similar to the traditional inorganic polycrystalline photovoltaic (PV) materials such as CdTe and Cu(In,Ga)Se<sub>2</sub> (CIGS). However, unlike the inorganic materials that usually require expensive vacuum processing to produce high-quality materials, the PS material crystalizes easily from solution phase. This enables utilization of inexpensive processing such as spin-coating and printing, which has been employed for producing organic solar cells but with their current record efficiencies still below 13% despite great research effort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The hybrid characteristics are also manifested in the fundamental device structure. The design of a solar cell structure is decided primarily by the optical, electronic and electrical properties of the light-absorbing material, and it requires the optimization of the excitation, separation and transport of charge carriers. An inorganic thin-film cell is usually designed as either a planar <italic>p–n</italic> or a <italic>p–i–n</italic> junction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, depending on the minority-carrier diffusion length and doping concentration in the absorber. An organic cell is often designed in a bulk heterointerface structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, because of the significant binding energy of excitons compared with the thermal energy at room temperature. The excitons, with short exciton diffusion lengths, need interfaces in close proximity to separate into free carriers. These device structures are usually highly material dependent; high-performance devices cannot usually be achieved in alternative structures for a particular absorber material. However, high-performance PS solar cells can be made in both planar and bulk heterointerface structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. There is debate among the community as to which device structure is the most robust, thus a deeper understanding of the electrostatic potential within the device can guide device optimization. The PS cells with planar structure have reached efficiencies greater than 15–17% (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). Interestingly, the current record PS device has a combined structure of a mesoporous-PS layer at the bottom (in contact with the compact TiO<sub>2</sub> layer) followed by a planar PS-capping layer underneath the hole-transport layer (HTL)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. These characteristics of the PS cells are significantly different from both the traditional inorganic thin-film cells (for example, CdTe) and organic cells (for example, P3HT/PCBM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Two critical questions arise about this anomalous material: (1) are the photoexcited states bounded excitons or free-mobile electrons/holes? (2) Is transport of the carriers in this material diffusion-dominated or does it have to be field-assisted (drift)? Understanding these fundamental material properties is important for designing device structure and improving its performance. However, although the device efficiency has surpassed 20%, which is comparable to state-of-the-art crystalline Si and polycrystalline thin-film solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, understanding the fundamental device operation mechanisms is still in its infancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. First, there is paucity of characterization studies, as compared with the large numbers of publications for other materials that have been developed for decades. Second, because the device research and development is still at an early stage, variations in devices and materials induced by processing imperfections make it difficult to properly identify intrinsic material properties. For example, the superior devices of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3−<italic>x</italic></sub>Cl<sub><italic>x</italic></sub> over CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3,</sub> and the structure of a mesoporous Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> scaffold over the planar structure, are mainly due to the processing-dependent PS film quality, rather than the intrinsic material properties. CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3−<italic>x</italic></sub>Cl<sub>x</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> devices, either in a planar or scaffold structure, have both reached similar high performance with high-quality PS films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Third, some artefacts and modification of the devices during characterization can easily complicate the results and interpretations, which is expected to occur especially for the PS material with relatively unstable mechanical, structural and optoelectronic properties. As a result, the PS material may change significantly during characterization studies due to interactions with a probe, beam, electric current and/or field.</p><p id="Par6">In this report, we address the important questions mentioned above by profiling the electric potential (or field) across the devices using Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and by combining the potential data with the examination of device performance changes as a function of the PS absorber layer thickness. The high-performance devices we have studied ensure that the results are representative of the materials and device physics associated with efficient PV operation. The KPFM probe does not electrically interact with the materials, because the electric field between the probe and sample is constantly nullified during the measurement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. KPFM has been used previously to characterize the potentials at grain boundaries (GBs) from the top surface of the PS films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> as well as to study the potential distribution across the device stack by monitoring the potentials in the cross-section of PS solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. For the latter studies, inconsistent results of the junction types were reported with limited device structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These cross-sectional KPFM studies were based on profiling across devices without changing the bias voltage, which cannot exclude the influence of surface charges (defects) created on the cross-sectional surface during sample cleaving and preparation. Moreover, local facets of grains on the cleaved cross-sectional surface can have uncontrollable defects/charges in comparison with the top surface of the PS film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. To avoid the influence of surface charges on the measurement and interpretation, we have developed a procedure to measure surface potential changes by applying a series of bias voltages. In this condition, the change of the surface potential is about the same as the potential change in the bulk and the effect of surface charge can be excluded<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Our potential profiling results on both planar and porous devices with varying PS film thickness (from about 240 to 1,000 nm) show convincingly that the device physics of the PS solar cells resembles that of the traditional inorganic polycrystalline PV devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, where a <italic>p–n</italic> junction is located at the TiO<sub>2</sub>/PS interface and free-carrier concentration is on the order of 10<sup>16</sup>–10<sup>17</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>. However, unlike the polycrystalline cells, the diffusion length of minority carriers for thicker devices is likely shorter, which is presumably associated with poor carrier transport across the thick PS layer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>KPFM characterization</title><p id="Par7">Based on the atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique, KPFM measures contact potential difference between the probe and the surface of a solid-state sample by constantly probing and nullifying the Coulomb force between the probe and the sample. It maps the electrostatic potential of the sample surface with spatial and energy resolutions of 30–50 nm and ∼10 meV, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> shows a schematic diagram of the set-up. To profile the potential across the device, we cleaved the device to expose the cross-section. The cross-sectional surface should not be further processed (such as by being polished), as long as effective AFM and KPFM imaging can be adequately performed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. This fact is important for cross-sectional KPFM, because the KPFM measurements are highly surface-sensitive and any modification of the surface region may induce significant artefacts. For example, a treatment, which does not even significantly change the device current–voltage <italic>(I–V)</italic> output, may significantly change the cross-sectional surface region, because the change in the surface region may have only a minor effect on the overall device output. Our KPFM is set in a glove box with H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> concentrations of &lt;0.1 p.p.m., which helps mitigate the effect of humidity and oxidation that might complicate the analysis.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Schematics of KPFM and identification of bulk <italic>p</italic>–<italic>n</italic> junction by surface potential.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) KPFM set-up.

Any charges deeper than a screening length (in the range of hundreds of nanometres for most PV materials) should have negligible effect on the surface potential. In this characterization study, our primary goal is to profile the electrical potential in the bulk of the device to extract information about carrier separation and transport. Therefore, we must obtain information about the bulk property using a surface-potential measurement. To achieve this goal, we developed a procedure to measure the change in the surface potential induced by applying a bias voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>b</sub>) to a working device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The change in surface potential should be about the same as the potential change in the bulk, provided <italic>V</italic><sub>b</sub> is sufficiently small (such as 1–2 V). In other words, we can obtain the potential change in the bulk by measuring the change in surface potential, because the configuration of surface charges trapped at the localized surface states should not change significantly with such a small <italic>V</italic><sub>b</sub>. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref> schematically illustrates that the built-in potential of a <italic>p–n</italic> junction can be flattened by the surface band-bending (or surface charges), such that the bulk built-in potential (<italic>V</italic><sub>bi</sub>) of the junction does not appear properly on the surface (left panel).

This <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> value lowers the voltage output by ∼100 mV at the maximum power output point; hence reducing the FF by ∼10%. Although a mobility of 8 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> s<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>) of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> PS is a good value compared with most solution-processed organic PV materials, it is one or two orders of magnitude lower than the leading inorganic materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, which could be the reason for the shorter diffusion length in comparison with that in inorganic materials. It is worth noting that for a planar PS thin film (∼270 nm) a diffusion length of the order of 1 μm has been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, at this film thickness, the PS grain could span the entire thickness of the film (for example, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>), and thus the GBs will not likely play a significant role in charge transport across the thickness of the PS layer. When the film thickness is increased substantially (for example, ∼1 μm), the large number of GBs (for example, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>) will likely scatter transport across the thickness of the film, leading to reduced diffusion length in thicker films. A recent study shows that the optimum device architecture depends on the diffusion length, mobility-lifetime product of the absorber layer and their relationship with the absorber layer thickness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. To obtain such information, more fundamental studies are required in the future to verify the discussions above.</p><p id="Par22">As the planar PS thickness increases to 1 μm, FF is the most affected among the performance parameters (<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which is consistent with the poor diffusion length. The SEM image taken on the cross-section of the 240-nm device (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>) indicates a single layer of PS grains; the image on the 1-μm device (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>) suggests multiple grains in the device vertical direction. Therefore, scattering at GBs could be a contributing factor to the poor diffusion length, which is consistent with the discussion above. Developing PS films with a single layer of grains with different film thickness will help to elucidate the effect of the GBs on charge transport across the PS layer.</p><p id="Par23">Finally, we compare the PS device with the record CdTe thin-film cell (<italic>E</italic><sub>ff</sub>=21.0%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, with only small differences in the bandgap (PS is 1.55 eV, CdTe is 1.45 eV). Our PS cell has a higher <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> (1.07 versus 0.88 V), a lower short-circuit current density (<italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub>=21.6 versus 30.3 mA cm<sup><italic>−</italic>2</sup>), and lower FF (69.6 versus 79.4%). The high <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> indicates a proper carrier concentration and good junction quality. Since the bandgap difference of ∼0.1 eV at the bandgap of ∼1.5 eV should ideally lead to a <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> difference of ∼4 mA cm<sup><italic>−</italic>2</sup> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>), the observed substantially lower <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> value indicates inadequate light absorption, which is attributable to the thin absorber layer. Although PS absorbs light strongly, its absorption at the long wavelength range near the absorption edge (∼800 nm) is less ideal. This is also reflected from the external quantum efficiency spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM98">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>) for a thin (∼250 nm) planar device. It is clear that external quantum efficiency drops quickly at wavelength longer than 650 nm, suggesting that thicker PS films are needed for further improving <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>s</italic>c</sub>. The low FF can be ascribed to the nonideal field-assisted carrier collection associated with the poor carrier mobility. <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> should be improved by increasing the PS thickness. If the diffusion length and mobility in the PS material can be improved, a higher FF value in a thickened PS device is expected.</p><p id="Par24">In summary, we have studied the carrier separation and transport in PS solar cells—the fundamental mechanisms of device operation—by determining the junction structure across the devices. We found that the electric field in the planar TiO<sub>2</sub>/PS device concentrates around the TiO<sub>2</sub>/PS interface with a depletion width of ∼300 nm. This demonstrates the <italic>p–n</italic> junction structure and the minority-carrier diffusion/drift operation of the devices, rather than the mechanism of exciton separation at the interface. The electric field in the porous device covers the TiO<sub>2</sub>-layer/porous-PS interface, and the porous-PS and PS-capping layers, with amplitudes in the decreasing order of TiO<sub>2</sub>/PS-interface&gt;PS-capping&gt;porous-PS. This distribution of electric field is also consistent with the <italic>p–n</italic> junction at PS/TiO<sub>2</sub> interfaces in the device. Our results suggest that for thicker PS films the carrier mobility may be the limiting factor that needs to be improved for further improving device efficiency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Device fabrication</title><p id="Par25">Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (TEC15, Hartford, USA) were cleaned by immersing in a base bath (5 wt% NaOH ethanol solution) overnight, and rinsed thoroughly with deionized water and ethanol. A thin compact TiO<sub>2</sub> layer was deposited on top of FTO by spray pyrolysis using 0.2 M Ti(IV) diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) in 1-butanol solution at 450 °C. For mesoporous structure, 280-nm and 850-nm TiO<sub>2</sub> layers were printed using a screen printer by controlling emulsion thickness of the screens. PS film was prepared by adapting procedures from previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Briefly, planar samples (240 and 1,000 nm) were prepared through spin-coating 42 and 60 wt% of stoichiometric lead iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>) and methylammonium iodide in 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone/γ-butyrolactone (7/3, weight ratio) solution at 4,500 r.p.m. for 15 s. These films were then transferred into a diethyl ether bath for 2 min, followed by a heating at 150 °C for 2 min. For preparing mesoporous samples, the precursor was made of ∼44 wt% of 1:1 molar ratio of methylammonium iodide and PbI<sub>2</sub> in γ-butyrolactone/dimethyl sulfoxide (7/3 v/v). Substrates with different mesoporous layers (280 nm, 850 nm) were spin-coated at 4,500 r.p.m. for 50 s, and a drop of toluene was dripped during the spinning process. These films were then annealed at 85 °C for 10 min. The thickness of the PS film was controlled by changing precursor concentration (40–60 wt%) and spin-coating speed (2,000–5,000 r.p.m.). Then, a HTL was cast on top of the PS film by spin-coating a spiro-OMeTAD solution at 3,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The spiro-OMeTAD solution is composed of 80 mg 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-dip-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD), 30 μl bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt stocking solution (500 mg Li-TFSI in 1 ml acetonitrile), 30 μl 4-tert-butylpyridine and 1 ml chlorobenzene solvent. Finally, a 150-nm silver film was deposited on top of HTL by a thermal evaporator using a shallow mask.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>KPFM characterization</title><p id="Par26">The PS devices were cleaved to expose the cross-section for potential profiling across the device. In brief, we first make a notch on the device side in areas outside the device boundary, and then cleave the device from the device side (not from the glass-substrate side), so that the device was cleaved by tension rather than by compression. In this way, the cross-section of the PS device is often adequately flat for AFM and KPFM measurements.</p><p id="Par27">KPFM was employed for the potential imaging, which measures the contact potential difference between the probe (Nanosensor PPP-EFM) and sample by detecting the alternating current–voltage-induced AFM cantilever oscillation using a wide-bandwidth and low-noise lock-in amplifier (Signal Recovery 7,208). A negative-feedback analogue circuit using the cantilever oscillation signal (the lock-in amplifier output) as a feedback source generates the contact potential difference or Kelvin probe signal, which also constantly nullifies the cantilever oscillation. The workfunction of the probe remains unchanged during the AFM scanning. The sum of Kelvin probe voltage and alternating current–voltage (1 V) is applied to the probe. The image of the Kelvin probe signal represents the relative scale of the electrostatic potential on the sample surface. In our set-up, the first resonant oscillation of the cantilever (50–70 kHz) was used for the non-contact AFM (Veeco D5000 and Nanoscope V) topographic imaging. The second resonant frequency (300–500 kHz) was used for the potential imaging, which gives an enhanced energy resolution of ∼10 mV in the atmospheric pressure, compared with the conventional set-up using a low frequency of ∼20 kHz (∼50 mV). The scan rate is 0.2 Hz. The FTO layer of the device is grounded. <italic>V</italic><sub>b</sub> is applied to the device through the metal back-contact of the superstrate devices.</p><p id="Par28">When a bias voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>b</sub>) is applied to the device with extended amplitude and duration, the bias voltage may induce significant ion migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, which can complicate the results of potential profiling. To avoid this complication, we first took the potential profiling at <italic>V</italic><sub>b</sub>=0, and then applied <italic>V</italic><sub>b</sub> step by step in a small voltage interval (for example, 0.5 V) and short time interval (for example, 5 min). Then, the potential at <italic>V</italic><sub>b</sub>=0 was retaken to check no change in the potential image. The maximum reverse <italic>V</italic><sub>b</sub> was –1.5 V. The maximum forward <italic>V</italic><sub>b</sub> was +0.75 V on the optimized (and +1 V on the thickened) devices. We found no significant effect of ion migration under these conditions. This is supported by having no changes of the potential line profiles during the 5-min scanning and also by having consistent change in electric field when changing <italic>V</italic><sub>b</sub>. It is worth noting that the effect of ion migration under extended bias voltage amplitude and duration is expected to affect the potential profiling, and this will be a subject of future study.</p><p id="Par29">In addition, we have ensured no significant illumination effect on the potential profiling results. The measurement was carried out in the dark. However, there is a weak unintentional illumination of the AFM laser (1.8 eV and 100 μm in diameter). The cantilever width is 40 μm, which blocks the laser illumination on the area right beneath the probe tip. In this case, there is some leaking of light in areas of about 20 μm away from the area that is probed by KPFM. This distance is much larger than film thickness of the device. To be certain, we have also used a cantilever with a hammerhead shape, which blocks the entire AFM laser by the 100-μm-wide cantilever. The results are consistent with that using the normal KPFM probe.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Device characterization</title><p id="Par30">The current density–voltage <italic>(J–V)</italic> curves were measured by a source meter (Keithley 2400) under AM 1.5G illumination (Oriel Sol3A class AAA solar simulator) at a scan rate of 20 mV s<sup><italic>−</italic>1</sup>.
