So, apart from the treating biomaterials and tissues with plasma, we have studied the effect of soft plasma with different feeding gases such as Air, N<sub>2</sub> and Ar on modification of biomolecules. Hence, in this work we have used the soft plasma on biomolecules such as proteins ((Hemoglobin (Hb) and Myoglobin (Mb)), calf thymus DNA and amino acids. The structural changes or structural modification of proteins and DNA have been studied using circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence spectroscopy, protein oxidation test, gel electrophoresis, UV-vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and 1D NMR, while Liquid Chromatograph/Capillary Electrophoresis-Mass Spectrometer (LC/CE-MS) based on qualitative and quantitative bio-analysis have been used to study the modification of amino acids. Further, the thermal analysis of the protein has been studied with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and CD. Additionally, we have performed docking studies of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with Hb and Mb, which reveals that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> molecules preferably attack the amino acids near heme group. We have also shown that N<sub>2</sub> gas plasma has strong deformation action on biomolecules and compared to other gases plasma.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08221.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>15</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep08221" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep08221</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Supplying energy to gaseous medium leads to the dissociation of molecular bonds, resulting in the generation of fully or partially ionized gases commonly known as plasma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

These results are based on plasma created reactive agents including UV photons, reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), charged particles and electric fields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The APPJ exposure on the DNA molecule are studied for short intervals showed that it results to the DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Recently Han et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, reveals that APPJ can damage the aqueous plasmid DNA. DNA break increases as distance between the DNA and APPJ decreases and treatment time increases. Furthermore, lysozyme in the aqueous solution revealed the change in the structural information of enzyme, after plasma treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, studies have been reported for the horseradish peroxidase inactivation and heme degradation induced by discharge plasma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Hence, structural modifications in biomolecules on treatment with reactive species or free radical may vary from biomolecule to biomolecule.</p><p>In order to study the effect of soft plasma, we have studied direct effect of plasma on heme proteins such as Hemoglobin (Hb) and Myoglobin (Mb). These proteins are involved in the electron transfer and transport of oxygen in life processes. Certainly the most broadly studied allosteric protein found in nature is Hb<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Hb constitutes of seven non-helical and helical segments each in an α-chain, while each β-chain has eight helical and six non-helical segments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. While, Mb is a fairly compact globular protein whose backbone structure consists of eight α-helical segments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Hence, it is interesting to study these protein modifications using soft plasma as model proteins.</p><p>During the study of living cells in the presence of plasma, one of the main reasons for the cell death is DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. One of the explanations of DNA damage is related to the radical attack that involves metabolic changes in the cell and results to the initiation of nucleases capable of degradation of DNA. Breaking of single and double DNA-strand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> a consequence of the reaction with ROS is responsible for blocking the replication process that ultimately leads to the cell death<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. There might also be possibility of formation of the modified nitrogen bases on the reaction of ROS with DNA. Guanine (a component of a nucleoside, nucleotide, or polynucleotide (DNA, RNA)) in its free state, is susceptible to oxidation at C8 position and attack of ROS generated by plasma, thus results in formation of 8-oxoguanine or 8-oxoG ultimately leading to structural changes of DNA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p>Due to oxidative stress, the modification of DNA, proteins, lipids and carbohydrates are occurred<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Amino acid residues in proteins are highly susceptible to oxidation by ROS which are present as by-products of normal metabolic processes, pollutants in the atmosphere and produced by exposure to different type of irradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In order to understand the mechanisms of these ROS-mediated oxidations, many research groups explored the exposure of ionizing radiation to the solutions of amino acids, peptides and proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. It was observed that OH radical dependent abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the α-carbon of amino acids, aliphatic side chains of hydrophobic amino acid residues of protein and from the protein polypeptide backbone seem to be the possible initial sites of attack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. There are some studies of the plasma action on amino acids by different research groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. They observed the disulfide linkage formation and hydroxylation of amino acids after the plasma treatment. Very recently, Takai et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, found that APPJ can modify the 14 amino acids. They observed the hydroxylation, nitration, sulfonation, disulfide linkage formation and amidation in amino acids after the APPJ treatment using high resolution mass spectroscopy. However, there was no qualitative and quantitative analysis of the new groups originated after the plasma treatment using different type of gases.</p><p>Therefore, in this work we have tried to throw some light on the aspect that how the ROS/RNS created by the soft plasma affect the biomolecules directly. Modification of biomolecules such proteins (Hb and Mb) were studied by using circular dichroism (CD) (structural and thermal analysis), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), fluorescence spectroscopy, protein oxidation, gel electrophoresis, UV-vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS) and 1D NMR. Additionally, we can locate the attacking site of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on proteins using docking studies. Modification or oxidation of calf thymus DNA was studied by CD analysis and DNA oxidation. At last, we studied the amino acid modification using the most efficient technique such as Liquid Chromatograph/Capillary Electrophoresis- Mass Spectrometer (LC/CE-MS) based qualitative and quantitative analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>There are many studies highlighting the effect of ROS and RNS produced by plasma sources on the cells and tissues, while to gain an in-depth insight, the interaction of plasma with the involved biomolecules directly becomes necessary.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Reactive species generated using plasma in water and optical emission spectroscopy of a APPJ in the presence of different feeding gases</title><p>We have studied some important reactive species (RS) generated from the plasma in the presence of different feeding gases, as illustrated in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.

However, atomic O spectra were only observed for the Air plasma at 552.91 and 776.05 nm, due to the higher gas temperature in O<sub>2</sub> plasma. Hence, the number of electrons decreased during the formation of oxygen ions, that results in the shorter lifetime of active molecules found in Air plasma due to collisional quenching by oxygen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.

As seen from <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2a, b</xref>, the far-UV CD spectra of proteins indicates the deformation of mainly secondary structure of proteins due to different feeding gases. The CD spectrum is typical for a polypeptide chain, with two well-pronounced minima at ≈210 and ≈222 nm for proteins in water suggesting that the polypeptide chain is mostly organized in α-helix conformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The results in this <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> clearly reveal that after the Air plasma treatment the α-helical structure of both Hb and Mb increases and β-sheet decreases. Whereas, after the N<sub>2</sub> and Ar plasma treatment the decrease in α-helical structure and increase in β-sheet as compared to without treated proteins. Further, a more closer look at the observations reveals that the decrease in α-helical structure is more for Mb than Hb in the presence of N<sub>2</sub> plasma.

This further supports our above data that the change in the structure of the Hb is more as compared to the Mb structure after N<sub>2</sub> and Ar plasma. Whereas, the gel bandwidth has become thicker for both Hb and Mb proteins in the presence of Air plasma. This reveals that in the presence of the Air plasma the intensity of the bandwidth increases due to the formation of higher molecular weight carbonyls, similar behaviour is observed by the Chesne et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, for BSA oxidation.</p><p>The heme group is submerged in a hydrophobic pocket within the protein's interior.

Therefore, in this study, we performed molecular docking study to investigate if H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> modulates the target and identifies the binding site active pocket against the well-known human molecular target Hb and Mb protein receptor. This is theoretically validated by computational simulation process. The molecular docking technique is used to show the molecular insight of interacting compound with that of the target protein. This process is used to display the molecular interaction and also measured the interaction in terms of docking score or docking energy. Using molecular docking simulations, we successfully elucidate the orientations and binding affinities (in terms of docking score refer here as ‘total score’) of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> against molecular target Hb and Mb protein receptor.</p><p>The docking results for compound H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> against the target protein Hb exhibited high binding affinity docking score represented as total score of 3.1416 and also, the formation of three hydrogen bonds of length 1.9, 1.9 and 2.6 Å between backbone atoms of positively charged polar basic residue lysine (Lys)-99, backbone atom of nonpolar hydrophobic amino acid residue proline (Pro)-95 and valine (Val)-96, respectively.

While in comparison of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> effect with N<sub>2</sub> plasma, we observed that N<sub>2</sub> plasma has much more influence on the secondary structure of Hb and Mb as compared with 200 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. From <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, we already know that the maximum concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is 60 μM for N<sub>2</sub> plasma, but modification level is much higher. This shows that other radicals (O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>, NO, OH and ONOO<sup>−</sup>) also have a strong influence on the structural modification of proteins.</p><p>Moreover, hemes are non-fluorescent, while the heme degradation yield fluorescent porphyrin degradation product<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. We have evaluated the fluorescence intensity for heme degradation at ≈460 nm. We detected that fluorescence intensity for both proteins (Hb and Mb) in N<sub>2</sub> plasma is higher than 200 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S12</xref>). Hence, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is one of the factors for heme degradation, but for plasma, we have other factors also that increase the heme degradation. Rifkind group observed that O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> radicals are responsible for heme degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. In another study by Huang group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> found that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, OH radicals and UV radiation generated during the plasma treatment plays role in acceleration of the heme degradation for horseradish peroxidase protein. In our present study, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and OH radicals are much higher for N<sub>2</sub> plasma as compared with Ar and Air plasma. Hence, degradation of heme group is more for N<sub>2</sub> plasma as compared with other gas plasma.</p><p>Further, results from protein oxidation test and gel electrophoresis experiment reveals that different feeding gases can produce different levels of efficiently oxidants that generate carbonyls into proteins. Carbonyl levels in proteins can be increased by non-oxidative and oxidative mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. So, if we compare the carbonyl content in both proteins due to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. We observed that carbonyl content due to 60 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (the highest concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> observed during plasma treatment in all feeding gases, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) is much less compared to all feeding gases plasma. Among the feeding gases N<sub>2</sub> and Ar gas plasma has a high level of carbonyl content as compared with Air plasma. On the other hand, we observed that Air plasma has thicker bandwidth for both proteins, while the bandwidth is thinner for the N<sub>2</sub> plasma and Ar plasma. These results are explained by literature results that excess ROS increase the BSA fragmentation, that results in thin bandwidth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. While, control oxidation increase the bandwidth of BSA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Recently published work by Ye et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, observed that lower level of oxidation (carbonylation) could generate soluble protein aggregates that having less particle size. Whereas, higher level of oxidation would induce insoluble aggregates of protein, that results in higher molecular size. Similar results were observed for both proteins (Hb and Mb) that Air plasma has particle size is less or approximately near the control, but for N<sub>2</sub> and Ar plasma the particle size in more. As we have discussed above that it is due to protein carbonylation (protein oxidation).</p><p>Whereas, except in N<sub>2</sub> plasma we have not observed the quenching and red shift in UV-vis spectroscopy for soret band. In comparison with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, we observed that 60 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has no effect on the soret band (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figs. S14c, d</xref>). Hence, the presence of other radicals such as OH and ONOO<sup>−</sup> are the main factors responsible for the red shift in soret band for N<sub>2</sub> plasma. Our docking results also show that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> gets attached and oxidizes the amino acids near the heme group, which is one of the cause for heme degradation, as supported by other groups also<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. However, to check the amino acid modification in proteins (Hb and Mb), we have checked the NMR. We observed that peaks of both proteins are either shifted or vanished or become broad after the plasma treatment. While, same results we are not observed for 60 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This further indicated that other radicals that are generated in plasma with a combination of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has influenced on protein modification.</p><p>Moreover, the main cause of cancer cell death is DNA damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Hence, we have also checked the structural changes in ctDNA. The CD spectra shows that plasma have much more action of structural damage of DNA as compared with 60 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Similar way, the 8-OHdG formation is also high for plasma treated DNA, as compared to 60 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treated DNA. Although, among all the treated gas plasma, N<sub>2</sub> plasma has highest oxidation level as compared to other feeding gas plasma. Therefore, all these results of both proteins (Hb and Mb) and ctDNA show that there are some changes in the amino acid structure. Hence, we have also studied amino acids and observed that after treatment either amino acids weight increases or decreases, shown in <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. There are some cases like L-alanine has no effect of plasma, but might be in the given window, we have not observed the changes. Therefore, we have checked the quantitative analysis in <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, where we can observe the change in amino acids after treatment with plasma. The change in the weight of amino acids after treatment is due to oxidation, nitration, dehydrogenation and dimerization as suggested by literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Change in the molecular structure of Amino acids after the treatment with soft plasma.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08221_Fig8_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>In order to understand the mechanism of action of the plasma in different feeding gases, we considered the reactive species (RS) generated in different feeding gases to different extent. In recent work from Keider group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, they observed that the change in the plasma parameter such as voltage, flow rate and composition of gas has various effects on cells reflected by cell viability, because these parameters changes the ROS/RNS level to medium. Similarly, in our present work we have changed the feeding gases, that results in different extent of modification for proteins, DNA and amino acids. Among all the gases N<sub>2</sub> plasma has strong action, one of the reason is that N<sub>2</sub> plasma are excited the N<sub>2</sub> in metastable level of <inline-formula id="IEq1"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08221_IEq1_HTML.jpg"/></inline-formula>, which dissociate water molecules generating hydroxyl radicals and hydrogen atoms (detail calculation is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supporting information</xref>) as shown in <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (1)</xref>:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep08221_Equ1_HTML.jpg"/></disp-formula>with dissociation coefficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> of α<sub><italic>HO</italic></sub> = 5 × 10<sup>−14</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>/s and returning back to the ground state of N<sub>2</sub>.

Therefore, the presence of oxygen atoms in Air plasma reduces the OH radical density, results in less concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formation. Whereas, Ar plasma also reacts with water to form OH radicals and hydrogen atom, but the plasma density for the Ar is ≈10<sup>12</sup> to 10<sup>13</sup>. While for the N<sub>2</sub> plasma the plasma density is ≈10<sup>15</sup>, hence the generation of OH radicals in N<sub>2</sub> plasma is much more than Ar plasma and least for the Air plasma. Due to this action, we observed from <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> that N<sub>2</sub> plasma has highest H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and OH radicals generated followed by Ar plasma and Air plasma. However, our control experiments, we observed that the structural and chemical deformation for proteins and DNA are low as compared to the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has generated during treatment. And among all the gases N<sub>2</sub> plasma has highest modification level, this shows that OH, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ONOO<sup>−</sup> plays an important role in the structural modification of Hb, Mb, DNA and amino acids. On the other hand, NO is maximum for Air plasma (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S5</xref>), but the structural modification is very less, hence NO has no major role in structural changes. It is well that NO is removed with in second by reaction with oxyhemoglobin, during in vivo analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. There are many studies for binding studies of Hb and Mb with NO and their structural effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Whereas, the reaction between the NO and O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> produced the powerful and toxic oxidant ONOO<sup>−</sup>. Therefore, the presence of high amount of OH, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ONOO<sup>−</sup> for N<sub>2</sub> plasma results in high oxidation of Hb, Mb and DNA, followed by Ar plasma and least in Air plasma. As we have shown that during treatment, the pH of water becomes acidic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S6</xref>), so the peroxynitrite will be protonated to form peroxynitrous acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. This peroxynitrous acid is very strong oxidant that can react with biomolecules and make the number of complex systems and it plays very important role in protein carbonylation (protein oxidation) and 8-OHdG product formation (DNA oxidation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>.</p><p>These results show that plasma lead oxidation can modified and oxidized the proteins, DNA and amino acids. Due to oxidation, Fe (II) oxidized to Fe (III) and also degraded the heme group. The interaction between the heme groups and peroxide cause the pseudoperoxidase activity and plays important role in pathophysiology for many diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>.
