An almost complete genome sequence for a single, dominant GSB species (‘<italic>C</italic>-Ace’) was assembled from shotgun sequence data of an environmental sample taken from the O<sub>2</sub>–H<sub>2</sub>S interface of the water column of Ace Lake, Antarctica.

that are important in global carbon and sulfur cycling in natural environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">Pfennig, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">Overmann, 2006</xref>). The GSB are anaerobic photoautotrophs carrying out photosynthesis using light-harvesting chlorosomes and carbon fixation through the reverse tricarboxylic acid (rTCA) cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">Eisen et al., 2002</xref>). Chlorosomes are unique, light-harvesting antennas that are packed with bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) <italic>c</italic>, <italic>d</italic>, <italic>e</italic> and <italic>a</italic>, which enable photosynthesis to occur at low light intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">Blankenship et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">Bryant and Frigaard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">Frigaard and Bryant, 2006</xref>). GSB can grow mixotrophically through acetate assimilation in the presence of light and CO<sub>2</sub>. For these photoassimilatory reactions, most GSB use sulfide as an electron donor, although some GSB species are able to oxidize other inorganic reduced sulfur compounds (for example, sulfur, polysulfides, thiosulfate and tetrathionate), as well as hydrogen and/or ferrous iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">Frigaard and Bryant, 2008</xref>). The oxidation of sulfide results in the production of sulfate, and in some instances, the accumulation of sulfur deposits outside the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">Frigaard and Bryant, 2008</xref>). In some anaerobic aquatic systems, syntrophic interactions take place between GSB and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). When this occurs, the sulfate produced from the activity of GSB is used as a terminal electron acceptor by SRB, which in turn is converted to biogenic sulfide. GSB therefore contribute to the sulfur cycle by oxidizing sulfur compounds, and when they coexist with SRB they cooperatively create a complete sulfur cycle, a matter of importance in closed lake systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">Pfennig, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">Biebl and Pfennig, 1978</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Green sulfur bacteria are typically found thriving in freshwater and estuarine environments where light is limited, and the waters are anoxic and rich in sulfide. Their habitats include sediments, microbial mats, sulfide-rich hot springs and within a discrete zone of the water column of stratified lakes where light is able to penetrate to the anoxic zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">Wahlund et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">Ward et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">Vila et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">Mallorqui et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">Martínez-Alonso et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">Musat et al., 2008</xref>). GSB have also been identified in marine environments where light penetration is very limited, at the chemocline of the Black Sea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">Manske et al., 2005</xref>), and in the benthos near deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Pacific Ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">Beatty et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">In East Antarctica, an area called the Vestfold Hills contains numerous marine-derived saline lakes that were formed when the ocean receded approximately 5700 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">Gibson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">Rankin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">Cavicchioli, 2006</xref>). Fjords connected to the ocean also cut across the Vestfold Hills. Ellis Fjord is 10 km long, up to 100 m deep and has become a stratified system due to its restricted opening (less then 4 m deep) to the ocean (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">Burke and Burton, 1988b</xref>). In more than a dozen of the stratified systems that have anoxic bottom waters (lakes, marine basins and fjords), members of the Chlorobiaceae (that is, <italic>Chlorobium limicola</italic> and <italic>Chlorobium vibrioforme</italic>) have been reported to be the dominant type of GSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">Burke and Burton, 1988a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1988b</xref>). In Ellis Fjord, the O<sub>2</sub>–H<sub>2</sub>S interface where GSB have been observed is at a depth of ∼40 m beneath the surface where measurable quantities of light (0.1 μE m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) have been detected during summer. <italic>Chlorobium</italic> species have been grown from samples taken at a depth of 100 m below the surface, and based on rates of sedimentation, the GSB in Ellis Fjord were predicted to have survived in the dark for &gt;4.5 years. The capacity of the <italic>Chlorobium</italic> species to dominate has been speculated to be due to a superior ability to harvest the intensity and wavelength of available light during the Antarctic summer (for example, compared to members of the <italic>Chromatiaceae</italic>), and to remain viable during winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">Burke and Burton, 1988a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1988b</xref>). Isolated <italic>Chlorobium</italic> species have been noted for their ability to grow well in hypersaline water at −2 °C, and to grow at very low light intensities (&lt;1 μE m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">Burke and Burton, 1988a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1988b</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">Ace Lake (in the Vestfold Hills) is the most thoroughly studied meromictic lake in Antarctica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">Rankin et al., 1999</xref>), and it is the subject of a comprehensive environmental genomic/proteomic program. The lake surface remains covered in approximately 2 m of ice for about 10–11 months (February/March–December) of the year and usually (but not always) melts out during summer (January) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">Gibson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">Rankin et al., 1999</xref>). Mixing in the upper waters of the lake is caused by exclusion of salt from the forming ice cover in winter, and by wind mixing when the lake is ice free. A strong mid-water halocline prevents penetration of mixing to deeper waters. The oxygen content in surface waters of the lake is high, and rapidly decreases at the chemocline where a pronounced O<sub>2</sub>–H<sub>2</sub>S interface exists. Phytoplankton species (for example, <italic>Pyramimonas gelicola</italic>, <italic>Mesodinium rubrum</italic>), cyanobacteria and photosynthetic microorganisms in microbial mats (for example, cyanobacteria, diatoms, algae) are likely to contribute to primary production in the oxic zone of the lake. Primary productivity measurements of Ace Lake indicate that the autotrophic ciliate, <italic>M. rubrum</italic>, which has also been found in Antarctic waters is a major contributor to carbon fixation (15–40%) during its bloom period over summer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">Labourn-Parry and Perriss, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">Rankin et al., 1999</xref>). Autotrophic primary producers convert inorganic carbon to biomass (0.16–0.68 mgC m<sup>−3</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>), and in the process release dissolved organic carbon by the action of predation and viral lysis (dissolved organic carbon: 6–11.5 mgC l<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">Rankin et al., 1999</xref>). Owing to physical stability, dissolved organic carbon is likely to cycle within the aerobic zone. Dead cell material from all organisms and fecal pellets (<italic>P. antarctica</italic>) forms particulate organic carbon that gradually sinks (particulate organic carbon: 0.22–0.73 mgC l<sup>−1</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">Rankin et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">At the interface, a brief period (∼6 weeks) of high light intensity occurs after the ice cover has melted during summer allowing maximum light penetration (maximum recorded ∼100 μmol of photons m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>1</sup>) and enabling the most rapid growth of photosynthetic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">Burke and Burton, 1988b</xref>). The lake experiences a longer period of intermediate light intensity (&lt;30 μmol of photons m<sup>2</sup> s<sup>1</sup>) over summer when the ice cover has not melted, and a period (∼6 weeks) of almost complete darkness during winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">Burke and Burton, 1988b</xref>). <italic>Chlorobium</italic> species of GSB have been identified at this O<sub>2</sub>–H<sub>2</sub>S interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">Burke and Burton, 1988b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">Coolen et al., 2006</xref>), and sulfate reduction by SRB has been reported in the region below the chemocline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">Franzmann et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">Rankin et al., 1999</xref>). No axenic cultures of GSB have been obtained from Ace Lake or any of the systems in the Vestfold Hills, limiting physiological and molecular analyses. In contrast, mesophilic and thermophilic counterparts are available, including the complete genome sequences of 12 GSB species that range in size from 1.97 Mb for <italic>Prosthechochloris vibrioformis</italic> DSM 265 to 3.3 Mb for <italic>Chloroherpeton thalassium</italic> ATCC 35110. The first and most comprehensively characterized genome sequence is for the thermophile, <italic>Chlorobaculum tepidum</italic> TLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">Eisen et al., 2002</xref>), which was isolated from a hot spring in New Zealand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">Wahlund et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">In this study, microbial biomass was sampled from the turbidity peak coinciding with the halocline and oxycline in Ace Lake, and analyzed by metagenomic sequencing and metaproteomic mass spectrometry. The sample was highly enriched for a single, dominant bacterium (referred to as ‘<italic>C</italic>-Ace’) enabling a large assembly for a composite genome of the bacterium and high coverage of the proteome to be achieved. As a result we have been able to assemble a hypothetical model of the active biological processes mediated by <italic>C</italic>-Ace and propose a number of adaptive strategies it may use in response to physiochemical conditions prevailing in the lake, including seasonal changes in solar radiation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Antarctic samples</title><p id="Par8">Water samples were collected from Ace Lake (68° 28.33′ S, 78° 11.29′ E), Vestfold Hills, Antarctica on 22 December 2006.

Further, the 10 most frequently assigned organisms were all from the Chlorobiaceae family, accounting for 85% of all assignments.

These SRB had a high proportion of genes involved in motility, chemotaxis and degradation of chlorinated aromatic compounds, indicating the SRB can use recalcitrant compounds (possibly deposited as the remains of zooplankton and phytoplankton from the upper aerobic zone) as a carbon source while cycling sulfate to sulfide.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Oxidative stress</title><p id="Par43">The dissolved O<sub>2</sub> concentration measured at the time of sampling was ∼0.4 m<sc>M</sc> at the surface and ∼0.2 m<sc>M</sc> at the 12.7 m sampling depth (data not shown). Owing to its position near the steep oxycline in the lake, and its obligate anaerobic metabolism, <italic>C</italic>-Ace may be prone to oxidative stress by reactive oxygen species generated as a result of the low potential of electron transfers typical of anaerobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">Imlay, 2003</xref>). Several oxidative stress proteins that may fulfill roles in oxidative defense were identified in the metaproteome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM10">Supplementary Table S3</xref>): a superoxide dismutase (159801535), catalase-peroxidase/hydroperoxidase I (159801779), alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (159802085), thiol peroxidase (159802716), thioredoxins (159801715, 159801555) and thioredoxin reductase (159801713). A number of <italic>C</italic>-Ace proteins contain FeS clusters (for example, chlorosome RC, coenzymes, bacteriochlorophylls), which are extremely sensitive to attack by the superoxide radical, O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>. The removal of O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> is catalyzed by superoxide dismutase enzymes through the dismutation of O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> to hydrogen peroxide, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is still potentially toxic to the cell and can be converted to H<sub>2</sub>O and O<sub>2</sub> by catalase-peroxidase/hydroperoxidase I. Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, thiol peroxidase and thioredoxins are able to reduce other organic hydroperoxides and may also catalyze the conversion of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">Farr and Kogoma, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Alkyl hydroperoxide reductase has also been shown to scavenge endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">Li et al., 2009</xref>). In <italic>C. tepidum</italic>, chlorobactene has also been shown to function as a photoprotectant, and specific quinones within the chlorosome have an even larger role in providing a mechanism to quench the excited states of chlorosomes (on exposure to light and O<sub>2</sub>) preventing the production of singlet oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">Frigaard and Bryant, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">Li et al., 2009</xref>). Similar mechanisms may be used by <italic>C</italic>-Ace to counter oxidative damage if cells are exposed to O<sub>2</sub> during summer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Genes that do not match known GSB</title><p id="Par44">Among the 71 genes that were assigned to phyla distinct from GSB in the Chlorobiaceae family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM10">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM10">Supplementary Table S2</xref>), a number of them provided clues about possible mechanisms of adaptation. In <italic>C</italic>-Ace, six genes were predicted to be involved in capsular polysaccharide formation and lipopolysaccharide production: putative capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis protein, mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase, UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine 2-epimerase, UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<sc>D</sc>-mannosamine dehydrogenase, GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase and a putative glycosyltransferase (genes 169800457, 159800859, 159800861, 159800863, 159800461 and 159800467 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM10">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The presence of these genes may indicate a requirement for polysaccharide structures distinct from other known members of the Chlorobiaceae as a mechanism for achieving cold adaptation. Genome evolution through lateral gene transfer was reported to be important for cold adaptation of <italic>Methanococcoides burtonii</italic>; a methanogen isolated from the bottom waters of Ace Lake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">Allen et al., 2009</xref>). Consistent with the analysis of the <italic>C</italic>-Ace genome, the acquisition of polysaccharide biosynthesis genes by lateral gene transfer was linked to the ability of <italic>M. burtonii</italic> to grow at low temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">Allen et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="Par45">Genes encoding the three subunits (M, S and R) of a type I DNA restriction and modification (RM) system were arranged in <italic>C</italic>-Ace genome in the order: subunit R (159800462), subunit S (159800469), a gene with a DNA-binding domain (159800473) and subunit M (159800475). In addition, two copies of a <italic>res</italic> gene (159801046 and 159802022), belonging to one of the two subunits (Res and Mod) of a type III restriction enzyme complex were present in the genome. One possibility is that these defense mechanisms help protect <italic>C</italic>-Ace against bacteriophage attack over the dark winter period, when cell replication has effectively ceased. An ABC transporter for the uptake of iron was also encoded in the <italic>C</italic>-Ace genome (159802314, 159802318, 159802322). The ability to import iron is essential for the synthesis of heme groups and the Fe-S clusters of RCs of the light-harvesting units in GSB. Another gene encoding the periplasmic component of an ABC transporter (159802310) involved in nitrate/sulfonate/bicarbonate uptake was also identified. In the <italic>M. burtonii</italic> genome, the Defence mechanisms COG category was overrepresented compared to genomes from archaeal thermophiles and hyperthermophiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">Allen et al., 2009</xref>). The individual COGs were mainly from type I RM systems, and specific ABC transporters. The presence of specific polysaccharide biosynthesis, RM system and ABC transporter genes in <italic>C</italic>-Ace and <italic>M. burtonii</italic>, is consistent with them having a role in cold adaptation in both archaea and bacteria, and argues for further experimental work to be performed to test these inferences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par46">The ability to perform metaproteomics with matching metagenome data for an environmental community consisting largely of a single GSB, <italic>C</italic>-Ace, has allowed us to construct a working model describing the protein complement required for thriving under cold, nutrient- and O<sub>2</sub>-limited, and extreme light conditions (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The success of GSB has been attributed to the extremely efficient light capturing abilities of the chlorosomes, which allows growth at extremely low light intensities, and (for those GSB that have a Dsr system) the efficient and complete oxidation of sulfur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">Frigaard and Bryant, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>). The survival strategy for <italic>C</italic>-Ace during the winter months depends on building up sufficient biomass to remain viable during winter and re-commence growth when sufficient light resumes later in the season. Although this capacity has been inferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">Burke and Burton, 1988a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1988b</xref>), the pathways that facilitate an obligate phototrophic metabolism of GSB, mixotrophic assimilation of simple carbon compounds and sulfide oxidation in Antarctic GSB have been mapped out for the first time, in <italic>C</italic>-Ace.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Overview of the biology of <italic>C</italic>-Ace.

Metabolic conservatism is a hallmark of an oligotrophic physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">Lauro et al., 2009</xref>), and <italic>C</italic>-Ace can generate biomass from a narrow pool of ubiquitous substrates (for example, CO<sub>2</sub>, acetate, pyruvate). The metabolic efficiency is further underscored by having CO<sub>2</sub> fixation and the generation of the carbon skeleton for amino-acid biosynthesis being served by a single pathway that can be turned in either reductive or oxidative directions. The rTCA cycle for carbon assimilation has been considered the primordial pathway for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, and to have its origins in anaerobic environments rich in H<sub>2</sub>S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">Wächtershäuser, 1990</xref>). The metaproteome data for <italic>C</italic>-Ace also indicate that although the 2-oxoglutarate necessary for ammonia assimilation could be obtained from the rTCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">Overmann, 2006</xref>), this precursor can be generated through the less energy-intensive oxidative route.</p><p id="Par48">This study identified traits that are likely to be specifically important for adaptation to the cold and the proliferation of <italic>C</italic>-Ace in Ace Lake. This included proteins involved in DNA processing, nucleic acid binding and folding/refolding of proteins at low temperature. Analysis of the lipid biosynthesis pathways, and particularly the synthesis of FabF, shows that cold adaptation in <italic>C</italic>-Ace is likely to be mediated by the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids to facilitate the maintenance of membrane fluidity at low temperatures. Cold adaptation also appears to have involved the acquisition of specific polysaccharide biosynthesis genes, RM systems and certain ABC transporters.</p><p id="Par49">The stable stratification of Ace Lake and the biotic and abiotic conditions prevailing at the chemocline have not only selected for a very low complexity community, but have enabled a high-density population to develop; turbidity in this zone is far greater than anywhere else in the water column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">Rankin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">Coolen et al., 2006</xref>). The capacity for a single genotype to rise to such dominance while the ecosystem sustains the growth of distinct populations in the water column above and below highlights the evolutionary specialization that can occur in an otherwise physically continuous aquatic system. To achieve this, <italic>C</italic>-Ace has evolved physiological traits that promote its ability to compete very effectively with other GSB and gain dominance, while evolving a syntrophic relationship with SRB that relies on the exchange of sulfur compounds with neighbors within proximity and deeper into the anaerobic zone. <italic>C</italic>-Ace also appears to possess oxidative stress response mechanisms capable of protecting against damaging oxygen species that may occur due to its proximity to the aerobic zone.</p><p id="Par50">The study provides solid foundation for comparative studies of GSB in other Antarctic lakes (for example, Clear, McCallum, Abraxas, Pendant, Burton, Fletcher) and marine basins (for example, Ellis Fjord, Taynaya Bay), where populations are reported to be abundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">Burke and Burton, 1988b</xref>). These different systems vary in geochemical and physical properties (for example, salinity, depth, temperature, light quality, reduced sulfur compounds) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">Burke and Burton, 1988a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1988b</xref>). Extending comparisons to low light-adapted, marine GSB, such as those found at the chemocline of the Black Sea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">Manske et al., 2005</xref>) or near a deep-sea hydrothermal vent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">Beatty et al., 2005</xref>), will help establish how GSB have evolved in response to important global ecological factors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank John Bowman, Louise (Cromer) Newman, Anthony Hull, John Rich and Martin Riddle in providing helpful discussion and logistical support associated with the Antarctic expedition.
