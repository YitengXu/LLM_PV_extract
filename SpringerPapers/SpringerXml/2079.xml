Recently, rapid progress has been made in perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs), with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) reaching more than 20% through suppression of non-radiative recombination and improvement of light out-coupling efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In addition to high efficiency, it is also important to achieve PeLEDs with long operational stability, a key factor towards practical applications. However, improving operational stability of PeLEDs is still a major challenge, and obtaining PeLEDs with both high efficiency and long operational stability remains elusive.</p><p id="Par4">From the materials point of view, a highly luminescent and stable perovskite film is essential to achieve PeLEDs with both high efficiency and long operational stability. Several approaches have been attempted towards this direction, including mixed A-site cations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, all-inorganic perovskites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, perovskite–polymer bulk heterostructures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, quasi-core/shell structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, etc. Unfortunately, most of these approaches lead to either low efficiency or poor device stability. Not until very recently did rational additive engineering enable PeLEDs with both high efficiency and long operational stability in a few reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Herein, we develop an effective approach, i.e., perovskite-molecule composite (PMC) thin films, for efficient and stable PeLEDs. Our PMC films consist of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI<sub>3</sub>) perovskite nanocrystal islands embedded in an electron-transport molecular matrix of 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl sulfone (DDS). We find that DDS controls nucleation process of the perovskite nanocrystals, leading to the formation of PMC thin films with enhanced PLQEs and prolonged PL lifetime. Moreover, this PMC structure shows impressive structural stability of α-phase FAPbI<sub>3</sub> for over half a year in ambient air with relative humidity of 20–80%. By employing the PMC thin films as emissive layers, we achieve LEDs with a peak EQE of 17.3% and half-lifetime (<italic>T</italic><sub>50</sub>, the time it takes until the light output reaches 50% of the maximum output) of 100 h at a constant current density of 20 mA cm<sup>–2</sup> (initial radiance of 15 W m<sup>−2</sup> sr<sup>−1</sup>). Considering the huge library of molecular semiconductors developed in organic LEDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, more efficient and stable PMC thin films can be expected for achieving high-performance PeLEDs. In addition, from the device point of view, we find that the degradation mechanism of PeLEDs at high driving voltages is different from that at low driving voltages. Our findings in both materials and devices will spur further developments of PeLEDs with high efficiency and long operational stability for practical applications in lighting and display.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>PMC thin films</title><p id="Par6">The PMC thin films are prepared by facile one-step spin-coating from precursor solutions of formamidinium iodide (FAI), lead iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>), and DDS dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (<italic>x</italic> DDS films, where <italic>x</italic> = 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0, denote the films prepared with a DDS:Pb<sup>2+</sup> molar ratio of <italic>x</italic>:1.0; see the “Methods” section for details). Diphenyl sulfone is widely used as an electron-transport building block in molecular semiconductors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and its derivatives such as di(4-(4-diphenylaminophenyl) phenyl) sulfone have been reported as efficient blue emissive molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In this study, a diphenyl sulfone derivative, DDS (the chemical structure shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), is chosen as the target molecular semiconductor due to its high singlet and triplet energies of 3.59 and 2.95 eV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, respectively, avoiding energy transfer from the perovskite nanocrystals to the molecule. In addition, DDS retains the electron-transport property of diphenyl sulfone (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), while its amino group can help to control the growth of perovskite nanocrystals through chemical bonding with the perovskite, as will be discussed later.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Morphology of PMC thin films.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Molecular structure of DDS. <bold>b</bold> Top-view SEM images of perovskite films.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, the control film (FAPbI<sub>3</sub>) without DDS is a reticular film composed of irregularly shaped particles. The bright areas in this SEM image are attributed to the parts of the polyethylenimine ethoxylated-modified zinc oxide nanoparticles (PEIE-ZnO) layer which are not covered by FAPbI<sub>3</sub>. With addition of DDS, the perovskite particles adopt a cuboid shape. In contrast to the control film, the perovskite grains in the PMC thin films are unambiguously bright while the uncovered areas become dark with the addition of DDS.

We take the 1.0 DDS film as an example, which shows the best efficiency and stability among all our devices. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> is a bright-field TEM image which shows the device structure of an LED based on the 1.0 DDS film. From the bottom to the top, the layers are indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEIE-ZnO (approximately 50 nm)/emissive layer (approximately 70 nm)/poly(9,9-dioctyl-fluorene-co-N-(4-butylphenyl) diphenylamine) (TFB; approximately 60 nm)/molybdenum oxide (MoO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>; approximately 7 nm)/gold (Au; approximately 60 nm). This image confirms the formation of isolated perovskite grains (dark areas) in the emissive layer. In addition, we can see that the perovskite grains are connected by gray belts whose brightness level is clearly distinct from the surrounding layers. The contrast in this bright field image is dominated by mass contrast as the cross-sectional lamella has a nominally uniform thickness, and hence regions composed of high-Z elements appear darker as they scatter more electrons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Therefore, we can infer that the gray belts do not have the same composition as TFB, PEIE-ZnO, or perovskite based on their different brightness levels.</p><p id="Par9">We then switch our TEM to scanning mode (STEM) to run an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> shows an image of the EDS scan area acquired in high-angle annular dark field mode and elemental maps of iodine, lead, and oxygen. Oxygen is selected as a marker for DDS. The iodine and lead maps show that neither element appears between perovskite grains, proving that the gray belts are not FAI, PbI<sub>2</sub> or other iodine- or lead-containing compounds. The oxygen map unambiguously confirms that DDS is present on top of the PEIE-ZnO layer, right between neighboring perovskite grains. At this stage, we can conclude that the PMC thin films assemble in situ as a composite of FAPbI<sub>3</sub> islands surrounded by DDS.</p><p id="Par10">The cathodoluminescence (CL) spectroscopic measurements (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) are also consistent with the fact that DDS lies between perovskite grains in the PMC thin films.

The diffraction intensities of the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> control film is much weaker than those of the PMC thin films. In spite of stronger diffraction intensities in the XRD measurements, the PMC thin films show much weaker absorption (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) in the wavelength range of 600 to 800 nm.

At this stage, it remains unclear how DDS facilitates the formation of high-quality α-phase FAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystal nuclei and how DDS interacts with the perovskite lattices after annealing.</p><p id="Par20">In order to answer these questions, we perform attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FT-IR) spectroscopy to elucidate how DDS works with the perovskites. Firstly, we examine the interactions between DDS and FAI. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, the NH<sub>2</sub> scissoring vibration δ(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>DDS</sub> of DDS at around 1630 cm<sup>–1</sup> shifts to lower wavenumber (1623 cm<sup>–1</sup>) in the DDS + FAI mixture film (prepared from a DMF solution with DDS:FAI = 1:2.2 in molar ratio). This indicates that the N–H chemical bond of the –NH<sub>2</sub> groups in DDS is weakened with the addition of FAI, suggesting that there is hydrogen bonding between the –NH<sub>2</sub> groups in DDS and FAI. This hydrogen bonding could in principle come from the interaction between –NH<sub>2</sub> and FA<sup>+</sup> or between –NH<sub>2</sub> and I<sup>–</sup>, the former of which can be excluded based on the following evidence. The formation of hydrogen bond (if any) between the C=NH<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> group in FAI and –NH<sub>2</sub> in DDS is expected to weaken the C=N and N–H chemical bonds, leading to shifts of C=N stretching vibration ν(C=N)<sub>FA</sub> and δ(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>FA</sub> to lower wavenumbers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. However, both ν(C=N)<sub>FA</sub> and δ(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>FA</sub> of FA<sup>+</sup> ions shift to higher wavenumbers in the DDS + FAI mixture film, suggesting that there is no hydrogen bond forming between FA<sup>+</sup> and DDS. We notice similar shifts to high wavenumbers when mixing FAI with PbI<sub>2</sub> to form perovskites, where the C=N and N–H chemical bonds of the FA<sup>+</sup> ions are strengthened. In that case, I<sup>–</sup> anions contribute to the formation of corner-sharing [PbI<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4–</sup> octahedra, hence decrease the interaction between I<sup>–</sup> anions and FA<sup>+</sup>.</p><p id="Par21">In order to provide direct evidence for the interaction between DDS and I<sup>–</sup>, <sup>127</sup>I nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy measurements were conducted (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). Relatively sharp signals of FAI and FAI + DDS are found at ca. 200 ppm. The significant change in signal half-width of FAI + DDS (9.6 kHz) in comparison to signal half-width of neat FAI (8.8 kHz) confirms interactions between DSS and I<sup>–</sup>. Similar effect is observed in the case of neat FAPbI<sub>3</sub> and FAPbI<sub>3</sub> + DDS (1.0 DDS) systems. The clear broadening of the detected signal indicates a weak interaction of iodine anions. This observed asymmetric broadening can further indicate the formation of different chemical entities (different clusters) in local structures.</p><p id="Par22">We also examine the interactions between DDS and PbI<sub>2</sub>. We notice the split of the δ(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>DDS</sub> peak in the DDS + PbI<sub>2</sub> mixture film (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), indicating that there are chemical interactions between the –NH<sub>2</sub> groups in DDS and Pb<sup>2+</sup> or between the –NH<sub>2</sub> groups and I<sup>–</sup>. In order to further understand these interactions, we perform X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>, the Pb 4f spectra of the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> and 1.0 DDS films keep the same compared with that of the PbI<sub>2</sub> film. However, the I 3d spectrum of the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film is broader (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>) compared to that of the PbI<sub>2</sub> film, suggesting the change of chemical environment of I<sup>–</sup> anions in the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> film. In addition, the I 3d spectrum of the 1.0 DDS film becomes broader and shifts to higher binding energies compared to the FAPbI<sub>3</sub> control film.

In addition, we find obvious emission from TFB (400 to 500 nm) when the driving voltage is above 2.5 V (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>), which may be induced by carrier leakage and/or charge imbalance at high driving voltages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

We thus suggest that in addition to the perovskite material, the degradation of the interfaces between the emissive layer and charge-transport layers should be paid special attention.</p><p id="Par30">In conclusion, we have developed PMC thin films, which consist of in situ formed high-quality perovskite nanocrystals embedded in the electron-transport molecular matrix, for efficient and stable PeLEDs. The molecular matrix controls the nucleation process of the perovskite nanocrystals, and significantly improves the PLQEs and long-term stability under the exposure to moisture and oxygen. Consequently, PeLEDs based on the PMC thin films reach a peak EQE of 17.3% and half-lifetime of 100 h at a constant current density of 20 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> (initial radiance of 15 W m<sup>−2</sup> sr<sup>−1</sup>). In addition, we find that the degradation of our PeLEDs at a relatively low driving voltage is mainly caused by the degradation of the emissive layer; whereas at a relatively high driving voltage the degradation of the interfaces between the emissive layer and charge-transport layers could be one of the main degradation channels. The findings in this work from both material and device perspectives pave the way for achieving efficient and stable PeLEDs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par31">Colloidal ZnO nanocrystals were synthesized following the reported solution-precipitation process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.
