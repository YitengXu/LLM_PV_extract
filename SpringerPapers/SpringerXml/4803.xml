Landfill disposal poses an environmental hazard, therefore, recycling or reusing them as second-life batteries (SLBs) are the inevitable options. Reusing the EV batteries with significant remaining useful life in stationary storage applications maximizes the economic benefits while extending the useful lifetime before recycling. Following a critical review of the research in SLBs, the key areas were identified as accurate State of Health (SOH) estimation, optimization of health indicators, battery life cycle assessment including repurposing, End-Of-Life (EOL) extension techniques and significance of first-life degradation data on ageing in second-life applications. The inconsistencies found in the reviewed literature showed that the absence of degradation data from first as well as second life, has a serious impact on accurate remaining useful life (RUL) prediction and SOH estimation. This review, for the first time, critically surveyed the recent studies in the field of identification, selection and control of application-based health indicators in relation to the accurate SOH estimation, offering future research directions in this emerging research area. In addition to the technical challenges, this paper also analyzed the economic perspective of SLBs, highlighting the impact of accuracy in second-life SOH estimation and RUL extension on their projected revenue in stationary storage applications. Lack of standard business model based on future market trends of energy and battery pricing and governing policies for SLBs are identified as urgent research gaps.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Second life batteries</kwd><kwd>Energy storage system</kwd><kwd>Battery degradation</kwd><kwd>State of Health (SOH) estimation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Jiao Tong University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>21</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/43979_2023_Article_49.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Science and Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Climate Change</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par57">Electric vehicles (EVs) with zero emissions are considered to be the best alternative to combustion engine cars reliant on polluting fossil fuels. According to the International Energy Agency's annual report, global EV sales surpassed 2.8 million in 2020, bringing the overall number of EVs to 10.1 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. By 2060, it is expected that this number would reach 1.2 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Due to reduced capacity of less than 80% of the rated capacity, also known as End-of-Life, these batteries cannot be used for traction purposes, according to comprehensive research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Remaining usable life (RUL) is the capacity of a retired battery that can be evaluated using state-of-charge (SOC) estimates. To make EVs affordable and alleviate End-of-Life anxiety among EV producers and customers, the probable solution in the literature is to employ these retired batteries for stationary applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Reuse of these retired batteries provides environmental benefits in addition to economic gains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Hence, the term "second life batteries (SLB)" is introduced in the literature to describe them.</p><p id="Par58">Various techniques are implied for screening, repurposing, and accurate SOH estimation of electrical vehicle retired batteries to enhance the techno-economic benefits in second-life applications. Advanced machine learning-based techniques and health indicators for SOH estimation are introduced for improving the accuracy and speed of the process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Assessment of opportunities, scopes, challenges, and market trends related to this new technology of EV battery secondary use is gaining hype every passing day and has been reviewed by several fellow researchers. Initial review based on this specific area includes a critical discussion on the overall concept of battery second use. The survey mostly focuses on existing R&amp;D projects involving second-life batteries and closely judges the environmental as well as economic aspects of battery secondary use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Following a review in 2019, the authors tried to cover the gap by proposing potential solutions to challenges posed by economic and environmental adaption of second-life battery reuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Business models, government policies, market strategies, environmental benefits from repurposing, SLB’s modelling techniques, cost analysis of repurposing and installation, and impact on overall cost reduction are proposed and discussed in detail. In addition to stationary storage applications, mobile applications including EV charging stations are accessed both technically and economically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Another review paper later this year combined the economic aspects with social and environmental dimensions hence emphasizing the need for sustainable business models for EV battery second use. Existing business models are discussed and their comparison is made with proposed sustainable models, the results stay uncertain due to lack of empirical research data and ambiguity of possible stakeholder’s involvement in the battery second use market but it opens a new horizon of sustainability in future Electrical vehicle battery reuse market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Another review paper sheds light on technical, environmental, and market challenges involved with the reuse process and proposes data and cloud-based technologies to keep a better record of battery historical data and the existing state of the health for future reuse reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] second life battery market trends are surveyed and challenges faced regarding reuse and recycling of used electrical vehicle batteries are accessed globally. There is a discussion of environmental impacts and economic challenges associated with manufacturing, recycling, and wasting different types of batteries on a global level. A more recent review on second life batteries covers the economic, technical, and environmental aspects of said technology. The technical aspects of battery screening for reuse are highlighted including degradation studies mainly in first use but also after deployment in secondary use to a smaller extent. Battery recycling challenges, reuse applications and business models are also explored. There is an emphasis on further research in this field to make second life batteries a part of mainstream market [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The latest survey reviews specifically the technical aspects of the inclusion of second-life batteries in stationary storage applications. It covers the literature regarding battery repurposing, ageing mechanisms, battery management systems for battery optimal sizing, and battery modelling. This review also points out the lack of degradation studies in second use and precise ageing model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">Although this review study and the aforementioned articles cover some prospects for electrical vehicle second-life batteries applications, their main targets are economic benefits and market strategies which is no doubt need of the hour. However, these benefits are not achievable if technical aspects are not thoroughly surveyed and the battery is not fully productive during its second use. A discussion about technical prospect of battery reuse after degradation in first use is included in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], however, there seems an uncertainty in accessing the future trends of this technology in techno-economic point of view. The most important reason of this uncertainty is ignorance of battery degradation history from first use. There is a need to review battery degradation process both in first and more importantly in secondary use as the data from first use plays an important role in determining battery ageing process in secondary use. There is no set methodology yet to record battery degradation history in first use hence most of the studies are based on assumptions and hypothetical data. This predication of remaining useful life is more inevitable during second-life so that it could be extended to a maximum limit. In this paper we try to fill this gap by reviewing the literature focusing on degradation studies of batteries during secondary stationary storage applications. The latest developments in SOH estimation techniques such as identification of health indicators for both battery first and second-life will be examined. Existing battery ageing models and state of health (SOH) estimation techniques will be reviewed and their applicability on battery second-life will be examined closely with references from literature. A critical discussion on existing second-life batteries R&amp;D projects will be included and suggestions will be made to more realistic approaches.</p><p id="Par60">To perform this survey, a systematic research and review method was implemented to analyze the process of battery degradation during second-life applications. To obtain our required results the keywords “Electrical vehicle battery”, “battery degradation” and “SOH estimation” were used in the search engine “Google Scholar”. This has an authentic scientific peer-reviewed publication containing both journal and conference papers. The following methodology is shown in the Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Filtering of literature having above mentioned keywords in their abstract, title, and keywords was performed.

With this growing number of EV batteries, the issue of how to dispose of retired Lithium-ion batteries is becoming particularly crucial. There are no approved recycling facilities for these batteries, and discarding them without adequate handling can cause greater environmental difficulties than fossil fuels, rendering the entire electric vehicle transition worthless [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. On the other hand, the high cost of lithium-ion batteries is a key obstacle to the evolution of electric car technology, and it is the reason why these batteries should be handles carefully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Disposal, recycling, and reuse are the most common current solutions for retired batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. EVs are expected to travel between 120,000 and 240,000 km on average. The most commonly used LIBs is expected to last 8–10 years and have a useable capacity of 70–80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Disposal</title><p id="Par63">The disposal of retired EV batteries is not a very suitable option due to many reason, one of them is that an average battery pack weighs 250 kg, then five million LIBs retired from EV waste will weigh 1.25 million tons when they reach the end of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. If they are disposed of, they generate a lot of trash because recyclable and expensive materials are discarded. Heavy metals and electrolytes from these batteries contaminate soil and water, causing irreversible damage to the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The majority of discarded electric vehicle batteries end up in landfills, with a few being transferred to waste-to-energy facilities for ignition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The lithium salt LiPFe6 is an example of discarded material that is extremely toxic and damaging to the human body, causing damage to the eyes, skin, and lungs in particular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Non-flammable metals such as nickel and cobalt are collected in the bottom of burnt materials with ash and eventually disposed of in landfills, causing harm in the same way as direct landfill disposal does [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Recycling</title><p id="Par64">Recycling is another popular option for retired batteries. Using the recycling process, it is possible to recover and return the valuable materials of lithium-ion batteries into the value chain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It has the potential to provide significant economic and environmental benefits. Instead of discarding valuable metals, this method can collect them for reuse, making the acquisition of raw materials easier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Recycling plastic and graphite can also boost the economic value of retired lithium-ion batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. From an environmental standpoint, disposal is the most unaccepted alternative for dealing with end-of-life EV batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. For the recycling of valuable elements from end-of-life lithium-ion batteries, standard chemical and physical procedures have been used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, because battery cathodes are made of a variety of materials, developing a low-cost, environment-friendly recycling method still remains a difficult and debatable issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Reusing</title><p id="Par65">On the other hand, Instead of recycling the retired batteries, the smart way is to reuse them to maximize their remaining potential life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Reuse of EV batteries can be defined as the application/treatment of these retired batteries for storing energy in domestic storage systems and as a backup in modern grids that are integrated with renewable energy sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Two common methods of reusing these EV batteries are repurposing and remanufacturing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The latter entails repairing or renovating used EV battery packs and redeploying them in automotive applications, whereas the former entails reconfiguration of these EV batteries to deploy them in less-demanding secondary applications such as those indicated above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. However, prior to secondary usage, batteries may require additional processing such as testing, inspection, disassembly, removal of faulty calls, and replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p id="Par66">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> depicts the complete life cycle process at the end of the transportation life of the EV battery.

In the United States, a cost-effective and carbon emission analysis of installing SLBs against new LIBs for three energy storage applications: (1) domestic energy storage with rooftop PV, (2) utility-level PV firming, and (3) utility-level peak-shaving is conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In comparison to new LIBs, SLBs reduced the levelized cost of power by 12–57 percent and carbon emissions by 7–31 per cent. When compared to rooftop PV alone at the residential level, SLBs lower the levelized cost by 15–25 percent and carbon emissions by 22–51 percent, making SLBs attractive to residential users as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">When these three methods of handling retired EV batteries are compared, it is obvious that discarding them after their initial usage is not an acceptable alternative from both an economic and environmental standpoint. While it is self-evident that reused batteries will eventually be recycled, the only practical choice for maximizing financial advantage and optimizing environmental benefit is to reuse them in static applications. It will also facilitate the intermittent renewable electricity supply in the future by implying a controlled life cycle analysis of reused batteries in these stationary storage applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par69">However, there are still significant obstacles in reusing EV batteries, particularly in terms of estimating remaining life, life cycle evaluation, screening process, regrouping, and, most importantly, safety management of wasted batteries for secondary use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. According to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] repurposing old EV batteries into stationary storage systems can improve the overall environmental sustainability of EVs and residential storage. The environmental implications, in particular, are reduced by a percentage ranging from roughly 4% (in cumulative energy usage) to 17% (in abiotic depletion potential). This will help kick-start the transition towards a low-carbon economy. According to this research, more research is needed to improve the environmental sustainability assessment of used batteries' second lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The lack of primary data on key energy model factors that affect environmental impact assessments, such as charge/ discharge efficiency, battery capacity degradation, and battery lifetime, as well as methodological assumptions (e.g., allocation strategy), is a major concern in this sector. Introducing proper business models for retired battery use in post-vehicle markets can assist lower the upfront cost of an electric car, producing money, and making them more accessible to the general public, increasing EV penetration in the transportation sector.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Second-life battery degradation studies in stationary storage applications</title><p id="Par70">The use of second-life batteries in stationary storage applications has proven to be a better alternative to disposal and recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

The assessment of useful lifetime of a battery in specific applications require practical data, which is not very common practice yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

As SOH is considered an indicator of battery ageing there are various techniques in the literature to estimate battery SOH. In an ageing study for an Electric vehicle battery, an electrical equivalent circuit is used to represent battery performance and ageing in different second-life applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Some ageing parameters are indicated but there are no demonstrations on how they are involved in controlling battery life. This [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] equivalent circuit model is combined with a reliability model to check stress levels from the battery ageing model to more accurately estimate the remaining useful lifespan of the battery. The battery model is used to calculate SOC and DOD from the battery current and capacity. The reliability of a Li-ion battery on second-life stationary energy storage missions can be assessed using this model. The conventional coulomb counting method compares estimated capacity with rated capacity by continuously measuring current, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] is a simple technique but has the disadvantage of requiring a complete battery cycle of 100% which is practically not true [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. A data-driven SOH estimation technique in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) uses a forecasting algorithm to predict second-life battery remaining useful life in stationary applications with less than 3% error. This technique works by initializing a model order and starting a time series model constructed on the past cycle’s training data. The combination of this approach with other forecasting algorithms for example neural networks is proposed to handle the non-linearity in components estimating SOH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Another innovative lithium-ion battery ageing model in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] is based on open circuit voltage analysis using incremental capacity curves. Following these, a bi-stage segmented non-linear regression technique is used here to fit the curves as per peak value. This approach presents a better degree of accuracy to a vast application area of lithium-ion batteries, possibly extendable to second-life applications as well.</p><p id="Par77">In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] a forecasting model to predict battery capacity estimation both for ageing and regeneration phenomenon is presented. However, this study does not use data from an actual electrical vehicle battery so in the future proposed model can be applied to real-life battery data from different compositions and manufacturers. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> entails a comprehensive survey of literature on degradation studies on second-life batteries including economic analysis and technical aspects like ageing studies method, ageing parameters, control of ageing parameters, health indicators identification, capacity dispersion, specific second-life application and effect of temperature.

(HI) for extension of the useful life of these EV batteries in their secondary applications is gaining popularity. It makes SOH estimation more accessible by parameterizing. The internal resistance rise, which is evaluated practically using impedance spectroscopy, capacity fade, which is determined by incremental capacity analysis, as well as current and voltage measurement, are the commonly utilized battery health indicators for SOH estimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. New classes of HIs are being identified and classified based on accuracy under specific second-life applications. This study, in addition to previously stated HIs, identifies two novel indicators of Cpk (Capacitance peak) and Vpk (Voltage at peak Capacitance) for specific battery chemistry (lithium iron phosphate LFP). This technique uses a simple conventional estimation algorithm to obtain an average accuracy for RUL predication (above 97%) and high accuracy capacity prediction (error less than 1%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is also suggested to investigate their applicability to other battery compositions.</p><p id="Par79">As data-driven ageing models based on HIs are getting famous, an innovative combined machine learning approach for accurate estimation that is also faster than standard processes.

It uses SOH<sub>C</sub> (battery current maximum capacity) and SOH<sub>E</sub> (battery current maximum energy) as novel initial health indicators. The proposed method is efficient and widely applicable based on a limited data set of measured voltage and current only.

Three of them are based on impedance studies from the battery equivalent circuit model, two from the battery OCV curve and the last one is from the incremental capacity curve. At least 22.9% more accurate results are claimed to be achieved from this MHIs-based system as compared to single HI-based techniques.</p><p id="Par81">The health indicators’ identification for degradation studies of batteries suggests that this is the main strategy for cost reduction of second-life batteries both in the repurposing stage and during second-life applications.

However, there is not much development in this regard to keep a track of the battery’s complete history during first use. An initiative has been taken in this aspect and an innovative cloud-connected battery management system is suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. This system keeps a track of battery data in electrical-thermal from first use continuously on a back-end server. Then a combination of this data and an empirical ageing model is proposed for the correct prediction of battery remaining useful life. The crucial part of this model is the extraordinary requirement of the degree of precision of the electrical and thermal model to compute stress factors for ageing estimation of different cells. The merits of this proposed method above related techniques in literature are economical and reliable state estimation at the end of first-life and remaining useful life during secondary use as well. However, in a real life scenario, there is a requirement for an appropriate ageing model for identical electrochemical cell types and ideally the same cell type for each battery. Brings another parameter into consideration which is battery repurposing which can be an expensive process if not handled and planned according to the existing health conditions and homogeneity among battery cells. Repurposing has a significant effect on battery degradation properties in the second-life in the context of both cost and efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Second-life Batteries Screening and Repurposing</title><p id="Par83">So there is another highlighted problem is the handling of end-of-life batteries of EVs to repurpose them as stationary energy storage devices. Accelerated cyclic testing is performed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] on six cells extracted from the Nissan Leaf battery after reaching end-of-first-life to see whether they might be reused in a stationary application that required low performance. An end-of-life ageing knee is determined for battery second use by using capacity fade and internal resistance rise during cell ageing testing. In a related study in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], five NMC battery cells, with different states of health for four of them, were tested for their performance from the first end of life. It was concluded that these batteries can be involved in stationary storage applications with relatively lower performance requirement such as frequency services. A low charge/discharge current rate can extend their useful life in second applications. This study was extrapolated to Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analysis in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] for different chemical properties of batteries and their SOH estimation. The influence of ageing on the batteries has been investigated with the parametrization of the battery impedance circuit model.</p><p id="Par84">However, handling EOL batteries and repurposing them may become costly if the capacity dispersion among cells is not taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. An intra-modular and inter-module capacity dispersion of battery cells are performed on 10 first-life modules and 32 s-life modules for comparison before repurposing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. A proposed method in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] suggests two-step characterization; initial scanning based on external physical parameters and then sorting the scanned batteries based on their remaining effective capacity. A sophisticated workbench is used for testing the battery in this proposed method. A Smart Batching Management modelling tool is proposed as a cost solution to perform capacity test to find SOH of all used cells on field, this will also ease quick sorting of used cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Testing of batteries in practical application is postponed for future work and the life cycle of second-life batteries is proposed to be described as a function of energy storage system application. An experiment-based sorting technique categorizes six battery samples for grid connecting applications is proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. However, no attention was given to battery degradation and heterogeneity among cells.</p><p id="Par85">To handle heterogeneity among cells, a general energy management system (GEMS) is proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] to regulate and distribute load demands between varying capacity second-life battery modules under various operating conditions (load profiles, disturbances). Experimental verification of this scheme shows that it successfully manages the performance differences between second-life battery modules of varying sizes, capacities and chemistries in the same application at the same time. However, the initial age of the battery cells should also be taken into account. An automated testing device is built and tested in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] to handle second-life lithium-ion batteries. For future scenarios, this device can be used to perform multiple accelerated charge/discharge life cycle tests on the batteries and provide real-time data. This data will be helpful in the determination of the feasibility of batteries integrated with grid-tied energy systems. But this testing has been intended for future work and no real-time result/data is available from it to date. There is another retired electrical vehicle batteries repurposing technique presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] for a renewable integrated high-scale battery energy storage system. A hybrid technique to extend the battery ageing process called “Multi-Level Interlaced Pulse Charging (MLIPC)” is developed from two processes, 1. Pulsed charge management and 2. Battery interlacing. This combination allows a single battery pack operated by simultaneous multiple interlaced PWM pulse trains so if applied to multiple batteries can contribute to charge exchange between the cells. This helps in avoiding an unbalance stress on one battery unit/cell. However, no comprehensive economic study was conducted. Further research into the length of the battery’s pulse period is needed to optimize the performance of the system. In another related study with unknown battery history, sorting and prediction studies are conducted to categorize and repurpose batteries for secondary storage applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The techniques used are called Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC), EIS analysis and incremental capacity analysis. Three LMO battery models were tested for SOH estimation of end-of-first-life sorting using all three different techniques. The results are based on comparisons showing that each method has its own merits of looking into specific aspects of degradation studies of batteries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Life cycle assessment</title><p id="Par86">The efficient modelling of complete life cycle assessment of second-life batteries in energy storage systems also plays an important role in optimal utilization of second-life batteries in stationary applications hence it is an inevitable part of battery second-life degradation studies. A parametric life cycle system model has been developed and applied to integrate second-life batteries to facilitate the renewable electricity supply and to access the potential of these batteries to be used in second-life applications in California in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. Different techniques of battery testing to estimate battery SOH has been used in the literature. These include incremental capacity analysis, EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) and estimation algorithms based on machine learning. The method of EIS in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] along with half-cell testing is used to study the degradation of two different cells under two grid applications of frequency regulation and energy arbitrage services. Suggestions are made for appropriate cell types in a particular grid service with maximum economic benefits. This poses an opportunity for grid operators and also researchers to manage the life span of second-life batteries by using them under particular conditions and operational time. Nevertheless, the cell compositions cannot be disregarded on the basis of type of application as it can cause instabilities in assessment of life cycle and cost estimations.</p><p id="Par87">A novel method to link SOH with EIS of new and used lead-acid batteries in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] provides a better and reliable way to predict battery SOH for all values with less than 10% of error and is valid for possible SOC range from 80 to 20 percent. The drawback is an extremely costly workbench for battery testing. The methods of incremental capacity analysis and probability density function are used and compared for battery SOH modelling in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] for a constant power operating condition. Whether it is the cell or the module, the variation in SOH between different batteries in the BESS is significant. The relative degree of ageing degree for a battery can be determined by grading the HI value on ICA or PDF curves based on actual charging voltage data in the case of an unknown SOH. This study's methodology and findings add to the adoption of online SOH battery evaluation in real-world energy storage systems. The above-mentioned techniques are combined with another method for battery ageing studies called average Frechet distance of battery ageing, and introduced in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The offline SOH is predicted using internal resistance as a health indicator. However, the results drawn here cannot be applied generally to all battery types because this testing has been performed under specific conditions.</p><p id="Par88">As data-driven based SOH estimation techniques are gaining attention due to their robustness and accuracy. A SOH estimation for battery degradation studies uses linear regression with incremental capacity analysis to estimate the remaining useful lifespan in second-life storage applications. Life cycle tests are performed on six lithium-ion battery cells to demonstrate the battery’s ageing characteristics for three typical load profiles. Then a quantitative incremental capacity analysis is performed to access ageing mechanisms followed by another systematic ageing analysis to find the similarities and differences under different load conditions. The suggestion is to use a combination of ridge and linear regression with a correlation-based feature to counter the estimation variance with so many inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. There are some discontinuities in results possibly due to differences in the ageing patterns in EV first operations. As part of the European Second-life battery energy storage system, a novel algorithm called a mixed least square estimator ramp rate compliant (MLSERRC), based generic method is used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>] to determine the optimal rating of SLBs, power exchange and battery state of charge profiles for an entire operational year. The driver for using SL batteries is the possibility of reducing costs and minimizing the environmental impact by using aged batteries closer to their lower operation performance. The authors claim that the power profiles obtained from this study can later be used for SLB testing, which will allow analyzing the performance capabilities of such batteries, and their ageing.</p><p id="Par89">As previously emphasized, historical data from battery first use can be a game-changer in optimizing the useful life of second-life batteries, this study in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] aims for total life span prediction of batteries starting from cycle life in first use, second-life application life and then remaining capacity of retired batteries. There is also an investigation of ageing process and SOH estimation for the said life span of batteries. First-life data of a new battery is used to train the second-life battery to predict the interdependence of both. Being a beginner research area, a few deficiencies are also observed in this study, one of them is an online estimation of impedance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], as impedance is an important deciding factor in SOH estimation, it should be estimated precisely and online. Moreover, as batteries in each stage have different capacity fade ratings, it can result in inconsistent battery system overall ageing behavior hence more investigation is recommended in this regard.</p><p id="Par90">A summary of key research issues in the deployment of lithium-ion batteries includes the estimation of actual capacity, sorting of battery modules based on capacity dispersion, remaining useful life, battery circuit model and SOH algorithms.

The technical feasibility, economics, and environmental impact of using second-life batteries are also investigated under different applications. The world’s first battery energy storage system comprising second-life batteries from BMW i3 sets a cornerstone for future reliable energy storage systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. A combination of estimation techniques for battery SOH and cost analysis tools is required for a comprehensive techno-economic assessment that would also keep in sight the concept of useful lifetime extension of second-life batteries. A real-life case study in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] considering two different scenarios in Spain analyses the feasibility of second-life battery energy storage but with approximations. An economic model built in MATLAB is later analyzed for expected results using a system called SMEs (small and medium enterprises). Electricity tariff reduction is proposed in an energy storage system with data from market and suitable battery ageing model. A leading electrical vehicle manufacturing company has recently devised a mixed research methodology for said purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. An application-based analysis of second-use batteries is conducted, and a comparison is made for economic feasibility themselves. The economic evaluation is performed for three different applications of battery repurposing with equally dispersed capacities, refurbishing for use again in electrical vehicles and finally reuse in secondary storage applications. The reuse of batteries in secondary storage applications without any categorization, refurbishing and repurposing is the most economical process of all. There is a need for detailed economic analysis for all three concepts to strengthen the idea of economic gain from the reusing process instead of recycling.</p><p id="Par93">It is also recommended to analyze second-life batteries use in residential systems with solar PV as initial studies. Levelized cost of electricity LCOE is used as an economic analysis tool for a residential energy storage system comprising of PV array and second-life batteries. Carbon emissions are also compared for an added environmental benefit. A research study in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] suggests grid level scenario as most favorable in terms of total cost reduction if compared on basis of specific application. Results are based on 41 cases including residential rooftop PV using energy storage, PV firming and peak shaving at the grid level. The use of second-life batteries in the residential system in combination with renewable generation reduced the LCOE by 12.57%. This is further investigated in another residential prosumer’s storage system in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] consisting of second-life batteries and solar PV. Sensitivity analysis is used to access the said system in terms of techno-economical aspects second-life battery changing market prices in California. The second-life batteries have variable battery SOH and variable PV generation penetrations.

Great reliability is predicted for a renewable generation as self-consumption results show the endurance of close to 12 years. The economic and environmental evaluation is not very feasible if used batteries are connected to the grid without renewable support. This is verified when a typical rooftop PV in the combination of second-life batteries is evaluated for technical, economic and environmental benefits in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>], it predicts a clear cost reduction when the excess electricity from solar arrays is not sold to the main grid. It can be said that the use of net-metering strategies can increase the cost of electricity from PV arrays. There is a need to devise policies for use of second-life batteries in residential energy storage systems and net metering to consider both the economic and environmental benefits. It is further studied in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], another case of second-life batteries and solar energy-based storage systems, a project in California. A data-driven battery ageing model is included to estimate ageing phenomenon and results are compared with another project with a new battery. A certain control policy is used to minimize battery cycle ageing with different SOC values and the life of the proposed system is calculated. Under these specific conditions, this project has been more long-lasting and economically favourable for use of a second-life battery in place of a new battery with cost benefits. The results presented here are for specific battery types and specific circumstances and loading conditions. Also, with the current battery prices, there remains uncertainty about the proposed economic benefits of this system. More rigorous analysis is required to generalize the presented results. Another research in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>] investigates an analysis of energy exchange between a residential PV array, second-life battery energy storage system and a grid in Southern Europe. The results are presented for 10 years of operation and technical benefits from batteries are confirmed. As far as economic benefits are concerned, large and small repurposed batteries were compared and conclusions verify the payback time of large batteries was greater than smaller but both batteries can provide technical benefits for an evaluated period of ten years. The policymakers should consider these results as a benchmark for future second-life battery projects.

A stochastic optimization method should be adopted to counter degradation uncertainties associated with battery and sizing of second-life batteries in the second-life application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. This has been proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>] for optimal sizing of second-life batteries in a real-life PV power plant based on a mixed least-squares estimator ramp-rate compliant (MLSERRC) algorithm. A one-year power profile is obtained and applied to second-life batteries in the laboratory for testing and ageing studies.

Results are shown for both cases with and without ageing involved. A cost comparison is done using economic indicators with a case where only the main grid is present. It predicts a microgrid with storage is way more economical than without a storage system. However, Calendar ageing is ignored in this analysis. There is a lot of room for improvement in this tool for the future such as considering power electronic components losses, more optimized battery ageing model during second use, more complex energy management models, battery life cycle assessment due to capacity dispersion among cells in calendar ageing, SOH and resistance values at end of first use depending upon first-life use and also uncertainty in market trends and price inflation impact on economic analysis over long periods.</p><p id="Par97">It is stressed that degradation history at the end of first use can be of great importance in accurate estimation of the used battery's remaining life span hence making economic evaluations more reliable. This economic model in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] regarding grid-able EVs and second-life batteries undertakes both vehicle and second-life degradation phenomena. It encourages EV owners to decide when to start second life for their EV battery depending on their requirement of revenue margin. Battery degradation is allowed up to 70% in first-life and up to 30% in second-life use and it is concluded that around 19.56% of a battery's upfront cost can be compensated by using this proposed model of degradation considered in both uses. It is suggested that the battery continues to generate revenue for both lives and the vehicle owner can decide about the amount of cost saving by starting the battery's second life and also selling the electricity in addition to the battery's second-life use. A techno-economic evaluation using software called SimSES in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>] investigates the revenues generated by deploying second-life batteries of varying capacities under different applications.

Both issues are addressed in the proposed energy storage system in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>] using second-life battery energy for EV fast-charging systems. Life cycle cost and carbon emission assessment are compared for new and second-life battery-based systems in five U.S cities. Second-life batteries seem more favorable for fast charging stations reducing the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by 12 − 41%. The addition of renewable like solar can increase these cost benefits. However, the number of retired batteries can be affected as fast charging can cause fast degradation of an EV battery. Hence understanding of battery degradation is recommended during fast charging techniques adoption.

Hence, it is crucial to conduct accurate and reliable assessments of their economic benefits incorporating a full process of repurposing and reusing, for stationary storage applications in real-life scenarios. It is recommended that researchers and stakeholders conduct cost analysis of battery screening, refurbishment, and repurposing for specific applications. There have been various techno-economic tools reported in the literature, such as Return on Investment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>], Return Rate on annual basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>], Levelized Cost of Energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>] and Levelized annual Cost of Energy using Net Present Value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>], Benefit–cost Ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], and cost-optimization algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>] for economic analysis, but these are based on several assumptions and are applicable only for specific battery compositions and controlled grid-connected applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. These economic studies have mostly confirmed the cost benefits of second-life batteries over new batteries in terms of decrease in LCOE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>], increased annual revenue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>] and operating as well as payback years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>] but it should be noted that these results cannot be generalized. There are many uncertainties like unpredictable battery prices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>] and application based benefits and controlled conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. It is recommended to take into account future battery and energy prices inflation for more reliable results. The importance of first-life degradation data and control of particular health indicators/ageing parameters has not been adequately discussed in previous review papers on second-life batteries in stationary storage applications. Further research is needed to conduct an up-to-date economic assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>] along with accurate battery capacity management for optimal and feasible control of stationary energy storage systems.</p><p id="Par117">There are only a few comprehensive studies of EV battery secondary usage (B2U) as a new market apart from some initiatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This new market is distinctive in that it is the first of its kind to bring together significant stakeholders from diverse industries on a single platform, including energy firms, the automotive industry, and government. The use of batteries as a storage component in addition to renewable energy sources has the ability to simultaneously eliminate significant obstacles in the transportation, energy, and waste management sectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Battery reuse conserves resources and lowers the amount of waste produced in the environment by slowing down the recycling process. It is also suggested to overview the second-life battery market prices and policies to attain a notable adoption of electrical vehicles. This demonstrates an opportunity to improvise the policy making on domestic energy storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>] and net metering rules by considering both economic and environmental benefits. These regulations for the SLB market are intended to look into the various aspects of using second-hand batteries, particularly concerning renewable energy systems, such as economic, environmental, and regulatory factors. The recommended approaches will be useful in delivering smart grid flexibility and improved demand-side management, as energy storage is a game changer for future power systems.</p><p id="Par118">Multiple concerns have been raised about policymakers' ability to approve legislation and business models for SLBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>].

Battery ageing modelling, optimizing aging parameters, and accurate State of Health (SOH) estimation are the most researched areas as depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. However, this review identifies the significant shortcomings in these areas, such as the application of battery first-life ageing models on second-life batteries, the absence of an accurate and online SOH estimation mechanism in secondary applications. The inability to accurately optimize aging parameters for useful life extension, and assumptions regarding battery first-life data are also lacking in this field. Approximately 65% of battery second-life studies as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> focus on degradation studies, including aging models, SOH estimation techniques, and health indicators/aging parameters. However, only 4% of the total studies address the control of these aging parameters and the impact of first-life data on battery degradation, highlighting another significant research gap. It is also identified that in comparison to the rising number of retired batteries, repurposing before reuse is falling behind significantly. This is primarily due to unavailability of the primary use data and high cost of refurbishment and repurposing of these used batteries. The economic aspect of second-life batteries has a major saying in the future of this technique. However, only 8% of second-life battery studies have performed cost analysis, and even fewer have taken into account the impact of battery degradation and battery future market prices. Additionally, no universal economic model for second-life batteries could be found in the literature, revealing a significant inconsistency (gap) in studies on the techno-economics of second-life batteries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Future research directions 2</title><p id="Par123">The extensive review of recently developed approaches for the said purpose reveals that future research in the area of battery SOH estimate has a lot of potential, including the creation of cutting-edge estimation algorithms for RUL estimation and battery cell characterization using cutting-edge health indicators. To maximize environmental benefits and to establish a future direction for selecting and assessing reliable health indicators for battery ageing research under various operating conditions, it is advised to incorporate the suggested parameters into practical repurposing and reusing applications. While the traditional approaches only produce approximations, data-driven strategies based on machine learning algorithms have the potential to produce outcomes that are more precise.

Hence, the research on reuse of these batteries for other storage applications has gained popularity. There are still many technical and economic challenges to adaptability of this reuse technology into stationery storage applications. In this paper an extensive review of second life battery degradation studies in stationary storage applications is carried out focusing on technical, economic, business models and policy recommendations prospects. The key technical areas like SOH estimation techniques, battery life cycle assessment including repurposing and methods for End-Of-Life extension of these batteries are analyzed in detail.</p><p id="Par131">This paper critically examined the identification, selection and control of battery health indicators for specific applications and their impact on battery accurate ageing studies. The lack of battery first-life degradation history has a serious impact on useful lifetime estimation of these batteries in stationary storage applications. The cloud connected based storage technologies are recommended for keeping a track of battery ageing during complete life cycle. The conventional model based and data driven SOH estimation techniques are also thoroughly reviewed. This review reveals that absence of a second life battery aging model (adopting first-life ageing model; a common practice) results in uncertainties for accurate SOH estimation. Moreover, an ideal second life ageing model is also recommended based on this review which should be capable of controlling the aging parameters /health indicators for accurate SOH estimation. This ideal model should also be capable of balancing between technical and economic perspectives of second life batteries and can also accommodate battery first-life data, end of life extension.</p><p id="Par132">Critical analysis of economic studies related to application of second life batteries in stationery storage applications reveals that multiple ambiguities exist in the available economic models. Cost effectiveness of these batteries (compared to new ones), price inflation over long time periods and lack of a generic business model are the major hurdles highlighted in this article. Therefore, it is suggested that the future price inflation, accurate battery market prices and net-metering rates should be paid attention for a generic economic model development. This review also reflects that only a limited number of studies have considered the impact of battery’s degradation on battery economic studies. Battery degradation studies incorporating a complete life cycle analysis (including first and second life) is of immense importance for optimal techno-economic evaluation. Also, lack of incentives and policies for users and stakeholders like electric cars and battery manufacturers has caused hindrances to adopt this technology. Introduction of government policies regarding market scenarios such as low cost of second life battery in comparison to new battery, attractive net metering rates for second life batteries’ users and controlled inflation in second life battery prices are suggested. As stated previously, the combined techno-economic benefits like projected future business revenues and RUL extension by accurate SOH estimation methods are expected to tackle the growing number of retired batteries from EVs by increasing the feasibility of their reuse in stationary storage applications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research work was possible by financial support of Higher Education Commission (HEC) Pakistan under the program “Overseas Scholarship for PhD in selected fields Phase III”Batch-1.
