Dendooven*</underline>, M.J. Helbert, H. Peetermans, S. Leh</p><p id="Par6">*UZ Gent, Universiteit Antwerpen, Belgium</p><p id="Par7"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> The “Kidney Biopsy Codes (KBC)” project provides terms that allow any diagnosis and/or histomorphological pattern for a non-neoplastic kidney biopsy to be coded. We explored whether mapping to SNOMED CT is feasible, to enable aggregation and computerized exchange of data.</p><p id="Par8"><bold>Methods:</bold> For KBC terms for which an unambiguous match with a pre-existing SNOMED CT concept was available, both ‘parent concept’ and the place in the SNOMED taxonomy were established. For remaining terms, we explored whether these could be defined by combining pre-existing (more simple) SNOMED CT concepts. This process ('post-coordination’) is well supported by SNOMED CT and allows extending its content.</p><p id="Par9"><bold>Results:</bold> Of glomerular terms, 88/195 (45%) could be matched to SNOMED CT. %-matching was more successful for KBC terms designating disease concepts (56%) than patterns of injury (32%). For the majority of terms that could not be mapped, we found that these could indeed be defined as a compositional expression of pre-existing SNOMED CT concepts (post-coordination). We suggested concepts that are needed for this post-coordination.</p><p id="Par10"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> SNOMED CT is considered the standard for documenting, encoding and exchanging medical data in/between health information systems. This proof-of-concept shows that mapping of KBC terms to SNOMED CT is feasible, in part directly, in part through post-coordination.</p><p id="Par11"><bold>OFP-01-002</bold></p><p id="Par12"><bold>Molecular analysis of renal transplant biopsies comparing the Edmonton Molecular Microscope with the NanoString Human Organ Transplant Panel</bold></p><p id="Par13"><underline>J. Schmitz*</underline>, H. Stark, S. Bartels, D. Jonigk, P.F. Halloran, G. Einecke, J.H. Bräsen</p><p id="Par14">*Institute of Pathology, Nephropathology Unit, Hannover Medical School, Germany</p><p id="Par15"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Different molecular methods like microarrays or quantitative PCRs were used by several groups on renal transplant tissues. High-resolution determination of the inflammatory infiltrate by NanoString analysis (which was developed for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded-derived RNA) should be a sufficient approach.</p><p id="Par16"><bold>Methods:</bold> We used surveillance and indication biopsies from 63 patients whose time-matched second biopsy core had been frozen and analysed by microarray in the INTERCOM/INTERCOMEX study. After re-evaluation according to recent Banff consensus, RNA isolation was performed with Maxwell FFPE kits and led to sufficient RNA yields in 53 samples which were further processed for NanoString analysis (Human Organ Transplant panel).</p><p id="Par17"><bold>Results:</bold> Morphologically, of the 53 samples analysed (samples from 2011/12 and 2015), twenty-five patients showed no signs of rejection, twelve had borderline rejection, four showed cellular rejection, seven had humoral rejection, and five presented with combined rejection. Preliminary analysis of gene expression by T-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE), Random Forest and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed clear differences between samples with rejection (humoral and cellular) and without rejection. Rejection samples revealed high expression of chemokine ligands compared to rejection-free tissues. Borderline rejection shared a common pattern compared to samples without rejection. First results display good correlation with the former molecular diagnosis from the INTERCOM/INTERCOMEX study.</p><p id="Par18"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Molecular approach using the NanoString platform may supplement morphological diagnosis of renal grafts especially in unclear cases and thus enhance precision diagnostics with small tissue requirement. Morphological and molecular evaluation in the same biopsy core from FFPE tissue enables direct histological-molecular correlation. Additionally, this technology also improves our understanding of pathophysiology in renal and other transplants.</p><p id="Par19">Funding by: Dr. Werner Jackstädt foundation</p><p id="Par20"><bold>OFP-01-003</bold></p><p id="Par21"><bold>Arteriolar C4d: a potential prognostic marker in IgA nephropathy – a retrospective study in a Portuguese tertiary centre</bold></p><p id="Par22"><underline>P.

Seelen</p><p id="Par23">*Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, Portugal</p><p id="Par24"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common glomerulonephritis worldwide. C4d has been recognized as a marker associated with significantly reduced renal survival. We aimed to study the clinical significance of arteriolar immunoexpression of C4d in a cohort of IgAN patients.</p><p id="Par25"><bold>Methods:</bold> We selected all kidney biopsies with the diagnosis of IgAN, between 2001 and 2017, and reviewed their clinical features; evaluated them according to the Oxford Classification of IgAN 2016 and assessed the presence of vascular lesions. We evaluated the arteriolar and glomerular immunoexpressions of C4d and their association with the baseline and follow-up clinico-histological data thought bivariate and regression analysis.</p><p id="Par26"><bold>Results:</bold> Arteriolar immunoexpression of C4d was present in 21 (17%) biopsies and associated with mean arterial pressure (MAP), chronic microangiopathy and arterial intimal fibroelastosis. After adjusting to other significant predictors, such as baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate, MAP and the presence of crescents, this immunoexpression remained significantly associated (P values &lt;0.001) with progressive kidney disease.</p><p id="Par27"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Arteriolar immunoexpression of C4d is a potential prognostic marker in IgAN. These findings raise the possibility of including immunohistochemistry for C4d in the evaluation of IgAN biopsies.</p><p id="Par28"><bold>OFP-01-004</bold></p><p id="Par29"><bold>The impact of vitamin D3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) and its role on to the epithelial to mesenchymal transition and the development of interstitial fibrosis in renal allografts</bold></p><p id="Par30"><underline>E.S. Ayva*</underline>, B.H. Ozdemir, E. Yılmaz Akcay, G. Ozdemir, A. Yucel Polat, M. Haberal</p><p id="Par31">*Baskent University, School of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Turkey</p><p id="Par32"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> This study aimed to understand the role and the mechanism of action of vitamin D3 (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) in the development of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and interstitial fibrosis (IF) in renal transplant (Tx) patients.</p><p id="Par33"><bold>Methods:</bold> Out of 161 cases, 70 treated with vitamin D3 (Group D) and 91 cases did not receive vitamin D3 (Group A). Cytoskeletal proteins F-actin, α-SMA and paxillin expression of tubules and the tubular TGF-β, TNF-α, and E-cadherin expression evaluated. Follow-up biopsies analysed for the development of IF during 18 and 24 months after Tx.</p><p id="Par34"><bold>Results:</bold> Group D patients showed higher degrees of tubular E-cadherin expression than Group A (p&lt;0.001). Tubular F-actin, α-SMA, paxillin, TGF-β and TNF-α found significantly low in Group D compared to Group A (p&lt;0.001). A positive correlation found between the development of IF with the tubular F-actin, α-SMA, paxillin, TNF-α and TGF-β expression (p&lt;0.001). The development of IF during in follow-up biopsies found lower in Group D compared to Group A (p&lt;0.001)</p><p id="Par35"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The activation of EMT and the occurrence of IF found higher in Group A cases who had cytoskeleton reorganization (increased F-actin, α-SMA, paxillin expression), and E-cadherin downregulation. E-cadherin loss during EMT suggested to promoted by high TNF-α and TGF-β expression. Contrarily, Group D patients had a lower incidence of IF. Treatment with D3 abolishes the EMT promoted by TNF-α and TGF-β. Therefore, D3 therapy is beneficial in renal transplant patients with its antifibrotic property.</p><p id="Par36"><bold>OFP-01-005</bold></p><p id="Par37"><bold>Rearrangement of the endothelial cell cytoskeleton in glomerular and peritubular capillaries following antibody-mediated rejection: its significance on the development of transplant glomerulopathy and interstitial fibrosis</bold></p><p id="Par38"><underline>E.S. Ayva*</underline>, B.H. Ozdemir, E. Yılmaz Akcay, G. Ozdemir, M. Haberal</p><p id="Par39">*Baskent University, School of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Turkey</p><p id="Par40"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> This study aimed to understand the rearrangement of endothelial cell cytoskeleton (EC-CSK) both in glomeruli and peritubular capillaries (PTCs) in antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and to investigate the influence of cytoskeleton rearrangement on the development of transplant glomerulopathy and interstitial fibrosis</p><p id="Par41"><bold>Methods:</bold> Total 116 allograft biopsies which diagnosed with AMR were re-evaluated and the intensity of interstitial, glomerular and PTC inflammation were graded. The endothelial cell (EC) expression of F-actin, paxillin, vinculin, HIF-1α, VEGF, and eNOS were evaluated in glomeruli and PTCs. Follow-up biopsies analysed for the development of transplant glomerulopathy (TG) and interstitial fibrosis (IF).</p><p id="Par42"><bold>Results:</bold> The expression of F-actin paxillin, vinculin, HIF-1α, VEGF and eNOS in EC increased with increasing degree of C4d expression, PTC destruction, interstitial inflammation, glomerulitis and PTC-itis in glomeruli and PTCs (p&lt;0.001). The risk of the development of TG, IF, proteinuria, and graft loss found higher in recipients with a high degree of F-actin, paxillin, vinculin, HIF-1α, VEGF and eNOS expression (p&lt;0.001).</p><p id="Par43"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We hypothesized that PTC destruction following AMR causes chronic hypoxia that induces HIF-1α, VEGF and eNOS expression that give rise to the reorganization of EC-CSK. Upon the reorganization of EC-CSK and the increased amount of endothelial VEGF together induce the formation of gaps between adjacent ECs, which in turn initiate EC permeability and influx of leukocytes and proteinuria. As a consequence, the increasing amount of inflammatory cells induces the early development of IF, TG, and consequently the premature graft loss.</p><p id="Par44"><bold>OFP-01-006</bold></p><p id="Par45"><bold>Application of artificial intelligence (AI) in assessment of renal allograft biopsies: comparison with subjective Banff criteria for graft inflammation</bold></p><p id="Par46"><underline>M. Shamassi*</underline>, E.S. Ayva, N.K. Alham, I.S. Roberts</p><p id="Par47">*Department of Anatomical Pathology, Monash Medical Centre, Monash Health, Melbourne, Australia</p><p id="Par48"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> The Banff classification is used routinely in reporting of transplant biopsies. The variable reproducibility of Banff criteria limits its clinical value. This study evaluated the use of AI to quantify graft inflammation and correlated inflammatory cell density with Banff scores.</p><p id="Par49"><bold>Methods:</bold> Digital images from 119 allograft biopsies were scored by two renal pathologists according to Banff criteria. Images were then analysed using the Visiopharm Integrator System platform. An APP was designed to quantify inflammation within normal and fibrotic cortex, and an auxiliary APP to exclude glomeruli. The model was trained through one million iterations.</p><p id="Par50"><bold>Results:</bold> The inter-observer agreement for i, ti and i-IFTA scores was moderate to good (kappa-scores 0.615, 0.566, 0.552 respectively). Banff scores correlated only weakly with the density of inflammatory cells assessed using AI. i-score: only for i0 vs i3 was there a significantly different inflammatory cell density. i-IFTA and ti scores: the density was significantly greater for Banff categories 1-3 than 0, but there were no significant differences between categories 1-3.</p><p id="Par51"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> he density of inflammatory cells correlates weakly with Banff scores, likely reflecting the fact that a pathologist will only recognise cortex as inflamed when there is greater than a threshold level of inflammatory cell density in a particular area. It remains to be ascertained whether inflammatory cell density assessed by AI or subjective Banff scores correlate better with clinical outcome and response to treatment.</p><p id="Par52"><bold>OFP-01-007</bold></p><p id="Par53"><bold>Carcinogen-induced tumour mouse model reveals dynamic molecular changes during basal bladder cancer progression</bold></p><p id="Par54"><underline>J.

Allory</p><p id="Par55">*Molecular Oncology team, UMR144, Institut Curie, Paris, France</p><p id="Par56"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> The basal subgroup of bladder cancer is often diagnosed at the muscle-invasive stage (MIBC). Identification of molecular changes during progression from non-muscle-invasive (NMIBC) to basal MIBC is challenging.</p><p id="Par57">We used the N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN) mouse model to study disease progression.</p><p id="Par58"><bold>Methods:</bold> To study multiple stages of progression, 40 mice bladders were obtained at different time points following an oral BBN exposure of a maximum of 14 weeks. To characterize molecular changes occurring during progression from early stages to MIBC, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) - markers of basal (CK5, CK6, CK14) and luminal subtypes (FOXA1, CK20) - and RNA-seq for all stages.</p><p id="Par59"><bold>Results:</bold> Morphological analysis identified a spectrum of lesions during BBN exposure: hyperplasia (n= 5), dysplasia (n=5), CIS (n=3), pTa (n=14), pT1 (n= 6), MIBC (n = 7). All tumours displayed a squamous or sarcomatoid component. IHC showed expression of basal markers within early stages of carcinogenesis, with a decrease in FOXA1 expression during progression. Molecular classifications using RNA-seq data highlighted an early and progressive switch to the complete basal phenotype. Further analysis of RNA-seq data identified clusters of genes with expression changes during progression. Assessment of the expression dynamics of each cluster of genes provided insights into specific biological processes involved in basal bladder cancer progression and invasion.</p><p id="Par60"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We used the BBN-induced cancer mouse model to longitudinally study carcinogenesis and progression of basal bladder cancer. Our study sheds light on the underlying biology of progression from NMIBC to basal MIBC and from squamous to the aggressive sarcomatoid variant.</p><p id="Par61"><bold>OFP-01-008</bold></p><p id="Par62"><bold>TERT promoter mutation analysis is a valuable diagnostic adjunct to distinguish pseudosarcomatous spindle cell proliferations from sarcomatoid urothelial carcinoma of the urinary bladder</bold></p><p id="Par63"><underline>S. Bertz*</underline>, R. Stöhr, N.T. Gaisa, B. Wullich, A. Hartmann, A. Agaimy</p><p id="Par64">*Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany</p><p id="Par65"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Bladder pseudosarcomatous myofibroblastic proliferations are diagnostically challenging due to occasional ALK-negativity, frequent cytokeratin expression, worrisome histology. Sarcomatoid urothelial carcinoma (sUC) may resemble inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour (IMT). TERT promoter mutations are frequent in urothelial cancers, but pseudosarcomatous lesions have not been investigated.</p><p id="Par66"><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed comparative histomorphological and immunohistochemical analysis and TERT promoter mutation testing in 17 ALK-positive and -negative spindle cell lesions and 18 sUC. Screening for genetic rearrangement and/or FISH analysis was performed by RNA sequencing in the pseudosarcomatous myofibroblastic proliferations.</p><p id="Par67"><bold>Results:</bold> 9/17 sUC showed at least focal IMT-like morphology. Atypical mitoses, presence of a differentiated urothelial component and presence of heterologous elements were the most reliable morphological features of sUC, if present. ALK (D5F3), p53, p63, Ki67-index, smActin and GATA3 were differentially expressed. Pancytokeratin staining was frequent in both groups, but the staining pattern differed significantly (diffuse in 17/17 pseudosarcomatous proliferations, focal in 6/15 sUC). TERT promoter mutations were found in 17/18 sUC but in none of 17 pseudosarcomatous myofibroblastic proliferations.

Our department recommends ≤10 blocks. Our objective was to audit block-taking and assess how frequently the diagnosis could be reached with ≤10 blocks.</p><p id="Par82"><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective single-centre audit on cystectomy specimens for malignancy processed from January-December 2017. We performed a SNOMED search on Co-Path for all cystectomy cases for malignancy and collected data on patient demographics, presence of gross tumour, number of blocks taken from the bladder at initial cut-up and number of extra blocks (if any), and the histological diagnosis.</p><p id="Par83"><bold>Results:</bold> 45 cases were suitable for inclusion. A median of 13 bladder blocks were taken per case (range, 4-28). Ten blocks or less from bladder were submitted in 10/45 cases (22.2%). More than 10 blocks were taken in a higher proportion of cases without gross tumour (16/19, 84.2%) compared to cases with gross tumour (19/26, 73.1%). Additional blocks were taken in 4/45 cases (8.8%). 2/10 specimens (20%) where less than ten blocks were taken initially required additional blocks. On review of the slides, the final histological diagnosis was achievable on the initial blocks in all four cases where additional blocks were taken. Estimated costs of oversampling for one year were £8,595.36.</p><p id="Par84"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The final histological diagnosis was achievable in all cystectomy cases for malignancy where ten blocks or less were taken from the bladder. In the majority of cases, more than ten blocks were taken, incurring significant potentially unnecessary costs. We suggest that no more than ten blocks should be taken from cystectomy specimens for malignancy, and that even fewer representative blocks can be taken if a gross lesion is identified.</p><p id="Par85"><bold>OFP-01-011</bold></p><p id="Par86"><bold>Heterogeneity-analysis of molecular subtypes of muscle-invasive bladder cancer and their precursor lesions in multiregion mapped whole-organ bladders</bold></p><p id="Par87"><underline>V.

Immunohistochemical analysis of luminal (CK20, GATA3, FOXA1) and basal markers (CD44, CK14 and CK5/6) was carried out in selected precursor lesions and tumours to map the distribution of luminal and basal subtypes across the different positions/lesions.</p><p id="Par91"><bold>Results:</bold> Out of three analysed multiregion mapped bladder tumours, one showed a heterogenous luminal and double-negative molecular subtype in multiple tumour positions as well as a mixed morphology including conventional urothelial and neuroendocrine areas. Moreover, among the second analysed bladder tumour, all tumour positions showed a high expression of basal markers whereas the included Carcinoma in situ demonstrated a luminal subtype with almost total absence of basal markers. The third analysed mapped bladder tumour demonstrated a homogenous luminal molecular subtype in all precursor and tumorous lesions.</p><p id="Par92"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This first analysis of three multiregion mapped bladder tumours shows divergent results of subtype distribution: Heterogeneity of subtypes can be observed, but other tumours and associated precursor lesions show a homogenous distribution of subtypes.

We analysed inflammation in 158 PROMIS participants who had MRI followed by 5-mm template mapping biopsies (TPM) regardless of MRI findings.</p><p id="Par107"><bold>Methods:</bold> 235 men enrolled at University College London Hospital (2012-2015) and TPM outcomes were collected for 158 (77 pilots excluded). Cancer burden was recorded in 20 Barzell zones per prostate by an experienced uropathologist (Definition 1: Gleason≥4+3 and/or maximum length ≥6mm; Definition 2: 3+4 and/or 4-5mm; insignificant: 3+3, less than 3mm). Inflammation, PIN or ASAP were noted in cancer-free Barzell zones.</p><p id="Par108"><bold>Results:</bold> There was a negative association between the proportion of benign Barzell zones reported as “heavily inflamed” (out of all cancer-free zones) and TPM cancer burden (1A). The fraction of non-cancerous, inflamed Barzell zones was significantly higher in men without/insignificant cancer, compared to those with Definition 1/2 disease (1B; Kruskal-Wallis, p&lt;0.001; Tukey post hoc analysis; p&lt;0.001). This difference persisted when men without/insignificant cancer were compared to those with significant disease of any definition (1C). The opposite trend was true for PIN/ASAP: there was a positive association between PIN content in benign Barzell zones and cancer burden (2A), although not statistically significant (2B, 2C: Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA, p=0.37; Wilcoxon test, p=0.11).</p><p id="Par109"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Heavy inflammation affects fewer benign areas in men with significant cancer compared to those without significant tumours in their prostate. We hypothesise that such inflammatory burden differences (1) enable the progression of significant cancer in the first place (2) are a consequence of tumour-related microenvironmental changes or (3) are driven by increased inflammation in the early stages of carcinogenesis.

The pathogenic mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study aims to characterize the microvascular alterations in the lungs of ACDMPV patients.</p><p id="Par117"><bold>Methods:</bold> Lung histologic structures were analysed from 16 autopsies with ACDMPV. Lung endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and alveolar epithelial cells were examined by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent stainings with antibodies recognizing different cellular markers for ACDMPV and age-matched controls. Statistical analysis was performed.</p><p id="Par118"><bold>Results:</bold> The decreased capillary density or completely absence of capillary in the alveolar septa was observed while new microvascular formation with abnormal tortuosity in the thickened alveolar septa was present. Aberrant pulmonary veins were detected adjacent to small pulmonary arteries within the same bronchovascular bundle even though septal pulmonary veins were still seen in the ACDMPV lungs. Glut-1 protein, a marker for endothelial immaturity, was detected in the malpositioned and normalized pulmonary veins as well as abnormal septal neovasculature. In addition, hyperplasia of type 2 alveolar epithelial cells was observed.</p><p id="Par119"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The loss of vascular integrity and the destruction of the alveolar-capillary interface may drive abnormal growth and remodelling of the pulmonary microvasculature, which challenges the current concept of “misalignment of pulmonary veins”.

In six cases genetics confirmed the pathology diagnosis (thanatophoric dysplasia -twice-, spondylo-epiphyseal dysplasia (SEDC), osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), and Desbuquois syndrome), that could raise to seven if two negative SGS are included. Genetics provided previously unsuspected diagnosis in eight cases: de novo achondroplasia, OI, short-rib polydactyly type 3 (SRP3), anauxetic dysplasia, and LADD, Roberts, Steel, and Schwartz-Jampel syndromes. Pathology confirmed variants of unknown significance as actual pathogenic variants in seven cases (Steel, SEDC, Schwartz-Jampel, SRP3, Roberts, OI, and Desbuquois), all among CES-analysed cases.</p><p id="Par127"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> CES identifies a wide range of skeletal dysplasias and previously unreported genetic variants carrying pathogenetic significance.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernias were statistically significantly more common in Group 2 (34% vs 56%, p=0.03). There was no statistical significance between the groups in rates of segmental villous avascularity (29% vs 34%), but CD34 immunostain added and/or upgraded 12 more cases in Group 2, thus increasing the sensitivity of placental examination for FVM by 37%.

Methylation of global DNA, repetitive elements (LINE-1 and Alu) and BRCA1 gene were studied in blood, tumour tissue and normal breast ductal epithelial cells. These parameters were analysed in comparison to clinical, histologic and phenotypic characteristics of tumours.</p><p id="Par189"><bold>Results:</bold> Alu, LINE-1 and global DNA methylation showed markedly low levels in all tissues of cancer patients compared to healthy controls, with extreme hypomethylation in tumour tissue. Changes in these parameters were not always concordant. BRCA1 promoter methylation was detected exclusively in tumour tissues and in only two cases, both of which had aggressive phenotype. Methylation levels detected in blood didn't allow stratification of patients with benign and malignant breast lesions and showed rather weak relationship with clinicopathological characteristics of tumours.</p><p id="Par190"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Epigenetics signatures show distinct pattern in tumour tissue and are not homogenous in different tissues of the same patient.

The accuracy of this biomarker is dependent on the technical quality of the immunostaining as well as well as correct interpretation.</p><p id="Par298"><bold>Methods:</bold> BAGP members were invited to participate. Unstained sections from a tissue microarray containing 74 cores from anogenital neoplasms, non-invasive and invasive, as well as control cases, were sent to each of 40 laboratories.

We assessed the variability of the diagnosis of dVIN amongst pathologists and sought to identify the most reproducible histologic features.</p><p id="Par318"><bold>Methods:</bold> Two pathologists selected a set of dVIN (n=30) and no-dysplasia (n=10) slides with a range of histologic appearance and prepared a check-list of histologic features of dVIN. Nine external participants independently judged these slides as ‘dVIN’ or ‘no-dysplasia’ and noted which features they used for the diagnosis. ‘Consensus diagnosis’ was defined as 70% agreement. Inter-observer agreement (Fleiss’ Kappa) was calculated.</p><p id="Par319"><bold>Results:</bold> Consensus was reached for 23 (77%) dVIN cases and for all the no-dysplasia cases. For the diagnosis of dVIN moderate agreement (ĸ=0.46) was obtained; pair-wise agreement ranged from slight to substantial (mean ĸ=0.51; range: 0.14–0.71). Among all histologic features, moderate agreement was obtained only for parakeratosis (ĸ=0.51). Fair agreement was obtained for nuclear features such as atypia discernable under 100X magnification (ĸ=0.39), nuclear angulation (ĸ=0.38), abnormal chromatin (ĸ=0.38), and suprabasal mitoses (ĸ=0.32). Histologic features related to disturbed maturation and architectural changes, such as deep squamous eddies (ĸ=0.39), elongated/anastomosing rete-ridges (ĸ=0.33), altered cellular alignment (ĸ=0.32), cobblestone appearance (ĸ=0.29), and individual cell keratinization (ĸ=0.27), also had fair agreement.</p><p id="Par320"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Histologic diagnosis of dVIN suffers from considerable inter-observer variability.

Of the "small duct type" 6 cases partially resembles biliary adenofibroma and 6 had a cholangiolocellular carcinoma component. CFTR was expressed in 67% of "small duct type", whilst never expressed in the"large duct type", nor in the perihilar adenocarcinomas (p=0.009). Moreover, CFTR was positive both in the biliary adenofibroma and cholangiocellular components of the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas (p=0,011) and was positive in the case of biliary adenofibroma.

We aim to characterize the pathologic and molecular progression of SPS neoplasia.</p><p id="Par419"><bold>Methods:</bold> 32 SPS patients were identified using WHO criteria in 2345 consecutive patients with at least 1 SP. Clinicopathologic assessment of advanced neoplasia (AN) in SPS patients was performed, including CRC and/or SP with dysplasia of any grade (SSPD), intestinal (I) or serrated (S) type. 10 AN were subjected to next generation sequencing (NGS) using a 50 gene hot spot panel.</p><p id="Par420"><bold>Results:</bold> SPS incidence was 1.4% (18:14 female:male, mean age 67 years). 9 SPS patients had AN, including 7 CRC, 8 SSPD-I and 3 SSPD-S. BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 9 cases (5 SSPD-I, 1 SSPD-S, and 3 CRC) and KRAS Q61H in 1 CRC. Additional mutations were found in CRC cases in the following genes: p53 (2 cases), FBXW7 (2), and SMAD4, PTEN, RB1, and RET (1 each).</p><p id="Par421"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In our cohort, 13% SPS patients had AN, including CRC and SSPD. All AN had activating mutations involving the RAF-RAS -MAPK signalling pathway, with majority with BRAF mutations and one case with a KRAS mutation. Our study confirms that while BRAF V600E is a common early mutation in SPS neoplasia, analysis of CRC in SPS patients demonstrates a diverse mutational profile.

Detection of the hot-spot to score TB is based on visual inspection, hindering reproducibility of this important factor. We present an algorithm that can potentially assist pathologists in this task.</p><p id="Par427"><bold>Methods:</bold> We used a previously developed algorithm for the detection of tumour buds in pan-cytokeratin stained whole slide images, calculating the number of buds for each location using a circle with 0.785mm2 surface area. From these numbers, density heatmaps were produced. The algorithm was applied to 270 slides from Bern University hospital, in which hot-spots and tumour buds were visually identified.</p><p id="Par428"><bold>Results:</bold> Heat maps were created and we located the hand-selected hotspot and noted the associated TB number. The differences and similarities between computer identified and manually selected hot-spots were visually assessed as well as via histograms. Preliminary results show that the heatmaps are helpful, as locations with the highest TB density (the top 15%) also include the hand-selected hotspots. The full results will be presented during the conference.</p><p id="Par429"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The presented algorithm can assist the pathologist in selecting the hot-spot with the highest tumour bud count with more ease at low magnification and can help to reduce the high inter-observer variability among pathologists in scoring tumour budding.</p><p id="Par430">This project has received funding from the Dutch Cancer Society, project number 10602/2016-2.</p><p id="Par431"><bold>OFP-06-003</bold></p><p id="Par432"><bold>Prognostic value of tumour deposits for disease-free survival in patients with stage III colon cancer: a post hoc analysis of the idea France phase III trial (prodige-gercor)</bold></p><p id="Par433"><underline>M.

A training set of 50 slides was annotated by a pathologist, subsequently used to train a DNN using the Aiforia® cloud platform. The resulting algorithm was applied to a validation set of 250 slides and results were compared to pathologist performance. Discrepant results were reviewed by an expert panel.</p><p id="Par448"><bold>Results:</bold> The algorithm was consistently able to find areas suspicious for dysplasia. The algorithm could also differentiate between the classes 'indefinite for dysplasia', 'LG dysplasia', 'HG dysplasia' and 'Carcinoma budding', with the diagnosis for carcinoma being aided by the immediate vicinity of a class for 'reactive stroma'. Review of the discrepant diagnoses revealed the inconsistencies of human performance on the one hand and limitations of the trained algorithm on other hand. In a speed test with 100 random IBD slides, the algorithm was able to outperform a pathologist using a conventional microscope, finishing within 1/3 of the time needed by the pathologist.</p><p id="Par449"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our algorithm outperforms pathologists in both speed and consistency, but is limited in scope, and requires a pathologist to make the definitive diagnosis for carcinoma. Nevertheless, with the number of samples continuing to grow, it provides a useful tool for the screening and classification of dysplasia in IBD.

Although resection/radiation is generally curative, a significant minority of patients develop recurrence. Perineural invasion (PNI) is a significant risk factor for recurrence, however detection can be limited.</p><p id="Par548"><bold>Methods:</bold> We apply Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to 24 human cSCC transcriptomes (GSE86544) to identify gene clusters associated with PNI. Clusters are ranked by their correlation with PNI, and candidate biomarkers in top clusters are identified based on intracluster centrality, differential expression between tumours with and without PNI, and expression in normal tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project.</p><p id="Par549"><bold>Results:</bold> We identify 56 gene clusters ranging in size from 31 to 4166 genes. Sixteen clusters show significant correlation with PNI (p &lt; 0.05). These clusters are enriched for genes involved in transcriptional regulation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling (p &lt; 0.05). The transcription factor TEAD3 has high network centrality in a gene cluster enriched for transcriptional regulators (p &lt; 0.05), is significantly upregulated in cSCC with PNI (fold change = 4.57, p &lt; 0.05), and is preferentially expressed in skin compared to nerve, adipose, and salivary gland tissue. TEAD3 expression significantly correlates with expression of the EMT/ECM gene cluster (p &lt; 0.05).</p><p id="Par550"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our work suggests TEAD3 contributes to transcriptional regulation of cSCC invasiveness, and TEAD3 expression may be useful in identifying high-risk lesions.

To date, 38 cases have been reported. We describe 22 cases expanding their phenotypic and genotypic spectrum.</p><p id="Par593"><bold>Methods:</bold> Cases were identified in our pathology (n=2) and consultation files (n=20). Histological and immunophenotypic findings were reviewed. All cases were negative for melanocytic markers we use routinely (SOX10, S100, pan-melanoma, Melan A, HMB45) except for minimal foci (&lt;5%) of differentiation or immunoreactivity observed in a few cases. Molecular testing was performed (TST15 gene panel; Illumina® Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).</p><p id="Par594"><bold>Results:</bold> Age range was 31-86 years (median, 62). Fourteen patients were males. Twenty tumours were metastases and two were primary (subungual, anorectal). Initial diagnosis was undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (10), unclassified malignancy (5), other sarcomas (2), metastatic melanoma (2) and reactive (1). In only two cases was dedifferentiated melanoma mentioned. History of melanoma was positive in 13 cases. Sites of metastases were axilla, inguinal, shoulder, gastrointestinal, bone, neck, lung/pleura. Histology was predominantly undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (11). Unusual patterns include osteo-chondroblastic, tenosynovial giant cell tumour-like and low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma-like. Melanoma-typical mutations were detected in 17/21 (81%) cases (NRAS=8, BRAF=8 and KIT=1). Of 4 wild type tumours, one showed NF1 mutation by extended testing.</p><p id="Par595"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This extended follow-up study highlights the phenotypic plasticity of dedifferentiated malignant melanoma and indicates significant underrecognition of this aggressive disease among general surgical pathologists. UPS and other unclassified high-grade sarcomas occurring at unusual sites such as the axilla, inguinal area and the lateral neck should alert to the possibility of dedifferentiated melanoma, even in the absence of positive clinical history.

Tumours arose in upper limb (33%), trunk (31%), lower limb (29%), head and neck (7%) with size range 2.3-11.5 cm (median: 5.9). Tumours were variably composed of atypical and pleomorphic cells, adipocytes, and lipoblasts, often showing infiltrative growth, myxoid or collagenous stroma, and multinucleated floret cells. Mitoses were infrequent. Tumours expressed CD34 (65%), S100 (64%), and desmin (30%). 86% (38/44) showed Rb loss. Rare cases expressed MDM2 (2%) or CDK4 (13%); FISH for MDM2 amplification was negative (0/11).

However, little is known about the prognostic significance of individual histological features. This study aims to determine the prognostic significance of OED features in a preliminary cohort.</p><p id="Par672"><bold>Methods:</bold> OED cases with varying grades (n=51) were identified (2005-2013) from the local tissue archive after ethical approval. New H&amp;E sections were obtained, and five-year clinical follow-up data collected. Blind histological examination was undertaken to review the original diagnosis and identify the most prominent features from the WHO Classification for each case. The prognostic significance of specific histological features was measured.</p><p id="Par673"><bold>Results:</bold> 17/51 (33%) lesions showed malignant progression; 10 (59%) of these were originally graded as moderate dysplasia and 7 (41%) as severe dysplasia. The most significant features predictive of malignant transformation were: loss of epithelial cohesion/acantholysis (RR 3.9, CI 1.4-10.4, p=0.0057), hyperchromatism (RR 4.0, CI 1.6-9.6, p=0.0018), irregular and/or verruciform surface keratination (RR 0.44, CI 0.2-0.9, p=0.0282), dyskeratosis/individual cell keratinisation (RR 4.4, CI 1.1-17.3, p=0.0316) and presence of suprabasal mitotic figures (RR 7.8, CI 1.9-30.6, p=0.0033).</p><p id="Par674"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our preliminary findings reveal feature-specific risk of malignant progression in OED for the first time.

Our objective was to assess if PD-L1/2 expression and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in HNSCC of non-smokers and non-drinkers (NSND) have prognostic value.</p><p id="Par680"><bold>Methods:</bold> Clinical data and tumours of 114 NSND HNSCC patients were collected retrospectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed for PD-L1, PD-L2, and lymphocyte markers PD-1, CD45, and CD8 on Tissue MicroArrays. Difference in 5-year survival of patients with and without expression of these biomarkers was determined using Kaplan-Meier and log rank analysis.</p><p id="Par681"><bold>Results:</bold> The patients were on average 71.6 years old and predominantly women (77%) with a tumour of the oral cavity (78%). PD-L1 (tumour proportion score ≥1% and ≥50%) and PD-L2 (≥1%) expression was detected in 70%, 18%, and 10% of the tumours, respectively. A high number of CD45 and CD8-positive TILs (≥150/mm2) was a predictor for a significantly better 5-year disease free (HRCD45=.50, p=.010; HRCD8=.51, p=.013) and overall survival (HRCD45=.40, p=.001; HRCD8=.50, p=.014). This significant difference persisted, regardless of which cut-off value for TILs/mm2 was applied.</p><p id="Par682"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PD-L1 expression is present in a large percentage of HNSCC in NSND. This might have implications for the application of immunotherapy in this patient group.

Expression of EMT, retinoic acid and oxidative stress pathway components including NRF2, AKR1C1/3, ALDH1A2, Frizzled 10, b-Catenin, E-Cadherin, Vimentin, miR-9 and miR-16-2 were assessed by immunohistochemistry, RT-qPCR and/or in-situ hybridization. The impact of viral oncogenes on EMT-relevant components was addressed in primary human keratinocytes overexpressing HPV16-E6 and/or -E7.</p><p id="Par689"><bold>Results:</bold> Expression analysis revealed that subgroups of OPSCC predominantly related to HPV-infection exhibit an increased oxidative stress response (NRF2, AKR1C1/3) as well as activating EMT pathway signatures (Frizzled 10, b-Catenin, E-Cadherin, Vimentin, miR-9 and miR-16-2), frequent metastasis, and downregulated retinoic acid synthesis (ALDH1A2). Moreover, in vitro experiments showed that HPV16-E6 expression results in induction of miR-9, miR-16-2 and b-Catenin expression.</p><p id="Par690"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our data show, that OPSCC presenting with upregulation of oxidative stress response signatures have a higher tendency to undergo EMT. Frizzled 10 expression known to be regulated by retinoic acid was highly correlated to ALDH1A2 expression and inversely correlated to EMT and oxidative stress.

All cases were treated with parotidectomy. Histologically the tumour showed solid, tubular and microcystic structures with abundant eosinophilic bubbly secretion. Neoplastic cells had eosinophilic vacuolated cytoplasm, occasionally with condensed material (mucin) and uniform, round nuclei with small nucleoli. Immunohistochemical stains were performed, the tumour cells were positive for CK7, mammaglobin and S100. In all the cases pan-NTRK immunohistochemistry was positive. The presence of ETV6-NTRK3 translocation was confirmed by Fluorescent in-situ hybridization (FISH) break-apart for ETV6.

Despite contrary evidence in literature, we came across a STAT6-equivocal and beta-catenin+ glomangiopericytoma. This prompted a thorough review of all published reports and re-evaluation of histology and immunohistochemistry in all cases from our Institute.</p><p id="Par705"><bold>Methods:</bold> Four cases were retrieved from our pathology archive. All the histological material and corresponding clinical files were re-examined. New STAT6, beta-catenin and CD34 immunostains were performed on freshly cut formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. Older stains were also reviewed. Furthermore, one case required additional search for mutations of the <italic>CTNNB1</italic>gene by Sanger sequencing. Literature review was conducted using PubMed.</p><p id="Par706"><bold>Results:</bold> Two patients were male. The age range was 40-79 years. All cases displayed typical cytoarchitectural and immunohistochemical features of glomangiopericytomas, except for one showing moderate STAT6 nuclear positivity, both in tumoral and peritumoral tissues. Being described as consistently negative in glomangiopericytomas and positive in solitary fibrous tumour (SFT), our STAT6 yielded differential diagnosis issues. Nevertheless, our literature review disclosed rare STAT6-equivocal glomangiopericytomas. Furthermore, Ghaffar et al. described non-specific STAT6 positivity in the nasal mucosa of patients with chronic rhinitis, which our patient had. This phenomenon might lead to misdiagnosis. A mutation in exon 3 of the <italic>CTNNB1</italic>gene was found in this last case, confirming the diagnosis of glomangiopericytoma.</p><p id="Par707"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Glomangiopericytomas represent a diagnostic challenge. Differential diagnosis especially includes SFT, and STAT6 immunostaining plays a key role in discriminating the two entities. Cautious interpretation of STAT6 in patients with chronic rhinitis is advised.</p><p id="Par708"><bold>OFP-08-012</bold></p><p id="Par709"><bold>IDH2 R172 mutated sinonasal carcinoma: pathological and molecular assessment of 32 cases</bold></p><p id="Par710"><underline>S.

Here, we explored pathological features of a sizable cohort of IDH2 mutated sinonasal carcinomas (SNC).</p><p id="Par713"><bold>Methods:</bold> Thirty-two primary IDH2 R172 mutated SNC were studied by light microscopy and by immunohistochemistry (IHC) including S-100, cytokeratins, synaptophysin and chromogranin. IDH2 mutation status was assessed by targeted exome sequencing or by IDH2 IHC (clone 11C8B1) in most cases. DNA methylation profiles were analysed by semisupervised hierarchical clustering and IDH2 wild-type sinonasal tumours were used for comparison.</p><p id="Par714"><bold>Results:</bold> IDH2 variants included R172S (61%), R172T (14%), R172K (14%), R172G (7%) and R172M (4%). All cases were high-grade with a median 21 mitoses/10 high-power-fields, frequent necrosis (85%), apoptosis (100%) and prominent nucleoli (97%). Most (94%) were SNUC or LCNEC. Two cases showed glandular/acinar differentiation. While no tumour had definitive features of ONB, two ethmoid carcinomas focally labelled for S-100 (sustentacular pattern) suggesting the olfactory bulb origin. Surface and/or minor salivary glands involvement was detected in 39% cases supporting the Schneiderian mucosal origin. All cases, irrespective of subtle differences as to their putative cell/tissue of origin, formed one distinct methylation cluster and clearly separated from IDH2 wild-type tumours.</p><p id="Par715"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> IDH2 R172 mutated SNC are phenotypically, genetically and epigenetically remarkably similar suggesting that their biology and clinical behaviour might be primarily defined by their unique molecular signature.

The relationship between neoplastic and lymphoid cell immunoreactivity score (IRS), histopathological parameters (Pearson’s test) and survival of 35 patients (Mantel-Cox model) was explored.</p><p id="Par724"><bold>Results:</bold> Epithelial-rich subtypes showed higher EPH-A6 cytoplasmic IRS (B2, B3, carcinoma) (P&lt;0.001) and stronger EPH-A4 IRS (B3, carcinoma) (P=0.011). The immature T-cells, especially in subtypes AB and B1, had a higher EPH-B6 IRS than carcinoma-associated mature lymphocytes (P&lt;.001); carcinomas had a higher lymphocytic EPH-B1 IRS (P=0.026). High lymphocytic EPH-A6 IRS was overall rare, but more common in B1 thymomas (P=0.015). Higher lymphocytic and lower epithelial EPH-B6 IRS correlated with low Masaoka stages (stages ≤II) (P=0.043, P=0.010 respectively).

Statistical significance was denoted as p&lt;0.05.</p><p id="Par757"><bold>Results:</bold> AMP had comparable demographic profile to invasive MPM. Multivariate analysis showed lack of subpleural structure sampling (p=0.010) and severe nuclear atypia (p=0.001) were independent predictors of worse OS. Cases fulfilling the criteria of (i) adequate subpleural sampling either without invasion or invasion limited to fibrous pleura, (ii) no severe nuclear atypia, (iii) no necrosis, were associated with significantly improved median OS compared with those without (24.4 vs 12.8 months, p&lt;0.001).</p><p id="Par758"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> AMP poses challenges to diagnosis and patient management as it encompasses a spectrum of benign and malignant mesothelial lesions. We propose morphology-based criteria to stratify AMP into high and low risk groups. It is likely the former was the result of insufficient sampling whilst the latter represented minimally invasive MPM. This allows MPM to be diagnosed earlier in its natural history. Further refinement using BAP1/MTAP immunohistochemistry as part of a multidisciplinary approach is currently being investigated.</p><p id="Par759">Funding by: National Centre for Mesothelioma Research (NCMR), established via a Department of Health (United Kingdom) grant awarded to National Heart &amp; Lung Institute, Imperial College London.</p><p id="Par760"><bold>OFP-09-006</bold></p><p id="Par761"><bold>Congenital pulmonary airway malformations with K-RAS mutations may have malignant potential</bold></p><p id="Par762"><underline>J.

In this study, we analysed immunohistochemical expression patterns and molecular findings of adult lung tumour markers in CPAM.</p><p id="Par765"><bold>Methods:</bold> CPAM tissue samples were morphologically evaluated, classified, and subsequently analysed by immunohistochemistry using a panel of lineage differentiating (TTF1/CDX2/MUC2/MUC5ac/CC10) and tumour (p16/p53/Dicer1) markers. Intensity of immunohistochemical staining was quantitatively assessed in normal lung tissue, CPAM and mucinous proliferations (MP) in each sample. Next generation sequencing of adult tumour markers (KRAS/BRAF/EGFR/ERBB2) was also performed separately for the aforementioned categories.</p><p id="Par766"><bold>Results:</bold> We analysed 50 CPAM samples (Types 1 and 2; n=25 each). Irrespective of the type of CPAM, mucinous cell clusters were detected in 11 cases all characterized by a lack of CDX2, MUC2 and to a lesser extent TTF1 expression, whereas MUC5ac was strongly expressed. P16, DICER1 and p53 showed no aberrant expression. All 11 samples with mucinous proliferations harboured a K-RAS mutation. The normal, surrounding lung tissue showed no genetic alternations.</p><p id="Par767"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Immunohistochemistry using TTF1 and MUC5ac may help to identify small MP in the pathological assessment of CPAM. These proliferations were found in both CPAM type 1 and 2 and harboured a K-RAS mutation in all cases. These findings support the notion that a subset of CPAMs may be considered potentially pre-malignant lesions.</p><p id="Par768">Funding by: Educational Fellowship BDIAP</p><p id="Par769"><bold>OFP-09-007</bold></p><p id="Par770"><bold>Can pulmonary sarcoidosis with severe fibrosis be considered as a severe form of lung sarcoidosis?</bold></p><p id="Par771"><underline>E.

The histological analysis of PR is coded for other malignancies in which it seems to play a prognostic role.</p><p id="Par782"><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively analysed eight consecutive samples of Pancoast tumour surgically resected after induction chemo-radiotherapy. The PR was evaluated according to the last IASCL recommendations [Travis WD, 2020]. Microenvironment assessment included immunostaining for several tumour-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD68) and PD-L1 expression (tumour proportion score). Radio-metabolic responses and radiomic evaluation were also reported and correlated with our data.</p><p id="Par783"><bold>Results:</bold> Histologically the tumours were six adenocarcinomas, one squamous cells carcinoma and one non-small-cell lung cancer-not otherwise specified (NSCLC, NOS). Two cases showed a complete pathologic response (CPR) and two other a major pathologic response (MPR); the rate of residual tumoral cells (RTCs) was 10% (median value; from 0 to 60%). No oncogene addiction was detected, PD-L1 was &lt; 1% in all cases. All TIICs had a score &gt;2+, except for CD4+ that scored 1+ in 88%. Tumours with a greater metabolic response showed a higher CD68+ TIICs and lower RTCs (p=0.020 and p=0.042, respectively). No other statistically significant differences were found.</p><p id="Par784"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Based on our data, the histological evaluation of the PR does not correlate with the radiological, metabolic and radiomic findings, highlighting the crucial value of morphological analyses. Data from radiomic analyses require larger case series.

With a steadily increasing number of cases, currently applied FISH-criteria can be time-consuming for the evaluating pathologist.</p><p id="Par790">Objectives: to propose a faster and equally reliable MET-FISH evaluation algorithm.</p><p id="Par791"><bold>Methods:</bold> In the present two-centred study, we re-evaluated the MET-amplification status obtained by FISH of n=497 NSCLC. For each case, after counting the first 20 cells, the possible results (negative/low-/intermediate-/high-level amplification as previously defined by us) were compared to the original results based on 60 cells.</p><p id="Par792"><bold>Results:</bold> Of all 497 cases, 471 (94%) showed identical results when counting 20 or 60 cells. Only 26 cases (5%) showed discrepancy: n=19 (4%) would have been upgraded in a higher diagnostic category when counting 20 cells only and n=6 (1%) would have been downgraded. Most importantly, all high-level amplified and negative cases remained the same. To prevent scoring-errors, we propose the following evaluation algorithm: After thorough examination of the tumour, 20 continuous nuclei are counted in the area with most MET-signals. If the case is negative or high-level amplified, it can be signed out. If it fulfils the criteria for low- or intermediate-level amplification, another 40 cells in two different areas must be counted to reach a total of 60 cells.</p><p id="Par793"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We propose a modified FISH-evaluation algorithm for MET-amplification in NSCLC that provides a much faster, yet equally reliable method.</p><p id="Par794"><bold>OFP-09-010</bold></p><p id="Par795"><bold>Overexpression of p14/ARF in PD-L1 positive malignant epithelioid pleural mesotheliomas with high nuclear grade</bold></p><p id="Par796"><underline>F.

Development of semi-automatic interactive annotation tools helps a lot to solve this problem.</p><p id="Par833"><bold>Methods:</bold> The proposed algorithm for semi-automatic image segmentation works with scribble annotations and is based on a graph model with 2-stage label propagation.

The proposed algorithm works in real time and allows to add new scribbles during the annotation which makes the labelling process interactive. Despite the high accuracy of the proposed algorithm we also offer a “classical” set of manual annotating tools to postprocess the results of the algorithm thus allowing annotator to finalize the annotation down to the smallest details.

Stone</p><p id="Par872">*Massachusetts General Hospital, USA</p><p id="Par873"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cardiac amyloidosis due to transthyretin are all age-related diseases characterized by amyloid deposition. In this study, the relationship between cardiac amyloidosis and AD/CAA was investigated in autopsies of elderly patients.</p><p id="Par874"><bold>Methods:</bold> Autopsies with cardiac amyloidosis in patients 80 years old or older were matched with control patients without cardiac amyloidosis based on age and gender. Patients with AL amyloidosis were excluded. The association between cardiac amyloidosis and CAA or severe AD (Braak stage V or VI) was assessed by Fisher test. P values less than 0.05 were considered significant.</p><p id="Par875"><bold>Results:</bold> Sixty-five patients with cardiac amyloidosis met the study criteria and were matched with 65 control patients without cardiac amyloidosis. CAA was present in 17 (26%) of the cardiac amyloidosis cases and in 13 (20%) of the controls (p=0.53). Severe AD was present in 11 (17%) of the cardiac amyloidosis cases and in 14 (22%) of the controls (p=0.66). The amyloid stained positively for transthyretin by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence.</p><p id="Par876"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Some recent studies have suggested a relationship between AD and cardiac amyloidosis in the elderly, potentially resulting from the release of amyloidogenic peptides from the brain into the bloodstream in AD. However, in this series of patients, there is no significant association between cardiac amyloidosis in the elderly and severe AD or CAA. The cardiac amyloid in these elderly patients is derived from transthyretin.</p><p id="Par877"><bold>OFP-10-009</bold></p><p id="Par878"><bold>Implementation of a cardiac proforma to autopsy practice</bold></p><p id="Par879"><underline>K.

To improve the quality of reporting, a proforma was introduced. A subsequent audit was conducted to see if there was improvement in the recording of heart measurements.</p><p id="Par882"><bold>Methods:</bold> Training was given on how to use the cardiac proforma, specifically on how to undertake the measurements required. Following this, the proforma was introduced. We subsequently extracted specific data items from our departmental post-mortem reports before and after the introduction of the cardiac proforma.</p><p id="Par883"><bold>Results:</bold> Undertaking heart examination in a systematic way with reproducible results helps to inform clinico-pathological correlation and the need for genetic testing. Since introducing the proforma, septal wall thickness measurement increased by 30%, left ventricular wall thickness by 12% and right ventricle wall thickness by 10%. The ventricular diameters measurements increased by 8% and 10% more cases commented upon the pattern of ventricular hypertrophy. Measurement of aortic valve circumference/leaflet number rose by 53%.</p><p id="Par884"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Following the introduction of the proforma, there was an improvement in the number of measurements recorded when examining the heart during autopsy.

Here we characterize the dynamics of protein degradation in human autopsy samples of the liver, kidney and lung.</p><p id="Par890"><bold>Methods:</bold> Snap-frozen tissue samples were processed for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with label-free quantification. Representation pattern of the proteins in the mass-composition were identified by comparative analysis of co-expression networks of the targeted tissues. Stable and unstable proteins were coupled with the Gene Ontology (GO) database and analysed according to molecular functions.</p><p id="Par891"><bold>Results:</bold> Patients were included with predefined exact post-mortem time intervals (6-12-18-24-48-96 hours; 78 tissue specimens of 26 patients). Dynamic changes in representation of proteins in the mass-composition were different in the investigated organs. The kidney tissue cytoskeletal proteins remained stable by the increasing time intervals whereas proteins of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex became underrepresented. In the liver, proteins of the lipid metabolism became underrepresented while pigment storage-related proteins accumulated by the time. Contrary to the liver and kidney, proportion of the lung cytoskeletal proteins decreased while proteins involved in activation of neutrophil granulocytes and lipid metabolism increased by the time in the mass-composition.</p><p id="Par892"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Protein degradation is one of the major processes in tissue decomposition after death. Understanding the biology behind the post-mortem interval-dependent changes of the mass-composition offers breath-taking opportunities for diagnostic and therapeutic improvements and paves the way for proteomic quality analyses of snap-frozen and formalin fixed-paraffin embedded tissue specimens.</p><p id="Par893">This study was supported by the Start-up Grant of Semmelweis University (11722).</p><p id="Par894"><bold>OFP-10-011</bold></p><p id="Par895"><bold>Review of water-related deaths in Oxfordshire over the last 22 years</bold></p><p id="Par896"><underline>A.

Likert-type and open/close ended questions were asked and cored. The participants were also asked to complete Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (MSQ).</p><p id="Par922"><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 321 participants, 75% were female and median age was 41±8.82 (range 28-71 y.o.). The respondents’ experience as a pathologist ranged between 0.12 years and 44 years (mean 11.4±9.16 years). Academic pathologists had significantly higher scores of MSQ, HT, WPC and PWB. Senior pathologists working at larger laboratories were significantly more satisfied of their WPC, with higher scores of MSQ and HT. Overall, 83% of participants were happy to have chosen pathology, but 45% reported to experience the feeling of burnt out.

Accuracy of serous effusion cytology was measured against histological analysis, imaging, surgical findings and clinical follow-up.</p><p id="Par999"><bold>Results:</bold> 1496 pleural effusion samples were recategorized: 12(0.8%) non-diagnostic(ND)|944(63.1%) negative for malignancy(NFM)|9(0.6%) atypia of undetermined significance(AUS)|54(3.6%) suspicious of malignancy(SFM)|477(31.9%) malignant(M). 763 peritoneal effusion samples were reclassified: 5(0.7%) ND|457(59.9%) NFM|12(1.6%) AUS|37(4.8%) SFM|252(33%) M. Risk of malignancy was, for the aforesaid categories, 57.1%;23.9%;50%;76.2%;100% in pleural effusions and 100%;26.3%;62.5%;91.7%;100% in peritoneal effusions. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy were, respectively, 61.6%;100%;100%;73.3%;81.3% for pleural effusions, and 61.2%;100%;100%;70%;79.7% for peritoneal effusions.</p><p id="Par1000"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Serous effusion cytology has a confirmatory role in the diagnosis of malignancy, corroborated by a high positive predictive value and specificity and a modest negative predictive value and sensitivity. The tiered classification system proposed (ISRSFC) will increase standardization, consistency and reproducibility in reporting, with an aim to improve communication and clinical decision-making.</p><p id="Par1001"><bold>OFP-11-010</bold></p><p id="Par1002"><bold>Moesin (MSN) as a novel proteome-based diagnostic marker for early detection of muscle-invasive bladder urothelial carcinoma in liquid-based cytology</bold></p><p id="Par1003"><underline>H.S.

A predictive biomarker needs to be identified for invasive BUC. Here, we employed proteomics on urine liquid-based cytology samples to demonstrate a biomarker for invasive BUC.</p><p id="Par1006"><bold>Methods:</bold> Proteomics methods were employed on 16 urine liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples and a set of BUC cell line library to verify candidate biomarker for invasive BUC. Furthermore, in vitro 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) invasion study and validation of immunocytochemistry were performed on an independent liquid-based cytology cohort.</p><p id="Par1007"><bold>Results:</bold> The proteomic analysis suggested moesin (MSN) as a potential biomarker to predict the invasiveness of BUC. Moreover, an in vitro 3D invasion study showed that inhibition of MSN significantly decreased invasiveness in BUC cell lines. Further validation of the slide-based moesin immunocytochemical test ultimately confirmed moesin (MSN) as a potential biomarker to predict the invasiveness of BUC (p = 0.042). The predictive ability was more powerful in the dichotomous comparison between BUC groups without invasion and the other group with invasion (p-value = 0.023, moesin immunoreactive rates, 38.5% vs. 82.4%, respectively).</p><p id="Par1008"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In conclusion, we suggest moesin as a potential diagnostic marker for early detection of BUC with invasion in LBC and as a potential therapeutic target.</p><p id="Par1009"><bold>OFP-11-011</bold></p><p id="Par1010"><bold>EUS guided FNA in diagnosing pancreatic lesions according to Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology for pancreaticobiliary system, a single centre experience</bold></p><p id="Par1011"><underline>I.

We present a first classification of tCAC obtained from patients diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma.</p><p id="Par1022"><bold>Methods:</bold> The study enrolled 170 patients with suspected prostate cancer scheduled for transrectal ultrasound-guided tissue biopsy. Blood was drawn immediately before the biopsy, thereby avoiding cross-contamination with cells released into circulation by the procedure. Atypical cells were isolated using hMX high-gradient magnetic cell separation and characterised by highly-multiplexed Cryoimmunostaining on standard laboratory slides in a seven channel widefield fluorescence microscope.</p><p id="Par1023"><bold>Results:</bold> Atypical circulating cells or cell clumps were observed in 49 out of 74 patients with a positive tissue biopsy for prostate adenocarcinoma, as well as in 22 out of 72 patients with a negative biopsy. Cells from patients with positive biopsy showed classical structural changes such as nuclear enlargement, indentation, irregularity, increased chromatin, multinucleation, and high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. The immunophenotype of atypical cells was predominantly endothelial (CD31, CD34) with diffuse overexpression of vimentin.</p><p id="Par1024"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Papanicolau first systematized general criteria for cellular malignancy. The Bethesda classification, among others, later refined and elaborated such criteria. The present study demonstrates that morphologies of tCAC in prostate adenocarcinoma patients correspond well to these general criteria, and, in addition, takes advantage of highly multiplexed immunophenotyping.

Sequencing and analysis of cancer genomes have identified a wealth of driver mutations and mutation signatures, illustrating how environmental mutagens cause genetic damage and elevate cancer risk.</p><p id="Par1050"><bold>Methods:</bold> We chemically induced liver tumours in fifteen-day-old male C3H/HeOuJ inbred mice and performed whole genome sequencing and histological analyses of of 371 independently-evolved tumours from 104 individuals.</p><p id="Par1051"><bold>Results:</bold> We revealed that most mutagenic DNA lesions are not resolved as mutations within a single cell-cycle. Instead, DNA lesions segregate unrepaired into daughter cells for multiple cell generations, resulting in the chromosome-scale phasing of subsequent mutations. We characterised this process in mutagen-induced mouse liver tumours and show that DNA replication across persisting lesions can produce multiple alternative alleles in successive cell divisions, thereby generating both multi-allelic and combinatorial genetic diversity.</p><p id="Par1052"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The phasing of DNA lesions enables the accurate measurement of strand biased repair processes, the quantification of oncogenic selection, and the fine mapping of sister chromatid exchange events.

To investigate the metabolic effects of LSD1 inhibition in tumours we used the novel inhibitor HCI-2509.</p><p id="Par1059"><bold>Methods:</bold> RNA sequencing followed by pathway analysis and qPCR validation was performed on non-treated versus HCI-2509 treated cancer cell lines. The mitochondria were investigated by mitochondrial membrane potential staining, flow cytometry quantification of the mitochondrial membrane potential and analysis of the respiratory chain, using the Seahorse device. Besides, public available patient datasets were assessed regarding differential expression of metabolic genes.</p><p id="Par1060"><bold>Results:</bold> Expression profiling revealed altered regulation of many metabolic genes upon pharmacological LSD1 inhibition. Especially, transcription of genes related to mitochondrial metabolism and in particular, expression of genes encoding subunits of the electron transport chain (ETC) complex I were repressed. Accordingly, we proved a decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential, lower ATP production and lower maximal respiration upon LSD1 inhibition in cancer cells. Interestingly, the expression of various mitophagy effectors was increased.

All slides were stained with H&amp;E, and immunohistochemistry was performed for the following markers: CD163 (or CD68), CD1a, S100 protein and phosphoERK. DNA was extracted from histiocyte-rich areas and analysed using real-time PCR, Picodroplet Digital PCR and NGS. Clinical information was obtained for each case.</p><p id="Par1109"><bold>Results:</bold> The final diagnosis of seventeen patients was ECD. For twelve patients, the abdominal symptoms revealed the disease, and nineteen underwent surgical biopsies. Four patients had a unique abdominal mass, while the others had diffuse peritoneal infiltration. Sixteen had subserosal histiocytic infiltration, ten of whom also had deep infiltration of adipose tissue. Histiocytes were mainly mononucleated, with multinucleated cells in seven cases. Eighteen cases contained foamy histiocytes. Most cases with low or moderate density of histiocytes had ECD. Cytosteatonecrosis was present in one patient with ECD. All cases were positive for CD163 or CD68 and negative for CD1a. Twelve cases contained phosphoERK positive histiocytes. Thirteen patients had BRAF or MAP2K1 mutations.</p><p id="Par1110"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Abdominal symptoms may reveal unsuspected Erdheim-Chester disease. In more than half of these referred cases the diagnosis of ECD was not initially proposed.

Deep learning-based TB assessment has the potential to improve diagnostic reproducibility and efficiency. We developed an algorithm that can detect individual tumour buds in pan-cytokeratin stained colorectal cancer slides</p><p id="Par1131"><bold>Methods:</bold> Tumour-bud candidates (n=1765, collected from 58 whole slide images; WSI) were labelled by seven experts as either TB, poorly differentiated cluster, or neither. The 58 slides were randomly split into a training (49) and test-set (9). A deep learning (DL) model was trained using the buds identified by the experts in the training set.</p><p id="Par1132"><bold>Results:</bold> The algorithm was tested on the nine remaining WSI and 270 WSI from pan-cytokeratin stained slides from Bern University hospital, in which hot spots and TB were manually scored.

This study aims to establish the most optimal (marker, region) and objective TIL assessment method.</p><p id="Par1140"><bold>Methods:</bold> Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) was applied on 94 triple negative breast cancer cases, using CD3, CD8 and FOXP3. Multispectral images were co-registered with serial H&amp;E sections, to combine deep learning based automated tissue delineation with lymphocyte detection. Densities of positive lymphocytes were analysed in different regions (peri- and intra-tumoral, within tumour stroma etc) and correlated to relapse free and overall survival.</p><p id="Par1141"><bold>Results:</bold> We found that for all three markers of TILs, the presence of a high density of positive cells correlated with an improved survival, with none of the markers being superior to the others.

For the task of pleomorphism grading, we trained a densenet model on those patches with the majority voting of the grades of the pathologists (majority grades). The variation of kappa scores of the pathologists with the majority grade was very high, ranging between 0.37 and 0.69 on the standalone test set consisting of 18 regions from 7 WSI.

However, conventional methods like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can come with several drawbacks. In this study, 1429 lung tumour samples were evaluated with targeted RNA-Seq.</p><p id="Par1263"><bold>Methods:</bold> For the detection of known and novel gene fusions, the Archer FusionPlex Lung panel (Archerdx, Boulder, CO) was used. In brief, 35 to 200 ng of tNA was target enriched by single primer extension. Prepared cDNA libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq (Illumina). Data analysis and fusion detection were done using Archer Analysis software versions 5.0.4, 5.1.3 and 6.2.1 (Archerdx).</p><p id="Par1264"><bold>Results:</bold> 1429 lung tumours were evaluated in routine diagnostics. 98% of these samples were analysable. Novel fusion partners, for example EGFR – VSTM2A or NIPBL-NRG1 were found as well as rare but clinically relevant lung fusions like ST7-MET and the EGFR VIII variant were identified. Furthermore, the assay was found to be a useful tool to verify, whether mutations and deletions in close proximity to characterized MET exon 14 skipping mutations will lead to a real exon skipping event. This assay is only hampered by the fact that fusions involving genes both outside the selectively captured region cannot be detected and false-negative results due to poor quality samples can be encountered.</p><p id="Par1265"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This method has demonstrated excellent diagnostic utility for fusion detection in lung tumours. Novel and rare fusions partner can be identified by targeting one gene fusion partner only.

MSI testing was carried out using the pentaplex panel and MMR immunohistochemistry testing two MMR proteins (MLH1, MSH2). The primary endpoint was the rate of real discordance between MSI and MMR IHC tests. Each discordance case was thoughtfully examined to be confirmed and explored.</p><p id="Par1282"><bold>Results:</bold> This cohort initially presented 28 (1.3%) discordant cases. After rereading of 2 tests (immunohistochemistry and molecular testing) and/or new tests, 75.0% of discordant cases (n=21/28) were reclassified as non-discordant. After rereading and addition of MSH6/PMS2 IHC, 32,1% of discordant cases, initially pMMR (n=9/28) were reclassified as non-discordant. Among the 19 remaining discordant cases (0,68%), 4 were MSI/pMMR and 16 MSS/dMMR. For 9 of them, the discordance was the result of sampling error (47% of the remaining cases).

The statistical significance of the correlation between PD-L1 status and clinicopathological characteristics was determined by chi-square test.</p><p id="Par1346"><bold>Results:</bold> PD-L1(+) were 24(51.1%) of the 47 TNBC patients whose median age at diagnosis was 59 (range, 39-79). 53.5%(23/43) of the primary and 25%(1/4) of the metastatic TNBC cases were PD-L1(+). 21(87.5%) of the PD-L1(+) TNBC had IC1(≥1 and &lt;5%), 2(8.3%) had IC2(≥5 and &lt;10%), and 1(4.2%) had IC3(≥10) score. The PD-L1(+) status significantly associated with high histological grade (G3, P=0.022), and higher proliferative index (Ki-67&gt;35%, P=0.004), while the correlation with larger tumour size (&gt;2 cm, P=0.055) did not reach statistical significance. No significant relationship was found between PD-L1 status and other variables such as patients` age, postoperative stage, tumour status, lymph nodal status, tumour type, vascular invasion, and p53 expression.</p><p id="Par1347"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our preliminary results suggest that PD-L1 expression is associated with several high-risk clinicopathological parameters in TNBC patients. Further larger studies are warranted to clarify the clinical relevance of PD-L1 expression in TNBC patients.</p><p id="Par1348"><bold>PS-01-008</bold></p><p id="Par1349"><bold>The significance of tumour budding in breast carcinomas and its relationship with E-cadherin, CD44 and CTLA-4 expressions</bold></p><p id="Par1350"><underline>T.

For each case, buds were counted at x200 magnification. 90% for E-Cadherin and 10% for CD44 were regarded as positive staining cut-offs. Staining intensity and percentage of CTLA-4 in bud and bud microenvironment lymphocytes were evaluated. Tumours were separated into low (&lt;5) and high bud groups (≥5) according to median bud number.</p><p id="Par1354"><bold>Results:</bold> High bud tumours were likely to have lymphovascular (p= 0.001), perineural invasion (p&lt;0.001), higher pT stage(p=0.025). Tumour bud number is correlated with higher metastatic lymph node number (p&lt;0.001) and tumour size (p&lt;0.01). No significant relation was found between number of buds and peritumoral lymphocytic reaction, immunohistochemistry based molecular subtyping, E-cadherin, and CD44 staining (p&gt;0.05 for all). E-cadherin was significantly lost in buds in regard to corresponding tumour (p&lt;0.001), while CD44 staining pattern is preserved (p = 0.76). In high bud tumours, CTLA-4 staining percentage of lymphocytes in bud microenvironment was found to be significantly higher (p =0.026). Every increase in tumour bud number, decreases overall survival risk 1.07 times (1.01-1.12 95%CI, p=0.013).</p><p id="Par1355"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Tumour bud is a poor prognostic factor in breast carcinomas. Increased CTLA-4 can block antitumour response, causing an increase in the number of buds. Anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapies may be beneficial in patients with high bud detected breast carcinoma.</p><p id="Par1356"><bold>PS-01-009</bold></p><p id="Par1357"><bold>A dynamic macrophagic environment in xanthogranulomatous mastitis: a broader clue to xanthomatous diseases pathophysiology and clinical evolution?</bold></p><p id="Par1358"><underline>L.

Usually no immunohistochemistry (IHC) characterization is performed in routine surgical pathology. In this study, we explored by IHC the macrophagic polarization status of M1 and M2 subtypes.</p><p id="Par1361"><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective single-institution case retrieve was performed from the archives. IHC was performed for CD68, Arginase I, Arginase II, NOS-2, and TGF-Beta. Sequential 400x images were acquired through a microscope coupled camera and quantified through an optical threshold method in ImageJ for each marker. Statistics were executed on SPSS 25 (ANOVA and Spearman's test), p-value less than 0.05 was significant.</p><p id="Par1362"><bold>Results:</bold> We reviewed 11 cases. All patients were female, median age of 56,5 years (29-72). Seven (63%) cases were radiologically described as an irregular nodule/asymmetry, while 4 (36%) as circumscribed nodule. The mean ratio of IHC stain was: Arginase I (0.80), Arginase II (0.70), NOS-2 (0.85), and TGF-B (0.60). M1 polarization elements (ArgI, II and TGF-B) were correlated (p=0.005 for ArgI-ArgII and p=0.001 for TGF-B-ArgI/II). Both M1 and M2 surrogate markers were expressed in all cases, characterizing a bipolar macrophagic activation status. No significant expressed in all cases, characterizing a bipolar macrophagic activation status. No significant correlation was evidenced between macrophage status and radiological presentation, necrosis or epithelioid giant cells.</p><p id="Par1363"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> XM is an uncommon diagnosis and this is the first attempt at classifying MC in indexed English-language literature. The bipolar status may translate as the destructive and reparative dynamic of lesions, evoking a slow-progressing evolution until reparative pole is reached.</p><p id="Par1364"><bold>PS-01-010</bold></p><p id="Par1365"><bold>Synchronous phyllodes tumour and ductal carcinoma in situ of breast</bold></p><p id="Par1366"><underline>R.

The lesion appeared 5 months before and it didn’t increased in size until lumpectomy was performed. For the histological examination we used hematoxylin&amp;eosin stained slides and immunohistochemical markers: CK5, ER, Ki67 and p-53.</p><p id="Par1370"><bold>Results:</bold> Histology analysis of the lumpectomy specimen showed phyllodes tumour with a 20% proliferative index and approximately 10 mitoses/10 HP, p-53 positive stromal cells. Following the histopathological result, modified radical mastectomy with lymph node dissection (Madden technique) was effectuated. The mastectomy specimen revealed multifocal high grade DCIS with comedo and non-comedo pattern; CK5 was expressed focally or in a continuous layer in the myoepithelial cells, excluding an invasive component, the tumour cells being diffusely and intensely positive for ER.</p><p id="Par1371"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The coexistence of phyllodes tumour and ductal carcinoma in situ as different lesions is a rare occurrence which complicates the evolution and treatment.

Yavuz</p><p id="Par1455">*Istanbul Faculty of Medicine, Pathology Department, Turkey</p><p id="Par1456"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Tall cell carcinoma with reversed polarity (TCCwRP) is a rare breast tumour. Despite the triple negative profile, it has an indolent behaviour. However, cases with lymph node and bone metastasis were published in literature.</p><p id="Par1457"><bold>Methods:</bold> The patient was a 62-year-old female who complained of multiple lumps in both breasts and had a history of surgery and chemotherapy for gastric carcinoma, 12 months before mastectomy. Grossly, there were two tumours, measured 14 and 13-milimeters, which were partly and totally well-demarcated respectively. Both had brown and white cut surfaces.</p><p id="Par1458"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopically, both tumours were composed of nests surrounded by artefactual empty space and separated by dense fibrous stroma. Both exhibited no sign of chemotherapy-induced regression. The tumour cells were columnar to cuboidal with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and oval, bland-looking nuclei which were located at the apical rather than basal pole of the cells. Foci of ductal carcinoma in situ were also found. Lymphovascular invasion and necrosis were absent. One of 22 axillary lymph nodes showed metastasis. The neoplastic cells were positive for GATA-3 and mammaglobin and negative for PAX-8 and TTF-1, excluding metastasis of thyroid carcinoma. They displayed diffuse expression of cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 5/6 and 14, and were negative</p><p id="Par1459"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> for oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2. Ki67 proliferation rates were 18% and 15%, respectively. EMA highlighted the apical membranes of neoplastic cells and pointed out the apical positioning of nuclei, therefore was helpful to designate the term reversed polarity. TCCwRP is a rare breast neoplasm, may mimic thyroid carcinoma metastasis. Hence, pathologists should keep it in mind and be aware of its morphological and immunohistochemical features.</p><p id="Par1460"><bold>PS-01-022</bold></p><p id="Par1461"><bold>High molecular weight cytokeratin expression in ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: a diagnostic pitfall</bold></p><p id="Par1462"><underline>T.

Bakhiet</p><p id="Par1463">*Hull University Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, United Kingdom</p><p id="Par1464"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> In breast pathology, the distinction between intraductal epithelial hyperplasia of usual type (HUT) and neoplastic lesions is challenging and often requires immunohistochemistry for confirmation. However, deviations from well-known patterns of expression exist in routine practice making such diagnoses challenging.</p><p id="Par1465"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present two cases of mammary Paget’s disease (PD) that underwent central excision of the nipple-areolar complex.</p><p id="Par1466">Histology confirmed PD with underlying intraductal epithelial proliferations difficult to differentiate between HUT and intermediate grade DCIS. Basal cytokeratins (CK5/6 and CK14) and oestrogen receptor (ER) immunohistochemical staining were performed to differentiate between the two entities, as well as HER2.</p><p id="Par1467"><bold>Results:</bold> Immunohistochemistry showed mosaic positivity of both basal cytokeratins akin to HUT. ER immunohistochemistry was heterogeneous in one case and negative in the other. However, the diagnosis of DCIS was confirmed in both cases by strong HER2 positivity and by extension of the proliferating cells into the epidermis as PD. Further morphological evaluation revealed nuclear hyperchromasia and occasional prominent nucleoli, features not seen in HUT.</p><p id="Par1468"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These cases demonstrate the importance of cellular morphology in diagnosing intermediate and high-grade DCIS and the potential diagnostic pitfall of relying on immunohistochemistry alone. The mosaic pattern of expression for basal CKs may represent basal-like differentiation of the neoplastic cells and this pattern of immunostaining should be interpreted in the appropriate context.</p><p id="Par1469"><bold>PS-01-023</bold></p><p id="Par1470"><bold>Comparison of the pam50 intrinsic subtypes with immunohistochemistry in breast cancer patients</bold></p><p id="Par1471"><underline>E.

Clinical subtyping, however, is based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) biomarkers. We aimed to analyse the discordance between immunohistochemistry based surrogate subtyping and PAM50 intrinsic subtypes.</p><p id="Par1474"><bold>Methods:</bold> PAM50 intrinsic subtypes were determined according to 50 cancer genes expression in a total of 74 breast tumours, oestrogen receptor positive, HER-2 negative, T&lt;=30 mm, pN0, pN1mi or pN1. Subtype Luminal A was defined by IHQ as Ki67 &lt; 14% and Luminal B as Ki67 &gt;=14%. Clinicopathological parameters were collected, including grade and stage in all tumours.</p><p id="Par1475"><bold>Results:</bold> A 33% of tumours, showed discrepancy between IHC subtype and PAM50 intrinsic subtype in our study. Out of 41 Luminal B tumours subtype performed by IHC, PAM50 reclassified 7 (17%) as Luminal A and low risk of recurrence, indicating that no adjuvant chemotherapy was needed. On the other hand, 7 (20.5%) Luminal A tumours classified by IHQ, changed to high risk by PAM50, being able to benefit from chemotherapy. The tumours reclassified by PAM 50 as low risk of recurrence were grade 1 and stage IA (71.4% Vs 17.7%, p=0.036) while the tumours reclassified as high risk, were grade 2 and stage IIA (60.0% Vs.47.8% p=0.048).</p><p id="Par1476"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A substantial portion of tumours showed discrepancy between IHC subtype and PAM50 subtype in our study. Gene expression-based classification shifted some tumours categorized as low risk by IHQ criteria to higher-risk subtypes and vice versa. Current IHC-based classification could mislead the treatment and result in poor outcome in 20% of breast cancers. Subtypes from PAM50 seem better able to predict tumours with poorer outcomes compared with using IHC markers.</p><p id="Par1477"><bold>PS-01-024</bold></p><p id="Par1478"><bold>A rare case of tumour-to-tumour metastasis from invasive lobular breast carcinoma to ovarian cystadenoma</bold></p><p id="Par1479"><underline>R.

Elalfy</p><p id="Par1480">*Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Ain Shams University, Egypt</p><p id="Par1481"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Tumour-to-tumour metastasis is an unusual phenomenon. The most frequently reported donor tumours are lung and breast carcinomas, whereas meningiomas represent the most common recipients. We hereby describe a rare case of metastasis from invasive lobular breast carcinoma to ovarian cystadenoma.</p><p id="Par1482"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 60-year-old female presenting with a 9 cm ovarian mass and a right breast lesion. Ultrasonography report of the breast lesion revealed features suggestive of malignant mass (BIRADS 4b). Fine needle aspiration of the breast tumour yielded malignant smear. Patient underwent right modified radical mastectomy, right oophorectomy and infracolic omentectomy.</p><p id="Par1483"><bold>Results:</bold> Histopathologic evaluation of the breast mass revealed invasive lobular carcinoma, positive for oestrogen, progesterone receptors and Her2-neu negative. The ovarian mass exhibited features of benign ovarian cystadenoma harbouring a distinct malignant component, histologically similar to invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast. Immunohistochemical assessment of the aforementioned invasive component using GCDFP15 and E-cadhrin confirmed the breast origin of the tumour and the lobular carcinoma diagnosis. Other markers were used to exclude metastasis from different sites such as Napsin-A and CDX-2</p><p id="Par1484"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This is the first reported case of invasive lobular breast carcinoma metastasis to ovarian cystadenoma. The possibility of tumour-to-tumour metastasis rises if any tumour exhibits dimorphic histology, which is diagnostically challenging.

Pathologic diagnosis and reporting is one of the basic available resources. It is therefore critical that reports contain key diagnostic and prognostic indicators guide the management of patients.</p><p id="Par1490"><bold>Methods:</bold> Copies of histopathology reports were retrieved from the histopathology department for all mastectomies reported between January 2016 and December 2019. Completeness for reporting of the mastectomies was examined for 7 key items: tumour size, tumour type, histological grade, margins of excision, vessel invasion, nodal status and TNM stage. The items were indicated as present or absent from the report.</p><p id="Par1491"><bold>Results:</bold> The histological type had the highest frequency of 100%, while the lymph node status and tumour size were reported in 92.3% and 82.1% respectively. The least frequently reported items were the TNM staging and the vessel invasion at 23.1% and 25.6% respectively. Only 2.6% of reports had all the variables reported.

Median follow-up was 15.2 years. Primary tumours were scored for TILs on whole slides. CD8 and FOXP3 were scored on tissue microarrays using immunohistochemistry and the absolute stromal area occupied by the respective cell type was calculated.</p><p id="Par1567"><bold>Results:</bold> Among unirradiated patients, a high absolute CD8:FOXP3 balance (CD8High/FOXP3Low) was associated with a decreased risk of BCR (HR 0.40, CI 95% 0.21-0.78, p=0.005) compared to the CD8Low/FOXP3Low group (HR 1.0). RT produced a significant risk reduction of BCR among CD8Low/FOXP3Low tumours (HR 0.49, CI95% 0.35-0.70, p&lt;0.001), but not among tumours with CD8High/FOXP3Low (HR 1.60, CI 95% 0.71-3.6, p=0.26).

Hence its correlation with prognosis in breast cancer (BC) is contradictory. This study investigated the correlations of TIMP2 expression in BC with clinicopathological variables.</p><p id="Par1624"><bold>Methods:</bold> Differential expression analysis of TIMP2 was assessed in the lymphovascular invasion (LVI) positive versus negative cohorts in the METABRIC BC dataset. Immunohistochemical analysis for TIMP2 (1:50 dilution) expression was conducted on BC tissue microarrays (n=1048) and clinicopathological correlations were assessed, including VI and expression of MMPs, 2, 14 and 15.</p><p id="Par1625"><bold>Results:</bold> TIMP2 was associated with positive LVI in the METABRIC cohort (p= 0.002).

TIMP2 expression showed a significant correlation with negative ER status (0.014) and Triple negative status (p =0.008). TIMP2 expression also showed a positive correlation with cytoplasmic MMP2, MMP14 and MMP15 (p&lt;0.0001) expression.

Galen Prostate CE-IVD detects and grades prostate core needle biopsies, and Galen Breast detects invasive and in-situ carcinomas in breast biopsies.</p><p id="Par1679"><bold>Results:</bold> Both algorithms were assessed for performance on independent data from various labs and demonstrated high specificity and sensitivity, including identification of cancers missed by pathologists. Maccabi has deployed both Galen Prostate and Galen Breast as a QC system on all new prostate and breast biopsies entering the lab. The system raises an alert whenever it encounters a discrepancy between the automated analysis and the original diagnosis, prompting a second human review. In this talk, we will discuss the workflow in the lab and the performance of the algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first AI-based prostate and breast diagnostic systems running in a live clinical setting.</p><p id="Par1680"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The importance of accurate diagnosis in prostate and breast biopsies, together with the growing shortage of pathologists, makes a QC system like this extremely useful for diagnostic accuracy and safety.</p><p id="Par1681"><bold>PS-01-055</bold></p><p id="Par1682"><bold>Crosstalk between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, Ki-67 labelling index and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in invasive breast cancer: a tertiary care centre study</bold></p><p id="Par1683"><underline>R.

Present study aimed to ascertain and correlate PD-L1 expression with Ki-67 labelling index and TILs in Invasive breast carcinoma</p><p id="Par1686"><bold>Methods:</bold> It was a two year (2016-2018), descriptive observational study including all the diagnosed cases of Invasive breast carcinoma. All Core biopsy, wedge biopsy, lumpectomy and MRM specimens were examined. PD-L1 expression was assessed in tumour and stromal TILs and its correlation was done with hormone receptor status and with Ki-67 labelling index. Appropriate statistical analysis was done using SPSS 23.0v.</p><p id="Par1687"><bold>Results:</bold> Total 114 cases were included in present study, of which 33.33% (38) showed PD-L1+ expression in tumour cells and 47.37% (54) showed PD-L1+ expression in stromal TILs. Higher Ki-67 labelling index was observed in 96 cases and low in 18 cases. 49 cases were ER- and 65 were ER+. Of these 49 cases, 22 cases showed PD-L1+ expression and from 65 cases, 49 showed PD-L1+ expression.</p><p id="Par1688">Present study highlighted a statistically significant relationship between expression of PD-L1 in tumour cells and stromal TILs. Significant concordance between Ki-67 labelling index and PD-L1 expression was noted in tumour cells and stromal TILs. An inverse correlation was noted between PD-L1 expression and ER.</p><p id="Par1689"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PD-L1 expression in tumour and TILs with high Ki-67 index may have role in targeted chemotherapy.

Active surveillance for low risk DCIS is currently explored as a valid treatment option in randomised clinical trial setting. The current study investigated the impact of morphological intra-tumoral heterogeneity in a series of 51 large DCIS lesions by comparing biopsies with their subsequent resection specimen.</p><p id="Par1726"><bold>Methods:</bold> Nuclear atypia, DCIS architecture, necrosis, calcifications, stromal architecture and stromal inflammation were assessed in one biopsy slide and three slides from the resection specimen. For each histopathological feature, a histoscore was determined and compared between the biopsy and the resection. Statistical analysis comprised Friedman tests, Wilcoxon tests with Bonferroni corrections and Spearman’s correlations.</p><p id="Par1727"><bold>Results:</bold> Despite substantial morphological heterogeneity in up to 50% of DCIS, the assessment of each histopathological feature in the biopsy correlated significantly with the assessment of the histopathological features in the resection specimen, with the exception of necrosis. Morphological heterogeneity was not associated with patient age, DCIS size or type of surgery, except for a weak association (p=0,048) between heterogeneous stromal inflammation and smaller DCIS size.</p><p id="Par1728"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Histopathological features assessed at the biopsy level correlated well with the surgical specimen, except for necrosis. Overall morphological intratumoral heterogeneity has limited impact. However, caution is warranted for the assessment of comedonecrosis in biopsies, as its presence can be underestimated.</p><p id="Par1729">Funding: Postdoctoral clinical mandate (2019-089) of the Foundation Against Cancer (Brussels, Belgium).</p><p id="Par1730"><bold>PS-01-062</bold></p><p id="Par1731"><bold>The diverse molecular landscape of breast cancers with heterogeneous HER2 gene amplification</bold></p><p id="Par1732"><underline>M.R.

Wesseling, C.H. van Deurzen</p><p id="Par1733">*University Clinics Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium</p><p id="Par1734"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Heterogeneous HER2 amplification is noted in 5-41% of breast carcinomas, depending upon its definition. Intra-tumour heterogeneity drives cancer progression and may enable circumventing HER2-targeted therapies, thereby causing primary and acquired resistance. Here, we performed an in-depth molecular analysis of admixed HER2-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer components.</p><p id="Par1735"><bold>Methods:</bold> We micro-dissected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue of ten patients. Each tumour contained at least one HER2-negative and at least one HER2-positive component. Targeted next-generation sequencing was performed using a 53-gene panel. Somatic mutations were analysed. Copy number variations were investigated, based on the available coverage data.</p><p id="Par1736"><bold>Results:</bold> The following (likely) pathogenic molecular anomalies were identified in 26 genes: 3 splice site alterations, 32 missense variants, 7 nonsense variants, 9 insertions and 12 deletions. Copy number gains were identified in the CCND1, EGFR, ERBB2, FGFR1, MYC and PVT1 genes. Overall, most somatic mutations and copy number variations were heterogeneously distributed within the different HER2-negative and HER2-positive tumour components. The HER2-negative cancer components did not harbour common alternative drivers.</p><p id="Par1737"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Breast cancers with heterogeneous HER2 gene amplification display several molecular anomalies that might act as alternative or collaborative drivers of carcinogenesis. However, these genetic aberrations display a heterogeneous distribution as well, and likely contain a large number of ‘passenger’ mutations.</p><p id="Par1738">Funding: Dr. Mieke Van Bockstal is supported by the Belgian not-for-profit organisation 'Foundation Against Cancer' (Grant 2019-089) and by the Mathilde Horlait-Dapsens Foundation (Brussels, Belgium).</p><p id="Par1739"><bold>PS-01-063</bold></p><p id="Par1740"><bold>HER2-positive apocrine carcinoma of the breast: a population-based analysis of incidence, treatment, and outcome</bold></p><p id="Par1741">F.

The purpose of study is to evaluate expression of S100A8, one of well-known MDSC markers, and see its relation to other factors including immune cell (IC) subsets in pre-invasive and invasive breast cancers.</p><p id="Par1762"><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 765 cases of breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive carcinoma were included in this study. S100A8 expression in tumour cells (TCs) and ICs, and infiltration of other IC subsets (CD4+, CD8+, and FOXP3+ T cells and PD-L1+ ICs) were detected by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays.</p><p id="Par1763"><bold>Results:</bold> S100A8 expression in either TCs or ICs did not differ in frequency between DCIS and invasive carcinoma. In both DCIS and invasive carcinoma, high-S100A8 in TCs and ICs were commonly associated with aggressive pathologic features, such as histologic grade. High-S100A8-IC status positively correlated with infiltration of CD8+ T cells, and presence of PD-L1+ ICs, in both DCIS and invasive carcinoma. In survival analyses, high-S100A8 in TCs and ICs was associated with decreased overall survival in patients with invasive breast cancer, and the difference in survival was most remarkable in HR-positive tumours. In subgroup analysis, tumours containing high-S100A8 and low-PD-L1 IC showed worst overall survival compared to other groups.</p><p id="Par1769"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> S100A8+ ICs are already found in pre-invasive stage as much as in invasive carcinoma and are correlated with CD8+ T cells and PD-L1+ ICs.

Usubutun</p><p id="Par1809">*Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Turkey</p><p id="Par1810"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> High grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (HG-ESS) is a malignant mesenchymal tumour of uterus which frequently demonstrates YWHAE-NUTM2 fusion. Previous studies identified HG-ESS cases with BCOR gene translocations. Therefore, immunohistochemistry for BCOR could be useful in identifying such HG-ESS cases.</p><p id="Par1811"><bold>Methods:</bold> One hundred seventy-two uterine sarcomas diagnosed between 2000-2019 were re-evaluated. Tissue microarray blocks were constructed from 3 HG-ESS, 19 LG-ESS and 15 uterine sarcomas with high-grade morphology which were included in this study. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies using YWHAE and BCOR brake-apart probes and immunohistochemical studies for BCOR were performed. Patients’ files were used for clinical information.</p><p id="Par1812"><bold>Results:</bold> Five patients, 4 of which had tumours extending beyond uterus, had translocations involving YWHAE or BCOR. Four tumours showed high-grade morphology and revealed YWHAE translocation. One patient with myxoid morphology revealed BCOR translocation. In immunohistochemistry, all YWHAE translocated tumours showed BCOR positivity, however, BCOR translocated tumour was negative. One patient is alive after 18 months, three patients died 4, 18 and 34 months after diagnosis, one was lost to follow-up.</p><p id="Par1813"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> HG-ESS is an aggressive tumour with poor clinical outcome. Our study showed that BCOR immunohistochemistry could be a useful diagnostic tool to identify HG-ESS cases with translocation of YWHAE gene. However, FISH analysis is essential for definitive diagnosis. We also report that molecular analysis and conspicuous myxoid morphology can help identifying HG-ESS with translocation of BCOR gene which also seems to have aggressive clinical behaviour. Another important finding is that BCOR translocated HG-ESS was negative with BCOR immunohistochemistry.</p><p id="Par1814">This research was supported by Hacettepe University - Coordination Unit of Scientific Research Projects.</p><p id="Par1815"><bold>PS-02-005</bold></p><p id="Par1816"><bold>Mismatch repair protein deficiency in the endometria of the general population: an immunohistochemical study</bold></p><p id="Par1817"><underline>K.

This study aims to assess the frequency of mismatch repair protein deficiency in this group within non-neoplastic and hyperplastic endometrium by immunohistochemistry.</p><p id="Par1820"><bold>Methods:</bold> 200 biopsies of polypoid and flat endometrium were anonymised and allocated to four different diagnostic groups (n = 50 each) for analysis of mismatch repair protein deficiency: non-hyperplastic, disordered proliferation, hyperplasia without cytologic atypia and hyperplasia with cytologic atypia. Each biopsy was assessed by immunohistochemistry for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6.</p><p id="Par1821"><bold>Results:</bold> One (2%) biopsy within the hyperplasia with cytological atypia group showed glandular MSH2 and MSH6 deficiency in areas of atypical hyperplasia and adjacent carcinoma. In the complex hyperplasia group, two (4%) showed glandular MLH1 and PMS2 deficiency, one with focal and the other with widespread loss of staining. The disordered proliferation group contained one biopsy with focal glandular loss of MLH1 and PMS2. The non-hyperplastic group contained no cases of mismatch repair protein deficiency.</p><p id="Par1822"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Mismatch repair deficient glands are observed in morphologically benign endometrium from women not known to have Lynch syndrome. Glandular loss of mismatch repair protein expression may be an early event in endometrial carcinogenesis and its detection may identify high-risk women in whom endometrial surveillance and/or progestin treatment is justified.</p><p id="Par1823">Funding: BDIAP Glasgow 2020 Educational Fellowship</p><p id="Par1824"><bold>PS-02-006</bold></p><p id="Par1825"><bold>L1 cell adhesion molecule expression in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma, its prognostic significance, and correlation with survival</bold></p><p id="Par1826"><underline>S.D.

This study aims to analyse the relationship between L1CAM expression, clinicopathological parameters, and survival in endometrioid endometrial carcinoma.</p><p id="Par1829"><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients diagnosed with endometrioid carcinoma were selected. Grade, presence/depth of myometrial invasion, invasion patterns, lymphovascular invasion, cervical stromal invasion were re-evaluated. Age, stage, lymph node metastasis, peritoneal cytology positivity, recurrence, overall and disease-free survival were recorded. Risk classification was made according to ESMO-ESGO-ESTRO consensus. The relationship between L1CAM expression and clinicopathological parameters and its effect on survival was calculated statistically.</p><p id="Par1830"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 264 cases were included in the study. L1CAM positivity was observed in 22 cases (8.3%). A statistically significant relationship was found between L1CAM expression and advanced age, high grade, deep myometrial invasion, high-intermediate with high-risk cases and pelvic recurrence. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that L1CAM positive patients had poorer overall survival and disease-free survival. L1CAM expression was found to affect overall and disease-free survival in univariate analysis.</p><p id="Par1831"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> L1CAM expression was significantly associated with advanced age, high grade, deep myometrial invasion, high-intermediate, and high-risk cases. Moreover, L1CAM expression predicts pelvic recurrence and poorer survival.

Our study is evaluating the immunoexpression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers (EMT) in different types of myoinvasion patterns.</p><p id="Par1837"><bold>Methods:</bold> The study has been performed on a study group of 20 cases selected from the files of “Elena Doamna” Obstetrics and Gynaecology University Hospital of Iasi, between 2013 and 2017, in patients of 43-78 year-old. The hysterectomy specimens have been evaluated by routine histology and immunohistochemistry for CK7, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, β-catenin, and Vimentin.</p><p id="Par1838"><bold>Results:</bold> Clinicopathological parameters have been evaluated. The myoinvasive pattern has been identified as: MELF (multicystic, elongated and fragmented glands) (45%), diffusely infiltrative (25%), broad front (expansile, pushing border) (15%), adenomyosis-like (10%), and adenoma malignum (5%).The evaluation of different myoinvasive patterns of endometrioid endometrial carcinomas has been challenging, mainly in appreciation of the depth of myometrium invasion in adenomyosis-like and adenoma malignum patterns. MELF pattern has been correlated to age &gt;50 years, deep myometrium invasion (&gt;50%), recurrences (22.22% of cases), and partial immunoexpression of EMT markers.</p><p id="Par1839"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The evaluation of myometrium invasion types may open new perspectives for endometrioid endometrial carcinoma prognosis.

MMR-D and p53wt harboured 34/35 endometrioid carcinomas. POLE-EDM exhibited high-grade histology. Vascular invasion: 6/21(28,6%)MMR-D, 6/13(46,2%)p53abn, 8/19(42,1%)p53wt. "MELF" invasion: 1/21(4,8%)MMR-D, 1/13(7,7%)p53abn, 5/19(26,3%)p53wt. Extrauterine disease: 4/21(19%)MMR-D, 4/13(30,8%)p53abn, 6/19(31,6%)p53wt. POLE-EDM was IA and disease free survival(DFS). 14/21(66,7%)MMR-D, 5/13(38,7%)p53abn and 17/19(89,5%)p53wt are DFS. SUVmax/SUVpic were higher in MMR-D than p53abn. p53abn MTV and TLG were the lowest (p&lt;0,005). Only one p53abn(negative pattern) did not correlate with NGS results. PSQ was restricted to two codons, with frequent contaminations, but easy and quantitative interpretation.</p><p id="Par1921"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> ProMisE classification exhibits pathological correlation that improves diagnoses in ambiguous cases, displays strong prognostic value, above classical ones, and guides treatment. p53 immunohistochemistry correlates with molecular status of the gene. Paradoxically, the lowest metabolical activity is observed in p53abn group. PSQ is a sensitive technique, allowing an easy interpretation and quantitative results. However it exhibits some technical limitations. A comparative study with Sanger approach would have to be carried out.</p><p id="Par1922">Funding: BECA CIR (COMITÉ INSTITUCIONAL DE RECERCA) FUNDACIÓ PARC TAULÍ, 2017 (CIR2017/043).</p><p id="Par1923"><bold>PS-02-018</bold></p><p id="Par1924"><bold>Possible etiologic role of human papillomavirus in vulvar seborrheic keratosis: a study combining whole tissue section-PCR, immunohistochemistry (p16 and e4), and laser capture microdissection-PCR</bold></p><p id="Par1925"><underline>S.

Ewing-Graham, F.J. van Kemenade</p><p id="Par1926">*Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, The Netherlands</p><p id="Par1927"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> HPV-DNA has been previously detected in vulvar seborrheic keratosis (VSK) by performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on whole-tissue sections (WTS). However, this has been refuted as evidence of an etiologic involvement of HPV, as WTS-PCR does not inform on HPV-integration.</p><p id="Par1928"><bold>Methods:</bold> We explored the association of HPV and VSK by performing WTS-PCR, immunohistochemistry with p16 and E4, and laser capture microdissection (LCM)-PCR. p16 and E4 are surrogate markers of HPV-oncogene expression, and LCM-PCR allows HPV-detection from specific lesional cells, with a higher precision than WTS-PCR. VSKs were selected following strict histologic criteria to avoid including the common differential, HPV-related condyloma acuminata.</p><p id="Par1929"><bold>Results:</bold> HPVs were detected in 73% (11/15) of VSKs through WTS-PCR (SPF10-PCR-DEIA-LiPA25); these included HPV44 (n=4), HPV6 (n=4), HPV42 (n=2), HPV53 (n=1), and an untypable genotype (n=1). p16-positivity was noted in 82% (9/11), and E4-positivity was noted in 36% (4/11) of HPV-positive VSKs. LCM-PCR was performed on six lesional areas (two p16+/E4+ and four p16+/E4-) and one area of adjacent normal epithelium (p16-/E4-) selected from four HPV-positive VSKs. HPVs were detected from all lesional areas by LCM-PCR and the results were concordant with WTS-PCR. HPV could be detected in the basal/intermediate epithelial layers of the lesional areas, thereby ruling out surface contamination. The area from normal epithelium was negative for HPV.</p><p id="Par1930"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These results imply a pathogenic involvement of HPV in a proportion of VSKs. p16 and E4-positivity indicated HPV-integration, and through LCM-PCR, HPVs could be localized to the lesional cells. The natural of history of these VSKs deserves further study.</p><p id="Par1931"><bold>PS-02-019</bold></p><p id="Par1932"><bold>Analysis of endometrial carcinoma with subclonal P53 expression</bold></p><p id="Par1933"><underline>A.

An additional 5/19 cases (26%) harboured pathogenic POLE mutations (POLEmut). The remaining 7/19 tumours (37%) were MMR proficient (MMRp) and POLE wild type (POLEwt). Of these, 6/7 contained a TP53 mutation in both the areas with mutant pattern and wild type p53 expression, the only exception being a tumour where the subclonal loss was only present in 3% of the tumour cells, and below the limit of detection of the assay used.</p><p id="Par1938"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Subclonal p53 IHC reflects underlying TP53 mutation. In MMRd and POLEmut EC this is secondary and unlikely to show adverse prognosis.

Dissemination typically occurs via transcoelomic spread. Tubo-ovarian carcinoma presenting as nodal metastases in the absence of clinical features of pelvic disease is rare.</p><p id="Par2042"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present a summary of findings in a series of serous carcinomas of Mullerian origin, diagnosed on lymph node biopsies. These cases were seen as a part of the diagnostic and consultation service of a specialist gynaecological pathology department.</p><p id="Par2043"><bold>Results:</bold> 12 women, 4 each with enlarged axillary and neck nodes, 1 each with enlarged nodes in the supraclavicular fossa, inguinal, peripancreatic and retroperitoneal sites; were diagnosed with metastatic serous carcinoma of Mullerian origin (10 high grade and 2 low grade). 9 presented with mass related symptoms, others with nausea, backache and dysphagia.

In this study we investigated whether the Amsterdam Placental Workshop Group (APWG) recommendations could provide relevant information concerning placental lesions, in comparison to routine study (RS).</p><p id="Par2050"><bold>Methods:</bold> We carried out a 9-month retrospective study of spontaneous abortion samples collected in our institution. All samples coded as “spontaneous abortion” and/or “product of conception” were selected from the Pathology Department database. Maternal clinicopathological and demographic variables were collected from the electronic records. All histopathological samples were reviewed a second time by two pathologists simultaneously using the APWG criteria.</p><p id="Par2051"><bold>Results:</bold> 408 samples were analysed. Mean age 35.5 years (17-48 years), mean gestational age 9.2 weeks (4-18 weeks). Samples were normal in 405 cases in the RS compared to 352 following our systematic revision. Relevant data were identified in 3(1%) cases of the RS [mola(1), acute inflammation(2)] vs. 56(14%) cases with APWG criteria [mola(1), distal villous hypoplasia(1), accelerated villous maturation(1), infarction(12)].

Overlapping/atypical staining patterns are a common pitfall. Our objective was to ascertain the frequency of tumours co-expressing Müllerian marker PAX-8 and breast/urothelial marker GATA-3.</p><p id="Par2066"><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a search on our internal pathology I.T. system (CoPath) for all specimens from 2015-2019 on which PAX-8 and GATA-3 immunostains were performed. We then collated the cases which expressed both markers and reviewed the final diagnoses on the pathology reports.</p><p id="Par2067"><bold>Results:</bold> PAX-8 and GATA-3 immunostains were performed on 228 surgical and cytological specimens. 22 tumours expressed both markers. The final histological diagnosis in 12/22 cases (54.5%) favoured tumours originating in the gynaecological tract; most of these were high-grade (8/12) and of tubo-ovarian origin (6/12), while 2/12 were uterine, 1/12 was cervical and for 3/12 the particular site of gynaecological origin was uncertain. 8/22 cases (36.5%) were diagnosed as poorly differentiated/high grade carcinoma where the site of origin could not be determined; 3/8 of these cases had a background history of previous ovarian or endometrial cancer. 1/22 (4.5%) was diagnosed as high-grade urothelial carcinoma and 1/22 (4.5%) as malignant epithelioid tumour.</p><p id="Par2068"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Immunohistochemistry is commonly used to establish the origin of poorly differentiated or metastatic tumours. PAX-8 is positive in approximately 80% of Müllerian tract-derived carcinomas. GATA-3 is positive in 94% of breast and 86% of urothelial carcinomas. Our study highlights potential diagnostic pitfalls when both markers are positive, particularly in the diagnosis of gynaecological tract malignancy, and supports previous findings of GATA-3 positivity in a subset of endometrial and ovarian carcinomas.</p><p id="Par2069"><bold>PS-02-039</bold></p><p id="Par2070"><bold>Mismatch repair deficiency in uterine carcinosarcoma - a 20 year retrospective review: 18 cases tested</bold></p><p id="Par2071"><underline>S.

In the setting of MMR loss, a diagnosis of dedifferentiated carcinoma should be considered. Understanding how MMRd contribute to carcinosarcoma pathogenesis is relevant not only for identifying Lynch síndrome and prevent the development of colorectal cancer but also for identifying candidates for immunotherapy, as defects in MMR have been shown to impart vulnerability to checkpoint inhibition.</p><p id="Par2092"><bold>PS-02-040</bold></p><p id="Par2093"><bold>Peculiarities of vascularisation of serous adenocarcinoma of fallopian tubes</bold></p><p id="Par2094"><underline>N.

The objective is to assess the impact of VDR expression levels in stroma and endometrial glands on the outcomes of ART programs.</p><p id="Par2168"><bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective study of IVF outcomes was performed in 70 women of advanced reproductive age with tubal-peritoneal infertility. An endometrial pipe-biopsy was taken during the supposed implantation window. The endometrial samples were formalin-fixed and embedded in paraffin. For immunohistochemistry, rabbit polyclonal Vitamin D receptor antibodies were used. The percentage of VDR-positive stromal cells was calculated.</p><p id="Par2169"><bold>Results:</bold> VDR expression in the endometrial stroma was significantly higher in the case of successful implantation. The threshold value was 8.7%, since clinical pregnancy was not observed if the percent of VDR positive cells was equal to or higher than 8.7%. Therefore, the endometrium was favourable for implantation in values of less than 8.7%. There were no significant differences in VDR expression in the endometrial glands.</p><p id="Par2170"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The obtained results expand the range of endometrial receptivity markers.

Recurrence/metastasis occurs in 1/5 of cases. Molecular markers tailor adjuvant therapies. We aimed to characterize therapy-related marker expression including mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, hormone receptors, and HER2 in metastatic/recurrent endometrial carcinoma.</p><p id="Par2192"><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective search in our pathology archive for metastatic/recurrent endometrial carcinoma subsequent to a staging surgery from 2008 to 2019 was performed. Tumours of epithelial origin including carcinoma and carcinosarcoma were included. Slides were retrieved for morphology review. Cases with sufficient formalin-fixed paraffin embedded materials were constructed into tissue microarray for immunohistochemical stains.</p><p id="Par2193"><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-six cases were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 60 years (34-76) and the median interval to 1st metastasis was 76.4 weeks (1.1 to 795.6). Loss of MMR protein expression was found in 22.2% of cases (seven paired loss of MLH1 and PMS2 and one paired loss of MSH2 and MSH6). Oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 was positive in 65.6%, 43.8%, and 6.3% of cases, respectively.

Yessen*</underline></p><p id="Par2404">*Karaganda Medical University, Kazakhstan</p><p id="Par2405"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Unfavourable conditions for foetal development are associated with the development of diseases in the postnatal period. Cause of perinatal death is latent or clinically expressed placental dysfunction, which developed under the exposure of various damaging factors at any stage of pregnancy.</p><p id="Par2406"><bold>Methods:</bold> A prospective histological study of 106 placentas (37-42 weeks) during physiological pregnancy (n-82) and prenatal death of the foetus (n-24) was carried out. All placentas were examined in accordance with Vogel principles (1996). The relative number of immature forms of villi in 100 peripheral grooves of the representative placental area was determined.</p><p id="Par2407"><bold>Results:</bold> In 28 placentas, the delayed development of chorionic villi was determined. Of these, 22 placentas (79%) showed expressed (&gt; 50% immature villi) and 6 placentas (21%) moderate delay (30-50% of immature villi) of the development of chorionic villi. In 92% of the placenta, with antenatal asphyxia of the foetus and in 15% of the placenta during physiological pregnancy was found an immature histological phenotype (54.2 ± 12% and 34.3 ± 5.8% of immature villi, respectively). Therefore, postnatal evaluation of placental phenotype can help in the timely identification of adverse foetal conditions and early stratification of the heterogeneous population of new-borns, with identification of individual risk of disease in post-natal life.</p><p id="Par2408"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Physiological pregnancy may be accompanied by a delay in the maturation of chorionic villi and thereby latent chronic placental insufficiency. In the case of antenatal foetal death,the placenta becomes the main reliable source of information for making a diagnosis.</p><p id="Par2409"><bold>PS-02-083</bold></p><p id="Par2410"><bold>Dedifferentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma of uterus</bold></p><p id="Par2411"><underline>Ö.N.

This tumour is a new entity and may pose diagnostic challenges.</p><p id="Par2414"><bold>Methods:</bold> We discuss a case of 28-year old women who had severe stomach ache with palpable mass in abdomen. By the surgical examination we learned that the tumour was mainly located in uterus and invaded colon, bladder, liver, paraaortic lymph nodes. Hysterectomy specimen showed polypoid tumour filling endometrial cavity, invading full thickness and exceeding serosa.</p><p id="Par2415"><bold>Results:</bold> Tumour was described by the coexistence of undifferentiated carcinoma(%85) and low grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma(%15).Undifferentiated component was characterized by the proliferation of noncohesive, medium size, monotonous epithelial cells growing in a patternless solid fashion. The transtion between the two tumour components was abrupt with a sharp border. Undifferentiated cells were negative for epithelial markers, oestrogen, and progesterone receptors although others were positive. There were no loss of mismatch repair gene proteins. Metastases contained only undifferentiated component.</p><p id="Par2416"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Dedifferentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma has poor prognosis and aggressive behaviour. It can be misdiagnosed as grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Accurate diagnosis requires more awareness of this entity.

We identified several proteins, including ladinin-1 (LAD1), overexpressed in cancer tissue at the interface by tissue proteomics. This study aimed to examine LAD1 functions in oral SCCs in-vitro.</p><p id="Par2423"><bold>Methods:</bold> Oral SCC cell lines, HSC-2, 3, and 4, were used for in-vitro functional and immunofluorescence analyses with siRNA knockdown methods.</p><p id="Par2424"><bold>Results:</bold> LAD1-knockdown cells showed decreasing of cell proliferation in MTS assay and increasing of numbers of migrated cells in the transwell migration assay. Morphologically, LAD1 was localized in the peripheral area of the cytoplasm. High-resolutional morphological analysis using structured illumination microscopy revealed that LAD1 was co-localized with actin filaments forming “actin arc”. LAD1-kockdown cells showed decreasing of elongated filopodial filaments and ruffling of cell borders compared with controls. In addition, LAD1-kcockdown cells overexpressed WNT5a and showed prominent accumulations of phosphorylated focal adhesion kinases in the cytoplasm.</p><p id="Par2425"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> LAD1 is potentially involved in cell motility by modulation of actin dynamics and focal adhesion formation in oral SCC cells and the non-canonical WNT pathway may play a pivotal role in LAD1 functional association.</p><p id="Par2426"><bold>PS-03-002</bold></p><p id="Par2427"><bold>Effectiveness of rapid onsite evaluation of thyroid fine needle aspiration cytology</bold></p><p id="Par2428"><underline>F.

The evaluation of TILs in HNSCC has not been yet standardized. The aim was to evaluate the inter-observer agreement of visually-assessed TILs and a visual-versus-digital image analysis (DIA) evaluation comparison.</p><p id="Par2439"><bold>Methods:</bold> 40 samples from HNSCC patients from the Colombian cohort of the InterCHANGE study (IARC) were included. TMAs were constructed and Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and Immunohistochemistry for CD3, CD4 and CD8 were performed. TILs average score was assessed independently by three pathologists. Their scores were compared to DIA-scores using QuPath.</p><p id="Par2440"><bold>Results:</bold> The inter-observer agreement coefficients were 0.64, 0.71, 0.55 and 0.70 (ICC p=0.0001) for H&amp;E, CD3, CD4 and CD8, respectively. When the DIA-scores were compared to visual estimates, the average scores of the pathologists (H&amp;E: 0.71, CD3: 0.73, CD4: 0.4, CD8: 0.68, weighted-kappa) had better agreement than comparing individual scores (H&amp;E: 0.52-0.66, CD3: 0.54–0.79, CD4: 0.33–0.39, CD8: 0.5–0.66, weighted-kappa).

HPV active infection may lead to alterations in key signalling pathways that promote carcinogenesis. Different studies identified PIK3CA mutations more commonly in HPV positive tumours (37%).</p><p id="Par2448"><bold>Methods:</bold> We evaluated PIK3CA gene mutations associated with HPV16+HNSCC patients from the Portuguese Institute of Oncology between 2007 and 2019. HPV DNA status was evaluated by PCR and genotyped (INNOLIPA/ALLPLEXHPV28). PIK3CA mutation analysis was performed by real-time PCR for the qualitative detection of four mutations (H1047L; E542K, E545K, E545D) in human genomic DNA extracted from tumour tissue (AmoyDx).</p><p id="Par2449"><bold>Results:</bold> PIK3CA mutations were evaluated in 50 squamous cell carcinomas, all HPV16 positive. Co-infection with HPV18, HPV53, HPV58 was present in 2 cases. Ten cases harboured PIK3CA mutations (20%). Three different mutations H1047R (10%), E545D (50%), E545K (20%) were identified. Combined E545D/E545K mutations were present in 20% of cases. Mutations in PIK3CA gene were present in cases from the oral cavity (20%) and the oropharynx (80%).</p><p id="Par2450"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In our series, a lower frequency of PIK3CA gene mutations was found among HPV16+ HNSCC compared with other series. These results may be related to the method used and to clinical aspects and should be confirmed by other series in Portugal.

A HPV+ and HPV- cell line were exposed to long term cisplatin treatment to generate resistant models. Immunofluorescence and MTS assays were used to assess DNA double strand breaks and cell viability respectively.</p><p id="Par2457"><bold>Results:</bold> Knockdown of E6 and E7 in a HPV+ cell line did not significantly effect cell viability in response to cisplatin. Following long term treatment with cisplatin, the HPV+ and HPV- resistant cells had a significantly higher half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) compared to the parental cells (HPV- resistant cells IC50: 47.5 compared to 10.3 and HPV+ resistant cells IC50: 84.9 compared to 40.0) and showed fewer DNA double strand breaks following cisplatin treatment.

In identifying the origin, the study of HPV-16 status can be useful.</p><p id="Par2465"><bold>Methods:</bold> We have studied three patients that presented cervical lymph node metastases of unknown origin. All three of them were middle-aged women with no relevant medical history. The lymph node study was done with hematoxylin eosin slides and immunohistochemistry techniques including CK5/6, p63 and p16. The HPV status was studied through DNA-PCR amplification and microarray hybridization.</p><p id="Par2466"><bold>Results:</bold> All cases showed infiltration in the lymph node of poor-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Two of the three cases showed positivity for p16 and also for HPV-16. The third case was negative for p16 and HPV. Gynaecological exams were performed in all these women, with absence of cervical dysplasia. In one of the patients the origin was identified, being oropharyngeal. The other two patients still remain with no primary tumour detected.</p><p id="Par2467"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The presence of HPV seems to be important in this patients but appears to not have direct relationship with cervical dysplasia or anogenital origin.

We aim to elucidate the status of SQSTM1 and GATA3 expression in SDC.</p><p id="Par2543"><bold>Methods:</bold> We collected 53 cases of SDC, including 30 cases of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (CXPA), and 30 cases of pleomorphic adenoma (PA), and performed the immunohistochemistry for SQSTM1 and GATA3 on their FFPE sections, adding GCDFP-15 and AR. Finally, we estimated the positive rates and the pattern for these molecules in SDC and PA cases, respectively.</p><p id="Par2544"><bold>Results:</bold> The positive rates for GCDFP-15, AR, SQSTM1, and GATA3 in SDC cases were 91%, 85%, 81% and 89%, respectively. The signals for AR and GATA3 were limited to nuclei (N), whereas the signals for GCDFP-15 were observed in the cytoplasm (CY). The signals for SQSTM1 were seen in N and/or CY.

The results and clinical outcomes for the positive and negative SNB cases were compared. <bold>Results:</bold> In all positive SNB cases, metastatic SCC was present on the first H&amp;E level. Additional histopathological levels and immunohistochemical staining did not contribute to the identification of SCC.

Imaging, including PET CT, highlighted metastatic disease at presentation in both cases. MDT discussion highlighted poor prognosis in each case.</p><p id="Par2646"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Intraosseous salivary gland neoplasms, although rare, should be considered in the differential diagnosis for tumours within the mandible. They have a propensity for local recurrence and metastasis, and complete surgical resection therefore offers the best outcome. Their clinical and radiological features can be similar to odontogenic tumours. Accurate histological diagnosis is therefore crucial as well as close clinical and radiological correlation to delineate the most appropriate treatment for these patients.</p><p id="Par2647"><bold>PS-03-032</bold></p><p id="Par2648"><bold>Protocols of lymph node sampling in 95 cases of head &amp; neck squamous cell carcinoma: is excessive concern for cost control leading to understaging and under treatment?</bold></p><p id="Par2649"><underline>S.

Does under-sampling of larger grossly uninvolved LN compromise the patient care.</p><p id="Par2653"><bold>Methods:</bold> 95 cases of head -neck SCC with metastatic lymph nodes(MLN) were categorized into four groups as small nodes(submitted entirely), grossly positive LN, bisected LN and both halves show metastasis and LN which were bisected or trisected and only one slice shows metastatic disease. LN level and the 'N' stage were noted. Retrospective analysis of its impact on staging was done.</p><p id="Par2654"><bold>Results:</bold> Nine cases out of ninety-five revealed that under-sampling of the MLN would have missed the detection of metastasis. Surprisingly, there would have been under-staging of LN stage in five out of these nine cases if the LN were not sampled entirely. This also changes the prognosis of the patient and will lead to false staging.</p><p id="Par2655"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The gross and microscopic examination provides information about the number of nodes involved, size of the deposit and presence of extracapsular extension (ECE) for staging of the disease. Accurate sampling and thorough examination of LN is perhaps the most important contribution of a pathologist in the management of head and neck cancers. Adequate sampling should be the standard of practice to avoid compromise in patient care.</p><p id="Par2656">Larger grossly uninvolved LN should be submitted entirely for adequate staging.</p><p id="Par2657"><bold>PS-03-033</bold></p><p id="Par2658"><bold>Focal melanocytic lesions of the oral mucosa: an 18-year retrospective study</bold></p><p id="Par2659"><underline>T.

Patient information was collected from medical charts, and all archived histopathological specimens with diagnoses of oral melanocytic lesions were retrieved and reviewed.</p><p id="Par2663"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 341 melanocytic lesions among 64,695 samples received for histopathological analysis. Of these, 191 were melanotic macule; 112 melanocytic nevi; 14 mucosal lentigo simplex; 12 oral melanomas; nine actinic lentigines and one melanoacanthoma. Lesions occurred mostly in women (n=218; 65.5%), with white skin colour (n=217; 74%). The main reported clinical aspect was macular (n=124; 67.6%). Melanocytic lesions occurred mainly in lip vermilion (n=83; 25.6%), followed by palate (n=74; 22.8%). The age of the patients was higher in melanoma patients and these cases had a shorter average duration until the time of diagnosis. Most lesions were small and only oral melanomas were larger in size when compared to other lesions.</p><p id="Par2664"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Melanocytic lesions are an uncommon diagnosis in oral pathology routines. The most frequent lesions are melanotic macule and nevus.

We aimed to investigate microRNA-31 expression in pre-and post-surgical OSCC patients and its association with clinicopathological features.</p><p id="Par2670"><bold>Methods:</bold> We investigated salivary microRNA-31 expression in pre-surgical and post-surgical (6 weeks after surgery) patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (n=16) and control (n=2) by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) after ethical approval from institutional review board (IRB).</p><p id="Par2671"><bold>Results:</bold> Salivary microRNA-31 expression was differentially regulated in pre- and post-surgical patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma and controls. MicroRNA-31 was significantly upregulated in pre-surgical cases (p&lt;0.05). However, the expression was significantly reduced after 6-weeks of surgical excision of tumour, indicating that most of the microRNA-31 derived from oral squamous cell carcinoma tissues.

We analysed HRAS status in 3 cases of EMCs with predominant solid-oncocytic and sebaceous features, as Urano et al (2019) demonstrated HRAS mutation in 82.7% of EMCs.</p><p id="Par2678"><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients were 2 males and 1 female aged 69-75 years. Two cases presented prominent solid oncocytic pattern and 1 was characterized by extensive sebaceous differentiation (initially diagnosed as sebaceous carcinoma). HRAS sequencing were analysed in 3 cases using a single base primer extension approach (SNaPshot assay) on an ABI Prism 3500 genetic analyser. Fragment analysis was performed using GeneMapper software.</p><p id="Par2679"><bold>Results:</bold> All 3 cases analysed for mutations in HRAS showed positive results. The site of mutation was exon 2 (p.Gly13Arg; c.37G&gt;C) in one oncocytic EMC, while the same mutation in exon 3 (Q61R; c.182A&gt;G) was found in the second oncocytic case and in the sebaceous EMC.</p><p id="Par2680"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> EMCs with prominent unusual variants of histologic features can be frequently confused with other entities with different behaviour and prognosis. We demonstrated that HRAS mutations are present in these variant EMCs. Thus assessment of HRAS status is useful in salivary gland neoplasms that do not entirely fulfil clear diagnostic criteria for EMC and cannot otherwise be classified as other entities.</p><p id="Par2681"><bold>PS-03-036</bold></p><p id="Par2682"><bold>PD-L1 score and CD8 heterogeneity in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas</bold></p><p id="Par2683"><underline>S.

CD8+-density was analysed as continuous variable. Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue-microarray sections with multiple cores per tumour, allowing for the assessment of intra-tumour heterogeneity.</p><p id="Par2687"><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 228 HNSCC, 16 were p16 positive (7.0%), half of them oro-hypopharyngeal; 37 (16.3%) were PD-L1 positive with CPS ≥1, while 7 of them with CPS ≥20 (high PD-L1 expression level); median CD8+-density was 204.9 (interquartile-range 105.0-437.2). Twenty-two (9.6%) and 48 (26.7%) tumours exhibited heterogeneous PD-L1 status and CD8+-density, respectively. p16-positive tumours demonstrated higher CD8+-density (Wilcoxon rank-sum p=0.0022), but none of them expressed PD-L1 at high levels (Pearson’s p=0.0008). PD-L1-positive tumours had higher CD8+-density (Wilcoxon rank-sum p&lt;0.0001); the latter did not differ for PD-L1 scores 1-19 and ≥20. PD-L1-positivity was associated with CD8+-heterogeneity (Fisher’s exact p=0.0005), particularly concerning tumours with high PD-L1 expression level (p&lt;0.0001), independently of tumour location.</p><p id="Par2688"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PD-L1/CD8 profiles may distinguish previously described immunologically “hot” and immunosuppressed HNSCC. CD8+-heterogeneity may be related to different immunological priming by tumour subpopulations.

Low-power appearance was that of an intradermal nevus with hypercellular dermal papillae featuring “puffy-shirt-sign” with 3 mitoses/mm², anisomorphic nuclei, 1-3 nucleoli and no maturation. Second case was a completely regressed melanoma which presented as tumoral melanosis, with dense fibrosis and lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. Breslow maximum depth was of 8.1 mm, corresponding to Clark level V.</p><p id="Par2772"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Despite paucity of literature data regarding malignant melanoma in tattooed areas, establishing a clinico-pathological connection between the two could increase chances of early detection and therefore, effectiveness of treatment. Both lesions presented in young patients and were challenging to diagnose.</p><p id="Par2773"><bold>PS-04-008</bold></p><p id="Par2774"><bold>Primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder: one-year experience in one dermatopathology unit</bold></p><p id="Par2775"><underline>M.

Tebeica</p><p id="Par2776">*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Pathology Department, Romania</p><p id="Par2777"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder is characterized by a solitary cutaneous lesion on the face, neck or trunk, with excellent prognosis. According to 4th Edition of the Blue Books it is a provisional entity, with uncertain malignant potential.</p><p id="Par2778"><bold>Methods:</bold> In this retrospective study, we examined the clinical records of 4 patients diagnosed with Primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder in our Dermatopathology unit. We thoroughly reexamined clinical photos, Hematoxilyn-Eosin and immunohistochemistry slides (CD3, CD20, CD4, PD-1, CD 8, BCL6, Kappa and Lambda).</p><p id="Par2779"><bold>Results:</bold> Each patient (median age 44-years-old), presented with a single lesion: three on the trunk and one on the forearm. In two cases, the lymphoid infiltrate featured a lichenoid pattern, predominantly affecting the papillary and upper reticular dermis. In the other cases, the lymphoid infiltrate was nodular and mostly affected the reticular dermis. The lymphoid proliferation was constituted primarily of small-sized lymphocytes, with fewer medium-sized lymphocytes and peripherally situated plasma cells. One of the cases presented with epidermotropism, and in all of them, the infiltrate surrounded cutaneous adnexa. Immunohistochemically, all cases were positive for CD3, CD4, PD-1 and negative for CD20 and CD8.</p><p id="Par2780"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We highlight the importance of recognizing this entity in order to avoid misdiagnosis as lymphoma and subsequent over-treatment. In the case of Primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, intralesional steroids or simple excision are sufficient, with rare recurrences.</p><p id="Par2781"><bold>PS-04-009</bold></p><p id="Par2782"><bold>Slow Mohs micrographic surgery in dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: 6 years experience in one dermatopathology unit</bold></p><p id="Par2783"><underline>M.

Tebeica</p><p id="Par2784">*Colentina Clinical Hospital, Pathology Department, Romania</p><p id="Par2785"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a soft tissue sarcoma with aggressive local behaviour and high recurrence risk. Due to its seemingly benign cytological appearance and irregular pattern of invasion, some cases may raise difficulties in determining whether the surgical margins are clear.</p><p id="Par2786"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present 12 cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans which were surgically removed using Slow Mohs micrographic surgery. All surgical specimens were intraoperatively marked by the surgeon and then photographed, inked and sectioned in our pathology lab, according to our slow Mohs protocol. All sections were examined using Hematoxylin-Eosin and CD34 immunolabeling.</p><p id="Par2787"><bold>Results:</bold> Patient age was 15-55 years, with male predominance (58%). Tumours presented either on the torso or head and neck area, apart from one, located on the foot. Two cases presented with clear margins after first excision, the rest having positive deep excision margins. The highest number of interventions was 5, the average being 3. One case presented with fibrosarcomatous transformation, featuring hyperchromatic nuclei and 21 mitoses per 10 HPF.</p><p id="Par2788">Our experience to date demonstrates that Mohs microsurgery combined with immunohistochemical evaluation is a reliable method of providing patients with complete surgical excision, especially when facing tumours in challenging locations, which are growing between nerves and/or tendons.</p><p id="Par2789"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Slow Mohs micrographic surgery offers the surgeon a histological confirmation before closing the wound. If the resection margins are positive, the surgeon can further remove the areas marked by the pathologist, sparing as much healthy tissue as possible.</p><p id="Par2790"><bold>PS-04-010</bold></p><p id="Par2791"><bold>Melanocytic nevus and osseous metaplasia: pathological features of 5 cases</bold></p><p id="Par2792"><underline>C.

Muñóz Fernández</p><p id="Par2793">*Hospital Universitario de Mostoles, Spain</p><p id="Par2794"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Wide variety of histopathological changes may be found in melanocytic nevi. Osseous metaplasia represents an unusual finding, sometimes misunderstood or overlooked, characterized by foci of bone formation adjacent to or surrounded by melanocytic nests exhibiting a normal maturation pattern.</p><p id="Par2795"><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective review, using our database from the last 15 years. Clinicopathologic features were gathered: age, sex, location, nevus type, intra or extralesional ossification and presence of dermal inflammation. Five cases were identified, four osteonevi of Nanta and one blue osteonevus.</p><p id="Par2796"><bold>Results:</bold> There were three men and two women. The ages ranged from 32 to 81 with a mean age of 53 years. Of these nevi, only one had congenital features, four showed presence of fatty marrow, three were intradermal and two compound, and all were on the upper part of the body. There were two of them with inflammation associated, and one with foreign-body granuloma. Four cases presented intralesional bone formation.</p><p id="Par2797"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> To our knowledge, this represents the largest series of such cases in Spanish literature, and the fourth example of blue ostenevus ever reported. Bone formation in nevi represents an unusual finding, and only small series have been reported. We confirmed the upper body location, intradermal type predominance and age span, similar to literature. In contrast to previous series, we found a slight predominance in males. The pathogenesis of osseous metaplasia in nevi is not fully understood and requires further study.</p><p id="Par2798"><bold>PS-04-011</bold></p><p id="Par2799"><bold>Neuronevus of masson: four cases with typical clinicopathological features</bold></p><p id="Par2800"><underline>F.J.

All lesions were localized on gluteal areas, consisting of asymptomatic, brownish to greenish nodules, one of them presumed to be since birth.</p><p id="Par2805">Histologically all cases were circumscribed tumours situated in medium and deep dermis, with intact epidermis, growing in a fascicular pattern, with a “hourglass” configuration.</p><p id="Par2806">Cytologically they were composed of ovoid and/or spindled cells, surrounded by fibrous tissue containing sparse dendritic cells and melanophages, without mitotic figures. All of them where immunoreactive for S100, SOX10 and HMB45 (the latter only focally at the periphery). Betacatenin was negative in all of them.</p><p id="Par2807"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> MN can mimic melanoma because of the size, the involvement of deep dermis and the abundance of melanophages. The absence of mitosis (or &lt;1/mm²), necrosis and atypia, without infiltrative margins supports the diagnosis. Unlike deep penetrating nevus, Beta-catenin is absent.</p><p id="Par2808"><bold>PS-04-012</bold></p><p id="Par2809"><bold>Blastic plasmocytoid dendritic cell neoplasm: a rare cutaneous lymphoma - analysis of 3 cases</bold></p><p id="Par2810"><underline>C.

Although some cases are indolent, the course is often aggressive with involvement of the bone marrow, peripheral blood and lymph nodes.</p><p id="Par2813"><bold>Methods:</bold> We report the cases of three male patients with ages between 57 to 85 years old, with diagnosis from 2013 to 2019, that presented multiple purpuric, painless and non-ulcerated nodules on the trunk, extremities and face. All patients didn't present systemic symptoms.</p><p id="Par2814"><bold>Results:</bold> Histopathological examination revealed a dermal infiltrate by a population of medium-sized cells with nuclear pleomorphism, several nucleoli and a moderate to scant cytoplasm. The mitotic count was high, and the epidermis was spared.

High mitotic count, apoptosis and epithelial hyperplasia with mild acanthosis were present in all cases.</p><p id="Par2825">Immunohistochemistry study showed positivity for LCA, CD34, CD117 and myeloperoxidase in two cases, favouring the cutaneous involvement by chronic myeloid leukaemia. Diffuse positivity for CD4, CD56, CD68, CD163 and lysozyme with negativity for CD34 and CD117 in the other two patients, suggesting cutaneous infiltrate by chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. CD3, CD5, CD20, CD79 and CD30 were negative in all cases.</p><p id="Par2826"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Most cutaneous involvement by myeloid leukaemia follow an aggressive clinical behaviour. In our analysis, two patients died in less than six months following the appearance of the cutaneous lesions despite systemic chemotherapy. Both cases were from elderly patients (&gt;70 years old): one with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia that had transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia and other with chronic myeloid leukaemia.

Patients usually present with multiple coalescent red macules or nodules located on the distal lower extremities.</p><p id="Par2832"><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a retrospective study including 32 cutaneous KS diagnosed in our unit during a period of four years (2016-2019). We aimed to analyse the epidemiologic features and establish clinico-pathological correlations regarding KS diagnosed in Romania. Clinical information was retrieved from the virtual database. We thoroughly re-examined all Hematoxylin-Eosin and immunohistochemically (HHV-8, CD34, D2-40, SMA) stained slides.</p><p id="Par2833"><bold>Results:</bold> Patient age ranged from 25 to 85 years. Lower extremities were frequently involved (55.2%), followed by upper extremities (27.6%), face (10.3%) and buttocks (6.9%). The overwhelming majority of the patients were males (72%) and nodular stages of the disease represented 65.5% of cases. Clinical diagnosis varied from Kaposi’s sarcoma (58%), haemangioma (10.3%), carcinoma (20.7%), sarcoma (7%) and melanoma (3.4%). “Promontorium sign” was present in 60% of patches and plaques cases.

This way, the wound is left open, awaiting the pathological report.</p><p id="Par2840"><bold>Methods:</bold> We re-evaluated 4 cases of extramammary Paget disease which were cured in our unit (2016-2019) using this technique. All specimens were received with marking sutures. Excision margins were inked, sectioned, mapped and submitted in separate blocks, in regard to the suture mark. All resulting slides were evaluated using Hematoxylin-Eosin staining and CK7 immunolabeling.</p><p id="Par2841"><bold>Results:</bold> All patients were females in their sixties and most lesions were located on the labia (75%) or in the perianal area (25%). In 50% of cases, the lesion spread in opposite directions, requiring multiple excisions per intervention. The total number of blocks used ranged from 18 to 38. First interventions required larger excisions (40/21/3 mm to 115/85/10 mm), while the last ones were much smaller (16/9/2 mm to 42/8/2 mm). Patients required 3 to 5 reinterventions in order to achieve curability. No case featured dermal invasion or signs of recurrence to date. This technique combined with immunohistochemistry is a reliable technique which increased the curability of EMPD in our unit.</p><p id="Par2842"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Slow Mohs micrographic surgery allowed the clinician to remove a targeted area with residual tumour located between specific hour intervals, thus sparing healthy tissue.

We thoroughly re-examined the slides and analysed the clinical data retrieved from the virtual database.</p><p id="Par2849"><bold>Results:</bold> Most lesions were located on the toes, followed by the lateral aspects of the foot and palms. Histologically, 75% were compound and 25% were junctional nevi. 50% were well-circumscribed, 25% were moderately well-circumscribed, and 25% were poorly circumscribed. No cytological atypia or lymphocytic infiltrate were noted. All lesions featured intraepidermal ascent of melanocytes throughout the entire epidermis, and 25% of the cases even showed rare melanocytes within the cornified layer as pigmented columns above the sulci or crista profundae intermediae. Well-circumscribed and symmetric lesions occurring in young adults which feature maturation and lack cytological atypia or brisk lymphocytic infiltrate usually manifest as benign nevi.</p><p id="Par2850"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Practicing pathologists should be aware that suprabasal scatter of melanocytes is not pathognomonic for melanoma in acral nevi without other worrisome features like lateral confluence of junctional nests, cytological atypia or lymphocytic infiltrate.</p><p id="Par2851"><bold>PS-04-017</bold></p><p id="Par2852"><bold>Merkel cell carcinoma of an unknown primary origin, 5 case report</bold></p><p id="Par2853"><underline>I.

We thoroughly re-examined the slides, analysed the clinical data retrieved from the virtual database and correlated all the findings.</p><p id="Par2893"><bold>Results:</bold> Patients ranged from 28 to 60 years. Lower lip and upper lip were equally often involved, and males were slightly more frequently affected (66% males, compared to 33.3% females). One patient also presented with facial nerve palsy, consistent with Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. None of the patients had any previous history of Crohn disease. Upon histologic examination, all patients had non-necrotising granulomas, with mild dermal oedema and no sign of epidermal ulceration. If the histologic examination reveals non-necrotizing granulomas in the lamina propria, often protruding into and obstructing the vessels, then also Crohn disease, sarcoidosis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis should also be considered.</p><p id="Par2894"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Granulomatous cheilitis is a rare entity. Taking into consideration the numerous reports of patients with orofacial granulomatosis and no gastrointestinal symptoms which were discovered with colonoscopic features consistent with Crohn disease, further check-up should be advised in such cases.</p><p id="Par2895"><bold>PS-04-023</bold></p><p id="Par2896"><bold>Sentinel lymph node excision in malignant melanoma: 3-year experience from one dermatopathology unit</bold></p><p id="Par2897"><underline>A.C.

It is recommended for patients with melanoma stage pT2 or pT3 and it could be considered in patients with pT1b or pT4 melanomas.</p><p id="Par2900"><bold>Methods:</bold> In this study we retrospectively analysed 84 patients which underwent SLN excision between 2017 and 2019, after being diagnosed with malignant melanoma. Each lymph node received in our pathology department was sectioned at 2-3 mm intervals and entirely submitted. All resulting paraffin embedded sections were examined at multiple levels in Hematoxylin-Eosin, Melan A and Tyrosinase.</p><p id="Par2901"><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 84 cases, 26.5% had lymph node metastases, and 12.05% had incidental capsular nevi. Positive SLN stemmed from pT2 cases (14.3%), pT3 (52.3%) and pT4 (33.3%). Most of them were axillary (54.5%), followed by inguinal (31.8%). Patients age ranged from 30 to 77 with both genders equally involved. Most cases featured one affected lymph node (75%), while 21.8% had two involved and only 3.2% had more than 2 affected.</p><p id="Par2902"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This technique can provide important information which should be considered in the follow-up and treatment of patients. In our study size of the metastatic deposit ranged from 0.1 mm to 12 mm and only 4.7 % had extranodal extension. Statistical analysis showed that the number of lymph nodes involved, size of the metastatic deposits and the presence of extranodal extension strongly correlated with more advanced stage of disease (pT4) and presence of ulceration in the primary tumour.</p><p id="Par2903"><bold>PS-04-024</bold></p><p id="Par2904"><bold>Nodulotumoral cutaneous involvement in adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma: report of two cases</bold></p><p id="Par2905"><underline>A.C.

Patients with the lymphoma-type variant of the disease have a worse prognosis.</p><p id="Par2908"><bold>Methods:</bold> We report two cases of ATLL, one in a 44-year-old male, known with systemic disease and HTLV-1 infection which developed cutaneous nodules, and one in a 66-year-old male, who presented with cutaneous manifestations, without any prior relevant medical history. Both patients had multiple red, tender nodules on the forearms and hands, which were clinically suspicious for cutaneous lymphoma.</p><p id="Par2909"><bold>Results:</bold> Both excision specimens revealed a diffuse intradermic lymphoid proliferation composed of medium-large cells, with marked epidermotropism and angiotropism. The lesions from the patient known with systemic disease also featured central ulceration. Immunohistochemistry revealed CD3, CD4 and CD5 positive cells, which were negative for CD8. Both lesions had a KI67 proliferative index of 50%. Unfortunately, both patients died within the next 4 to 6 months.</p><p id="Par2910"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We report two cases of cutaneous manifestation in patients with lymphomatous and acute ATLL variants, respectively. The only difference between the two lesions was that the one originating from the patient with systemic disease also had central ulceration and the cells were immunoreactive for CD30. The patient with no prior medical history was positive upon subsequent HTLV-1 testing. Both cases had an aggressive clinical course, associated with nodulotumoral presentation of the disease.</p><p id="Par2911"><bold>PS-04-025</bold></p><p id="Par2912"><bold>Dermatomyofibroma: a short series of a great mimicker</bold></p><p id="Par2913"><underline>A.C.

Patients are typically young females presenting with a plaque on the neck, shoulders and upper trunk.</p><p id="Par2916"><bold>Methods:</bold> In this study we examined the clinical records of five patients diagnosed with dermatomyofibroma in our Dermatopathology Department during a 3-year period. We thoroughly re-examined the slides and analysed the clinical data retrieved from the virtual database. Histologic examination reveals fascicles of spindle cells arranged parallel to the epidermis. Ancillary studies included S100, SMA and CD34.</p><p id="Par2917"><bold>Results:</bold> All patients were females in their thirties, with tender plaques located either on the upper trunk (60%) or proximal extremities (40%). Clinical diagnosis ranged from granuloma annulare (40%) to dermatofibroma (40%) and lymphoma (20%). Histologic examination revealed a diffuse spindle cell proliferation involving the reticular dermis. The neoplastic cells featured abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and elongated nuclei. All cases featured faint SMA positivity, while S100 and CD34 were completely negative.</p><p id="Par2918"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Dermatomyofibroma is a rare benign neoplasm, which should always be considered when evaluating a spindle cell proliferation from the upper trunk of young females. Due to inconsistency of immunohistochemical results, one should establish this diagnosis after excluding other benign mesenchymal proliferations, like leiomyoma or dermatofibroma Early lesions tend to show immunoreactivity for SMA, while older lesions are negative for SMA, S100 and CD34. This diagnosis should be kept in mind, even when SMA shows no or only weak positivity.</p><p id="Par2919"><bold>PS-04-026</bold></p><p id="Par2920"><bold>Cutaneous involvement by diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: clinical-pathological correlation</bold></p><p id="Par2921"><underline>G.

This study aims to find a link between BRAF and NRAS mutations in malignant melanoma and histological phenotype.</p><p id="Par2932"><bold>Methods:</bold> Data was gathered from 337 cases of metastasizing malignant melanoma occurring between 2015 and 2018 that were tested for BRAF and NRAS mutations. The Royal College of Pathologists core data items were recorded from the primary skin lesions in each case. Data from BRAF positive, NRAS positive and wildtype cases was compared to assess patterns between mutation and histological phenotype.</p><p id="Par2933"><bold>Results:</bold> On comparing each genotype and histological phenotype, several trends have been noted.

Thirty-one H/E-stained tissue slides were reviewed. Microscopic features documented included histologic subtype, tumour thickness, level of invasion, ulceration, mitoses and vascular invasion. The relationship between these variables in addition to patient's age, gender and tumour site were assessed using Spearman rank correlation. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05.</p><p id="Par2941"><bold>Results:</bold> The median tumour thickness was 7.00mm (2.1-19.5mm). Twenty-five (80.6%) of tumours had pT4 stage and also had Clark level IV and V. Ulceration was present in 30 (96.8%) cases and 20 (64.5%) had evidence of vascular invasion. Thirteen (41.9%) of the patients had metastasis at presentation. There was significant positive correlation between tumour thickness and level of invasion (r=0.7, p&lt;0.001), mitotic rate (r=0.45, p=0.01) and vascular invasion (r=0.42, p=0.02).

The following tumours were collected: 57 cases of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans; 15 cases of dermatofibroma; 8 cases of dermal scars; 5 cases of deep-seated fibrous histiocytoma. The antibody against the N- terminal portion of WT1-6F-H2, was used.</p><p id="Par2949"><bold>Results:</bold> The majority of dermatofibrosarcomas protuberans (54 out of 57), exhibited cytoplasmic staining for WT1. The immunohistochemical expression was diffuse, heterogeneous or focal, respectively, in 75%, 15% and 6% of cases. With the exception of 4 cases showing a weak to moderate staining in different areas of the same tumour, the staining intensity was diffuse and strong. All recurrent tumours showed diffuse and strong WT1 cytoplasmic immunoreactivity while the fibroblasts of the associated scar tissue were negative.

The aim of this study was to identify the histopathological features of these lesions and their clinical correlates.</p><p id="Par3018"><bold>Methods:</bold> We have reviewed the slides of 15 hepatic inflammatory pseudotumours resected between 2013-2018. The localization, presence of a pseudocapsule, the type and distribution of inflammatory cells, the presence of bile ductules/ducts within the lesion and of perilesional occluded large vessels and the degree of fibroblastic proliferation and fibrosis were noted. These were analysed in conjunction with clinical and imaging data.</p><p id="Par3019"><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age was 63 years and there was a slightly male predominance among patients. The relevant clinical associations were chronic cholecystitis, HBV infection, obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus and malignancy. The masses had an average maximum diameter of 5 cm. The most common histological features were lack of a pseudocapsule, presence of foamy cells, variable inflammatory cells and necrosis, in both perihilar and peripheral localization. Two cases were entirely composed of lobules of foamy cells with no atypia. One case lacked foamy cells and necrosis, but showed no association with IgG4-related disease and no periductal growth. No relapse was noted, although three cases were complicated by postoperative abscesses.</p><p id="Par3020"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Inflammatory pseudotumours of the liver have similar clinical correlates to other infectious/inflammatory lesions. Their pathological spectrum may be related to various aetiologies or inflammatory responses among individuals.

The role of B lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of BA has been hypothesised through murine models. We aimed to characterise B cell subsets in BA using triple immunohistochemistry.</p><p id="Par3035"><bold>Methods:</bold> CD20, CD24 and CD38 immunohistochemistry was carried out on three samples (hilum and peripheral liver (wedge) samples at time of Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy and an explant sample) for each patient (n=28). The slides were scanned to allow digital appraisal. Semi-quantitative analysis of inflammatory cells and fibrosis was performed. Phenotypic groups were formed using inflammatory cell frequencies and correlated with clinical outcome.</p><p id="Par3036"><bold>Results:</bold> Three B cell subsets were identified in the wedge samples at Kasai and the explant samples. CD20+CD24+CD38-cells were present in both sample types in all 28 patients. CD20+CD24-CD38+cells were present in 1 of 28 wedge samples and 3 of 28 explant samples. CD20+CD24+CD38+cells were identified in 4 of 28 explant samples. Patient stratification based on inflammation at the hilum did not predict transplant-free survival. CD20+CD24+CD38-cell frequency correlated with fibrosis scores.</p><p id="Par3037"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The histopathological analysis of three distinct tissue regions using triple immunohistochemistry in this study is a novel method in studying the evolution of the disease from the extrahepatic (hilum) to intrahepatic biliary system. This work is the first to report distinct B cell subsets in BA and hypothesises the possible role of CD20+CD24+CD38-B cells in biliary damage.

Diagnosis of MHL depends on its radiological and clinical presentation, while histopathology shows wide spectrum of changes.</p><p id="Par3043"><bold>Methods:</bold> Eight children with mesenchymal hamartoma diagnosed radiologically or histologically, operated in one paediatric surgery centre during last 10 years are presented. The clinical data analysis and detailed pathological examination with wide panel immunophenotyping covering epithelial and stromal components was performed.</p><p id="Par3044"><bold>Results:</bold> There were two girls and six boys in the age ranged 4 – 19 months. All tumours presented with abdominal enlargement, AFP elevation from 80 up to 10000. Radiologically five lesions were problematic, showing some indefinite features of vascular lesion(2), hepatoblastoma(2) or inborn defect(1). Two tumours were mainly solid, while the rest were multicystic. Three cases primarily underwent needle biopsy, with erroneous hepatoblastoma diagnosis in one boy and inconclusive answer in the second child. The final histological diagnosis of MHL was based on morphology and immunophenotyping. Two cases diagnosed radiologically as mixed hamartomatous lesion, were cavernous haemangioma with defect in portal veins and bile duct proliferation.</p><p id="Par3045"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver can cause diagnostic and therapeutic problems, mainly due to its rarity and different presentation in pathological and clinical aspects. Core needle biopsies in MHL may not be informative to establish the final diagnosis.

The histological evaluation according the FBI system showed a bile duct ratio (BDR) index of 0.9 with only one case presenting ductopenia. Respect lobular interphase hepatitis (LIH), five cases showed no LIH, 21 cases showed mild to moderate LIH and three cases showed severe LIH. Regarding fibrosis, 37 patients were in early stages (0-1), and only one biopsy showed histological criteria of cirrhosis.

We aimed to evaluate our medical liver pathology practice and its influence on patient management, using national standards.</p><p id="Par3086"><bold>Methods:</bold> The UK’s Royal College of Pathologists (RCPath) produces “Tissue pathway” guidelines promoting good practice in specimen handling and reporting. We used RCPath audit proformas to collect data on specimen quality/reporting and clinico-pathological effect. The QEUH pathology database was searched for liver specimens in 2019.

This study aims to explore the role of c-Met signalling in the acquisition of aggressive phenotypes in HCC.</p><p id="Par3138"><bold>Methods:</bold> HCC cell lines and HCC cases were analysed using immunohistochemistry, Western Blot, motility and invasion assays for c-Met expression. In-vitro mechanistic studies using overexpression and silencing vectors for the demonstration of for c-Met activation were made. Specific c-Met inhibitors were used for the reversal of sorafenib resistance in HCC cells.</p><p id="Par3139"><bold>Results:</bold> Immunohistochemical analyses of HCC cell lines and HCC cases, showed that immunoreactivity of phospho-Met and c-Met are increased in HCC compared to normal and cirrhotic tissues. Our Western Blot, motility and invasion assays showed higher c-Met expression in poorly-differentiated, highly motile and invasive HCC cell lines than well-differentiated ones. Our further in-vitro mechanistic studies using overexpression and silencing vectors revealed that c-Met activation was occurred mostly independent of HGF in HCC cells, including receptor cross-talk, non-coding RNAs and environmental factors. We demonstrated that miR-181a-5p regulates c-Met signalling in HCC and played a role in the acquisition of sorafenib resistance. We reversed sorafenib resistance in HCC cells using c-Met specific inhibitors.</p><p id="Par3140"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results provide mechanistic insight into c-Met signalling in HCC and sorafenib resistance. These findings suggest that c-Met might be used as a predictive biomarker to guide patient selection for clinical trials of Met-related therapies.</p><p id="Par3141"><bold>PS-06 Haematopathology</bold></p><p id="Par3142"><bold>PS-06-001</bold></p><p id="Par3143"><bold>Determination of mean HbA2 levels on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in known beta thalassaemia trait individuals</bold></p><p id="Par3144"><underline>R.

Patients who were diagnosed with secondary CNS lymphoma (n = 4) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (n = 4) were excluded. Remaining cases were retrospectively analysed considering localization, tumour morphology and immunophenotype, prognosis and overall survival.</p><p id="Par3249"><bold>Results:</bold> Nine cases diagnosed as primary diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) were analysed. The patient’s age ranged between 33-74 years, predominantly females (F/M-7:2). On stereotactic biopsy samples, all of them were diagnosed as DLBCL. In four cases the histological differentiation was limited by the reduced tissue sampling, rich in necrosis, without distinct tumour mass. Microscopic examination mostly highlighted an angiocentric growth pattern of tumour cells. Applying the Hans algorithm, using CD10, BCL-6 and MUM-1, 6 cases belonged to non-germinal centre subtype, associated with high Ki67 (&gt;70%). In the subgroup of elderly patients (over 65 years), a high Ki67 index and non-germinal centre subtype has been associated with short survival (three months).</p><p id="Par3250"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Stereotaxic biopsy and histology of the affected area in most cases will provide a reliable diagnosis. The diagnosis of primary cerebral lymphomas is complex, the histological subtypes are difficult to evaluate due to reduced tissue sampling and requires the application of a large immunohistochemistry arsenal. Non-germinal centre subtype with a high Ki67 index in our patients has been associated with worse survival.</p><p id="Par3251"><bold>PS-06-016</bold></p><p id="Par3252"><bold>Molecular signatures of anaplastic large cell lymphoma, ALK-negative – pilot study with 125 genes panel and recurrent MSCE116K mutation testing</bold></p><p id="Par3253"><underline>A.

Confirmation depends on histology and Ziehl Nielsen stain (ZNS). Immunohistochemistry using anti-MPT64 can detect mycobacterium TB complex proteins. We describe the histomorphology and anti-MPT64 immunoreactivity on Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) biopsies.</p><p id="Par3305"><bold>Methods:</bold> FFPE tissue blocks and haematoxylin-eosin stained slides of biopsies which were signed out as EPTB (July 2015 - June 2017) were retrieved from the archive. Slides of included cases were reviewed to confirm the diagnosis prior to resectioning for ZN staining and IHC. Demographic, clinical and histopathologic data were analysed. Proportions of AFB positivity for ZNS and anti-MPT64 immunoreactivity were calculated.</p><p id="Par3306"><bold>Results:</bold> 110 biopsies signed out as EPTB were analysed and biopsies were from patients aged between 2-76 years with mean of 36.3 years. Female represented 60% (n=66), lymph node was more frequent (41.8%, n=46) site and necrotizing granuloma was the most (69%, n=76) frequent lesion. IHC and ZNS positivity were found in 71% and 8% of the biopsies respectively. All ZN positive biopsies were also positive to MPT64 by IHC.</p><p id="Par3307"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> EPTB is encountered frequently among biopsies submitted at our hospital. Despite the challenges faced in establishing EPTB diagnosis, the histomorphology of necrotizing granulomas should be regarded as a strong indicator of EPTB, particularly in TB endemic areas. Furthermore, IHC by anti-MPT64 appears to be useful particularly in controversial cases where ZN staining is negative. EPTB affects mostly young adults in reproductive age group and the female gender and TB lymphadenitis is the most common type of EPTB presentation at MNH.</p><p id="Par3308"><bold>PS-07-006</bold></p><p id="Par3309"><bold>Laboratory and anatomopathological aspects in the diagnosis of Dengue in Ceara in 2011 and 2012: the role of the Death Verification Service</bold></p><p id="Par3310"><underline>D.

We aimed to investigate the association between histopathological features and molecular TB positivity in this retrospective study.</p><p id="Par3321"><bold>Methods:</bold> Slides of 36 consecutive patients who had undergone lymph node resection with clinical suspicion of TB lymphadenitis (TBLA) were re-evaluated. Molecular TB testing was performed on formalin fixed-paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (Anyplex™ MTB/NTM, Seegene, Inc). The findings were statistically analysed.</p><p id="Par3322"><bold>Results:</bold> The majority (n=26) were female and median age was 44.50±14.42 (range 17-69 y.o.). All but 2 patients had granulomatous inflammation, however, TBLA was confirmed by molecular analysis in only 8 patients, 5 of which had pure caseous granulomas. 2 patients with confirmed TBLA had mixed caseous and sarcoid-like granulomas, and 1 had suppurative necrotizing granulomas. The bacilli could be demonstrated by acid-fast staining in only 1 TBLA patient. TB-DNA was negative in 14 patients with mixed caseous-sarcoid granulomatous inflammation, 4 with suppurative necrotizing granulomatous lymphadenitis and 8 with sarcoid-like granulomas. Molecular TB positivity was significantly associated with the presence of caseation (p=0.018). No other significant association was found.</p><p id="Par3323"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Molecular testing seems to be more sensitive for diagnosis of TB in FFPE tissues compared to acid-fast staining. Morphological overlaps of different granulomatous patterns can be seen in TB, and although widely considered to be characteristic for TB, caseation is not always a sign of TB positivity.</p><p id="Par3324"><bold>PS-07-010</bold></p><p id="Par3325"><bold>Tissue reactions in cases of progression of tuberculosis in patients with HIV/AIDS</bold></p><p id="Par3326"><underline>A.

The scores for TE and G were dichotomized into two categories: no or any expression. IDO1-positive cells in foci of immune infiltrates were dichotomized into negative or positive group (any IDO1-positive cells).</p><p id="Par3365"><bold>Results:</bold> Rejection was observed in 32% (25/76) of patients with IDO1 expression in tubules (TE 1 or 2), and in 62% (28/45) of patients without IDO1 expression in tubules (TE 0) (p=0.0017). Increased number of IDO1-positive interstitial immune infiltrate cells was correlated with the presence of histopathologic features of any type of rejection. Rejection was observed in 56% (45/80) of patients from IDO1-positive group vs 19.5% (8/41) in IDO1-negative group (p=0.0001).</p><p id="Par3366"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The expression of IDO1 in tubules had a potential protective role but enhanced number of IDO1-positive interstitial immune cells was associated with the presence of rejection. The analysis of IDO1 expression in renal transplant biopsies might be considered for better transplant immunological risk assessment. Our preliminary results should be validated in a larger group of patients.</p><p id="Par3367"><bold>PS-08-005</bold></p><p id="Par3368"><bold>Dent’s disease: clinicopathologic and genetic findings of two patients with novel variants/mutations in the CLCN5 and OCRL genes</bold></p><p id="Par3369"><underline>H.

It is frequently underdiagnosed or diagnosed after patients have failed an immune suppression regimen. We present two well documented cases of Dent’s disease.</p><p id="Par3372"><bold>Methods:</bold> A Caucasian boy aged 9,5years and a young Caucasian man aged 30years, underwent a renal biopsy due to low molecular weight proteinuria (1.3-1.9gr/24h), without haematuria, with normal renal function.</p><p id="Par3373">Light microscope, immunofluorescence, electron microscope (EM) and genetic testing [Kidney Seq TM v3.0. and Whole Exome Sequencing (WES)] were performed.</p><p id="Par3374"><bold>Results:</bold> The main histologic finding in both biopsies was the presence of intratubular calcium salts (Von Kossa+).</p><p id="Par3375">Immunofluorescence and EM were negative or nonspecific.</p><p id="Par3376">Genetic testing revealed that the boy was hemizygous for a pathogenic variant in CLCN5, NM_000084:c1934-2A&gt;G.

Present study was undertaken to determine factors influencing renal survival based on Berden’s classification, renal risk score (Brix et al.) and individual risk factors.</p><p id="Par3383"><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective study done from January 2013 to December 2018. Cases were grouped into focal, crescentic, mixed and sclerotic categories based on histology. Serum creatinine, eGFR at biopsy and follow-up, were recorded. Renal biopsies were scored based on renal risk score [% of normal glomeruli (&gt;25%,10-25% and &lt;10%), percentage of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis(≤25%,&gt;25%) and eGFR(&gt;15ml/min,≤15ml/min)] into 3 risk categories.</p><p id="Par3384"><bold>Results:</bold> 51 adult patients were included. Mean serum creatinine at biopsy was 7.05±4.57 mg/dl and eGFR was 13.6±12.16 ml/min/1.73m2. 33 cases were ANCA positive and 18 were negative. Based on Berden’s classification, cases were grouped as focal(4), crescentic(29), mixed(12) and sclerotic(6). Based on renal risk score cases were grouped as low(8),medium(23) and high(20). Univariate Cox regression analysis showed eGFR at biopsy (p 0.024), % IFTA (p 0.001) and % normal glomeruli(p 0.023) are predictors of ESRD. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed IFTA (p&lt;0.001) and % normal glomeruli (p 0.018) as significant predictors of ESRD. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for histological categories (Log-Rank p=0.046) and the renal risk categories was done (Log-Rank p=0.002).</p><p id="Par3385"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Percentage of normal glomeruli, IFTA and eGFR at time of biopsy were important risk factors influencing renal survival.

Kiremitci*</underline>, R. Eren Sadioglu, S. Kutlay</p><p id="Par3389">*Ankara University Medical School, Pathology Department, Turkey</p><p id="Par3390"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> C4d deposition in native kidney has been investigated increasingly in recent years. For lupus nephritis, there are few studies reported and the results are conflicting. We aimed to investigate the association of C4d deposition with histopathological and clinical parameters.</p><p id="Par3391"><bold>Methods:</bold> Renal biopsies of 51 biopsy-proven lupus nephritis patients were evaluated for C4d immunohistochemistry. Clinical information at the time of biopsy and follow up data were collected from hospital database. Glomerular C4d staining scores, separately for mesangial and capillary wall, were obtained considering the pattern, extent and intensity of C4d deposition. Spearman’s correlation analysis was used for nonparametric correlations.</p><p id="Par3392"><bold>Results:</bold> According to 2003 ISN/RPS classification system for lupus nephritis; 5 biopsies were classified as class II (9.8%), 16 as class III (31.4%), 16 as class IV (31.4%) and 12 as class V (23.5%) in the cohort. All biopsies except one showed glomerular C4d staining in mesangium and/or capillary wall. Glomerular staining scores were significantly higher in class V compared to class III (p=0.016), whereas it was not significant between class III and class IV. Glomerular capillary wall staining was positively correlated with levels of 24-h proteinuria (p:0,020), and the staining scores were significantly lower in patients in remission compared to patients with active lupus nephritis (p:0.006).</p><p id="Par3393"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> C4d immunohistochemistry is useful to show both the presence and the localization of immune deposits in lupus nephritis. Besides, glomerular C4d load is correlated with clinical disease activity in terms of proteinuria.</p><p id="Par3394"><bold>PS-08-009</bold></p><p id="Par3395"><bold>The value of DARC expression as diagnostic marker in renal transplant biopsies</bold></p><p id="Par3396"><underline>J.

Regele</p><p id="Par3397">*Department of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria</p><p id="Par3398"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) is one of the genes most upregulated in antibody mediated rejection (ABMR) and is associated with endothelial injury. We investigated whether immunohistochemistry (IHC) for DARC might serve as a diagnostic marker for active ABMR.</p><p id="Par3399"><bold>Methods:</bold> 82 renal allograft biopsies performed during a prospective clinical trial (BORTEJECT Study) with detailed patient and biopsy characteristics available were included. IHC for DARC was performed on 2μm paraffin sections using a mouse monoclonal anti-human DARC-Fy6 antibody. DARC-IHC positive peritubular capillaries (PTC) were quantified and the distribution of the cortical stained PTC were further described</p><p id="Par3400"><bold>Results:</bold> DARC that was mainly observed in peritubular capillaries (PTC) and in small venules and arterioles. 61 biopsies showed positive DARC staining in ≥5% of PTC, mainly located in areas of interstitial fibrosis or inflammation. Most of the ABMR cases were DARC positive (n=40 vs. n=7, p=0.01), but a substantial amount of biopsies without signs of rejection still showed DARC positive PTC. C4d positivity was not associated with DARC positivity (p=0.365). On a molecular level, we see a significant difference of DARC gene expression in DARC positive vs. negative biopsies with higher DARC gene expression linked to more DARC positive PTC in biopsies (log scale: 8.68(7.91-9.32) vs. 7.52(6.99-8.14), p&lt;0.001; rs=0,546, p&lt;0,001)).</p><p id="Par3401"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> DARC expression on endothelial cells generally matches DARC gene expression and is associated with ABMR. However, DARC expression could also be observed in biopsies without signs of rejection which limits its value as diagnostic marker for ABMR.</p><p id="Par3402"><bold>PS-08-010</bold></p><p id="Par3403"><bold>Co-occurrence of spherocytosis and UMOD disease causing variant in a three-generation family presenting with kidney failure in adulthood</bold></p><p id="Par3404"><underline>N.

Seven patients from the same family with spherocytosis were evaluated to assess the kidney failure presented in all affected adult patients.</p><p id="Par3407"><bold>Methods:</bold> Clinical, radiological and laboratory investigations were assessed to evaluate the spherocytosis and kidney disease. We performed genetics testing with next generation sequencing of genes related to hereditary spherocytosis, inherited glomerular disorders and tubulo-interstitial kidney disease.</p><p id="Par3408"><bold>Results:</bold> Two adults had end-stage kidney disease and one chronic kidney disease stage 4 with histopathological findings of interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy and glomerulosclerosis. There were no signs of kidney disease in four paediatric patients. Novel nonsense variant in SPTB gene (NM 001024858; c.4796G&gt;A; p.Trp1599Ter) was detected in all family members with spherocytosis. Furthermore, all adult patients with kidney failure and two paediatric cousins of the index patients were heterozygous for the UMOD gene variant (NM 003361.3:c.552G&gt;C, NP 003352.2:p.Trp184Cys) previously reported in patients with autosomal tubulo-interstitial kidney disease. UMOD variant was not present in the index patients. Renal biopsy in two adult patients revealed diffuse interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy and glomerulosclerosis.</p><p id="Par3409"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Kidney failure in all adult patients was probably related to disease causing UMOD variant characterized by deficient production of functional uromodulin. It is not possibly to evaluate whether the haemolytic crises due to spherocytosis were influencing the progression of the UMOD related renal disease.

This study was conducted to document reversible and irreversible pathologies seen in complicated ADPGN in a paediatric population and to ascertain whether biochemical parameters would give a clue to the changes observed.</p><p id="Par3416"><bold>Methods:</bold> Forty-eight ADPGN proven renal biopsies were assessed. Severity of the glomerular injury and tubular injury were scored as GI 1+ and 2+ (reversible lesions), 3+ and 4+ (irreversible lesions), TI 0(no lesions), 1+ and 2+ (reversible lesions), 3+ (irreversible lesions) . Serum creatinine (SC) and serum albumin (SA) were correlated with above lesions using the “Spearman’s rank-order correlation”.</p><p id="Par3417"><bold>Results:</bold> All cases showed glomerular injury. 69% had reversible glomerular lesions while 31% were irreversible. Irreversible lesions included crescents and necrotizing lesions. Tubular injury was present in 46% and 92% were reversible and 8% were irreversible. Irreversible tubular injuries included tubulorrhexis. The group that showed reversible glomerular injury did not have crescents or necrotizing lesions at all. However, 42% had tubular injuries. A significant statistical correlation was not seen between the glomerular/tubular injuries and serum creatinine and serum albumin (P value was &gt; 0.05).</p><p id="Par3418"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Approximately 2/3 of the lesions in complicated ADPGN are reversible where the kidney is salvageable. More than a third have non-reversible lesions possibly culminating later on sclerosis of glomeruli.

In contrast, IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is characterized by IgA-dominant glomerular deposits which appear granular by electron microscopy (EM).</p><p id="Par3424"><bold>Methods:</bold> The characteristics of 14 cases of FGN (defined by smudgy glomerular staining for IgG with corresponding randomly-oriented fibrils on EM, mean thickness 16 nm) concurrent with IgAN (defined by granular mesangial IgA by immunofluorescence with corresponding granular electron dense deposits by EM) are provided. This represents the first study on the clinicopathologic and outcome characteristics of this dual glomerulopathy.</p><p id="Par3425"><bold>Results:</bold> The cohort included 11 males &amp; 3 females, mostly White, with median age of 56, who presented with haematuria (86%), proteinuria (100%), and renal insufficiency (71%). 1 patient had carcinoma, 1 hepatitis C, and 1 lupus. None had hypocomplementemia or monoclonal gammopathy. On follow up (median 27 months), 8 progressed to ESRD. Histologically,12 cases showed mesangioproliferative GN, 1 crescentic GN and 1 mesangial sclerosis. DNAJB9 IHC was positive in all.</p><p id="Par3426"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Most cases of FGN concurrent with IgAN are idiopathic, and not associated with liver disease, hepatitis C, malignancy, autoimmune disease, or monoclonal gammopathy. The pathologic diagnosis can be established by correlating the findings on immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. DNAJB9 IHC is useful to establish the diagnosis of FGN in these cases, particularly in centres that do not perform electron microscopy.

Using digital pathology, this study aims to determine reproducibility of GD measurement, defining minimum number of glomeruli required for accurate measurement, and correlating GD with MEST-C scores.</p><p id="Par3448"><bold>Methods:</bold> The diameter of all non-sclerosed glomeruli from renal biopsies of 420 patients with IgA nephropathy was measured independently by 3 pathologists, using the ruler device on Aperio ImageScope software. Inter-observer and intra-observer variability was then assessed using interclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Mean and maximum GD were correlated with Oxford Classification MEST- C scores, using the independent samples T test.</p><p id="Par3449"><bold>Results:</bold> There was excellent interobserver (between 3 pathologists) and intra-observer (one pathologist measuring 2 levels from the same biopsy) correlation with ICC of &gt;0.9.

Arias*</underline>, E.M. Pena Burgos, R.M. Regojo Zapata, M.I. Esteban Rodríguez</p><p id="Par3490">*Hospital Universitario La Paz, Spain</p><p id="Par3491"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour (AT/RT) is a rare entity accounting for 1-2% of all paediatric brain tumours. It is characterized by inactivation of SMARCB1 (INI1) or SMARCA4 (BRG1) genes. Our aim is to review the AT/RTs diagnosed in our hospital.</p><p id="Par3492"><bold>Methods:</bold> We searched our database for every AT/RT diagnosed since the introduction of immunohistochemical staining for INI1 in our hospital (2013). For each case we studied age, sex, location and tumour extent, tumour size measured by magnetic resonance, histopathological patterns (including rhabdoid, small-cell, gland-like and spindle cell patterns), immunophenotype, follow-up time, treatment and outcome.</p><p id="Par3493"><bold>Results:</bold> We gathered 5 AT/RTs. Four of them were children (median age of 4,5 years; range 1-11 years) and one was an adult (46 years). Male-to-female ratio was 1:1,5. Median tumour size was 6,4 cm and cerebrospinal fluid dissemination was found in one case. Histopathological analysis always revealed a combination of patterns. Rhabdoid features were present in 4/5 cases, being the predominant pattern in one of them. Every case showed negative INI1 expression by immunohistochemistry. Three patients died (mean survival 43 weeks), one was lost to follow-up, and one of the paediatric patients (11 years) is still on follow-up after 72 weeks.</p><p id="Par3494"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> AT/RTs have a wide differential diagnosis. We emphasize the importance of considering AT/RT in heterogeneous tumours in paediatric population, especially in infants. Due to its low prevalence in adults, other INI1-negative tumours should be ruled out prior to diagnosing AT/RT and the performance of additional studies should be suggested. We present our experience willing to provide data for a better understanding of this uncommon entity generally associated with poor prognosis.</p><p id="Par3495"><bold>PS-09-004</bold></p><p id="Par3496"><bold>Diffuse gliomas with non-canonical IDH mutations</bold></p><p id="Par3497"><underline>E.

In this study, we aimed to analyse the histopathological features of diffuse gliomas with non-canonical IDH mutations.</p><p id="Par3500"><bold>Methods:</bold> We sequenced by Sanger IDH1/IDH2 genes in 89 IDH1 R132H immuno-negative diffuse gliomas and validated our findings using data in TGCA database.</p><p id="Par3501"><bold>Results:</bold> Diffuse gliomas with non-canonical IDH mutations were rare (3.3%). Non-canonical mutations in IDH1 were exclusive to astrocytic tumours, while IDH2 mutations were significantly more frequent, though not exclusive to, oligodendrogliomas (P= 0.0019). In oligodendrogliomas, IDH2 mutation was significantly associated with frontal lobe localization (P=0.005). Similarly to diffuse gliomas with IDH1 R132H mutation, those with non canonical IDH mutations were significantly more frequent in patients &lt; 55 years (P&lt; 0.0001) and had significantly better prognosis than IDH wt gliomas (P&lt; 0.0001).</p><p id="Par3502"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Non-canonical IDH mutations are mainly found in diffuse gliomas of younger patients and have prognostic significance similar to that of IDH1-R312H mutation.

Variable biological behaviour and histological features makes tumour grading a challenge. This case series aims to study the clinicopathological features of these tumours diagnosed at a Portuguese tertiary centre.</p><p id="Par3508"><bold>Methods:</bold> All cases of TPR diagnosed in our institution from 1999 to 2019 were retrieved from our files. Their clinicopathological features, including imaging, histology and imunophenotype, treatment and follow up (six years on average) were reviewed.</p><p id="Par3509"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 24 TPR (16 males, 8 females; 19.8 years on average at diagnosis): eleven tumours of pineal parenchyma (six pineoblastomas, five parenchymal tumours of intermediate differentiation); four papillary TPR; four germ cell tumours; two embryonal tumours; one rosette-forming glioneuronal tumour and a pilocytic astrocytoma. Nineteen patients received radiotherapy, fourteen of whom had additional chemotherapy. Three patients had disseminated disease at diagnosis; four had craniospinal spreading on follow up (after 21 months on average). One patient died 23 months after the initial diagnosis. In our case series, recurrence and mortality were associated with disseminated disease at the time of diagnosis and high grade histology irrespective of tumour type.</p><p id="Par3510"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The prognosis of TPR depends on the clinical factors and response to therapy, but also on the pathological features.

The child complained of seizure, vomiting and headache. MRI showed a huge heterogenous left frontal mass infiltrating the skull with extracranial soft tissue extension. The diagnosis of ETMR was established based on histopathologic, immunohistochemical and molecular features.</p><p id="Par3517"><bold>Results:</bold> Histopathologic examination showed a neoplasm composed of primitive small cells arranged in sheets with scattered multilayered rosettes with extensive foci of desmoplastic stroma. Immunohistochemistry was performed using panel of antibodies and revealed positive expression for synaptophysin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, Olig2, smooth muscle actin, and LIN28A. Molecular testing revealed focal amplification of the chromosome 19q13.42 microRNA cluster (C19MC) with breakpoints of the amplification immediately preceding the C19MC locus at the 5' boundary and within the TTYH1 gene at the 3' boundary, thus confirming the integrated diagnosis of ETMR, WHO grade IV. The other chromosomal copy number changes in the tumour were losses of interstitial 5q and portions of 10q.</p><p id="Par3518"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Desmoplastic stroma can occur as a very rare and unusual histologic finding in ETMR due to tumour invasiveness with extracranial extension.</p><p id="Par3519"><bold>PS-09-007</bold></p><p id="Par3520"><bold>Bifocal, anaplastic cerebellar liponeurocytoma with ABL1-L292M mutation</bold></p><p id="Par3521"><underline>M.A.A.

Histologicaly, both tumours were similar. They showed sheets of monotonous neurocytic cells, admixed with fatty component. The tumour cells are positive for GFAP, Vimetin, Synaptophysin and Chromogranin, with weak focal expression of Neu-N, Desmin, and negative for EMA, ATRX, CD34, NFP and P53 immunostains. Anaplastic features and high Ki-67 (10%) were seen. NGS revealed ABL1-L292M mutation with alternate variant frequency of 5%.

Total gross ressection was performed.</p><p id="Par3578"><bold>Results:</bold> Histologic exam showed a tumour comprising: a) desmoplastic areas with mature spindle astrocytes (GFAP positive) surrounded by a dense reticulin network and pericellular collagen IV (DIA-pattern); b) a poorly differentiated component (GFAP negative) of small round blue cells. Mitotic figures were restricted to poorly differentiated areas; microvascular proliferation and necrosis were absent. A diagnosis of DIA was made. Recurrence with aggressive progression within few weeks led to comprehensive genomic profiling that revealed a CIC-NUTM1 rearrangement.

Studies describing their spectrum are generally few. Our objective was to determine the histomorphological spectrum of neoplastic spinal lesions and the trend in occurrence over four decades.</p><p id="Par3610"><bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed Patients’ age, gender and histomorphological data of all the neoplastic spinal lesions from the patients’ hospital records over a 40-year period (January 1st, 1980 to December 31st, 2019). All the cases seen were classified as either benign or malignant neoplasms with their spectrum, frequencies and trends in decades determined using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 20.</p><p id="Par3611"><bold>Results:</bold> Ninety-four cases of neoplastic spinal lesions were seen over the four decades of study with the highest number of cases observed in the last decade. The male to female ratio was 1.2:1. The mean age was 34.8 years with a peak incidence in the 5th decade. Benign and malignant spinal neoplasms comprised 55.3% and 44.7% respectively. Meningiomas and peripheral nerve sheath tumours had the highest occurrences (16% each), while germ cell tumours had the least occurrence (2.1%). Other spectrum of spinal tumours seen include metastatic tumours (14.9%), soft tissue tumours (14.9%), haemato-lymphoid tumours (9.5%), glial tumours (8.5%), bone tumours (7.5%), Vascular tumours (5.3%) and neuronal tumours (5.3%).</p><p id="Par3612"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study showed that benign spinal tumours are more common than malignant spinal tumours, with a slight male predominance and most of the spinal tumours occurring below 50 years.

Majority of gliosarcomas are IDH1/2 wildtype and mutated tumours are rare. Here we present two such cases.</p><p id="Par3618"><bold>Methods:</bold> Two males (case 1 - age 49, case 2 -age 39) were diagnosed with IDH1-mutated diffuse gliomas in left temporal (case 1) and left frontal (case 2) area. They recurred as gliosarcoma after 6 and 5 years respectively. Gliosarcomas and concurrent/precursor gliomas were studied using immunohistochemistry (IDH1 R132H, ATRX, GFAP, Olig2, SOX10, p53) and FISH (1p/19q probes).</p><p id="Par3619"><bold>Results:</bold> Both tumours showed conspicuous oligodendroglial morphology in glioma component. In both primary gliomas, immunohistochemistry showed expression of IDH1 R132H and ATRX and these were also expressed in sarcoma components. In case 1, repeated FISH showed no 1p/19q codeletion. In case 2, partial deletion of 1p (in 40% of cells) without loss of 19q was detected. Sarcoma components showed positive reticulin stain, loss of Olig2 expression and loss of GFAP expression in majority of tumour cells. Mutant-type (strong and diffuse) p53 expression was observed in both gliosarcomas, but not in the glial component of case 2.

Muscle biopsy, along with immunological and clinical data may provide key information in understanding the pathological mechanisms of these controversial diseases.</p><p id="Par3627"><bold>Methods:</bold> Open muscle biopsy was performed on 42 patients with suspected inflammatory myopathy during the year 2019 in our hospital. We evaluated the main pathological features using histological, immunohistochemical, enzyme histochemical techniques, routine and special stains on cryosections and paraffin-embedded tissue. Among them, we identified 3 patients (7%) with myopathology suggestive for anti-SRP myopathy. Anti-SRP antibodies were further tested positive.</p><p id="Par3628"><bold>Results:</bold> Muscle biopsies showed the picture of a severe active necrotizing myopathy with marked variability in size of the fibres, numerous necrotic and regenerating fibres and rare scattered mononuclear cells in all three cases. ATPase staining showed type 1 fiber predominance myopathic pattern with a reduced size of type 2 fibres. Immunomarking with MHC Class I antibody showed a rather unexpected prominent expression in non-necrotic fibres in two cases and normal expression in the third one. Differential diagnosis with other types of inflammatory myopathies, especially dermatomyositis, polymyositis, and anti-HMGCR myopathy, even with muscle dystrophies proved sometimes to be challenging because of the similarity of both clinical and morphological aspects.</p><p id="Par3629"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Anti-SRP myopathy is a distinct entity in terms of clinical traits, biopsy changes and response to conventional combined immunosuppressive therapy. Histopathology of muscle, along with complementary investigation, may provide useful clues regarding the correct diagnosis, in deciphering the mechanisms of this disease with a major impact on clinical management of this potentially life-threatening disease.</p><p id="Par3630"><bold>PS-10 Paediatric and Perinatal Pathology</bold></p><p id="Par3631"><bold>PS-10-001</bold></p><p id="Par3632"><bold>Composite hemangioendothelioma - a clinicopathological study of site, composition and immunohistochemistry of an additional series</bold></p><p id="Par3633"><underline>K.

Three major genes are involved in their pathogenesis (ie <italic>STFPB</italic>, <italic>STFPC</italic>, <italic>ABCA3</italic>). Histologically, several patterns may be observed, and although suggestive for one of these disorders, they are not specific.</p><p id="Par3644"><bold>Methods:</bold> 10 patients with a positive genetic testing were identified. We blindly reviewed their biopsies (H&amp;E, trichrome, PAS, SMA, CK7 and CD68 stains), recording the main histological findings according to a previous set list of items. Electron microscopy (EM) findings were also assessed, when available. The collected information was correlated with the corresponding mutation. Finally, we revised the clinical outcomes.</p><p id="Par3645"><bold>Results:</bold> 6 patients were female and 4 male, aged 0 to 11 (mean 1.6 years). The most common mutation was <italic>SFTPC</italic>(50%), followed by <italic>ABCA3</italic>(40%) and <italic>SFTPB</italic>(10%). All the biopsies presented features of chronic pneumonitis of infancy (CPI), with alveolar simplification, thickened septa and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. All the cases with <italic>ABCA3</italic>mutation showed the most prominent fibrosis and muscularization of the septa. The histology in <italic>SFTPC</italic>mutated cases was more variable.

All cases were then analysed in terms of age, age group, gender, residence, morphological features and immunophenotype, where possible.</p><p id="Par3719"><bold>Results:</bold> This study revealed that the most common solid tumours in children and adolescents diagnosed in Rwanda were retinoblastoma, followed by nephroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and osteosarcoma. The most common tumours by category were retinoblastoma (25%), soft tissue sarcomas (20%), renal tumours (18.5%) and bone tumours (14%). These tumours were more frequently seen in children between 1 and 4 years of age and were less frequent in infants. There was a slight male predilection (M/F ratio = 1.18). Among the cases where staging information was available, most patients presented at early stages; however, staging was not applicable or not provided for most cases (83.5%). Diagnostic immunohistochemistry was not performed in 46.1% of cases.</p><p id="Par3720"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In slight contrast to other studies of paediatric malignant solid tumours in the region, our study showed the most common paediatric tumour was retinoblastoma.

All cases were confirmed by diffuse nuclear NUT immunoreactivity and/or NUT rearrangement by FISH. Clinico-pathologic parameters were reviewed. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed in three cases.</p><p id="Par3911"><bold>Results:</bold> Primary sites included lung, frontal and ethmoid sinuses, larynx, and axillary area. Five patients had multiple metastases at the time of diagnosis. The tumours showed small round cell morphology with/without abrupt keratinization. The tumour were immuno-positive for cytokeratin (ck, 6/6, 100 %) and p40 (4/5, 80%). One showed EWSR1 rearrangement by FISH which initially diagnosed as Ewing sarcoma.

Guimarães</p><p id="Par3916">*Centro Hospitalar Universitário de São João, Portugal</p><p id="Par3917"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH) is an uncommon soft tissue tumour that typically occurs in the extremities. Fewer than 10 cases having been reported in the pulmonary region. Herein we report the first case of AFH arising from the pulmonary hilum.</p><p id="Par3918"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 32-year-old male presenting with recurrent haemoptysis was found to have a hypervascular mass (53mm) in the right pulmonary hilum, involving the pulmonary vein, the interlobar artery and the middle lobe bronchi on CT scan. The routine staging including PET scanning, disclosed no evidence of disease elsewhere. After several inconclusive biopsies, a right pneumonectomy was performed due to massive haemoptysis.</p><p id="Par3919"><bold>Results:</bold> The tumour comprised a multinodular proliferation of bland spindle to histiocytoid cells with dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate and angiomatoid features, which had invaded into bronchial and vessel walls (exhibiting an impressive endovascular growth) and two hilar lymph nodes. There was no significant atypia, mitosis or necrosis. Immunohistochemical profile (CD99, CD68, EMA diffusely positive; desmin focally positive with dendritic-like pattern) and detection of EWSR1(22q12) gene rearrangements confirmed the diagnosis of AFH.</p><p id="Par3920"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> AFH can occur at unusual sites, including the pulmonary hilum.

Clinicopathological details including age at diagnosis, tumour morphology and rearrangement /molecular status were collated.</p><p id="Par3927"><bold>Results:</bold> The cohort included 39females and 25males, age range 36-88 (average 66). 64 were tested: 2 lung resections, 52 biopsies(40 lung/pleura, 5 bone/soft tissue, 5 lymph node, 2 liver) and 10 cytology specimens. 55/64(86%) were adenocarcinomas. ROS-1 expression was detected in 33%(21/64). 3/21 showed strong positive staining with 1 confirmed CD74-ROS1 fusion, 1 KRAS codon 12 mutation and 1 negative for fusions/mutations. Equivocal expression was present in 28%(n=18) without subsequent ROS-1 rearrangement, but with KRAS(39%, n=7), EGFR(17%, n=3), and HER2(6%, n=1) mutations, giving a false positive rate of 17%. 3 showed no fusions/mutations and 4 were insufficient/not sequenced. ROS-1 expression was also noted in reactive type II pneumocytes and mesothelial cells.</p><p id="Par3928"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> ROS-1 immunoreactivity should be interpreted with caution as tumours lacking ROS-1 rearrangement may still express ROS-1 by IHC and harbour alternative mutations (i.e. KRAS in 39%).

IHC expressed strong for TTF-1, NapsinA, p40, and Braf-specific antibodies with Braf mutation(p.V600E). #2 was similar to #1. However, luminal cells consisted of MCs, negative for NapsinA without Braf mutation. #3, “distal-type BA” contained predominant CCs and cuboidal cells without MCs, papillary/glandular architecture. Bilayered architecture were equivocal, and possible to overlie BCs layer by luminal cells.

NordiQC provides proficiency testing for immunohistochemical (IHC) demonstration of PD-L1 expression with primary focus on non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC).</p><p id="Par3983"><bold>Methods:</bold> NSCLC samples characterized for PD-L1 with critical and relevant expression levels, using the companion diagnostic (CDx) assay 22C3, Agilent, as reference standard method, were used for the assessments. In each assessment, tissue micro arrays comprising 6–12 NSCLCs, were constructed. Sections were circulated to the participants performing IHC for PD-L1 by their routine method. Results were evaluated by experienced assessors.</p><p id="Par3984"><bold>Results:</bold> Between 2017-19, six PD-L1 assessments were performed. The number of participants have increased from 68 in C1 to 182 in C6 with a total number of 881 submitted protocols in the first six runs. The pass-rate varied from 50% in C1 to 91% in C3, with an average of 81%. 37% of the participants used CDx assays performed accordingly to vendor guidelines provided an average pass-rate of 92%, compared to 67% for laboratory developed (LD) assays, used by 44%. 19% modified the protocol settings for CDx assays, providing a pass-rate of 88%. 75% of insufficient results were characterized by false negative staining reactions changing PD-L1 status of the included carcinomas.</p><p id="Par3985"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Results obtained in all six assessments showed performance differences between LD and CDx assays.

Diagnosis is increasingly being made on small tissue samples and cytological specimens. We present here our institutional experience regarding this.</p><p id="Par4042"><bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed histo- and cytomorphological data of lung and pleural tumour specimens received over a 10-year period (2010-2019). Data was sourced from the surgical pathology records and population-based cancer registry. Diagnostic materials were mainly trucut biopsies of the pleura and lung. Appropriate statistics was applied to evaluate tumour subtype proportions and associate clinicopathological factors.</p><p id="Par4043"><bold>Results:</bold> There were 230 cases consisting of 166 (73%) biopsies and 64 (27%) cytology specimens from 103 (44.8%) males and 127 (55.2%) females giving a female-to-male ratio of 1.2:1. The mean age was 58±16 years. Primary tumours constituted 167 (72.6%) of the cases whilst 63 (27.4%) were metastatic tumours. Of the primary tumours, adenocarcinoma was the predominant histologic subtype (52.7%), with small cell carcinoma and mesotheliomas occurring in 3.6%% and 2.4% of patients, respectively. The number of cases diagnosed rose by 37% in the past 5 years (2014-218). Diagnosis of primary versus metastatic tumours was significantly associated with gender (p=0.003), females having more metastatic tumours, likely a reflection of gender incidence.</p><p id="Par4044"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our finding suggests a rising incidence of diagnosed pleuropulmonary tumours in this population. This reflects both the increased effort by surgeons to obtain tissue for diagnosis as well as a real projected increase in cancer burden being witnessed in developing countries including lung cancers. As in previous studies, adenocarcinomas predominate in the histomorphology.

The goal of this study is to find out the morphological characteristics of pulmonary collapse after a single dose of X-ray exposure.</p><p id="Par4121"><bold>Methods:</bold> For this study, two groups of Wistar male rats, aged between 8-9 weeks, were used. The main group of rats received a single dose of X-Ray. In both groups, surfactant phospholipids were checked. At various time points, each of the rats were sacrificed and lung samples were analysed through light and electron microscopy.</p><p id="Par4122"><bold>Results:</bold> On days 1 - 3, changes in the lung tissue could only be observed by electron microscopy in the subpleural areas. We discovered signs of endothelial and type II alveolocyte’s damage, such as oedema, disturbances in the location of the organelles, osmiophilic bodies and destruction of the surfactant. At the end of the first week, partial atelectasis were seen by light microscopy. Moreover, during this time, zones of pulmonary collapse expanded from the subpleural area to the lung’s root. Between 2 and 7 weeks, there was a noticeable change in the lung and constriction of the bronchus was widespread. After 7 weeks, a ‘honeycomb’ pattern and pulmonary fibrosis was observed.</p><p id="Par4123"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study showed that after a single dose of X-ray exposure, atelectasis starts from the distal, subpleural areas and moves down.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in radiation induced lung injury(RILI).</p><p id="Par4129"><bold>Methods:</bold> Two groups or the Wistar-male-rats were used. One group had been irradiated by a single dose 12Gy of X-ray on the right lung. Non-irradiated group had been instilled with a saline solution into trachea. Animals from both groups were sacrificed on the different days after the beginning of the experiment and their lungs specimen had been analysed.</p><p id="Par4130"><bold>Results:</bold> Signs of the endothelial dysfunction were discovered by electron microscopy in the lung’s capillaries such as spasm, endothelial dystrophy and neoangiogenesis in the first hours after the start. IHC showed the reduction of the endothelial function markers (CD31, CD34, CD117, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, e-NOS) but their activity had been recovered in a few weeks. The local maximum of the residual fluorescence identified on the spectrum of the specimens is conditioned by toxicity of– OH radicals, superoxide anion radicals – O2 and some quantity of – CH3 radicals in the tissues. Superoxide anion radicals reduced the amount of nitrogen oxides converting them into peroxynitrites (ONOOH).</p><p id="Par4131"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The results show that signs of oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction could be detected within the first 24 hours after the initiation of the experiment by electron microscopy. Raman-fluorescent shows peaks by the 3rd day and the activity decreases by the 50th day of the experiment. Free radicals play the key role in oxydative stress and mediate the extent and intensity of the endothelial dysfunction.</p><p id="Par4132"><bold>PS-11-041</bold></p><p id="Par4133"><bold>The use of multigene next generation sequencing to improve accuracy of lung cancer staging in multiple tumours</bold></p><p id="Par4134"><underline>S.

We present a case of a cardiorespiratory arrest with histologic evidence of eosinophilic infiltrate of the myocardium during the autopsy.</p><p id="Par4232"><bold>Methods:</bold> A medico-legal autopsy, toxicological laboratory exams and a histological diagnosis were conducted.</p><p id="Par4233"><bold>Results:</bold> A 48-year old, female patient with no relevant background history presented cardiorespiratory arrest, with previous complaints of interscapular pain. Laboratory findings revealed elevated levels of d-dimer, troponin I, reactive protein C and creatine kinase and no peripheral eosinophilia. Imagiological testing and coronary angiography, excluded aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism as well as, an acute coronary syndrome. Organ support was suspended because of the presented instability and an unknown reversible cause. Macroscopic appreciation, during autopsy revealed a slight heterogenic coloration of the myocardium, and no other apparent causes of death. The histology revealed interstitial haemorrhage of the heart and an eosinophilic infiltrate of the septal subendocardic myocardium.</p><p id="Par4234"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The clinical presentation of Eosinophilic myocarditis varies from paucisymptomatic to acute fulminant myocarditis. It is often fatal with high in-hospital mortality, in particular when it presents as fulminant form. Eosinophilic myocarditis is probably under-recognized and frequently discovered on post-mortem examination. We present a case of EM discovered on post-mortem examination were no associated systemic disorder was identified, as such considered an idiopathic/undefined EM.</p><p id="Par4235"><bold>PS-12-004</bold></p><p id="Par4236"><bold>Correlation of digital and invasive post-mortem examinations</bold></p><p id="Par4237"><underline>K.

Digital autopsies have been used in the Sefton Coroner’s jurisdiction since August 2018. We compared proposed digital COD with invasive COD and compared assessment of coronary artery disease.</p><p id="Par4240"><bold>Methods:</bold> All autopsies that had both digital and invasive examination at Whiston Hospital between August 2018 and January 2019 (6 month period) were included. Reports were interrogated for major and minor discrepancies along with coronary artery disease assessment. The data was compiled in Microsoft Excel and analysed in both Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS.</p><p id="Par4241"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 303 autopsies were digitally scanned of which 134 proceeded to invasive post-mortem examination. A total of 51 minor discrepancies were identified, which would not affected cause of death not were otherwise significant. There were 6 major discrepancies identified that would have altered cause of death. 57% had similar estimations of coronary artery disease. Only 64% of cases had no discrepancies between the radiological and invasive examinations.</p><p id="Par4242"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our cohort population is significantly different from those of previous studies. Often due to lack of clinical information there are many unanswered questions remaining after DA, so invasive PM is required. The use of digital autopsies has to be refined based on appropriate case selection since some COD cannot be detected or are likely to be missed on radiological examination.</p><p id="Par4243"><bold>PS-12-005</bold></p><p id="Par4244"><bold>Acute fatty liver disease of pregnancy: a difficult diagnosis in a case of maternal death</bold></p><p id="Par4245"><underline>L.

We present a case of a 29-years old female, who died shortly after the delivery.</p><p id="Par4248"><bold>Methods:</bold> She presented in emergency department with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting five days after her first delivery. She died shortly after due to liver failure. To establish the cause of death, a full autopsy was performed at the Institute of Forensic Medicine of Targu Mures, Romania.</p><p id="Par4249"><bold>Results:</bold> On autopsy examination, massive oedema of the lungs and fatty appearance of the liver were seen. At microscopy, the lungs exhibited acute extensive oedema and pulmonary capillary congestion. The liver presented microvesicular fatty infiltration of the hepatocytes visible only in the central and mid zonal parts of the lobule. The fat droplets surrounded centrally located nuclei with a foamy appearance of the cytoplasm. The fatty infiltration spared a thin rim of cells around the portal tracts.</p><p id="Par4250"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The histological aspect of the liver was consistent with AFLP. The differential diagnosis with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets syndrome (HELLP) is difficult, since there are some clinical, biochemical and pathological overlapping.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia ranges from mild interstitial infiltrates to diffuse alveolar damage and can sometimes mimic a lung tumour on macroscopy and Hodgkin’s disease on microscopic examination.</p><p id="Par4256"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present a case of a 46-year-old woman, previously diagnosed with usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), suffering progressive worsening of respiratory function, brought by ambulance into the emergency department. Chest CT scan showed ground glass appearance and multiple nodules in her lungs, suggestive of acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient died several hours after admission.</p><p id="Par4257"><bold>Results:</bold> Autopsy showed multiple confluent firm tumour-like gray-white nodules in the middle and lower lobes of the right lung, encasing hilar structures, with yellow-gray areas of necrosis and associated pleural and pericardial retraction. Dark red areas of haemorrhage were also seen. Frozen section examination during autopsy raised suspicions of malignancy, but permanent sections showed no malignant cells. Pneumocytes were large and displayed a single basophilic intranuclear inclusion, surrounded by a clear halo, resembling Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells. We also found the honeycombing pattern characteristic of UIP and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate, focal hyaline membranes, areas of hemorrhagic necrosis with central neutrophilic response and histiocytes within the airspaces.</p><p id="Par4258"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> On immunohistochemistry, the RS-like cells were pan-cytokeratin positive, TTF-1 and LCA negative and stained for anti-CMV antibody. CD15 was positive in some RS-like infected cells, but CD30 was negative.This case illustrates the diagnostic pitfalls in CMV pneumonia, mimicking a tumour, both macroscopically and histologically, and highlights the challenges pathologists face in autopsy examination.</p><p id="Par4259"><bold>PS-12-007</bold></p><p id="Par4260"><bold>Video documentation in autopsy practice</bold></p><p id="Par4261"><underline>D.

Only the sports cameras and Google glass provided sufficient resolution to be considered efficient aids. Ten of the autopsies were recorded simultaneously with the two devises, with the sports cameras performing superiorly in providing the proper point of view, due to their adjustable nature, video-resolution and audio quality, together with sufficient battery life.

There was a 48% response rate. The results, which were from a total of 14 countries, showed a wide variety in the management of sudden cardiac death, with a general tendency towards a lack of thorough investigation.</p><p id="Par4301"><bold>Results:</bold> In up to 40% of cases autopsies were not performed in subjects less than 50 years who may have died from cardiac disease.

Therefore, at the beginning of friction on a less rigid surface there are multiple tsar-pins in the direction of movement of fragments. Experiment: for the formation of traces, about 25 respiratory movements are necessary, which corresponds to the duration of the agonal period.

The study aimed to investigate the burden of pulmonary infections HIV deaths in Ghana, and the drug susceptibility of the causative organisms.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 95 consecutively consented HIV/AIDS-related deaths were prospectively included. Standard autopsy procedure was followed with review of record of deceased. Lungs were sampled with two representative specimens taken from each lobe, and then processed with histology-stains and cultures for micro-organisms. Drug susceptibility testing was performed. Baseline characteristics using Pearson, chi-squared, Fisher’s exact and student t tests were applied where appropriate.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Bacterial pneumonia was the most common cause of death (66.3% ) followed by TB (35%). The ante-mortem clinical diagnosis of TB compared to confirmed-autopsy diagnosis was 78.8% sensitive (95% CI 62.2-89.3) and 67.3% specific (95% CI 54.1-78.2). Of culture-proven M. tuberculosis cases, 23.8% failed to identify TB as an ante-mortem clinical cause of death, of which 20% were rifampin mono-resistant. Bacteria and fungi cultures resulted in several isolates. E. faecalis, E. coli, K. pneumonia, Staphylococcus species and Candida species are among the organisms identified. Gram-negative bacteria are most susceptible to cefoxitin but highly resistant to cefuroxime sodium whereas, the Gram-positives are highly susceptibility to vancomycin but resistant to flucloxacillin.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our findings emphasize that pulmonary TB and pneumonia are major causes of death in HIV/AIDS patients.

We aimed to determine the prognostic impact of the expression of CD10 and CD15 on patients with PTC.</p><p id="Par4528"><bold>Methods:</bold> Immunohistochemistry for CD10 and CD15 was performed on the tissue microarrays of 515 patients with PTC. Clinical significance of MME (CD10) mRNA and FUT4 (CD15) mRNA expression was analysed in 454 PTC patients using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data.</p><p id="Par4529"><bold>Results:</bold> CD10 and CD15 expression was detected in 201 (39.0%) and 295 (57.3%) of 515 PTC cases, respectively. Extrathyroidal extension and BRAF V600E were associated with the expression of both CD10 and CD15. Recurrence was inversely correlated with CD15 expression (p = 0.034) but not with CD10 expression. Patients with CD15 expression had an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.509 (p = 0.027) for recurrence-free survival and an adjusted odds ratio of 2.511 (p = 0.028) for predicting no clinical evidence of disease.

While paraganglioma harbour well-known germline/somatic mutations, the genetic background of DIPNECH remains unknown.</p><p id="Par4537">We herein report for the first time their coexistence and discuss the genetic results.</p><p id="Par4538"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 56-year-old female with a previous history of papillary thyroid carcinoma and breast ductal carcinoma, was found to have multiple lung nodules (from 4mm to 9mm) in a follow-up CT scan. Biopsies disclosed a neuroendocrine tumour. Subsequently, a Ga-68 DOTANOC PET/CT was performed disclosing a mass (20mm) near the left carotid artery that was removed before the lung surgery.</p><p id="Par4539"><bold>Results:</bold> Cervical lesion was a paraganglioma and lung lesion was a carcinoid tumour with associated tumourlets and neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH). Genetic study for mutations in SDHAF2, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, MEN1, MAX, TMEM127 and VHL genes was negative. A variant of unknown significance in the PALB2 gene (c.1408A&gt;G) was found in the peripheral blood while a genetic cause for the breast cancer was being pursued. This genetic variant was also detected in one close relative with breast cancer at younger age.

The frequency of this new entity is unknown. The aim of this study was to report our institutional experience with NIFTP.</p><p id="Par4546"><bold>Methods:</bold> Thyroid tumours diagnosed as follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma (FVPTC) or NIFTP between 2005 and 2019 were identified using our data base. Information regarding patient demographics, clinical presentation, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) results, multifocality, pathology stage, type of surgery, lymph node, systemic metastasis and follow-up were recorded, and the archived slides of the cases were reviewed.</p><p id="Par4547"><bold>Results:</bold> 13 patients (median: 50,3 years) were identified and classified as NIFTPs representing 5,4% of all cases of thyroid carcinomas. The FNA results were indeterminated including AUS/FLUS (33,3%) and suspicious for follicular neoplasm (33,3%), benign (25%) while malignant (8,3%) was les common.

Weiss-score (WS) defines malignancy criteria, while ENSAT and Helsinki score might be used for prognostisation. We aimed to introduce digital pathology methods for the precision work-up of ACC.</p><p id="Par4554"><bold>Methods:</bold> HE, Ki-67 and Phospho-Histon H3 (PHH3) stained slides of 34 ACC-cases were digitized and analysed with Pannoramic 250 Scanner and Pattern/HistoQuant Softwares (3DHistech, Hungary). For Digital Prognostisation Index (DPI) following variables were measured on whole slides: size and shape of tumour cells, necrosis, Ki-67 proliferation Index and PHH3 (for mitotic count). Results were correlated with data from clinical follow up.</p><p id="Par4555"><bold>Results:</bold> ENSAT-stage (Stage2:35 versus Stage 3-4:15 months, p=0,09), correlated better with modified Weiss-score and both showed moderate impact on survival. The presence of necrosis (threshold at 1%) resulted in lower overall survival ( 21,5 versus 39 months, p=0,08). WS, mWS and ENSAT stage could predict 18-month survival in less than 60% of cases. Ki-67 proliferation index defined by pathologists and by Digital Image Analysis correlated well (Spearman: 0,804), but PHH3, Ki-67, size and shape of tumour cells did not have prognostical impact alone on overall survival. If we combined above mentioned data into a Digital Prognostisation Index, it could predict 18-month overall survival in 21 of 27 (78%) cases.</p><p id="Par4556"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Helsinki and ENSAT score can tell something about the metastatic spread of ACC, but ACC still remains a disease with hardly predictable survival or outcome. Our study shows that thorough morphological examination with digital image analysis might bring some increase in the accuracy of predicting overall survival.

Animals received normal drinking water for 30 days after a 90-day exposure to a combination of heavy metal salts: zinc, copper, iron, manganese, lead and chromium. To reveal the neuroendocrine cells, the immunohistochemical study of Chromogranin A, using the rabbit monoclonal antibodies, was performed.</p><p id="Par4587"><bold>Results:</bold> Heavy metal salts cause the morphological and immunohistochemical alterations in all structural components of the epiphysis and parathyroid glands. Perivascular oedema, significant vascular plethora, thickening and impaired permeability of the vascular wall with the formation of diapedesis haemorrhages were observed. The vast majority of pinealocytes had signs of significant cytoplasmic vacuolation with an increase of Chromogranin A expression compared to control animals.

A case labelled as “sarcoma of the orbit” was selected for the study.</p><p id="Par4637"><bold>Methods:</bold> The wet specimen is a case of sarcoma of the orbit dating back to the year 1920. The label shows the autopsy number and an archive research was carried out.</p><p id="Par4638"><bold>Results:</bold> The wet specimen was collected performing an autopsy on a 50-year-old male. The autopsy report also describes his clinical history: he had a neoplasm at the basis of the orbital cavity which was treated with roentgen therapy. After the treatment the neoplasm was reduced. Later the patient had vertebral metastases and spinal cord compression with paraplegia. He died for purulent cystitis with fistulas.</p><p id="Par4639"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This case shows one of the historical first attempt to cure sarcomas with roentgen therapy in Turin. Therefore, it is of historical interest since it shows the outcomes of a first treatment with a new therapy.</p><p id="Par4640"><bold>PS-14-002</bold></p><p id="Par4641"><bold>Dry congenital arterial anomalies in the museum</bold></p><p id="Par4642"><underline>R.H.

Ramieri, <underline>M. Marino*</underline></p><p id="Par4651">*IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy</p><p id="Par4652"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> The haematopoiesis was first discovered as blood islands in extraembryonic tissues (area opaca/ yolk sac).In 1846 a liver role was discovered by Weber and Kӧlliker. In 1868, the bone marrow was identified as source of haematopoiesis by Neumann and Bizzozero.</p><p id="Par4653"><bold>Methods:</bold> Early blood staining techniques were developed by Ehrlich and refined by Pappenheim, allowing them to study the maturation sequence of blood cell lineages. Subsequently in the XX century, techniques of radiation biology provided experimental tools to distinguish among the dualistic and unitarian theory on haematopoiesis of the two scientists. Later on, radiation biology techniques extended to bone marrow transplantation research.</p><p id="Par4654"><bold>Results:</bold> P. Ehrlich and A. Pappenheim came to different conclusions, the first proposing a precursor marrow cell for the myeloid series and a lymphatic-derived precursor for lymphocytes (dualistic theory), and A. Pappenheim proposing that a primitive mononuclear cell he identified was precursor of all blood cells (unitarian theory). The blood stem cells were investigated by the scientists E. Neumann and A. Pappenheim both in physiological haematopoiesis and in various forms of leukaemia. A. Pappenheim was aware that ‘stem cells' ("Stammzelle")"or ‘mother cells’ (Mutterzellen) had the potential to differentiate into diverse cell lines. From the early 1960s the studies on stem cells in haematopoiesis led to the beginning of modern stem cell research</p><p id="Par4655"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The concept of Stem cells includes both positive meanings of common heritage and normal development as well as a negative significance as potential source of cancer. In the second half of the XX century the history of leukaemia research considered stem cells both as a ‘biological force for good’ in the framework of bone marrow transplantation as well as having a ‘dark side’ through the concept of cancer stem cell.</p><p id="Par4656"><bold>PS-14-004</bold></p><p id="Par4657"><bold>Evolution of intestinal metaplasia definition (term) as reflection of history of medicine</bold></p><p id="Par4658"><underline>S.

Historically, the development of ideas about metaplasia (and, in particular, intestinal metaplasia) was accompanied by a significant semantic modification.</p><p id="Par4661"><bold>Methods:</bold> Content analysis through systematic review of publications (PubMed, Embase) using key words metaplasia and intestinal metaplasia was carried out. Substantial evolutionary modification of these terms was noted from Rudolph Virchow (he coined the term “metaplasia” at the VIIIth International Medical Congress in Copenhagen in 1884) to the present time. A comparative method and a substantial analysis of sources were used.</p><p id="Par4662"><bold>Results:</bold> The main evolutionary stages of terms modification were identified and designated: general biological approach, pathology and epidemiology-based approach, association with stem cells and genetic regulation. Each period was associated with basic values and features of the development of medical knowledge. The forecast of the further evolution of the term based on the current ideas of modern pathology was indicated. Expanding on earlier discussion that metaplasias can develop when mature cells dedifferentiate and proliferate the modern aspects of this process is discussed about contribution of huge number of associated factors and conditions. There are numerous similarities between gastric and esophageal intestinal metaplasia,suggesting an idea that the mechanisms would be identical.</p><p id="Par4663"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The main feature of metaplasia is changing in cellular identity associated with transcription factors that inhibit and/or maintain cellular characteristics. Improved surveillance of metaplasia might lead to cancer prevention. All elements in terminology system affect each other with the following changes of conceptual apparatus (metaplasia-transdifferentiation). It means changing not only the terminology itself, but significantly affects the assessment of the pathological process: its diagnosis and the development of therapeutic strategies.</p><p id="Par4664"><bold>PS-14-005</bold></p><p id="Par4665"><bold>Pathology museum: the old way for learning medicine on modern times</bold></p><p id="Par4666"><underline>A.

Nowadays, new methods of teaching have been developed, leading pathology museums to be obsolete Hereby, we present a collection of macroscopies existing in our Pathology Department.</p><p id="Par4669"><bold>Methods:</bold> We want to highlight the importance of pathology museums, given than they are part of the history of medicine, and extremely useful for teaching Pathology. We counted the macroscopic samples, group them in the different body systems and finally these samples were catalogued taking into account the nosological entities they represented: inflammatory, vascular and degenerative processes, tumours, amongst others.</p><p id="Par4670"><bold>Results:</bold> We have 1275 specimens placed in sealed formalin bottles. The majority of them represented pathologies of gynaecological, digestive and respiratory system (18,5 % 16% 9,5%). The most frequent illnesses are neoplasms, except in: cardiovascular system, spleen and thyroid, for which inflammatory diseases, infarcts and goiter were prevalent.</p><p id="Par4671"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This presentation is important to seize this learning material to teach medicine. It represents the illness in an extremely tangible state and allows to make a correlation between clinical, imagenologic, and pathological findings.

Microscopic examination to estimate “tumour purity” before sequencing ensures high-quality data. We aim to estimate the level of consistency among pathologists and their agreement with CNV-based algorithms for tumour purity.</p><p id="Par4678"><bold>Methods:</bold> We selected 40 of 450 sequenced oesophageal tumours from the Mutographs study, through clustering by country of origin, method of preservation, and post-sequence assessment of purity. Four pathologists examined frozen sections and scored them for quality, percentage of tumour and inflammatory cells and necrosis. Inter-rater reliability (IRR) was estimated for the consistency among pathologists and their agreement with bioinformatics measurements.</p><p id="Par4679"><bold>Results:</bold> Average and individual IRR (95%CI) of purity estimates among pathologists was 0.73 (0.61 – 0.81) and 0.40 (0.28 – 0.52) respectively. The average IRR for inflammation and necrosis were 0.69 (0.56 – 0.79) and 0.37 (0.09 – 0.57). Modified weighted kappa for agreement between pathology and CNV-based methods ranged from 0.66 (0.44 – 0.87) to 0.51(0.29 – 0.73). When the quality of samples was accounted for, agreement improved to 0.72.</p><p id="Par4680"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Microscopic examination of frozen tissues is applicable for purity estimation in NGS-era and higher quality improves the estimate. We observed moderate to good reliability among pathologists and a moderate but variable agreement with post-sequencing measurement. This variation could not be explained solely by the quality of samples or differences in non-tumoral components. Harmonizing the method of estimation of cellular elements and regular communication between pathologists and bioinformaticians in case of disagreement might help to ameliorate this practice.</p><p id="Par4681">Funding: CRUK Grand Challenge Program</p><p id="Par4682"><bold>PS-15-003</bold></p><p id="Par4683"><bold>Utility of national next generation sequencing-based cancer profiling tests: experience from a series of 172 patients in a large private laboratory in Brazil</bold></p><p id="Par4684"><underline>D.

Pathogenic somatic variants were identified in all the major tumour types evaluated, and actionable variants were identified in all major tumour types except sarcomas. One case of lung adenocarcinoma presented high TMB.

Furney</p><p id="Par4701">*Department of Histopathology, St. Vincent’s University Hospital, Elm Park, Dublin, Ireland</p><p id="Par4702"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Synchronous colorectal cancers (syCRCs) are defined as two/more primary tumours identified simultaneously in a patient. Previous studies report high inter-tumour heterogeneity between syCRCs, suggesting independent origin and potential different treatment responses. No specific guidelines are currently available rendering management challenging.</p><p id="Par4703"><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed an in-depth characterisation of 12 tumours from 3 treatment naïve syCRC patients by analysing histopathological, whole genome sequencing and RNA-sequencing data. We assessed the extent of genetic overlap between syCRCs and examined associations between clinicopathological information and the molecular, microbial and immune features of each tumour genome.</p><p id="Par4704"><bold>Results:</bold> We found mixed microsatellite status between and within patient tumours. Synchronous lesions within patients harboured distinct mutations in the same known CRC genes, although overlaps of known driver mutations such as BRAF V600E did occur. DNA analysis of gut microbial organisms revealed the presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum species in BRAF mutant, hypermutated, microsatellite unstable tumours. Quantification of tumour immune infiltration showed varying immune responses between syCRCs. Inter-tumoral transcriptomic heterogeneity classified each tumour into different consensus molecular subtypes. High genetic heterogeneity between syCRCs suggest these tumours originate independently while accessing the same mutational processes.</p><p id="Par4705"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The importance of personalised genome/transcriptome sequencing of synchronous lesions is highlighted. Potential drug targets will vary depending on the mutational status in synchronous tumours from the same patient.

Liquid biopsy samples were collected in Streck tubes, ctDNA was extracted by Promega Maxwell and NGS was performed with two custom Ion Ampliseq HD panels covering hotspots in BRAF, CTNNB1, CYSLTR2, EIF1AX, GNA11, GNAQ, HRAS, KIT, KRAS, MAP2K1, NRAS, PIK3CA, PLCB4, PTEN, RAC1 and SF3B1.</p><p id="Par4777"><bold>Results:</bold> Primary tumour FFPE tissue was analysed with Ion Torrent Ampliseq to obtain initial mutation profile. Subsequently, liquid biopsy specimens were collected at defined intervals during targeted and immune therapy. A total of 159 plasma samples were analysed. ctDNA amounts were generally above 5ng/ml plasma and only marginally influenced by hemolysis. AmpliseqHD libraries were generated from 10 ng DNA and sequenced with at least 3mio reads. Analysis was successful in 100% of cases, molecular depth was 1000-2000 molecules per amplicon.

The possibility of using ctDNA for prognosis assessment and detection of minimal residual disease, monitoring of treatment efficacy therapies at CRC are studied.</p><p id="Par4883"><bold>Methods:</bold> The molecular testing performed by acPCR. liquid biopsy were collected at patients with mutated ras gene. ctDNA was detected on Idylla Biocartis automatic system. LB was performed in 35 patients with a primary diagnosis of CRC with a mutated RAS gene, after surgical treatment, prior to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy. In all cases, there was a localized process (T2-3N0-1M0).</p><p id="Par4884"><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 1318 patients with CRC RAS mutations found in 689 cases. Of the 35 patients examined by the LB, ct DNA in peripheral blood was detected in only 5 (14,2%) patients with moderately differentiated intestinal adenocarcinoma. All patients within 6-8 months passed from 6 to12 courses of adjuvant chemotherapy. In the control CT examination in 7/35 (20%) cases, the progression of the process to the liver and lungs was noted against the background of adjuvant treatment, of them in 5 cases with a positive on ctDNA confirmed before the start of chemotherapy. One patient with a constant positive ctDNA after adjuvant treatments with a fatal outcome during the year.</p><p id="Par4885"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Thus, the positive result at LB for ctDNA at the RAS study can be considered as a predictor of an unfavourable prognosis of the CRC , and in non-operable patients when tumour tissue is inaccessible, use it as a diagnostic predictive marker. The possibility of using ctDNA as a marker for monitoring of treatment efficacy therapies requires further study.</p><p id="Par4886">Funding: Scientific Medical Society of Kazakhstan and pharmaceutical company</p><p id="Par4887"><bold>PS-15-034</bold></p><p id="Par4888"><bold>Pan-cancer multiomics analysis of S-phase kinase-associated protein-2</bold></p><p id="Par4889"><underline>S.

However, exact mechanistic role of SKP2 in other cancers remains unfathomed. We present first report on pan-cancer multiomics analysis of SKP2 in all cancers.</p><p id="Par4892"><bold>Methods:</bold> We investigated SKP2 mRNA expression, methylation patterns, effects of SKP2 transcription on overall patient survival and somatic-mutations in SKP2 gene in pan-cancer by analysing data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) databases.</p><p id="Par4893"><bold>Results:</bold> SKP2 mRNA expression was upregulated in 12/33 TCGA tumour types. SKP2 promotor was significantly hypomethylated in most cancers while hypermethylated in colon-adenocarcinoma, oesophageal-carcinoma, kidney/renal-clear-cell-carcinoma, lung-squamous-cell-carcinoma and pancreatic-adenocarcinoma. Increased SKP2 transcript levels significantly reduce overall-survival in adrenocortical-carcinoma, uterine-carcinosarcoma, skin-cutaneous-melanoma, mesothelioma, lung-adenocarcinoma, liver-hepatocellular-carcinoma, brain-low-grade glioma and kidney-renal-papillary-cell-carcinoma. Low SKP2 expressions were significantly associated with short survival in thymoma, thyroid-carcinoma and ovarian-serous-cystadenocarcinoma. A total of 109 somatic mutations were found in SKP2 gene including missense mutations to be the highest. The highest somatic mutation rates in SKP2 were found in uterine-corpus-endometrial-carcinoma followed by lung-adenocarcinoma, head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma, skin-cutaneous-melanoma and bladder-urothelial-carcinoma.</p><p id="Par4894"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our findings unravel several unfathomed pathways related to the role of SKP2 in oncogenesis of several cancers, suggesting SKP2 as an important player in oncogenesis and a potential candidate for cancer-therapy.</p><p id="Par4895"><bold>PS-15-036</bold></p><p id="Par4896"><bold>Microsatellite instability testing, a 7-year experience</bold></p><p id="Par4897"><underline>Z.

Roca</p><p id="Par4931">*Hospital Vithas 9 de Octubre, Valencia, Spain</p><p id="Par4932"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Lacrimal gland tumours are similar to those in salivary glands. Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common. They are characterized by combining epithelial and mesenchymal elements. Different patterns are found, but lacrimal gland tumours usually have higher proportion of myoepithelial cells.</p><p id="Par4933"><bold>Methods:</bold> We have reviewed 5 tumours of the lacrimal gland studied in our institution with diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma. They corresponded to three women and two men with ages between 40 and 57 at the time of diagnosis. One of them was a recurrence but without evidence of malignant transformation. We used immunohistochemistry to assess myoepithelial and mesenchymal epithelial components.</p><p id="Par4934"><bold>Results:</bold> The five tumours studied presented a canalicular pattern with patent lights lined by cuboidal or columnar cells and surrounded by fusiform elements sometimes of clear cells. These cells expressed p63, GFAP, s100, and actin myoepithelial markers while the luminal cells were positive for keratins 5/6, 7 and 34βE12. In all cases Ki67 was expressed below 10% and in all, the myoepithelial component was superior to the epithelial. The mesenchymal component did not exceed one third of the tumour volume. None of the cases presented an absence of myoepithelial component, unlike many salivary tumours.</p><p id="Par4935"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although lacrimal pleomorphic adenomas reproduce the same patterns and elements as salivary, the proportion of myoepithelial component is more abundant and resembles biphasic patterns of epi-myoepithelial carcinoma, so a denomination epimioepithelial adenoma would be representative of its more usual features.</p><p id="Par4936"><bold>PS-16-002</bold></p><p id="Par4937"><bold>Prognostic role of immunoexpression of autophagy-related proteins in uveal melanoma</bold></p><p id="Par4938"><underline>G.

To understand the differences in cellular signalling in primary NMIBCs and their recurrences with/without progression, we studied the expression of molecules on tissue microarrays (TMA).</p><p id="Par5120"><bold>Methods:</bold> TMA of 106 NMIBCs (53 primary/53 recurrence) were constructed. Immunohistochemistry was performed for oncogenic (p53, p21/WAF1/Cip1), growth-factor signalling (Her2/neu), EMT (E-cadherin, Beta-catenin, vimentin), apoptosis (p53), cell proliferation (Ki-67, IMP3), angiogenesis (VEGF, VEGFR1), cell motility (MMP9) and immune tolerance (PDL1) pathways. Immunostaining was analysed by the semi-quantitative H-score (Histo-score, range 0-300) and differences in expression levels by the paired sample t-test.</p><p id="Par5121"><bold>Results:</bold> The mean time to recurrence was 30.3 months (range 3-109). p21 loss was defined as &lt;10% nuclear expression and PDL1 positive when &gt;5% cells showed membranous expression. Recurrent tumours showed higher p53, Ki-67, Her2/neu, PDL1, vimentin expression and p21 loss. 32 of 53 (60%) primary tumours showed progression in stage/grade/both at recurrence. Progressive tumours showed higher Ki-67 proliferation and expression of Her2, IMP3 and MMP9 and lower p21, beta-catenin, E-cadherin and VEGFR1 as compared to non-progressive tumours. Higher Ki-67 proliferation index and lower surface beta-catenin expression correlated with shorter time to progression. Two primary and four recurrent tumours were PDL1 positive.

LOT is diagnosed under several terminologies and poses a diagnostic challenge due to a lack of defined criteria, thus hindering definitive clinical decisions.</p><p id="Par5129"><bold>Methods:</bold> Institutional electronic database was searched between 2005 – 2020. It included all nephrectomies, partial resections, and biopsies performed during this period. A total of 7459 adult primary renal neoplasms were identified, and only tumours with characteristic LOT features were selected for the study. Age, gender, procedure type, surgery date, tumour stage, immunoprofile, and follow up data were recorded.</p><p id="Par5130"><bold>Results:</bold> 19 LOTs with CK7+/CD117- expression were identified. The median age was 67 years (range 47 - 84), and male/female ratio was 10/9. The median size was 4 cm (range 1.5 - 9.5 cm). All cases were confined except one with renal sinus invasion (pT3a).

Recent data suggest that several distinct entities may exist within this group. LOT may particularly be confused with oncocytoma or eosinophilic chromophobe renal cell carcinoma. Strict morphologic criteria including eosinophilic oncocytoma-like morphology, solid growth with occasional archipelago-like tumour clusters with edematous stroma, diffuse CK7 expression with negative CD117 are mandated.

ETT were identified based on their morphological features. Since most testicular ETT are associated with postchemotherapy and mixed germ cell tumours (MGCT); their differences and similarities to female tumours were recorded.

This study aims to compare bladder cancer grading between glass slide and digital reporting.</p><p id="Par5245"><bold>Methods:</bold> 48 consecutive transurethral bladder resections of non-invasive papillary urothelial carcinomas were graded by three specialist uropathologists - initially on a digital screen, followed by glass slide after a two-week washout period. Both WHO 2004 and 1973 systems were compared using linear weighted Cohen’s and Fleiss’ kappa.</p><p id="Par5246"><bold>Results:</bold> Agreement between all three pathologists on glass was 0.56 (2004) and 0.49 (1973), whereas on digital was 0.61 (2004) and 0.44 (1973). Comparing individual digital vs. glass, agreement for pathologist A was 0.74 (2004) and 0.70 (1973), pathologist B 0.82 (2004) and 0.77 (1973), and pathologist C 0.53 (2004) and 0.77 (1973).

We have evaluated the correlation and concordance between the two more used available assays.</p><p id="Par5279"><bold>Methods:</bold> Whole-slide sections from 23 PSCC (8 HPV related and 15 non-HPV related) were immunostained for PD-L1 using Ventana SP263 and Agilent 22C3 assays. PD-L1 expression was assessed estimating the percentage of positive tumour cells (TCs) of the total number of TCs.

We examined associations between hypertension and cancer incidence in the kidney and urinary tract in a cohort of UK women.</p><p id="Par5303"><bold>Methods:</bold> At recruitment in 1996-2001, participants completed a questionnaire on lifestyle and health factors, including hypertension requiring treatment. They were followed for cancer and death via record linkage to national registries. We used Cox regression models to estimate relative risks (RRs) of cancers of the kidney and urinary tract, associated with self-reported hypertension requiring treatment at recruitment, adjusted for potential confounders.</p><p id="Par5304"><bold>Results:</bold> In 1,319,718 women without previous cancer, 211,663 (16%) reported at recruitment that they were currently being treated for hypertension. After 16.9 years’ (SD 4.6) mean follow-up, 5391 kidney cancers, including 4248 renal cell carcinomas and 442 urothelial carcinomas, accrued. Hypertension requiring treatment at recruitment was associated with a significantly greater increase in the risk of renal cell carcinomas (RR=1.69, 95% CI: 1.57-1.82) than urothelial carcinomas of the kidney (RR=1.27, 95% CI: 1.00-1.62); heterogeneity by histotype, p=0.02. There were no clear associations between hypertension at recruitment and the risk of urothelial carcinomas elsewhere in the urinary tract (ureter: n=249, RR=0.82, 95% CI: 0.57-1.17; bladder: n=2929, RR=1.00, 95% CI: 0.91-1.11).</p><p id="Par5305"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Hypertension is strongly associated with an increased risk of kidney cancer, with significant heterogeneity by histotype. The risk of renal cell carcinoma is substantially increased in those with a history of hypertension, but there is little or no association with urothelial carcinomas, either in the kidney or the rest of the urinary tract.

Overall CK19 expression ranged from 0 to 100% across samples (Median = 60%, IQR 5%-95%). All Gleason patterns analysed showed great variability in the percentage of cells stained. IQR were 10-100% for Gleason 3, 3-98% for Gleason 4-ill-defined glands, 5-80% for Gleason 4-cribriform pattern and 25-100% for Gleason 5.

However, CK14 expression and its significance in non-muscle-invasive upper tract urothelial carcinoma (NMIUTUC) remain unknown. We investigated the prognostic and transcriptional characteristics associated with CK14 expression in papillary NMIUTUC.</p><p id="Par5372"><bold>Methods:</bold> Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for CK14 was conducted in 204 papillary NMIUTUC specimens. CK14 positivity was defined as a positive signal in &gt;0% of tumour cells. RNA sequencing data were analysed from 8 papillary high-grade NMIUTUC fresh-frozen specimens consisting of 4 CK14-positive and 4 CK14-negative tumours.</p><p id="Par5373"><bold>Results:</bold> CK14 positivity was significantly associated with poor progression-free survival (p = 0.015). Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that the CK14-positive tumours had characteristics reminiscent of the BASQ subtype. In addition, differentially expressed genes between CK14-positive and CK14-negative tumours enriched in positive regulation of cellular proliferation in CK14-positive tumours. Consistent with this, the mean Ki-67 proliferative index was higher in CK14-positive tumours than it was in CK14-negative tumours (p = 0.002).</p><p id="Par5374"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> CK14-positive papillary NMIUTUC is an aggressive subtype with BASQ-like molecular characteristics and dynamic proliferative activity. We propose that CK14 IHC staining can be a useful biomarker of BASQ-type papillary NMIUTUC that can be applied in daily practice with the aim of precision oncology.</p><p id="Par5375">This was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education (grant number 2018R1D1A1B07045763).</p><p id="Par5376"><bold>PS-18-034</bold></p><p id="Par5377"><bold>Morphological characteristics and immunophenotype of renal cell carcinomas with light cytoplasm</bold></p><p id="Par5378"><underline>E.

Cases of high grade G2/G3 infiltrating urothelial carcinomas showed higher PD-L1 score results for clone 22C3 than SP142 (41.5%&gt;36.6% and 64.7%&gt;58.6%, respectively).</p><p id="Par5478">Concordance of both PD-L1 expression status was present in 57/60 cases (95%). CD8 T-cells density did not correlate with PD-L1 expression. Urothelial carcinomas of higher grade were more frequently associated with high density intraepithelial T lymphocytes (G2:24.4% and G3:47.1%). Squamous cell carcinoma showed expression for both PD-L1 clones, in one case.</p><p id="Par5479"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The correct assessment for PD-L1 expression is essential for immunotherapy decision, improving the outcomes of patients. Higher grade was associated with higher PD-L1 expression and high density of intraepithelial T lymphocytes. We observed high concordance between both PD-L1 clones used.</p><p id="Par5480"><bold>PS-18-049</bold></p><p id="Par5481"><bold>Characteristics of metastatic renal cell carcinomas, observed in a 5-year period</bold></p><p id="Par5482"><underline>B.R.

We also wanted to evaluate the ratio between primary RCC and metastatic RCC cases.</p><p id="Par5485"><bold>Methods:</bold> From the database of our pathology department, we evaluated all the cases diagnosed as renal cell carcinomas from 2015 to 2019, selecting the metastatic RCC tumours.</p><p id="Par5486"><bold>Results:</bold> We included in this study 32 cases of secondary RCC (6 women and 26 men). The median age at diagnosis was 62.6 years for females, and 63.8 years for males. Anatomical sites involved: brain (40.6 %), bones (21.8 %), skin (6.25%), periosseous soft tissue (6.25%), distant lymph nodes - axillary and supraclavicular (6.25%), duodenum, ovary and adrenal gland (3.12 % each); a case presented subcutaneous and peritoneal involvement. Histologic types: clear cell (90.6%) and chromophobe (3.12%); the histologic type could not be specified in 6.25% of the metastasis. In 46.8 % of the cases, the secondary tumour was diagnosed prior to the renal neoplasm. The primary RCC/metastatic RCC ratio was 9.4.</p><p id="Par5487"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The brain was the main organ involved, the overwhelming majority of the cases being clear cell RCC. An effective screening tool for RCC is needed to detect renal neoplasms in early stages, for a better therapeutic management of the patients.</p><p id="Par5488"><bold>PS-18-050</bold></p><p id="Par5489"><bold>Immune profiling of prostate cancer using multiplex immunofluorescence and gene expression panels</bold></p><p id="Par5490"><underline>C.

The aim of this study was to investigate the in-situ phenotype of tumour infiltrating immune cells in order to determine whether they correlate with metastasis to regional lymph nodes.</p><p id="Par5493"><bold>Methods:</bold> We applied multiplex immunofluorescence to characterise the immune microenvironment of tissue samples obtained from radical prostatectomy. Patients with pathologically confirmed regional lymph node metastases were matched with patients without nodal metastases. The identified immune signature of nodal metastasis was validated in a comparable independent patient cohort. The functional orientation of immune cells was explored using a targeted gene expression panel.</p><p id="Par5494"><bold>Results:</bold> Patients with nodal metastasis had significantly decreased stromal effector CD4 cells (p=0.0003). This CD4 immune cell density was a significant predictor of lymph node spread in multivariate analysis. An independent cohort of 184 patients was also stained with the same panels and the CD4 cell density remained a predictor of nodal spread. The targeted gene expression analysis revealed increased extracellular matrix components expressed within primary prostate cancers with nodal spread.</p><p id="Par5495"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Together, these findings suggest differences in the immune infiltrate (particularly CD4 effector T cells) between prostate cancer patients with vs without lymph node metastasis. This suggests that prospective clinical studies could test its value in the diagnostic setting in order to improve patient stratification for regional lymph node dissection. Also, gene expression analysis suggested increased extracellular matrix components in tumours with nodal spread and although this requires further mechanistic exploration it highlights the potential for stroma-modifying treatments in those patients.</p><p id="Par5496">Funding: CRUK</p><p id="Par5497"><bold>PS-18-051</bold></p><p id="Par5498"><bold>Histomorphological characteristics and distribution of prostate carcinoma foci using multiple site-specific labelled core biopsies</bold></p><p id="Par5499"><underline>O.

This study analysed the Histomorphology, spatial distribution and prognostic implications of site-specific core biopsies of the prostate gland.</p><p id="Par5502"><bold>Methods:</bold> Double-sextant prostate biopsy cores were microscopically examined prospectively over an 18-month period representing the medial and lateral aspects of the left and right apices, mid-gland and bases of the glands. These were obtained by transrectal ultrasound guidance. H&amp;E-stained slides were examined for the presence, volume, Gleason score and ISUP grade-group of cancer. Frequency statistics was utilized to evaluate the data.</p><p id="Par5503"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 91 patients aged 48 to 88 years with a median age of 70 years were seen. Entire sextant regions showed cancer in 68.1% of cases whilst cancer was restricted to one sextant region in 8.8% and to two regions in 7.7% of cases. The apical, mid-gland and basal regions were positive for cancer in 35.6%, 33.8%, and 30.6% of the time respectively. Tumour was restricted to apices and mid-gland in 9.9% of the cases whilst it was restricted to bases in 2.2% of the cases. ISUP grade group 5 was most frequently seen with grade group 2 least frequent. Carcinoma volume was lowest in basally located cancers.</p><p id="Par5504"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Prostatic carcinomas in this environment have poor prognostic indicators of poor differentiation and high tumour volume and multifocal occurrence of tumours.

PD-L1 expression on tumour cells and tumour associated immune cells were categorized as Negative/Low and High expression. DNA MMR protein expression were classified as “reduced (≤30%)” and “preserved(&gt;30%)”. Microsatellite analysis was performed by PCR using 5 mononucleotide markers.</p><p id="Par5611"><bold>Results:</bold> PD-L1 expression did not show any difference between neither the pre- and post-treatment biopsies in the BCG refractory group, nor the BCG refractory and the BCG responsive groups. Most of the carcinomas (70.8%) with reduced expression of DNA MMR proteins were in the BCG responsive group (p=0.022). All the carcinomas were microsatellite stable (MSS).</p><p id="Par5612"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Immune escape mechanism by PD-1/PD-L1 interaction seems to have no role on BCG failure of urothelial carcinomas. It can be suggested that reduced DNA MMR protein expression may lead to predict cases that will respond to BCG therapy, but this should be supported by larger case series. Finally, according to our results the presence of immunexpressions of DNA MMR proteins, even focal, seems to be enough to determine MSS cases.</p><p id="Par5613">Funding: The Scientific And Technological Research Council Of Turkey (TUBITAK) and Scientific Research Projects Coordinator of Ankara University.</p><p id="Par5614"><bold>PS-18-063</bold></p><p id="Par5615"><bold>Inter-observer variability in Gleason grading of prostate cancer biopsies</bold></p><p id="Par5616"><underline>E.

The aim is to determine inter-observer variability in the reporting of Gleason scoring in tissue biopsies.</p><p id="Par5619"><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 30 cases reported at the Royal Oldham Hospital were reviewed by three local pathologists with a special interest in urological pathology and the results also compared with a central Specialist Urology MDT (SMDT) review to ascertain the degree of agreement in Gleason scoring and the Grade Group.</p><p id="Par5620"><bold>Results:</bold> Within the 3 local pathologists, there was complete agreement for Gleason pattern in 15 cases (50%). These were most with 3+3 (10 cases), 3+4 (1 case), 4+4 (3 cases) and 4+5 (1 case). Including the SMDT opinion, the complete agreement with regard to Gleason pattern drops from 50% to 30% (9 cases). With regard to Grade Group, exact agreement within the 3 local pathologists was 63% (19 cases) and when the SMDT opinion included, this drops to 43% (13 cases).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the aetiology of granulomatous prostatitis and its association with prostate adenocarcinoma.</p><p id="Par5627"><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective analysis of 3250 prostatic specimens received in the pathology department was done over a period of 16 years (2004 to 2020). We identified 15 cases of granulomatous prostatitis (GP) diagnosed in our hospital. Clinical data were collected retrospectively from the medical records and the histological slides were reviewed.

The incidence of GP was very low (0.46%). Histological examination showed poorly formed granulomas with negative stains for microbiological agents. Two patients had a previous history of BCG treatment because of the papillary urothelial cell carcinomas (2/15). None of the patients had previous transurethral prostate resection or systemic granulomatous disease. Six patients (6/15; 40%) had a concurrent prostate adenocarcinoma.

We aim to study CD36 expression in urothelial bladder carcinoma (UBC) devoid of distant metastases and explore its correlation with tumour stage and progression-free survival, among others.</p><p id="Par5635"><bold>Methods:</bold> Eight tissue microarrays containing samples from 208 cystectomy specimens were studied. No neoadjuvant therapy had been administered to patients. CD36 immunostaining (HPA2018, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:100) was performed and the percentage of neoplastic cells with positive membrane and cytoplasmic expression was assessed. Cases showing CD36 immunoreactivity in at least 1% of neoplastic cells were considered to be CD36-positive.</p><p id="Par5636"><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty cases (15.3%) were immunoreactive for CD36. Positive cases showed higher pT stage (pT3b-pT4) than negative ones (pT1-pT3a) (p=0.007). In addition, the median 12-month progression-free survival was shorter (6.505 months) in the CD36-positive group than in the negative group (8.44 months) (p=0.034). Although tumours with regional lymph node metastases tended to be CD36-immunoreactive (66% of them were CD36-positive), the trend did not reach statistical significance.</p><p id="Par5637"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results indicate that CD36 expression could constitute a negative prognostic factor in UBC, similarly to what has been described in other tumour types such as melanoma and lung, ovary and breast carcinomas. Further studies, with more cases and different clinical scenarios, are needed to evaluate CD36 as an independent prognostic factor, its relation to the metastatic process, and its possible role as a predictive factor of chemotherapy in UBC.</p><p id="Par5638"><bold>PS-18-067</bold></p><p id="Par5639"><bold>Incidence of involvement of pre-prostatic fat samples in robotic prostatectomy specimens</bold></p><p id="Par5640"><underline>G.

Later, we performed CD10 and CAIX staining.</p><p id="Par5661"><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 677 cases of renal carcinomas, 13 showed ST with or without RT and 5 exclusively presented RT. Prevalence was 2%. Percentage of ST ranged between 5% and 100% (mean: 43.92%), and RT ranged between 0% and 85%. RCC subtype most frequently associated with was clear cell RCC (8 /13).

Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) as a trigger and predisposing factor for VA. We aim to provide detailed topography and quantification of general, sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiac innervation in the normal heart.</p><p id="Par5825"><bold>Methods:</bold> Panel reviewed normal heart control cases had a non-cardiac cause of death. From ten cases, six sections of right ventricle and three of left ventricle were stained with PGP9.5, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and the choline transporter (CT).

These extend into the myocardium associated with blood vessels arborizing and becoming fibres and fibrils extending between and lying in close contact to myocytes. Very thin fibrils are seen in the subendocardium. No ganglia are seen in the myocardium.TH is predominantly distributed in the epicardial nerve fibres whereas CT is predominantly distributed in the small fibrils within the myocardium.

Here we suggest the Milan System as a helpful tool.</p><p id="Par5859"><bold>Methods:</bold> To overcome some of these difficulties the Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology (MSRSGC) was created to provide more standardized reporting and, mostly, a new category of Risk of Malignancy (ROM). ROM can guide cytological diagnosis, avoid medico-legal challenges of false positive/negative results, improve patient management. The MSRSGC is being successfully tested in several countries including the UK.</p><p id="Par5860"><bold>Results:</bold> Preliminary observations at the Royal Surrey Hospital -UK indicate: the introduction of ROM in cytopathology reports is clinically relevant to a) help cyto-pathologists to group salivary glands lesions into clinically meaningful categories, b) useful guide for treating clinicians to decide if further management according to the ROM category is required, c) meet turn-around time targets set for cancer treatment d)promote discussion of cytology reports in multidisciplinary Team (MDT) meetings.</p><p id="Par5861"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The Milan System for Reporting Salivary Gland Cytopathology in the UK is a helpful tool in routine reporting of FNA specimens from salivary glands. A group of histo- and cyto-pathologists has been created to widen knowledge of MSRSGC &amp; to implement application in routine practice in the UK. Given the shortage of cytopathologists in the UK MSRSGC can provide clinical guidance even in cytopathologists' absence at MDTs. Further work is recommended to create awareness of the MSRSGC in the NHS.</p><p id="Par5862"><bold>PS-20-006</bold></p><p id="Par5863"><bold>Diagnostic value of fine-needle cervical lymph nodes cytology and needle washout thyroglobulin measurement for preoperative diagnosis and staging of papillary thyroid carcinoma</bold></p><p id="Par5864">I.

Urine cytology has low sensitivity for detecting low-grade urothelial neoplasms. Our objective is to evaluate the results of a new biomarker (CellDetect®) that promise improvement of diagnostic sensitivity.</p><p id="Par5875"><bold>Methods:</bold> Voided urine was collected from 78 patients undergoing follow-up for urothelial carcinoma or presented haematuria. Each sample was processed by ThinPrep® into two smears, one stained with Papanicolaou method and the other with CellDetect® technique. Results were compared with cystoscopy reports and patients' history.</p><p id="Par5876"><bold>Results:</bold> The Papanicolaou slides were classified according to the Paris reporting system. 78 were enrolled in the study. 26 were negative, 22 low grade urothelial neoplasms (LGUN), 10 high grade urothelial carcinoma (HGUC) and 20 atypical.</p><p id="Par5877">Interpretation of CellDetect® results is based on the combination of cell colour and morphology.

The aim of the study was to review our experience with atypical breast cytology samples (C3 according to NCI criteria) and to correlate them with subsequent histological examination and/or radiological follow-up.</p><p id="Par5884"><bold>Methods:</bold> A total of 3504 breast cytology samples comprising fine needle aspiration biopsies and discharge smears were analysed in the year 2016. Among them, 270 cases (7.7%) were reported as atypical (C3). Follow-up was available for 173 cases (64%).</p><p id="Par5885"><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 173 cases with atypical cytology, subsequent histological examination was performed in 65 cases (37.6%), while the radiological follow-up only was provided in 108 cases (62,4%). None of the cases with radiological follow-up only was suspicious for malignancy. Histological examination was negative for malignancy in 44 cases (67.7%), and malignant in 21 cases (32,3%) .

Our aim was to assess accuracy of LBC in the diagnosis of SGLs.</p><p id="Par5901"><bold>Methods:</bold> FNA was performed freehand or under ultrasound guidance (USG), collected into PreservCyt and Papanicolou-stained ThinPrep slide prepared. Specimens were classified as non-diagnostic or diagnostic (subclassified as specific or indeterminate - descriptive or differential diagnosis). Compared to histology, they were classified as non-concordant or concordant (subclassified as complete - correct specific diagnosis, or satisfactory - correctly classified as benign or malignant).</p><p id="Par5902"><bold>Results:</bold> Over 3 years, 84 FNAs were received with 45 (53.6%) diagnostic and 39 (46.4%) non-diagnostic. The percentage of non-diagnostic specimens is slightly higher than that reported in the limited literature (up to 40%). Using freehand sampling, 50.9% were non-diagnostic, while 38.7% of USG specimens were non-diagnostic. The specific diagnosis with USG FNAs was 41.9%, more than double that of freehand (18.9%).</p><p id="Par5903">18/27 lesions which underwent a histological assessment had an initial FNA classified as diagnostic. 17/18 (94.4%) were concordant, with 6/18 complete and 11/18 satisfactory.

This interaction potently inhibits immune responses against cancer. However, the expression of these two markers has never been studied in colorectal cancer (CRC) simultaneously.</p><p id="Par5967"><bold>Methods:</bold> We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of CD73 and A2AR in tumour cells and stromal lymphocytes in tissue microarrays collecting tumour and adjacent non-tumour tissue specimens of 103 patients with CRC.

Gallbladder pancreatic heterotopia can be either an incidental finding or diagnosed in association with cholecystitis.</p><p id="Par5984"><bold>Methods:</bold> We report three cases of heterotopic pancreatic tissue in the gallbladder. One patient was a 24-year old male who presented with acute pancreatitis symptoms and an ultrasonographic mass in the gallbladder which proved to be heterotopic pancreatic tissue. The other two cases were female patients aged 24 and 32 respectively incidentally diagnosed on histopathological examination.</p><p id="Par5985"><bold>Results:</bold> A 24-year old man presented to the hospital with a intense upper abdominal pain radiating to the back. Ultrasonography revealed a mass initially believed to be an enlarged Mascagni lymph node and therefore laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed. After the surgical removal, the tissue fragments were sent for processing and examination to our Department of Pathology. Gross examination revealed a white-yellowish pseudo tumoral mass, slightly lobulated. Microscopic examination showed a well-circumscribed fully developed heterotopic pancreatic tissue in the muscularis layer and extending to the subserosal adipose connective tissue. The findings were consistent with type 1 pancreatic heterotopia according to the Hindrich classification. In the other two patients, ectopic pancreatic tissue was incidentally discovered.</p><p id="Par5986"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Despite being a exceptional encounter, gallbladder pancreatic heterotopia should be considered as a potential diagnosis in cases of cholecystitis and as an explanation for unusual ultrasonographic findings. In any case, the definitive diagnosis is only by histopathological examination.</p><p id="Par5987"><bold>PS-21-005</bold></p><p id="Par5988"><bold>Gallbladders – a “grumble” for patients and pathology departments – a model for potential savings?</bold></p><p id="Par5989"><underline>I.

Over 60,000 UK patients undergo cholecystectomies/year. We determined diagnostic yield and processing costs based on block numbers per gallbladder. We propose resource savings through reduction in block numbers.</p><p id="Par5992"><bold>Methods:</bold> Numbers of gallbladders and block numbers were determined for the years 2012-19 from the pathology database of Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde NHS trust with SNOMED codes for chronic inflammation, dysplasia and adenocarcinoma for disease patterns. Workload and cost details were determined for a 12-month period in 2017/18. Complex resections and referrals were excluded.</p><p id="Par5993"><bold>Results:</bold> Annual gallbladder block numbers varied between 5555 and 7694 with requests static at approximately 2200 per annum. Mean number of blocks per gallbladder was 2.2. Approximately 72.5% of gallbladders show chronic inflammation. Significant pathology, including dysplasia (0.2%) and adenocarcinoma (0.1%) are rare. Processing costs for one block approximate £8.84, two blocks £11.29. Reducing the number of tissue blocks processed by one would save ~ £5000 per annum.</p><p id="Par5994"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Reduction in the number of tissue blocks may improve turnaround times and reduce block storage costs. There is little good evidence for the cost-effectiveness of different tissue sampling strategies in Histopathology.

The present study aimed to clarify the relationship among clinicopathological and molecular features of gastric PDAs.</p><p id="Par6013"><bold>Methods:</bold> We randomly collected 154 PDAs (75 solid-type PDAs, 52 nonsolid-type PDAs, and 27 SRCC) from 154 patients. According to the method by Gonzalez et al., PDAs were classified into 4 groups using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization: EBV-associated GCs (EBV), microsatellite-unstable GCs (MSI), chromosomal-unstable GCs (CIN), and genomically stable GCs (GS). These clinicopathological variables were analysed statistically.</p><p id="Par6014"><bold>Results:</bold> Solid-type PDA showed significantly higher proportion (44%) of MSI in comparison with those (4% and 7%) of non-solid-type PDA and SRCC, respectively. Although most of non-solid type PDA and SRCC showed CIN and GS, proportion (85%) of GS in SRCC was significantly higher than that (48%) in non-solid-type PDA. In addition, SRCC preferred to occur in the middle third (70%) whereas non-solid type PDA developed in both middle third (35%) and lower third (35%).</p><p id="Par6015"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These results suggest that solid-type PDA is different tumour from non-solid type PDA and SRCC.

Mesna is a drug used in surgical field to facilitate tissue dissection. The aim of this experimental animal study was to investigate the effect of mesna on prevention of intraabdominal adhesion in rats.</p><p id="Par6022"><bold>Methods:</bold> 28 Wistar albino rats were used in the study. Cecum was abraded to create abdominal adhesion. No surgeries were performed other than adhesion in Group 1. 0.9% saline administered to Group 2, 40 mg/kg mesna for Group 3 and 400 mg/kg mesna for Group 4. Rats were sacrificed on postoperative 21st day.

TMAs included four samples of central and infiltrative areas of each patient and were automatically stained for PDL-1 (SP142) and MMR proteins (MLH1/PMS2, MSH2/MSH6). PDL-1 expression was assessed in the tumour- stroma interface.</p><p id="Par6039"><bold>Results:</bold> Prevalence of deficit MMR proteins was (12.5%) and (20.1%) for PDL-1. The latter was significantly more expressed in deficient MMR tumours (p&lt;0.001), right-sided localization and providing a better relapse-free survival p(log-rank) = 0.012. Additionally, the lack of PDL-1 presented a HR (95% CI) of 2.15 (0.91, 5.04) consistent with previous results.

We also assayed for the presence of mutations in a Next Generation Sequencing panel of known cancer-associated genes. Finally, we present a review of the literature of ACC of the oesophagus.</p><p id="Par6057"><bold>Results:</bold> Our case of oesophageal ACC does not possess the MYB-NFIB fusion gene; however, sequencing of a panel of cancer genes revealed the presence of a mutation in TP53 (c.737T&gt;G; M246R), which is a common mutation in salivary gland ACC.

LNR was categorized into 5 groups for survival analysis: score 0 (0%), 1 (&gt;0%-&lt;25%), 2 (25%-&lt;50%), 3 (50%-&lt;75%) and 4 (≥75%).</p><p id="Par6097"><bold>Results:</bold> 68% of patients were N+ (mean LNR:0.22). N-stage and LNR were significantly associated with vascular invasion, perineural infiltration, recurrences, and tumour death. Overall survival Kaplan-Meier curves depending on LNR showed good stratification, and three risk groups could be differentiated (scores 0+1,2+3, 4). N-stage curves were more overlapped and showed an inconsistent better survival for N2 patients in the first months. In cases with ≥15 LN resected, LNR showed an excellent stratification into 5 groups. N stage curves improved, but still showed overlapping. In cases with &lt;15 LN resected, LNR curves were non-informative (p=0.692). Regarding disease-free survival, both LNR and N-stage showed good stratification but LNR curves were more evenly spaced.</p><p id="Par6098"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> LNR seems to stratify patients better than N-stage for GC recurrence and survival. LNR could be used as an adjunct to the traditional TNM classification. Unlike some previous studies, we have found that the retrieval of less than 15 LN could affect LNR prognostic significance, and LNR may not be used as an alternative to N-staging in this context. More studies are needed to confirm LNR prognostic role in GC.</p><p id="Par6099"><bold>PS-21-020</bold></p><p id="Par6100"><bold>Prognostic role of TBK1 expression in resected gastric cancer</bold></p><p id="Par6101"><underline>C.

Fernández Aceñero</p><p id="Par6102">*Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain</p><p id="Par6103"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) belongs to the non-canonical nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-KB) pathway. It is involved in cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, immune response, and autophagy. However, its role as oncogene or tumour suppressor depending on tumour origin is unclear.</p><p id="Par6104"><bold>Methods:</bold> Our aim is to evaluate the prognostic role of TBK1 immunohistochemical (IHC) expression in gastric cancer (GC). Retrospective study of 77 cases of GC surgically resected in a tertiary hospital (Spain). Tissue microarrays were constructed, TBK1 IHC expression was assessed and statistical analysis were performed.</p><p id="Par6105"><bold>Results:</bold> Most patients were T3 stage (61.6%) and N+ (77.5%). 50.7% of patients recurred and 36.2% died due to GC. TBK1 was positive in 64.4% of cases. TBK1 expression was associated with tumour desmoplasia and systemic symptoms, and inversely correlated to tumour stage. The association with Laurén subtype and tumour stage tended to significance. Disease-free survival curves successfully stratified patients into two significant risk groups, according to TBK1 expression (p=0.006). Survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves tended to significance (p=0.065). Patients with negative TBK1 tumours showed poorer prognosis than TBK1-positive patients. Multivariate analysis showed that TBK1 expression was independently associated with tumour recurrence.</p><p id="Par6106"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although nearly all previous studies recognize TBK1 as an oncogene, our results support the study published by Lee et al., in which TBK1 expression in GC was associated with better prognosis. Careful should be taken when extrapolating TBK1 prognostic role to other tumour types. Further research in larger sample sizes is needed to clarify the prognostic impact of TBK1 in different stages of GC.</p><p id="Par6107"><bold>PS-21-021</bold></p><p id="Par6108"><bold>Prognostic role of YAP and P53 expression in gastric cancer</bold></p><p id="Par6109"><underline>C.

Fernández Aceñero</p><p id="Par6110">*Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain</p><p id="Par6111"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Yes-associated protein (YAP) is the nuclear effector of the Hippo-signalling pathway, which regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis. YAP overexpression has been identified in many cancers, but its role as oncogene or tumour suppressor gene is controversial.</p><p id="Par6112"><bold>Methods:</bold> Our aim is to investigate the clinical significance of YAP immunohistochemical (IHC) expression in gastric cancer (GC), and its relationship with p53 IHC expression. Retrospective study of 206 cases of GC surgically resected in a tertiary hospital (Spain, 2000-2017). Clinicopathological features were collected and tissue microarrays were constructed. YAP and p53 IHC expression were assessed and statistical analysis were performed.</p><p id="Par6113"><bold>Results:</bold> Both high YAP expression and complete loss of YAP expression were considered abnormal YAP staining. 83.4% and 16.6% of cases showed abnormal and “wild-type” YAP staining, respectively. Abnormal YAP staining was significantly correlated with lymphovascular invasion and tumour death. Stratification by YAP expression was significantly associated with overall survival. Multivariate analysis identified YAP expression as an independent prognostic factor. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted, and patients with “wild-type” YAP expression showed significantly better survival rates. We further classified our patients into three groups: YAPabnormal+p53high, YAPabnormal+p53”not high” and YAPwild-type. This classification was also significantly and independently related to patient survival, and Kaplan Meier curves showed three groups with significantly different survival rates.</p><p id="Par6114"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Abnormal YAP expression may be associated with GC prognosis, and p53 accumulation could enhance its prognostic impact. More studies are needed to clarify the role of YAP expression, its interaction with p53, and its effect on chemotherapy and immunotherapy.</p><p id="Par6115"><bold>PS-21-022</bold></p><p id="Par6116"><bold>Differential expression of cytokine-coding genes BMP8B, LEFTY1 and INSL5 in ulcerative colitis and crohn’s disease</bold></p><p id="Par6117"><underline>Z.

However, its extensive correlation with genomic features is still missing. Here, we sought to perform genotype-phenotype correlations in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data.</p><p id="Par6129"><bold>Methods:</bold> TB was evaluated and graded on the digital H&amp;Es slides of CRC from TCGA (n=631) according to the guideline by two pathologists. TB defined as single cells or small clusters (&lt;5 cells) at the peritumoral invasive front (pTB) and within the main tumour body (iTB). Association with molecular features was performed from the TCGA matched data.</p><p id="Par6130"><bold>Results:</bold> In the preliminary analysis reported here %34 (217/631) of TCGA colorectal carcinoma samples’ H&amp;E slides were evaluated. The level of agreement between observers was very high. We found high correlation between grade 1 pTP and low grade pTP. Higher grade of tumour buds, both iTB and pTB, were found significantly correlated with metastatic disease (p&lt;0.01, both). High pTB and iTB showed significant correlation with microsatellite stable (p&lt;0.05, p&lt;0.01, respectively) and cancer molecular subtype 4 mesenchymal type (p&lt;0.01, iTB)</p><p id="Par6131"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Tumour bud is a worse prognostic parameter on colorectal carcinoma with particular genomic signature which reflects its position on EMT. Additionally, intratumoral tumour buds convey similar prognostic and characteristic information from tumours and they are big candidates on treatment decisions by endoscopic biopsies in the future.</p><p id="Par6132"><bold>PS-21-024</bold></p><p id="Par6133"><bold>The feasibility of tissue microarray in immunohistochemical assessment of mismatch repair proteins in colorectal cancer – preliminary results</bold></p><p id="Par6134"><underline>S.

They can determine a variable clinical behaviour. In case of rupture, the mucin spreads to the adjacent peritoneum, leading to pseudomyxoma peritonei, associated with poor prognosis.</p><p id="Par6161"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present three cases of LAMN: an incidental finding in a 81-year-old female patient who underwent surgery for ascending colon cancer, a 32-year-old female patient who underwent caesarean section at 38 weeks and appendicectomy and a 78-year-old female patient with non-specific symptoms, who performed a CT scan that revealed an enlarged appendix, with fluid content and calcifications of the wall.</p><p id="Par6162"><bold>Results:</bold> On gross examination, the appendix was dilated in all cases, up to 4 cm in diameter, with abundant luminal mucin and smooth serosa. Microscopic examination revealed predominantly a flat proliferation of the mucinous epithelium, with focally villous/papillary pattern, mild atypia of the epithelium, marked atrophy of the lymphoid tissue, fibrosis of the appendiceal wall and calcifications. A pushing pattern of invasion was identified in one of the cases. The dysplastic epithelial cells were positive for CK20, CDX2 and MUC2.</p><p id="Par6163"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Frequently, LAMN are found incidentally. In one of our cases, the association between LAMN and ascending colon cancer raises the question if they might share the same mutation.

Media of Ki67 index resulted 2 times higher in HAMN as opposed to LAMN neoplasms (19.2%-LAMN; 33.66%-HAMN). Both pseudomyxoma peritonei cases were positive for HER2.</p><p id="Par6218"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> HER2 expression in appendiceal mucinous neoplasms exhibits low levels regardless of the tumour type. These findings indicate the need to initiate larger studies in order to search for patterns in the marker expression of this particular malignancy of the appendix.</p><p id="Par6219"><bold>PS-21-035</bold></p><p id="Par6220"><bold>Late stage diagnosis of oesophageal cancer - facts from a developing country</bold></p><p id="Par6221"><underline>N.

Most cases are initially diagnosed in either stage 3 or 4. Our study aimed to determine the frequency of Oesophageal Carcinoma in different ethnic groups of Karachi and to identify factors responsible for late stage diagnosis.</p><p id="Par6224"><bold>Methods:</bold> A multi-institutional prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at Oncology ward, JPMC &amp; AEMC Karachi. Non-probability convenient sampling technique was implemented. Chi square/Fisher Exact was applied to observe any association between ethnic groups, grade, stage and risk factors of delayed diagnosis.</p><p id="Par6225"><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 93 patients, Squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) was the most common (80.6%) type. Lower 1/3 was the most frequent site (53.8%). Sindhi ethnicity was most commonly effected (33.3%). Moderately differentiated grade was seen in good number of cases (67.7%). First visit to a general physician (GP) was within a month in 54.8% patients. A delayed referral was advised in 21.5% patients. Biopsy was delayed in 19.4% cases. Significant association was noted between late stage diagnosis &amp; factors including late referral (P 0.003), non-availability of laboratory (P 0.018), site of tumour (P 0.000), age of the patient and size of tumour (P 0.001).</p><p id="Par6226"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Initial diagnosis of most of the patients was made in late stage. Important contributing factors of late diagnosis were inadequate knowledge of patients, delayed initial investigations, poor socioeconomic status and late referrals to oncologist by GP.

Our aim was to investigate the involvement of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in serosal invasion by analysing the expression of the miR-200 family and their target genes in CC.</p><p id="Par6242"><bold>Methods:</bold> We analysed the expression of miR-200 family and their target genes CDKN1B, ONECUT2, PTPN13, RND3, SOX2, TGFB2 and ZEB2 using qPCR. Thirty-three cases of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue were included (20 CC without and 13 CC with serosal invasion). Microscopically normal colon mucosa from surgical margins was used as control.</p><p id="Par6243"><bold>Results:</bold> Association analysis showed a gradual increase of expression of ONECUT2 from normal mucosa to pT2/pT3 and pT4 CC (Rho=0.621, p=0.001). We observed statistically significant change in expression for miR-429 in CC pT2 (p=0.031), for ONECUT2 in CC pT3 (p=0.035) and ONECUT2 (p=0.006), ZEB2 (p=0.017) and SOX2 (p=0.025) in CC pT4a compared to normal mucosa. In addition, there was statistically significant difference in expression of PTPN13 (p=0.037) and ZEB2 (p=0.017) between CC without (pT2/pT3) and CC with serosal invasion (pT4a).</p><p id="Par6244"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results provide further evidence that EMT is involved in the progression of CC, including serosal invasion. Decreased PTPN13 expression in advanced CC suggests a potential tumour suppressor role of PTPN13, at least regarding serosal invasion.</p><p id="Par6245">This research was funded by Slovenian Research Agency, grant number J3-1754 and P3-0054.</p><p id="Par6246"><bold>PS-21-038</bold></p><p id="Par6247"><bold>Agreement in the assessment of depth of invasion in pT1 colorectal adenocarcinoma</bold></p><p id="Par6248"><underline>M.

The aim of this study was to determine the agreement between pathologists to assess this measurement.</p><p id="Par6251"><bold>Methods:</bold> Forty pT1 CRC cases previously diagnosed (20 pedunculated, 20 sessile) were selected. Three pathologists (one GI experienced pathologist, one general experienced pathologist and one non-experienced pathologist) evaluated the depth infiltration level by measuring it in millimetres. Haggitt level was also assessed in pedunculated polyps. Statistical analysis was performed to calculate paired and global interobserver agreement (SPSS version 24).</p><p id="Par6252"><bold>Results:</bold> Fair global agreement was found in sessile polyps (CCI=0,42) with excellent value between experts (CCI=0,99), and moderate in pedunculated ones (CCI=0,72). Nonetheless, poor global agreement was shown for Haggitt level (weighted kappa=0,11), improved by one paired observation (moderate agreement). Best concordance values were achieved by the 2 experienced observers.</p><p id="Par6253"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Interobserver agreement in the classification of level of invasion has shown consistency between experienced pathologists in our study, especially for sessile polyps. Measurement with Haggitt level has shown, however, significant limitations. The quantitative value of invasion as recommended, should be the method of choice to evaluate this risk factor.

Detailed clinicopathological review including age, sex, tumour location, histological type, lymph node status and management outcomes was undertaken.</p><p id="Par6260"><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-one cases of mixed tumours of the colon and rectum were identified in ages 32-87 years with majority in 7th-8th decade with male predominance-13 cases. Dominant right colon lesions-10, rectosigmoid-5, left colon-4 and rectum-2. Epithelial component was adenocarcinoma-20 and tubulovillous adenoma-1. Neuroendocrine component: low-grade-NET-G1 [5], G2 [4], high grade-NETG3 [2] and neuroendocrine carcinoma [NEC10]. Node positivity seen in 15 cases.

The aim of this study was to investigate the protein expression of RIPK3 and MLKL and its prognostic relevance in human colon cancer.</p><p id="Par6275"><bold>Methods:</bold> 375 primarily resected tumours were analysed. Cytoplasmic expression of tumoral RIPK3 and MLKL was determined by immunohistochemical staining of tissue micro arrays of formalin fixated paraffin embedded tissue. Level of protein expression was determined by calculation of immune reactive score (IRS). Expression levels were correlated with histopathological parameters (pT, pN, M, G) and overall survival (OS).</p><p id="Par6276"><bold>Results:</bold> High RIPK3 expression was detected in 25,4% (95/373) of the tumours. 64,9% (242/373) showed low expression and 9,7% (36/373) were negative. MLKL was highly expressed in 24% (90/375), 53,1% (199/375) showed low MLKL expression and 22,9% (86/375) were negative. Positive staining of RIPK3 was significantly associated with positive MLKL staining (p&lt;0.001). However, in 18% of the tumours (67/373) we observed the combination of positive RIPK3/negative MLKL and in 4,8% (18/373) negative RIPK3/positive MLKL. Positive RIPK3/negative MLKL expression pattern was significantly associated with peritoneal metastasis (p=0,009). High RIPK3 tended towards higher pN status (p=0,089). However, no significant association of RIPK3 and MLKL expression with pT, G and OS was found.</p><p id="Par6277"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our data does not provide evidence of RIPK3 and MLKL protein expression being independent prognostic factors for OS in human colon cancer. However, we identified cases with exclusive expression of either RIPK3 or MLKL (18% and 4,8% respectively) proposing two distinct biological sub-groups in colon cancer.

Biomarker expression has been quantified at the tumour core (TC) and invasive margin (in carcinomas) / neoplasia border (in adenomas) (IM/NB) as areal fraction with digital pathology software (Visiopharm).</p><p id="Par6353"><bold>Results:</bold> Expression of all biomarkers was strongly correlated in both regions but was significantly higher at the IM/NB compared to TC (except for anti-CD68 in adenomas). In more advanced pathological tumour stages T-cell expression and B-cell expression were decreasing, whereas CAF expression was increasing. CD68-positive macrophages were more prevalent compared to CD163-positive macrophages in carcinomas with no significant difference in adenomas. High expression of CD163-positive cells was associated with presence of BRAF mutation(s) and microsatellite instable tumours, whereas low macrophage expression was associated with microsatellite stable tumours. Moreover, high expression of T-cells was associated with microsatellite instable tumours and low expression group was associated with microsatellite stable tumours.</p><p id="Par6354"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study provides insight into relationship between TME and molecular/biological tumour profile.

Combined PASD/Alcian Blue stain was used for detection of goblet cells. Immunohistochemical evaluation was performed in cases with dysplasia, including immunostaining with MUC1, MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC6, CDX2 and villin.

This study aimed to assess the microvessel density (MVD) in CRC tissue microarrays (TMAs) and determined correlations with clinicopathological variables.</p><p id="Par6402"><bold>Methods:</bold> TMAs from 1000 consecutive cases (2008-2014) of CRC from a tertiary centre were immunostained with clinical grade CD34 antibody (1:500 dilution). Stained microvessels and core areas were annotated on digital images (Nanozoomer) and assessed (3D Histech). The MVD was adjudged in luminal, central and peripheral tumour cores as well as adjacent normal, and results correlated to clinicopathological variables (SPSS).</p><p id="Par6403"><bold>Results:</bold> Of 985 assessable cases, 490 had a high overall tumour MVD.

A higher overall and peripheral tumoral MVD was associated with lower T stage (p=0.04) and lower overall stage (p=0.02). Average tumour MVD (as well as peripheral and luminal specific MVD) correlated with a conspicuous peri-tumoral lymphocyte density (p&lt;0.0001). Higher tumour MVD also correlated with mismatch repair (MMR) proficient state (p&lt;0.001). The MVD in the adjacent normal neither correlated with the immune response nor with the MMR status.

Additionally, most of BRAF-mutant CCs probably derive from SSLs (so-called serrated neoplasia pathway: SNP). Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of SOX2 in SNP.</p><p id="Par6507"><bold>Methods:</bold> In order to clarify the association of SOX2 with SNP, we evaluated SOX2 expression profile in SNP and compared to that in traditional adenoma-carcinoma sequence. The expression of SOX2 was investigated by applying immunohistochemistry in SSL (n=50), SSL with cytological dysplasia (n=20), carcinoma in SSL (n=13), conventional adenoma (tubular and tubulovillous) (n=53) and carcinoma in adenoma (n=27).</p><p id="Par6508"><bold>Results:</bold> SOX2 was expressed with significantly higher frequency in SSL (54%, 27/50) than in adenoma (11.3%, 6/53) (p&lt;0.0001). SOX2 expression of the dysplasia part and the carcinoma part in SSL, and the carcinoma part in adenoma were 20% (4/20), 30.8% (4/13), and 14.8% (4/27), respectively. SOX2 expression rate was considerably higher in advanced stage of histology in SSL than that in adenoma, though the difference was not statistically significant.</p><p id="Par6509"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These results indicate that SOX2 may be associated with histogenesis, rather than carcinogenesis, of SSL. However, this may possibly be attributed to the present small-sized sample study.

Based on the histological features, it is divided into collagenous colitis (CC), lymphocytic colitis (LC) and incomplete microscopic colitis (MCi).</p><p id="Par6515"><bold>Methods:</bold> The histopathological parameters were evaluated in 53 microscopic colitis (37 CC, 7 LC, 9 MCi) diagnosed between 2012 and 2019. The presence of a broad subepithelial collagen band ≥10 μm in thickness and ≥20 intraepithelial lymphocytes(IELs)/100 enterocytes were considered diagnostic for CC and LC respectively. The presence of 5-10 μm in thickness or 5-20 IELs/100 enterocytes were evaluated as MCi.</p><p id="Par6516"><bold>Results:</bold> CC had female predominance (%70) with a mean age of 59 (22-87) while LC and MCi showed male predominance (%100,%78). The most distinct localization for CC and LC was right colon (%60,%77) while for MCi left colon (%60).</p><p id="Par6517">All of CC,LC,MCi had lymphoplasmocytosis in lamina propria (slight %46,%86,%100, moderate/severe %54,%14,%0). The majority of CC (%97) showed 5-19 IELs/100 enterocytes. The striking point was the presence of ≥20 eosinophils/1HPF in lamina propria in %78,%43,%11 of CC,LC,MCi respectively. Desquamation, flattening, vacuolization, loss of mucin in the surface epithelium were %73,%51,%65,%62 of CC, %21,%86,%43,%71 of LC while %33,%11,%22,%33 of MCi respectively. None of CC,LC had crypt distortion, crypt abscess, giant cell, granuloma, ulceration.</p><p id="Par6518"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Histopathologically the presence of distinct lymphoplasmositosis, increased eosinophili and epithelial damage should alert for the diagnosis of complete microscopic colitis. Collagenous colitis may demonstrate intraepithelial lymphocytosis.

Clinical findings were retrieved from electronic records.</p><p id="Par6525"><bold>Results:</bold> There were 22 males and 7 females, with a mean age of 10.8 years. Mean number of eosinophils and lymphocytes were significantly (p=0,000) higher in EoE (47.2; 58) compared to LyE (0; 46.8), GERD (1; 21), and controls (0; 11). Lymphocytes ≥29,5 and eosinophils ≥12 yielded the highest sensitivity and specificity (100% &amp; 87.5%, 100% &amp;100%, respectively) for EoE. Lymphocytes were above the cut-off in 87.5% of EoE, 84% of LyE, and 25% of GERD. Eosinophil count (100%) followed by lymphocytes (94%) and basal cell hyperplasia (78%) were the most important discriminant parameters EoE/LyE.

Aggressive tumour behaviour was defined as having at least two of the histopathological features including parenchymal invasion, vascular invasion, perineural invasion, cytological atypia, adipose tissue invasion and &gt; 5% Ki67 index. ‘Aggressive’ group (n=4) and relatively low-risk group (n=5) were compared in terms of BAP1 expression but there was no statistically significant relationship (p=0.722). However, there was one case with loss of BAP1 expression showing five out of six aggressive histopathological features and also with a short survival time (12 months).</p><p id="Par6582"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Loss of BAP1 expression may be associated with more aggressive clinicopathological features in solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas. Larger case series are needed to reveal the possible effects of BAP1 expression on the prognosis of this unique neoplasm.</p><p id="Par6583"><bold>PS-22-006</bold></p><p id="Par6584"><bold>Assessing the impact of neoadjuvant therapy on lymph node yield, lymph node status and excision margin status in pancreaticoduodenectomy specimens: a ten-year review</bold></p><p id="Par6585"><underline>A.

Swan</p><p id="Par6586">*St James's Hospital, Ireland</p><p id="Par6587"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Pancreaticoduodenectomy is the primary surgical treatment for pancreatic malignancies. Pathological examination of the specimen including lymph node dissection, is essential for staging. We assessed the effect of neoadjuvant therapy on lymph node yield and lymph node and resection status.</p><p id="Par6588"><bold>Methods:</bold> All pancreaticoduodenectomy specimens at St Vincent’s University hospital between January 2009 and December 2019 were retrieved via a SNOMED search of the laboratory information system (n=714). Margin status, lymph node yield and lymph node status was obtained from pathology reports. Details of neoadjuvant therapy were retrieved from the patient chart or the clinical history provided on the specimen request card.</p><p id="Par6589"><bold>Results:</bold> 272 pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) specimens contained pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) was administered to 61 patients. The mean lymph node yield for NAT patients was equivalent to that of non-NAT patients (14.7 versus 14.6). The mean nodal positivity for patients without NAT was 2.6 versus 1.7 for patients treated with NAT. R0 margin status was achieved in 135 (64%) cases with no NAT versus 49 (80.3%) of NAT cases.</p><p id="Par6590"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our study has shown that neoadjuvant therapy has a positive impact on both the nodal status (N) and the resection (R) status.

Popa” Iași, Romania</p><p id="Par6595"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Galectin 8 (Gal8), a “tandem-repeat”-type galectin, is currently studied in numerous tumours as prognostic factor, but limited data for pancreatic malignancies are available. Our study aims to analyse the immunohistochemical profile of Gal8 in pancreatic ductal neoplasia.</p><p id="Par6596"><bold>Methods:</bold> We investigated 25 cases of pancreatic ductal carcinoma, 13 of them associating intraductal proliferation (PanIN). Gal8 was assessed qualitative and semiquantitative (based on the percentage of positive cells and intensity of reaction). The semiquantitative assessment allowed the stratification in three classes: low Gal8, moderate Gal8 and high Gal8. The Gal8 immunoprofile was correlated with pTNM stage and histological variants.</p><p id="Par6597"><bold>Results:</bold> Qualitatively, 21 cases of pancreatic ductal carcinoma presented cytoplasmic and nuclear Gal8 expression, with low/moderate intensity; 3 cases displayed exclusively cytoplasmic expression, 1 case – only nuclear. In PanIN, Gal8 was strong cytoplasmic or cytoplasmic and nuclear, similar with normal pancreatic tissue. Semi-quantitatively, 11 cases had low score, 9 cases – moderate score, and 5 cases – high score. Significant correlations were noted between high Gal8 and pN stage (p=0.019).</p><p id="Par6598"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Overall, our results indicated a loss of Gal8 expression from normal exocrine pancreas to preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions. To the best of our knowledge, our study represents the second report regarding Gal8 profile in pancreatic malignancies, preneoplastic lesions and normal pancreatic tissue, opening interesting perspective for larger studies in order to define a better stratification of cases and to correlate Gal8 expression with clinico-pathological features.</p><p id="Par6599"><bold>PS-22-008</bold></p><p id="Par6600"><bold>Transcriptomic correlation of fine-needle aspiration samples and paired surgical specimens from pancreatic ductal carcinomas</bold></p><p id="Par6601"><underline>J.

Most cases were diagnosed by endosonography-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). We aim to evaluate the molecular concordance between EUS-FNA and surgical specimens.</p><p id="Par6604"><bold>Methods:</bold> We used a 52-gene signature by NanoString technology that identifies three populations: Cluster-1 (inflamed, stromal-dependent) characterised by upregulation of CAF and EMT-related genes. Cluster-2 (inflamed, non-stromal-dependent) presents enrichment for immune checkpoint genes and features of EMT. Cluster-3 (non-inflamed) lacks such upregulated genes. The percentage of fibrosis/epithelium was evaluated in all samples.</p><p id="Par6605"><bold>Results:</bold> Paired samples from 18 PDAC patients who underwent EUS-FNA for cytological diagnosis and surgical resection were analysed. The study was closed prematurely due to low concordance (5%). All three clusters were identified in EUS-FNA samples in 1 (6%), 8 (44%), and 9 (50%) cases, respectively, whereas all resected specimens where classified as cluster-1. There was less fibrotic component representation in FNA specimens (mean 10%) than in surgical specimens (mean 60%), associated with cluster-1 features.</p><p id="Par6606"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The epithelial compartment is well represented in EUS-FNA samples, but fibrotic transcriptomic information is under-represented, which poses the question whether FNA material is adequate or not for molecular classification of PDAC. Further analysis with microdissection is required in order to identify the cell population aspects that explain molecular discrepancies and their impact in the prognosis.</p><p id="Par6607"><bold>PS-22-009</bold></p><p id="Par6608"><bold>Tumour regression grading of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: value of immunohistochemical and molecular markers</bold></p><p id="Par6609"><underline>L.

Only limited data support its prognostic significance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of immunohistochemical (IH) and molecular parameters in PDAC-TRG.</p><p id="Par6612"><bold>Methods:</bold> Tissue samples from patients with neoadjuvant treated PDAC were reviewed (n=18). CAP (College of American Pathologists) TRG score was determined for primary tumour, lymph node metastases, and distant metastases, if present. Expression of p16, p53, SMAD4, and proliferation index (Ki67) were evaluated by IH. Additionally, next generation sequencing (NGS) using the Cancer HotSpot Panel v2 (ThermoFisher) was performed.</p><p id="Par6613"><bold>Results:</bold> Most cases were CAP score 2 (partial response; 78%). Based on IH, co-existent aberrant p16 and p53 expression showed association with reduced overall survival (OS) (p=0.06). SMAD4 loss was also associated with poor OS (p=0.07). NGS was successful in n=16. Pathogenic variants found in n=14 included variants of KRAS (87.5%), TP53 (68.7%), CDKN2A (25%) and SMAD4 (25%). Identical variants were found pre- and post-therapy (n=3). SMAD4 variants were correlated with poor OS (p=0.02). TP53 variants correlated with the presence of distant metastasis (p=0.03). CAP-TRG was not correlated with OS. However, high CAP score (poor regression) showed a trend for positive correlation with the total number of mutated genes (p= 0.07).</p><p id="Par6614"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> CAP was not correlated with patient survival, questioning its role as prognostic factor. However, an association of CAP with the number of mutated genes was noted, suggesting that the mutational burden of PDAC might be involved in therapeutic response. Adding IH and molecular analyses may be more reliable for PDAC-TRG compared to using histomorphology alone. Evaluation in larger independent cohorts of patients is needed to validate our preliminary results.</p><p id="Par6615"><bold>PS-22-011</bold></p><p id="Par6616"><bold>Nerve fibres in the tumour microenvironment are co-localised with tertiary lymphoid structures and is associated with a better survival in pancreatic cancer patients</bold></p><p id="Par6617"><underline>L.

Its implication into daily diagnostics would improve prognostic stratification. We performed a multicenter interobserver study to identify the optimal method of TB assessment in PDAC.</p><p id="Par6653"><bold>Methods:</bold> TB was scored by independent observers at five participating centres in Switzerland, Germany and Canada. Two serial sections were stained for H&amp;E and pan-cytokeratin. Pathologists assessed TB on a digital pathology platform comparing H&amp;E with pan-cytokeratin staining in 10 high power fields (10HPF) and one HPF hotspot (1HPF), as well as in one H&amp;E hotspot at 20x magnification.</p><p id="Par6654"><bold>Results:</bold> 50 resected PDACs TNM-stage I-III were evaluated.

Autoptic samples, kidney, liver and myocardium were routinely processed for histology and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis and some also for ultrastructural analysis.</p><p id="Par6711"><bold>Results:</bold> Muscle biopsy showed unspecific myopathic damage with mitochondrial alterations. Ultrastructurally, liver samples showed many rounded-polygonal viral particles (70 nm) with an electrondense core (herpes-like virus), mainly detectable both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of hepatocytes. IHC analysis defined viral particles as type I HSV. Moreover, type I HSV positivity has been confirmed also in cortical adrenal glands.</p><p id="Par6712"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Ultrastructural analysis, even in autoptic cases, allows to make a precise diagnosis when clinical features are not suggestive: fulminant hepatic and multi-organ failure can be induced by HSV infection. It has high mortality for untreated neonates and early diagnosis is difficult as the characteristic vesicular rash may be absent, early symptoms often nonspecific and HSV infection maternal history not evident. Neonatal HSV infection, although rare, can cause neonatal hepatic failure.</p><p id="Par6713"><bold>PS-24IT in Pathology</bold></p><p id="Par6714"><bold>PS-24-001</bold></p><p id="Par6715"><bold>Digital pathology; awareness, practice, and challenges in a developing country like Pakistan</bold></p><p id="Par6716"><underline>F.

The aim of this study is to determine the perception of various pathologists regarding digital pathology, its applications, and challenges.</p><p id="Par6719"><bold>Methods:</bold> A cross sectional descriptive survey was conducted involving 76 surgical pathologists including postgraduate residents of different levels and consultants belonging to different governmental and private institutions of Pakistan. The respondents were evaluated by means of a self-designed questionnaire prepared after extensive literature search. Data was entered and analysed using SPSS version 21.</p><p id="Par6720"><bold>Results:</bold> The overall response rate was 98%. The awareness regarding digital pathology and its uses varied among respondents depending upon their level of residency. Many practical perspectives of this field were either missing or not being followed in spite of provision in some institutions. However, majority of the institutions were lacking in this facility. Many challenges in implementation included lack of awareness, financial constraints, improper technical support and backup, and disinterest in the new technology.</p><p id="Par6721"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Awareness among residents and practicing surgical pathologists can be increased by encouraging their participation in dedicated workshops thus familiarizing them to its various advantages.

For consultation, WSI is useful, but small hospitals need cheaper systems. Therefore, the usefulness of the system using the remote desktop (RDP) was verified.</p><p id="Par6727"><bold>Methods:</bold> We collected 50 intraoperative diagnostic specimens. On the RDP distribution side, a pathologist or clinical technician operated the microscope and displayed the image obtained from the CCD camera. On the receiving side, a RDP connection was made from a smartphone via a 4G line, and pathologists diagnosed while instructing the viewing site via telephone. Then, we compared the coincidence rate.</p><p id="Par6728"><bold>Results:</bold> Regarding diagnostic accuracy, no statistical difference was found between the diagnosis using RDP and using microscope. However, the diagnosis time tended to be slightly longer when RDP was used. This tendency was remarkable when the laboratory technician operated the sender. In addition, in the diagnosis by RDP via the 4G line, there was almost no problem of the diagnosis due to the delay of the image and the unclear image.</p><p id="Par6729"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> It was shown that even a low-cost system using a conventional CCD camera and RDP can provide sufficient performance for consultation for rapid intraoperative diagnosis. If it is a small specimen, it can be applied to a consultation system for routine diagnosis. This system can be configured at about one tenth the price of a WSI scanner and can be installed in many small hospitals. It is considered that this system may contribute to the equalization of diagnostic accuracy.</p><p id="Par6730"><bold>PS-24-003</bold></p><p id="Par6731"><bold>Views on digital pathology: a departmental survey</bold></p><p id="Par6732"><underline>J.

Participants were asked to rate their views towards the plans to change to digital pathology and whether they thought reporting biopsy and resection specimens would be faster or slower. Free text fields for perceived advantages and disadvantages of digital pathology were also given.</p><p id="Par6736"><bold>Results:</bold> 44 completed questionnaires were returned (14 trainees, 26 consultants). Feelings towards the introduction of digital pathology were generally positive (average = 4.1, 1 being very negative and 5 being very positive), particularly amongst trainees (average = 4.4). The main perceived advantages were measuring, sharing slides with colleagues and experts, access to archive and ergonomics. The main perceived disadvantages were IT issues, costs, image quality and a delay caused by scanning.</p><p id="Par6737"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> At the QEUH there is a positive attitude towards digital pathology, but concerns remain. The changeover to digital pathology is now underway and digital workstations are being installed for both consultant and trainee pathologists.

At least 12 lymph nodes are to be assessed for proper staging. The examination of lymph node metastasis is an important but tedious task for the pathologist.</p><p id="Par6743"><bold>Methods:</bold> The primary aim was to develop a deep learning algorithm that can detect and outline metastatic cancer in digitalised histologic sections of colorectal lymph nodes with at least the same sensitivity and specificity as pathologists. Lymph nodes with and without metastases from patients with colorectal cancer operated at Västmanlands Hospital were included and the glasses scanned on a Hamamatsu scanner.</p><p id="Par6744"><bold>Results:</bold> To maximize the performance of the deep learning algorithm two pathologist annotated, on pixel level, areas of metastases in each positive node. A deep learning algorithm pre-trained with Camelyon data was trained on 270 (138 with cancer and 132 benign) whole slide images (WSI). The performance was evaluated on 26 WSI with cancer and 9 benign. The median sensitivity for cancer images was 0.88 and the median specificity for benign images was 1.00.</p><p id="Par6745"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These encouraging preliminary results indicate that a deep neural network could be developed to identify and outline lymph node metastasis in colorectal resections.

Photographs of cases were then classified via a deep learning algorithm. Nuclei are detected, features are extracted, values are visualized and integrated on to the same image with colour codings above each lymphocyte as to whether that lymphocyte nucleus is atypical or not.</p><p id="Par6752"><bold>Results:</bold> Nucleus area, hue, saturation, heterogeneity, roundness, convexity extracted from each nucleus showed that all features showed statistically significant difference between MF and non-MF cases. The deep learning algorithm developed during this study achieved 85% accuracy in classifying lymphocytes as atypical or normal.</p><p id="Par6753"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> MF is a type of cutaneous lymphoma that is potentially fatal, so correctness of the diagnosis is of utmost importance. In order to diagnose MF, pathologist should determine if the lymphocytes seen in the biopsy specimen are atypical or not.

Laohawetwanit*</underline></p><p id="Par6757">*Chulabhorn International College of Medicine, Thammasat University, Pathumthani, Thailand; Division of Pathology, Thammasat University Hospital, Pathumthani, Thailand</p><p id="Par6758"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Historically, conventional light microscopy (CLM) was the preferred learning modality in pathology courses for almost two centuries. Virtual microscopy (VM) has been recently challenging traditional practices and providing a new realm for pathology diagnostics. However, most medical schools in Thailand still use CLM to teach pathology for medical students. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of digital pathology in terms of undergraduate teaching, which is the first experience at Thammasat University.</p><p id="Par6759"><bold>Methods:</bold> Participants were 29 second-year medical students who sat in the practical session of the alimentary system pathology using VM as a teaching modality. Students took pre- and post-test with 12 items covering common alimentary diseases, followed by ten survey questions with a five-point Likert-style scale. Test and satisfaction scores were analysed.</p><p id="Par6760"><bold>Results:</bold> There was a significant difference (p&lt;0.01) between students' pre-test scores (mean±SD, 1.7±2.1) and post-test scores (7.1±3.4). VM was viewed as efficient in terms of undergraduate education, mainly because of its portability (mean: 4.9 on the five-point Likert-scale), satisfactory quality of images (4.4), allowing learning in less time (4.3), and stimulating cooperation between students with improving interaction with teachers (4).</p><p id="Par6761"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The students' perceptions regarding VM as a new teaching-learning tool and their excellent performance on the knowledge exam suggest that VM has a potential role in undergraduate teaching.

We perform a study to assess different Ki67 quantification techniques including manual evaluation, traditional image analysis, and machine learning.</p><p id="Par6767"><bold>Methods:</bold> Eighty regions of interest from ten Ki67 stained NETs were chosen randomly. To assess the ground truth, an experienced pathologist counted positive and negative tumour cell nuclei on digital slides. For traditional image analysis, the Aperio Nuclear Algorithm was applied. Finally, a machine learning system (Aiforia™) was trained with a training data set (29 digital slides).</p><p id="Par6768"><bold>Results:</bold> The observed correlation between traditional image analysis and ground truth was not significant (R2=0.4). This may be justified by the difficulty of the Nuclear Algorithm to only include tumour cells and ignore interstitial cells and lymphocytes nuclei. We also found that the algorithm could not properly separate overlapping tumour cell nuclei. On the other hand, an intra-observer study noted that traditional image analysis offers increased reproducibility compared to manual evaluation (R2=0.9). Finally, the machine learning approach successfully identified and segmented tumour cell nuclei and offered a performance, in one test sample, of overall 90% precision and 94% sensitivity.</p><p id="Par6769"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Nuclear detection and segmentation in NET for assessing the Ki67 labelling index is a challenging task for traditional image analysis. A machine learning solution on the other hand, once trained and verified, delivers reliable and reproducible results and is hence preferable.</p><p id="Par6770"><bold>PS-24-009</bold></p><p id="Par6771"><bold>Blinded external validation of a multi-feature AI-based algorithm in prostate core needle biopsies</bold></p><p id="Par6772">L.

ElGabry</p><p id="Par6841">*Roche Tissue Diagnostics, Companion Diagnostics (CDx), USA</p><p id="Par6842"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> During the development of VENTANA immunohistochemical (IHC) assays, fixation studies are conducted to ensure assay performance is acceptable within established standards and to provide information on any limitations observed with fixatives or fixation times that may yield inaccurate results.</p><p id="Par6843"><bold>Methods:</bold> Fresh tissues well characterized for biomarker expression were harvested to limit ischemic time. Samples were immediately subjected to various fixatives for a range of 1-72 hours. The samples were then compared to a reference fixed within established guidelines. This data set compiles the results of these studies across eleven VENTANA assays tested with various formalin, alcohol, and glyoxal based fixatives.</p><p id="Par6844"><bold>Results:</bold> Across all VENTANA IHC assays tested, crosslinking formalin-based fixatives yielded more consistent results within 6-72 hours by demonstrating overall percent agreement (OPA) rates of 95.4% and 98.5%, respectively, to the reference sample. Comparatively, 1-72 hours in formalin fixatives yielded 88% and 87.6% OPA, respectively. Alcohol and glyoxal-based fixatives exhibited more variability within 6-72 hours of fixation resulting in OPAs of 12.8% and 38%, respectively.</p><p id="Par6845"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The potential of fixative types and fixation times to yield inaccurate results necessitated the need for standardization such that The College of American Pathologists (CAP) and American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) developed guidance for HER2 Testing in Breast Cancer (2018). These data corroborate the established CAP/ASCO guidelines and demonstrate the importance of standardization in fixation practices to yield accurate IHC results, particularly for predictive assays that aid in determining patient treatment regimens.</p><p id="Par6846"><bold>PS-25-008</bold></p><p id="Par6847"><bold>Twitter is a useful and effective tool for pathologists worldwide in the diagnosis of breast pathology</bold></p><p id="Par6848"><underline>I.J.

Guidelines for standardized evaluation of biomarkers are mainly defined for light microscopy (LM). This study aimed to define parameters for alternative standardized use of digital and light microscopy for biomarker evaluations.</p><p id="Par6867"><bold>Methods:</bold> Microscopes with field numbers (FNs) 23 and 18, respectively, a HD computer monitor with diagonal of 56 cm, 100% size scaling and 1920x1200 resolution and a 3K computer with monitor diagonal of 31 cm, 200% size scaling and 2736x1824 resolution were used. PD-L1 stained cancer sections were scanned with Leica Aperio AT2 slide scanner and evaluated with Aperio ImageScope.</p><p id="Par6868"><bold>Results:</bold> Field of view (FOV) adjustment was required to enable standardized PD-L1 scoring. Light microscopic FOV was calculated using the FN of the ocular, and digital FOV using Aperio ImageScope.

Study investigated sources of variability in estimation of its constituent parameters: number of viable tumour cells (vTC), PD-L1-positive tumour cells (PD-L1PTC) and PD-L1-positive immune cells (PDL1PIC), in head-and-neck cancer (HNC).</p><p id="Par6875"><bold>Methods:</bold> A digital image of HNC stained for PD-L1 with 22C3 pharmDx kit, was analysed for vTC, PD-L1PTC, and PD-L1PIC using Visiopharm tissue selection application, to determine PDL1cps in 3 non-overlapping 0.64 mm2 digital fields, 3 independent times by an expert trained medical student. Mean % coefficient of variation (MCV% of the 3 repeats) was calculated as an index of variability.</p><p id="Par6876"><bold>Results:</bold> The mean (range) counts of vTC, PD-L1PTC, and PD-L1PIC included within 0.64mm2 digital image frames (n = 9) as manually determined on three repeat analyses, were found to be 819 (478-1559); 165 (75-255); 125 (89-166), respectively. For each of these three parameters, the relative variability (MCV% = 1 standard deviation/mean x 100) was calculated to be 33, 50 and 19, respectively, and that for PD-L1cps to be 21. According to statistical criteria applied to small samples MCV% of &lt;20 is considered to be a reflection of good reproducibility; &lt;30 as indicative of acceptable reproducibility; and that of &gt;30 as representative of overall poor reproducibility.</p><p id="Par6877"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Visiopharm tissue selection application provides a means of determining the sources of variability in PD-L1cps estimation by allowing simple manual annotation of individual cells of interest in predefined areas of digital images. The poor reproducibility of vTC and PD-L1PTC estimation indicates need for more objective methods for identification of viable tumour cells and PD-L1-labelled tumour cells, whilst the higher precision noted in estimation of PD-L1IC acknowledges its greater clinical utility.</p><p id="Par6878"><bold>PS-25-012</bold></p><p id="Par6879"><bold>Immunohistochemical detection of FAS in formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissues</bold></p><p id="Par6880"><underline>A.

However, mechanisms of L-17 anti-diabetic action are not completely clear. Our study aimed to characterize regenerative process in the pancreas in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats treated with L-17.</p><p id="Par6923"><bold>Methods:</bold> Forty male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: control, control plus L-17, streptozotocin diabetes (T2DM) and T2DM treated with L-17. T2DM was induced by intraperitoneal injection of nicotinamide (110 mg/kg) and streptozotocin (65 mg/kg). L-17 was injected intramuscularly (40 mg/kg/day, 12 injections for 4 weeks). Biochemical, haematological, histological and immunohistochemical investigations were performed.</p><p id="Par6924"><bold>Results:</bold> L-17 decreased fasting blood glucose, glycated haemoglobin, urea and alkaline phosphatase in diabetic rats. Haematological analysis did not reveal any negative effects of this substance. L-17 treatment had no impact on the pancreatic islets’ quantity, their diameters, β-cells number and CD117 expression (both in islets and acinar part). However, L-17 caused increasing of total islet cells, extra-islet insulin-producing cells (especially in acinar part), PDX1+cell in acini and ducts in T2DM-rats.</p><p id="Par6925"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our studies suggest that observed plasma glucose and glycated haemoglobin improvement appears to be occurred by the way independent from islet β-cells recovery.

Although the lung is the best known and most common site, IMT occurs in diverse extrapulmonary locations and in any age group.</p><p id="Par7015"><bold>Methods:</bold> 94 cases of IMT were retrieved from the archives of Histopathology at The Aga Khan University Hospital between years 2006-2019.Out of these,30 cases involved quite unusual sites. H&amp;E slides were evaluated for characteristic findings. Relevant IHC stains performed were CKAE1/AE3, ASMA, ALK protein, Desmin, CD34, S100 and CD117.FISH analysis for ALK gene rearrangement had been done on two cases. Treatment/follow up details were obtained by calling the patients.</p><p id="Par7016"><bold>Results:</bold> The described unusual tumour sites were abdominal wall(n=2) kidney(n=3), eye(n=1),orbit (n=2),intracranial but extra-axial (n=2) and rest included cheek, parotid gland, oropharynx, epiglottis, supraclavicular area, hypochondrium, vocal cord, liver, adrenal gland, urinary bladder, gluteal region, popliteal fossa and big toe.14 patients were female and 16 were male. Ages ranged from 01-64 years with a mean age of 21 years. Specimen were received as trucut biopsies, excised nodular masses or in multiple pieces. The IHC results were CKAE1/AE3(n=19),ASMA(n=30),ALK protein(n=30) Desmin (n=21),CD34(n=13), S100(n=23),CD117(n=12).Follow up of 13 patients was attainable.6 found to have expired of their disease.

To address this issue, the growth pattern of retroperitoneal ALT/DDLPS was pathologically studied.</p><p id="Par7023"><bold>Methods:</bold> The materials consisted of surgical specimens of two cases of ALT and seven of DDLPS, all of which arose in the retroperitoneum. The surgical margins were retrospectively re-evaluated in all tumours. Immunostainings for p16 and HMGA2 were applied to investigate the growth pattern of tumour cells.</p><p id="Par7024"><bold>Results:</bold> In all tumours, we confirmed tumour cell infiltration at surgical margins. Tumour cells including lipogenic cells and atypical stromal cells were diffusely positive for p16, whereas they were sparsely positive for HMGA2. The boundaries between tumours and surrounding tissues were well-demarcated or infiltrative. At the latter, p16-positive atypical stromal cells infiltrate along fibrous septa of normal-appearing adipose tissue. Besides, daughter nodules were occasionally found apart from main tumours.</p><p id="Par7025"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> As the retroperitoneal ALT/DDLPS are usually large in size, they tend to be marginally resected. Infiltrative growth of atypical stromal cells and daughter nodules may also cause recurrence. The p16, rather than HMGA2, immunostaining is useful to detect infiltrating tumour cells and to evaluate the surgical margins. As the complete excision may be impossible, novel, molecular target therapies are desirable for the treatment of the retroperitoneal ALT/DDLPS.</p><p id="Par7026">Funding: Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (TH, 18K06989) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</p><p id="Par7027"><bold>PS-26-009</bold></p><p id="Par7028"><bold>TFE3-rearranged pecoma: expanding gene fusion knowledge</bold></p><p id="Par7029"><underline>A.B.

Dedifferentiated histological subtype and the need for contiguous organ resection (excluding nephrectomy) was associated with an increased risk of local and distant recurrence. Nephrectomy may be necessary to achieve complete resection, but its absence does not increase survival.

The tumour, nine lymph nodes, a part of the right clavicle and a segment of mediastinal adipose tissue were submitted for histological examination. Diagnosis was set with Hematoxylin – Eosin stains and supported by the necessary immunohistochemical assays.</p><p id="Par7109"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopy revealed a tumour showing nodular, diffuse or fascicular to storiform growth pattern, composed of oval to spindled, occasionally multinucleate, cells, with eosinophilic and fibrillar cytoplasm, small nucleoli and frequently pseudoinclusions. 15 mitoses per 2mm2 were counted. Perivascular lymphocyte cuffs and admixed population of lymphocytes, eosinophils, plasma cells and neutrophils were also observed. Tumour showed positivity for CD21, CD23, CD35, D2-40 and negativity for CD1a, CD4, CD14, CD15, CD30, CD68, Langerin, S-100 and HMB-45.

Antúnez</p><p id="Par7203">*Clinical University Hospital of Santiago de Compostela, Spain</p><p id="Par7204"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Splenic angiosarcoma (SAG) is a rare, aggressive and poor prognosis malignant entity, which apparently derives from the sinusoidal vascular endothelium in red pulp. SAG usually debuts with metastasis, with the liver being the most common site.</p><p id="Par7205"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 65-year-old woman presented with a general syndrome displaying joint pain and oedema, which had evolved during the three previous months. A PET-CT scan showed an uptake area of liver segment VIII, with no evidence of splenic alterations. Later, the patient presented hemodynamic instability with multiorgan failure, which evolved into refractory shock causing death. A clinical autopsy was performed.</p><p id="Par7206"><bold>Results:</bold> Post-mortem examination evidenced a subcapsular, poorly-defined lesion (2.5 x 1.5 cm) located in segments VII-VIII of the liver. Microscopically a marked hepatic infiltration caused by a malignant vascular tumour was detected; this neoplasm formed channels containing red blood cells delineated by histiocytoid-like tumour cells. Occasional mitoses and tumour projections could be seen. Spleen had massive AG infiltration and a similar morphological appearance was also found in metastatic lung microscopic foci.</p><p id="Par7207"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Splenic littoral cell angiosarcoma is a neoplasm with aggressive behaviour and unfavourable prognosis due to high rates of metastasis caused by hematogenous spread. Early diagnosis and prompt splenectomy are very important for survival.</p><p id="Par7208"><bold>E-PS-01-003</bold></p><p id="Par7209"><bold>Dandy-Walker syndrome - case report</bold></p><p id="Par7210"><underline>V.

The measuring and weighing of these were within normal values. However, the brain was in places with indications of encephalopathy, hydrocephalus. The myocardium was in places with ischemic lesions and the lung tissue blocks were with oedema and in places with fibrosis and thickening.</p><p id="Par7214"><bold>Results:</bold> The results included brain in places with indications (macroscopic – microscopic) of encephalopathy, hydrocephalus, myocardium in places with ischemic lesions and lung tissue blocks with oedema and in places with fibrosis and thickening</p><p id="Par7215"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Dandy-Walker syndrome is associated with chromosomal abnormalities, Mendelian disorders, syndromic malformations, congenital infections, CNS disorders, including various malformations. Hydrocephalus is a common complication of the disease in almost 80% of the cases. With regard to the diagnosis, it depends on ultrasound as the first imaging modality in assessing foetal brain and on MRI after the 20th week of gestation. Treatment is generally focused on alleviating hydrocephalus and posterior fossa symptoms and it consists of treating the manifestations and associated comorbidities.</p><p id="Par7216"><bold>E-PS-01-004</bold></p><p id="Par7217"><bold>Sudden cognitive decline: a presentation of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma</bold></p><p id="Par7218"><underline>C.

Imaging exams showed inferior vena cava thrombosis, that required an implant of a temporary filter. On the day following the procedure, patient decreased level of consciousness. Laboratory tests showed markedly elevated serum ammonia levels. Hyperammonemia was treated with ammonia scavengers, but the patient did not respond to treatment and died. At autopsy, a tumour measuring 21,3 x 16,4 x 11,6 cm was identified. Microscopic analysis leaded to the diagnosis of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FHCC). Neoplastic cells were large, polygonal, with oncocytic cytoplasm, accompanied by parallel lamellae of dense collagen bundles.</p><p id="Par7270"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> FHCC is a very rare tumour. In the United States, it corresponds to less than 1% of all liver tumours. Hyperammonemic encephalopathy in patients with FHCC is also a very rare complication; some aetiologies have been proposed for it's emergency, and one of them is intrahepatic shunting.

The study aimed to review all the male breast cancer cases over a ten-year period and to compare the findings with other similar studies.</p><p id="Par7343"><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a retrospective review of all histologically diagnosed cases of male breast cancers in the Department of Pathology, University College Hospital Ibadan over a ten-year period. Clinicopathological parameters and specific histological sub-types were extracted from surgical day book and Cancer Registry of the Department. The data was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, version 22 (SPSS-22).</p><p id="Par7344"><bold>Results:</bold> Forty-two cases of male breast cancer were seen accounting for 1.7% of all breast cancer cases. The age range was between 22-91 years with a mean age of 60.3 years and a peak occurrence was in the 8th decade. The right breast was more commonly affected accounting for 52% of cases. Most of the patients presented with a retro-areolar mass. The commonest histological sub-type found in this study is the invasive ductal carcinoma accounting for 88% of the cases. The peak incidence of male breast cancer cases was in 2013 with 8 cases while the least incidence of 2 cases was seen in the year 2012 .</p><p id="Par7345"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Breast cancer in men is relatively uncommon compared to female breast cancers. Breast cancer in males and females however share similar clinico-pathological features. Male breast cancer is more common in the older age group and invasive ductal carcinoma is still the commonest histological subtype seen in our environment.

Liesegang rings are rare but known diagnostic pitfalls, commonly misinterpreted as filarial parasites, resulting in inappropriate management.</p><p id="Par7351"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 72 years female presented with a screen-detected lesion in the right breast (R3/U3). Histology revealed microcalcification associating multi-cystic spaces, lined by bland cuboidal epithelium and appear partially filled with multiple globular pink structures, closely mimicking filarial parasites with focal areas showing granulomatous reaction (CD68 stain positive). There is also marked periductal chronic inflammation with no atypia or malignancy identified.</p><p id="Par7352"><bold>Results:</bold> Liesegang rings typically lack the internal structures of true parasites. The diagnosis, however, would be challenging in degenerative forms of filarial parasites. The experts’ opinion (from The London Hospital of Tropical Diseases) described these structures as a special type of secretion, so-called ‘Liesegang rings’. The variable size of rings, the absence of distinct internal organs of parasites in addition to the lack of relevant travel history (to an endemic place) in our case, all favoured Liesegang rings over filarial parasites. The special stains requested initially (Iron stain, Von Kossa, PAS, GIEMSA, MAST) were all negative.</p><p id="Par7353"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We describe a rare histopathological finding ‘Liesegang rings’ that mimics parasites histologically.

The aim was to determine GATA3 expression among different histological and surrogate molecular BT subtypes.</p><p id="Par7386"><bold>Methods:</bold> Immunohistochemical staining of ER, PR, ki67, HER2 and GATA3 was performed in a cohort of 84 consecutive cases of primary IBCs. The association of GATA3 expression with different histological subtypes, grades and surrogate intrinsic molecular subtypes was assessed.</p><p id="Par7387"><bold>Results:</bold> The overall positivity of GATA3 across various histological subtypes was 71.43% with no correlation with histological type (p=0.849). GATA3 expression was positively correlated with low histological grade (G1/G2 vs G3: p=0.001; OR=0.174 95%CI=0.057-0.535) with most of G3 (57.89%) cases being negative and with luminal A (72.22%) and B (84.62%) subtypes (p=0.00001; OR=17.544, 95%CI=4.202-71.429) while most of the triple negative (87.5%) and HER2-overexpressed (66.67%) being negative for GATA3 (p=0.0001).</p><p id="Par7388"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> GATA3 exhibits a relatively high sensitivity for IBC.

The aim of this study is to investigate the distribution of breast cancer molecular subtypes among Egyptian females in correlation with clinicopathological parameters.</p><p id="Par7473"><bold>Methods:</bold> This retrospective study included a cohort of 1072 breast cancer cases from archives of Pathology laboratory at Ain Shams University hospital, Egypt, between 2015 and 2019. Molecular subtypes (luminal A, luminal B, Her2-enriched, and triple-negative) were determined based upon immunohistochemical analysis of ER, PR, Her2, Ki-67, plus SISH for Her2. These data was correlated with the clinicopathological and prognostic indicators.</p><p id="Par7474"><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age of the patients was 51.4 (±12.4) years. The most prevalent subtype was luminal A in 463 cases (43.2%), followed by luminal B in 430 cases (40.1%), Her2-enriched in 91 cases (8.5%), and then triple negative in 88 cases (8.2%). Invasive ductal carcinoma was the most common histological type (91.1%) then lobular carcinoma (6.5%) and the other types accounted for (2.4%). Most of the tumours were grade-II (85%). The triple-negative patients' mean age was 48 years; the lowest among the other subtypes (p=0.02). Both HER2-enriched and triple-negative cases had the highest percentage of T3 stage tumours. HER2 subtype was associated with highest nodal (p=0.02) and distant metastasis (p=0.03).</p><p id="Par7475"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Luminal A and luminal B subtypes are the most common among Egyptian breast cancer patients. Her2-enriched subtype correlates with aggressive clinical behaviour having the highest tendency for metastasis, and triple-negative subtype is more frequent among the younger age group.</p><p id="Par7476"><bold>E-PS-02-020</bold></p><p id="Par7477"><bold>Neuroendocrine mammary carcinoma with long-interval adrenal metastasis: a case report</bold></p><p id="Par7478"><underline>O.

Immunohistochemistry is helpful to distinguish these entities from one another.</p><p id="Par7489"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 48-years-old woman presented with a palpable lump at three o’clock in the left breast. Medical imaging revealed a slightly irregular 10 mm mass. A core needle biopsy showed a solid papillary proliferation of epithelial cells with oval to round overlapping nuclei, surrounded by a sclerotic stroma. This distorted lesion contained peripheral clefts and cellular streaming, without high-grade nuclear atypia.</p><p id="Par7490"><bold>Results:</bold> Immunohistochemistry for oestrogen receptor (ER), cytokeratin-5 (CK-5), chromogranin and synaptophysin distinguished this sclerosing papilloma with extensive UDH from an SPC. Immunohistochemistry is helpful to distinguish both entities from one another, since UDH shows no immunoreactivity for chromogranin and synaptophysin, and presents with a mosaic-type expression pattern of ER and CK-5.</p><p id="Par7491">The lumpectomy specimen revealed a second challenge: multiple epithelial islets without surrounding myoepithelial cells were observed near the papilloma in three consecutive tissue blocks, mimicking an invasive carcinoma. However, they were surrounded by steatonecrosis and reactive fibroblasts, indicating a location within the biopsy needle tract, resembling a comet’s tail.</p><p id="Par7492"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A sclerosing papilloma with extensive UDH is a morphologically mimic of an SPC.

To investigate this, we used digital image analysis (DIA) to count Ki67-positive cells in digitally identified hot-spots.</p><p id="Par7498"><bold>Methods:</bold> Sections from 200 BC cases, stained for Ki67, were assessed using QuPath software. The percentage Ki67-positive cells was recorded in five 100-cell groups in digitally identified hot-spots. Then increments of 100 cells up to 500 cells, were compared. The number of positive cases at each of three clinically relevant cut-off levels (15%, 20%, 30%) was calculated in each group.</p><p id="Par7499"><bold>Results:</bold> At all three cut-off levels the percentage positive cases were lowest when counting 500 cells and highest when counting 1-200 cells. At the 15% cut-off level, 172 and 184 cases were positive at the 500- and 100-cell increments respectively, implying that 12 cases were downgraded with increasing number of cells assessed. At the 20% and 30% cut-offs, 30 and 25 cases respectively were similarly downgraded. The differences in the number of Ki67-positive cases between all five 100-cell increments were higher at the 20%- and 30% cut-off levels compared to the 15% cut-off level.</p><p id="Par7500"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this study, the percentage of Ki67-positive cells was diluted with increasing number of cells counted, leading to downgrading of the proliferation status of some tumours.

They occur rarely but confer a high probability of local recurrence and poor prognosis.</p><p id="Par7539"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 85-year-old woman with left breast invasive ductal carcinoma was treated with breast conserving surgery, sentinel lymph node excision, and standard radiation therapy to the breast two years ago. After two years, the patient applied with an erythematous oedematous lesion in the incision area. PET-CT revealed thickening of the breast skin and increased FDG uptake in the axillary lymph nodes.</p><p id="Par7540"><bold>Results:</bold> A punch biopsy was taken from this area and reported as angiosarcoma. The patient underwent mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. Macroscopically, an irregular tumoral lesion measured 28x23cm with ulceration which caused thickening of the skin was observed. Histopathologically, epithelioid and spindle cell areas and erythrocyte extravasations were seen. Necrosis and mitosis were common. Metastasis was observed in two lymph nodes.

Molecular subtypes were defined according to the St. Gallen 2013 consensus. The IHC and FISH analyses were performed based on the ASCO/CAP 2013 guidelines.</p><p id="Par7548"><bold>Results:</bold> The impact of the ratio of amplified cell population on distant metastases-free survival (DMFS) was analysed in breast cancers with less than 50% amplified cells (HER2 negative tumours). The median follow up of the153 patients was 43.48 months. Distant metastases were observed in 28.29% of the cases. Univariate analysis revealed significant positive correlation between the ratio of the HER2 amplified cells and the longer DMFS (p=0.014). By analysing the subtypes separately, this correlation remained significant only in the HER2 negative luminal B-like group (p=0.025), where by using multivariate analysis, the ratio of the amplified cells proved to be an independent prognostic factor from the Ki67 and progesterone receptor expression.</p><p id="Par7549"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> According to our results, within the 0-49% range, the higher HER2 amplified tumour cell ratio surprisingly might be a positive prognostic variable for the HER2 negative luminal B-like breast cancers.

Ultrasound examination revealed a fibroadenoma-like lesion with code 3.</p><p id="Par7599"><bold>Methods:</bold> Fine needle aspiration cytology proved to be inconclusive. It showed inflammation containing mesenchymal cells and atypical epithelial cells with tendency to papillary fronds. It raised the suspicion of fibroadenoma, a cystic or papillary lesion. Core biopsy (14G) revealed only necrotic and haemorrhagic mass without viable epithelial or stromal cells.</p><p id="Par7600"><bold>Results:</bold> Excision biopsy was performed. Microscopical examination detected a 44 mm large malignant phyllodes tumour (MPT) with extensive necrotic/haemorrhagic changes. Leaf-like stromal fronds were present. The tumour border was focally infiltrative to the adjacent stroma. Atypia was observed in the epithelial part. The hypercellular stroma was dominated by an atypical spindle cell proliferation with stromal overgrowth and with a high number of mitoses (11-15 per 10 high power fields).</p><p id="Par7601"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The final diagnosis of MFT came only from excision biopsy, followed by total mastectomy for a tumour free margin. The patient is recurrence free 1.5 years after the operation. Examination of pathology records revealed 39 MPT cases between 1982-2020 with only one paediatric case (46% of the patients were aged ≤ 50 years, the youngest eight patients were between 23-36 years of age). MPT constitutes &lt;1% of all primary breast neoplasms, which can occur in adolescents and young adults.</p><p id="Par7602"><bold>E-PS-02-037</bold></p><p id="Par7603"><bold>Analysis of clinicopathologic features of glycogen-rich clear cell carcinoma (GRCC) of the breast</bold></p><p id="Par7604"><underline>Y.

They may arise spontaneously (primary angiosarcoma) or following radiation therapy for breast cancer (secondary angiosarcoma).</p><p id="Par7633"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 42-year-old female, with a right breast primary well-differentiated angiosarcoma, diagnosed in January 2016. Three years after quadrantectomy, follow up imaging studies revealed several systemic infiltrative nodules at both breasts, left lung, liver, bones and skin. Clinically, the patient was initially asymptomatic, though clinical progression was early evident by interspersed cutaneous papules. A biopsy of an skin lesion was performed.</p><p id="Par7634"><bold>Results:</bold> Histologic examination showed a notorious small and medium-sized vessels proliferation, with dilated or collapsed spaces, covered by a bland-appearance endothelium. Immunohistochemical study revealed positivity for CD31 and CD34, focal c-myc expression, and actin stain partial positivity.

The presence of giant cells in malignant phyllodes tumour (MPT) is rare and much rarer is the occurrence of osteoclastic giant cells in MPT.</p><p id="Par7649"><bold>Methods:</bold> Here, we present the case of a 39 year old woman who had history of cystic left breast swelling since 3 years. Grossly, it was a partly skin covered breast tissue. Cut surface showed a solid cum cystic and haemorrhagic lesion that measured 13 x 10 x 4 cm.</p><p id="Par7650"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopy revealed breast tissue exhibiting cleft like areas showing compressed breast ducts and spindly stroma with transition to high grade tumour composed of small fascicles of spindle shaped cells with vesicular nuclei, conspicuous nucleoli and moderate eosinophilic cytoplasm interspersed with scattered uniform distribution of osteoclast giant cells. Approximately 20 mitosis were identified. Immunohistochemical epithelial markers were negative in osteoclastic giant cells and showed CD68 expression. Spindle cells were positive for SATB2.

It has a high rate of local recurrence without metastatic potential. We report a case of a breast-DF to emphasize its clinico-histological features and to discuss its differential diagnoses.</p><p id="Par7734"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present a case of DF of the breast in a 33-year-old woman who presented with a single lump of the left breast measuring 15 mm.</p><p id="Par7735"><bold>Results:</bold> Ultrasound showed a hypoechogenic spiculated mass suggesting an invasive carcinoma. Biopsy revealed a spindle cell proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts without atypia or mitoses. There was no epithelial component. Immunohistochemical analysis showed negativity for keratin and CD34 and was inconclusive for β‑catenin and Desmin. Wide local excision was completed and revealed the same proliferation with infiltration of the adjacent breast tissue. All surgical margins were free from tumour. Immunohistochemistry led to the diagnosis of DF confirmed by positive nuclear staining for β-catenin. Tumour cells were also positive focally for SMA and negative for Desmin. The patient is followed now for 4 months with no apparent recurrence.</p><p id="Par7736"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The breast is an unusual site of DF. Biopsy is not always successful to make the exact diagnosis. Differential diagnoses include phyllodes tumour, fibromatosis-like metaplastic carcinoma and myofibroblastoma.

We describe an additional case of TCVPBC and the problems correlating with its diagnosis.</p><p id="Par7761"><bold>Methods:</bold> A circumscribed nodule of 0,9cm, in the UOQ of the right breast, of a 71 year-old woman, was discovered incidentally during a mammographic examination. A hook was placed and the lesion was excised for diagnostic evaluation. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was also performed.</p><p id="Par7762"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopically, the majority of the tumour consisted of solid circumscribed nodules of epithelial cells with a focal papillary and trabecular arrangement of cuboidal or tall columnar cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei with reverse nuclear polarity and occasional grooves. Myoepithelial markers, TTF-1, thyroglobulin, hormone receptors and c-erb-B2, were negative. The diagnosis was of an invasive tumour with features consistent with tall cell papillary breast carcinoma.</p><p id="Par7763"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> TCVPBC is a recently described, rare, special histologic subtype of invasive breast carcinoma with specific morphologic, immunohistochemical and molecular features, with overall favourable prognosis, which has to be differentiated from other papillary lesions of the breast and metastatic thyroid carcinoma.

HER2-expression leads to a worse prognosis. Expression of hormonal receptors together with the expression of HER2 (triple-positive breast cancer) leads to a worse response to therapy.</p><p id="Par7769"><bold>Methods:</bold> We analysed pathological reports in our laboratory during the period 2011-2019 y.y. All cases were stained with antibodies to hormone receptors, HER2 protein and Ki-67.We examined only patients who were not treated before surgery. In all cases, the degree of differentiation (grade), the presence or absence of metastases, and the stage were assessed. The comparison group selected ER + BC.</p><p id="Par7770"><bold>Results:</bold> In total over the period of 2011-2019 years, 3182 cases were operated for BC without neoadjuvant therapy. The proportion of TPBC was 5.2% of their number. Most TPBCs were grade 3 (58%), only 2 cases were grade 1. Ki-67 index ranged from 5 to 90%, the average value was 28.4%, median 25%, mode 40%. Among TPBC 35.9% of tumours had metastases in regional lymph nodes according to the pathological report, although the clinical stage before surgery was N0.</p><p id="Par7771"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> According to Patrizia Vici et al., TPBC accounts for up to 50% of HER2 + BC, 5-15% of all BC.

Another key feature includes perivascular pseudorosettes formation and the presence of extracellular mucin. The cells are monotonous, polygonal in shape with low nuclear grade. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen. No myoepithelial cells observed within the lesion or outer nodules. Immunohistochemical staining shows diffuse positivity for ER, PR and synaptophysin but negative for HER-2, P63 and CK5/6.

Lai*</underline>, Z. Zhao</p><p id="Par7857">*Singapore General Hospital, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore</p><p id="Par7858"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) manifests as a pan-carditis resulting from altered immune response to Streptococcal pharyngitis. The acute phase is seldom seen in surgical pathology practice. Mesothelial/monocytic incidental cardiac excrescence (MICE) is a rare benign incidental finding in cardiothoracic surgery.</p><p id="Par7859"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present a case of MICE associated with suspected acute RHD. A 17-year-old male was found to have a pansystolic murmur on pre-enlistment medical examination. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed mitral valve prolapse with severe mitral regurgitation. During surgery for mitral valve replacement, the surgeon reported thickened mitral valve and possible pericarditis. A 2.5cm anterior mediastinal lymph node was also excised.</p><p id="Par7860"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopic examination showed mitral valve endocarditis. Aggregates of activated macrophages were seen with focal peripheral palisading surrounding central fibrinous areas, reminiscent of the Aschoff nodules. The “mediastinal lymph node” included two small reactive lymph nodes and a loose nodular fragment comprising sheets of histiocytes admixed with rare islands of mesothelial cells. There were also entrapped adipocytes, fibrin and mixed inflammatory infiltrate. The histiocytes were positive for CD68 and CD31, and negative for S100 and CD1a. Diagnosis of MICE and possible acute RHD was made. Retrospectively, the patient admitted that he had two to three days of sore throat before his enlistment check-up.</p><p id="Par7861"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> MICE is believed to be part of the entity “histiocytosis with raisinoid nuclei”. A reactive or iatrogenic aetiology has been proposed. About 15% of MICE are associated with RHD. Diagnosis requires close clinico-pathological correlation.</p><p id="Par7862"><bold>E-PS-03-010</bold></p><p id="Par7863"><bold>Leiomyosarcoma of the descendent aorta, a case report</bold></p><p id="Par7864"><underline>L.

The vast majority are diagnosed post-mortem. We report a case of aortic LMS underlining the difficulty of in vivo diagnosis.</p><p id="Par7867"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 75 years old male, presented for precordial pain, dyspnoea, feeling of chest constriction, dysphagia; thorax CT raised a lung cancer suspicion. Positive pathology diagnosis was reached employing a series of minimally invasive procedures. The patient underwent imagistic assays, toracocenthesis and ultrasound guided transthoracic biopsy, followed by histopathological examination through routine staining and immunohistochemistry.</p><p id="Par7868"><bold>Results:</bold> Thoracic CT scan showed a mass abutting descending aorta. As bronchoscopic and pleural fluid cytology were inconclusive, the hypothesis of thrombosed aortic aneurism was put forward but unsubstantiated. Ultrasound guided transthoracic biopsy followed by histopathological exam revealed a highly cellular proliferation containing spindle cells with positivity for caldesmon and SMA and negativity for desmin, p63, TTF1, S100, CD34, MDM2, EMA, CK7 and CK cocktail, supporting a diagnosis of aortic LMS. Proliferation factor was positive in 30-40% of the tumour cells. Patient was referred to oncology services, declined specific therapy and survived 2 months after diagnosis.</p><p id="Par7869"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Imagistic approaches are usually not enough to establish a clear diagnosis of aortic LMS. Minimally invasive bioptic approaches have a good safety profile and adequate efficacy, still cytological examination may not always reach diagnosis despite the advanced stage of tumour.</p><p id="Par7870"><bold>E-PS-03-011</bold></p><p id="Par7871"><bold>Cardiac sarcoidosis or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy?: a diagnostic challenge</bold></p><p id="Par7872"><underline>O.

Wright</p><p id="Par7873">*Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, United Kingdom</p><p id="Par7874"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) and cardiac sarcoid can be identified in explanted heart specimens. Both are morphologically and histopathologically distinct but studies have shown histological overlap between so-called “burnt-out” sarcoid and AC. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge for the histopathologist.</p><p id="Par7875"><bold>Methods:</bold> A middle-aged male with no past medical history, presented with syncope and complete atrioventricular block and underwent dual-chamber pacemaker insertion. Imaging showed biventricular dilatation, late gadolinium enhancement and possible FDG avidity within hilar lymph nodes. However, the study quality was poor. Despite immunosuppression therapy for suspected sarcoid, the patient rapidly deteriorated into severe biventricular failure, necessitating cardiac transplantation.</p><p id="Par7876"><bold>Results:</bold> Macroscopic examination of the explanted heart showed right ventricular wall atrophy and fibrofatty replacement. The left ventricle was largely normal.</p><p id="Par7877">Microscopy showed extensive fibrosis and fatty replacement of the myocardium in the right ventricle, with extension into the posterior left ventricle, with focal areas of lymphocytic inflammation but the inflammatory cells did not appear to be associated with myocyte damage. There was a single giant cell present but no well-formed granulomas were identified.</p><p id="Par7878"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The distribution of fibrofatty replacement without granulomas suggests AC. Genetic confirmation is awaited. Following cardiac transplantation the patient shows no evidence of recurrent sarcoidosis. Histological features of cardiac sarcoid can mimic AC, thus posing a diagnostic difficulty for histopathologists.</p><p id="Par7879"><bold>E-PS-03-012</bold></p><p id="Par7880"><bold>Investigation of the presence of neutrophils and macrophages in the tissues of calcified aorta affected by atherosclerosis</bold></p><p id="Par7881">I.

All samples were examined by histology and immunohistochemistry. Samples were fixed, embedded in paraffin and analysed for neutrophils and macrophages accumulation with anti-MPO and anti-CD68 antibodies.</p><p id="Par7886"><bold>Results:</bold> MPO expression was increased in aortic tissues with calcifications (42.08±2.85 cells per 1 mm2) in comparison to those without them (33.3±2.23, p&lt;0.05, Student’s t-test).

Popescu</p><p id="Par7891">*County Hospital of Oradea, University of Oradea, Romania</p><p id="Par7892"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Dilative cardiomyopathy (DCM) represents a myocardial structural disorders associated with mechanical dysfunctions and rhythm disturbances that causes enlargement of both ventricles. More than 50% of primary DCM are familial diseases and identifying those forms is essential for discovering asymptomatic patients.</p><p id="Par7893"><bold>Methods:</bold> We included in our study 353 dead patients with DCM for a period of 3 years. We eliminated all secondary known cases of DCM. At autopsy, the heart was measured and trimmed by four-chamber view or short axis (bread loafing) slicing technique. Histology assessments were made using paraffin embedding and slides were stained routinely and with special enzymes.</p><p id="Par7894"><bold>Results:</bold> Primary DCM was suspected in 55 patients and those family members were advised to have regular cardiologic examinations and genetic assays. At autopsy, patient’s heart with DCM has an increased weight with globular shape and decreased tonus. In endocardium fibrous thickening starts mainly in the septum of left ventricle affecting trabecular muscles. Histology revealed different degrees of myocyte enlargement, “box-car” nuclei and protruding collagenous fibres arranged diffuse or perivascular. Majority of myocytes exhibit degenerative brown pigment (lipofuscin) and in interstitial space we found moderate cellularity represented by fibroblasts, fibrocytes and lymphocytes. Comparing slides form patients with primary and secondary DCM there were insufficient data useful for distinguish these two entities.</p><p id="Par7895"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Primary DCM is proposed to be included in “cytoskeletopathies” and without cardio-pulmonary transplant, these patients have an ominous prognosis with reduced 5-year survival rate. A good correlation was found between clinical or functional status and the extent of microscopic lesions (expressed mainly by interstitial fibrosis). An early detection of DCM and proper treatment can improve quality of life in these patients.

SPN occurs predominantly in young women and occasionally in men. Cytological diagnosis is crucial for patient management.</p><p id="Par7922"><bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed all cytological cases obtained by ecoendoscopy in a referral centre between 2009 and 2020. Smears were studied with Papanicolaou and Diff-Quick stains. Immunocytochemistry for CD10, synaptophysin, Cyclin-D1 and beta-catenin was performed on Papanicolaou or cell blocks. In one case histological material was available.</p><p id="Par7923"><bold>Results:</bold> Four cases of SPN with cytological material were found, 3 males and 1 female from 27 to 84 years-old. Characteristically, smears usually were highly cellular. Cells were uniform with round to oval nuclei, dispersed or granular chromatin and small indistinct nucleoli. Nuclear grooves were frequently found and cytoplasm size ranged from scant to moderate. Neoplastic cells were arranged singly, in cohesive clusters or branching papillary structures. Fibrovascular core stroma appeared myxoid and metachromatic. Hyaline globules were occasionally present. Inmunocytochemical studies showed positive stain for neuroendocrine markers (synaptophysin or cromogranin), oestrogen receptor (in female patients), CD10 and beta-catenin. Differential diagnosis were established with neuroendocrine tumours and acinar cell carcinoma.</p><p id="Par7924"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Cytology and immunocytochemistry are essential to SPN diagnosis. Beta-catenin is one of the most reliable marker in the diagnosis of this entity.

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) is one of the techniques for evaluating breast masses. This study aims to correlate between cytologic and histologic findings in mucinous spectrum.</p><p id="Par7930"><bold>Methods:</bold> A search for mucin, mucocele-like lesion (MLL), and mucinous carcinoma (MC) from Chiang Mai University Hospital cytologic electronical database between 2017-2019 was performed. All cytologic slides were reviewed to determine cytomorphological characteristics that specific for benign or malignant MBL, including background, cellularity, arrangements, and nuclear with cytoplasmic details.</p><p id="Par7931"><bold>Results:</bold> 16 FNA diagnoses from females aged 34-84 years were 2 (12.5%) proliferative lesions with atypia (PLA), and 14 (87.5%) malignancy. Correlation with histology, two PLA were 1 fibroadenoma with myxoid stroma (FAM) and 1 MC. 14 malignant cases were 9 (64.3%) MC, 2 (14.3%) mixed MC and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), NOS, and 1 (7.1%) for each ductal carcinoma in situ with mucin content, MLL, and metastatic lung adenocarcinoma. Our study showed MC can be accurately diagnosed. However, the cytologic findings cannot entirely distinguish between benign and malignant tumours. Benign lesions, particularly FAM and MLL, can be missed diagnosed as MC. IDC, NOS and metastatic adenocarcinoma can mimic breast MC.</p><p id="Par7932"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> FNA is useful to detect MBL.

Immunocytochemistry (ICC) is widely used to improve body fluid cytology accuracy, and several markers have been proposed. Ber-EP4 has shown high sensitivity and specificity in previous studies.</p><p id="Par7938"><bold>Methods:</bold> We here report two cases of pericardial effusions misdiagnosed as metastatic carcinoma, based on Ber-EP4 staining. Pericardial fluid was processed by centrifugation and ICC markers were performed. In the second case, a pericardial biopsy was also obtained and immunostained.

Imaging studies showed a large pericardial effusion. Cytology revealed atypical tridimensional groups. Ber-EP4 showed strong membranous staining, and it stained most cells of several cell groups (40%). A pericardial biopsy was performed and also showed patchy intense membranous Ber-EP4 positivity in 40-50% of mesothelial cells. The second case was a 82 year old man with history of ischemic cardiomyopathy who consulted on abdominal pain. Pericardial fluid showed tridimensional cell clusters. Ber-EP4 strongly stained most cell groups, and percentage of cells stained varied between groups (10-100%). Both patients were evaluated (PET-CT, endoscopy) and no malignancy was found.</p><p id="Par7940"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Most cases of Ber-EP4 positivity in mesothelium show weak/patchy staining, but intense staining may be seen both in cytological and histological specimens.

All specimens were re-classified according to the new International System for Reporting Serous Fluid Cytopathology.</p><p id="Par7988"><bold>Results:</bold> 87 PF specimens were obtained from 70 patients (36 males and 34 females). Of these, one (1,1%) was Non-diagnostic (ND), 62 (71,2%) were categorized as Negative for Malignancy (NFM), and 24 (27,6%) were classified as Malignant (MAL). The benign PF specimens were most frequently related to malignancy (18/29%), followed by unknown/unclear cause (15/24,2%), infection (9/14,5%), cardiac disorder (9/14,5%), rheumatic disease (6/9,7%), and other (5/8%). In males, the most common tumour producing malignant PF was lung carcinoma (7/11); other malignancies were rare (oesophageal, bladder, AML, Adenocarcinoma NOS). In women, the leading neoplasm was breast cancer (7/13), followed by lung carcinoma (3/13). Single cases revealed ovarian cancer, plasmablastic lymphoma, and neuroendocrine carcinoma.</p><p id="Par7989"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our findings are well comparable with the results of previous studies. Most benign pericardial effusions are related to malignancy (29%). The vast majority of PFs can be related to clinical history or a specific disease (75,8%). By far, metastatic carcinoma was the most common cause of malignant PF (22/24; 91,7%) with the top differential diagnoses of lung and breast carcinoma. However, malignant mesothelioma involving the pericardium was not present.</p><p id="Par7990"><bold>E-PS-04-014</bold></p><p id="Par7991"><bold>International telecytology diagnosis using whole slide images (WSI)</bold></p><p id="Par7992"><underline>I.

We used Liqui-PREP LBC system for preparation. Slides were scanned by 40x mode with 3 layer Z-stack with 2 μm thickness. Vietnamese pathologists who learned Japanese style cytology diagnosis in Mita hospital make primary diagnosis using conventional microscope in Vietnam, then we observe WSI images and make secondary telecytology diagnosis from Japan.</p><p id="Par7996"><bold>Results:</bold> The Papanicolaou staining showed different colour between Japan and Vietnam. We need to condition our eyes to the Vietnamese colour. Until the end of December 2019, almost 14 months, we performed 600 tele cytology diagnosis. The WSI quality and the concordance rate of diagnosis was fairly good between Vietnamese and Japanese pathologists. The ratio of NILM in cervical cytology was about 98% which is almost similar to Japan.</p><p id="Par7997"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Good LBC preparation, 40x mode scanning, and good staining are essential for digital cytology.</p><p id="Par7998"><bold>E-PS-04-015</bold></p><p id="Par7999"><bold>EUS-FNA of pancreas: an initial 3-year Malaysian study in private laboratory</bold></p><p id="Par8000"><underline>T. Pasupati Meenakshi*</underline>, B. Karikalan, A. Narayanan</p><p id="Par8001">*Clinipath Malaysia Sdn Bhd, Malaysia</p><p id="Par8002"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is being increasingly used in the diagnosis and management of pancreatic mass. Gastroenterologists in Malaysia have been increasingly using EUS FNA, owing to its increasing precision, and relative safety of the procedure.</p><p id="Par8003"><bold>Methods:</bold> This is a cross sectional study conducted on clinical and cytological characteristics on all the EUS-FNA cytology samples of pancreas received in Clinipath Laboratory from 2017 to 2019. Data collected included patient demographics (gender, age and mass lesion location) and tumour characteristics. 679 cases of EUS-FNA were received and reported as per the new guidelines of Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology.</p><p id="Par8004"><bold>Results:</bold> Pancreatic adenocarcinoma ranging from well-differentiated to poorly differentiated was confirmed in 506 cases. Mucinous cystic neoplasms, neuroendocrine tumours, lymphomas, spindle cell tumours and small blue round cell tumours constituted 36 cases. Benign lesions and chronic pancreatitis were 62 in number. The rest of the samples showed pauci-cellularity or complete absence of epithelial cells to arrive at any conclusion. In very occasional cases, atypical cells that were suspicious of an underlying malignancy but not affirmative were also reported. Correlation with clinical picture and CT scan findings were undertaken in all cases.</p><p id="Par8005"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> EUS-FNA is emerging to be the most useful technology in the diagnosis of pancreatic lesions In Malaysia. The precision of the procedure and accuracy of the results of EUS-FNA samples have dramatically increased over the past few years. This initial study carried out for the first time in Malaysia is to document the increasing diagnostic capability of EUS-FNA in the management of pancreatic lesions in a private set up.</p><p id="Par8006"><bold>E-PS-04-019</bold></p><p id="Par8007"><bold>Basal cell adenoma of parotid: a cytological diagnosis confirmed by histology</bold></p><p id="Par8008"><underline>I.

The FNA specimen was sent to our Department of Cytology, where it was stained using conventional (Papanicolaou) and liquid-based methods. The surgical specimen was sent to out Department of Pathology for histological examination.</p><p id="Par8012"><bold>Results:</bold> The cytological examination revealed aggregates, sheets or syncytial fragments of uniform oval epithelial cells with ill defined cytoplasm, round-to-oval nuclei, surrounded by a bright hyaline bands. The diagnosis of a basal cell adenoma was set and surgical resection of the tumour followed. Multiple sections from the tumour for histology confirmed the cytological diagnosis, revealing a well-circumscribed, encapsulated tumour presenting solid, trabecular, tubular and membranous architecture, composed of cells with two cell morphologies: Basaloid cells with peripheral palisading, positive for Vimentin and Actin and larger central (ductal) cells from the bulk of the nodules, angular in shape with more cytoplasm and pale round nuclei, positive for cytokeratin and S100a.</p><p id="Par8013"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Basal cell adenomas of the salivary glands have a low recurrence rate and they rarely demonstrate malignant transformation. FNA is usually followed by surgery, in order to assure the complete resection and to minimize the chances for recurrence.</p><p id="Par8014"><bold>E-PS-04-020</bold></p><p id="Par8015"><bold>Outcome of thyroid nodules diagnosed as atypia or follicular lesion of undetermined significance: a 10-year single institutional experience</bold></p><p id="Par8016"><underline>R.

Properly trained interventional pathologists perform ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy procedures with a methodology which has proven to be very efficient.</p><p id="Par8027"><bold>Methods:</bold> For two years, the cases of ultrasound guided FNA biopsy of superficial lymph nodes performed by a pathologist were counted in our institutions. In situ microscopic assessment was done in all the cases. The following variables were taken into account: clinical data, lymph node characteristics, number of passes, need for ancillary techniques and cytological diagnosis.</p><p id="Par8028"><bold>Results:</bold> There were 363 cases. 96.42% were representative samples. Only one pass was necessary in 40% of cases, and on average less than 2 passes were performed. Overall, insufficient samples represented 3.58%, and specifically 8.18% in lymph nodes smaller than 11mm in diameter (n=110), and 1.57% in lymph nodes larger than 10mm (n=253). Of the 13 insufficient samples, the average lymph node size was 9.9mm.</p><p id="Par8029"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> During ultrasound guided FNA biopsy of superficial lymph nodes, real-time decision making is determined by rapid on site evaluation.

In adults, it occurs in less than 1 % of all lung tumours(WHO 2015). To date there have been few reports on cytology of IMT of the lung.</p><p id="Par8036"><bold>Methods:</bold> Here we report the case of an asymptomatic 30-year-old man who presented an abnormal shadow in his left lung at his annual health check in his institution.</p><p id="Par8037"><bold>Results:</bold> CT scan of the chest demonstrated an intrabronchial mass in the left B3 bronchus. A bronchoscopy for airway inspection found an endobronchial tumour obstructing the left B3 bronchus. A transbronchial biopsy(TBB) and brush cytology with bronchial washing were performed. Cytology disclosed abundant spindle-shaped atypical cells seen in various-sized clusters and singly intermixed with prominent mature plasma cells and lymphocytes. Histology of the TBB specimen by immunohistochemistry suggested IMT. Segmentectomy(upper segment of left upper lobe) specimen with immunohistochemistry and FISH examination of ALK gene rearrangement confirmed IMT, namely a mesenchymal tumour with spindle cells(myofibroblastic nature) and abundant inflammatory cells.</p><p id="Par8038"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The cytologic diagnosis of pulmonary IMT is challenging due to its rarity.

She had no known systemic disease and no history of drug use.</p><p id="Par8120"><bold>Methods:</bold> This year, the patient’s complaints increased compared to the previous year. Her complaints, which started in April last year and regressed in October, this year continued during the winter and lesions spread in the malar region and hand dorsum. In her systemic examination, there was no abnormal finding other than mobile 1 cm diameter submandibular lymphadenopathy.</p><p id="Par8121"><bold>Results:</bold> On the dermatological examination, vesicle and papules completely covering the nose and haemorrhagic overlying epidermis were seen. Also there were several hyperpigmented varioloform scars in the malar region and hand dorsum. Leishmania, fungi and mycobacterium were not detected in microbiological examination. On histopathological examination, intense inflammation (mostly lymphocytes) under the ulcerated epidermis was observed. Lymphocytes were stained in the reactive pattern with CD3,4,5,30 and nuclear positivity was detected with EBER. Direct immunofluorescence was negative. EBV-VCA Ig G and EBNA Ig G positivity shown in peripheral blood.

D'Arrigo</p><p id="Par8126">*Poundbury Cancer Institute, Dorchester, United Kingdom, University Emergency Hospital, Bucharest, Romania</p><p id="Par8127"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> PRAME (PReferentially expressed Antigen in MElanoma) is a member of the CTA (cancer testis antigens) family originally identified as overexpressed in melanoma. We describe the use of PRAME in the diagnosis of sebaceous cutaneous lesions.</p><p id="Par8128"><bold>Methods:</bold> We observed expression of PRAME in normal sebaceous glands. The current panel of adjunctive stains (EMA, Adipophilin, AR and Oil Red-O) is of limited effectiveness. We present two cases of sebaceoma, both with a clinical diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma. We stained for PRAME and compared them to a number of skin tumours that may enter in the differential diagnosis.</p><p id="Par8129"><bold>Results:</bold> Both are well-circumscribed basaloid tumours lacking epidermal connection. One shows distinctive rippled, petaloid and labyrinthine architecture. Both have scattered cells showing cytoplasmic vacuolation and nuclear indentation lying singly or in small clusters, suggestive of sebaceous differentiation. PRAME-IHC confirms sebaceous differentiation in these cells and highlights numerous others more basaloid cells with less obvious sebaceous phenotype. One case is MMR deficient (MLH1 &amp; PMS2). The other lesions are negative for PRAME.</p><p id="Par8130"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The identification of cutaneous tumours with sebaceous differentiation is important because of their association with ds-DNA mismatch repair (MMR) syndromes (Lynch or Muir-Torre syndrome). Sebaceous cells are key to this diagnosis however they can be scant in sebaceoma (and sebaceous carcinoma). PRAME helps identify sebaceous differentiation even in cells with little cytoplasmic vacuolation and does not stain other clear cells. PRAME is a useful adjunctive stain to demonstrate sebaceous differentiation.</p><p id="Par8131"><bold>E-PS-05-011</bold></p><p id="Par8132"><bold>Hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans (Flegel disease) in an uncommon localisation</bold></p><p id="Par8133"><underline>F.J.

Microscopically, it consisted of a cystically dilated hair follicle, containing hair shaft fragments and communicating with the epidermis. It was lined by stratified squamous lesion with a granular cell layer and numerous hair follicles arising from the cystic wall. Thus, it was diagnosed as trichofolliculoma.</p><p id="Par8149"><bold>Results:</bold> In the second case we received a papule of the nose. Histologically, there was a central cystic cavity, with keratin pearls and without hair shafts, connected with numerous small sebaceous nodules. Each epithelial component was surrounded by a dense collagenous stroma. There were also small vessels, with perivascular fibroplasia. It was diagnosed as a folliculosebaceous cystic hamartoma (FSCH).</p><p id="Par8150"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Due to the rarity of the lesion, some studies consider FSCH to be a very late stage of trichofolliculoma. However, the lack of communication with the surface, along with the stromal component is considered a distinct difference between the two entities. Moreover, a study of chronological changes in trichofolliculoma showed no features indicating the replacement of the regressing secondary hair follicles by any sebaceous elements.</p><p id="Par8151"><bold>E-PS-05-014</bold></p><p id="Par8152"><bold>Primary anorectal melanoma – a diagnostic challenge of a mimicking neoplasm</bold></p><p id="Par8153"><underline>J.

PPTs are usually benign however malignant transformation has been recorded in very rare cases.</p><p id="Par8166"><bold>Methods:</bold> Current literature categories PPT into 3 categories - benign, low grade malignant and high grade malignant. Low grade features include stromal invasion and mild cytopathological abnormalities. Infiltrative growth, marked atypia, high mitotic activity and geographic necrosis may indicate malignant transformation. The differential diagnosis includes squamous cell carcinoma and trichilemmal cysts.</p><p id="Par8167"><bold>Results:</bold> We report a case of a 70 year old gentleman with a 9 month history of a rapidly growing scalp mass. Radiology demonstrated a multi cystic lesion with bony erosions and small vessels connecting the lesion to the epidural space. Initial biopsy revealed mildly atypical squamous nests with evidence of trichilemmal keratinisation. A proliferating trichilemmal neoplasm was suspected however further characterisation could not be made. The excision was performed and showed features consistent with a low grade PPT. The tumour showed mild to moderate cytological atypia and focal infiltrative growth pattern. There was no evidence of tumour necrosis or abnormal mitotic figures.</p><p id="Par8168"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The determination of malignant potential in a proliferating pilar tumour can be challenging given the small number of cases reported in current literature.

Multiple biopsies were performed between 2015 and 2018.</p><p id="Par8175"><bold>Results:</bold> Biopsies showed a vaguely nodular histiocytic infiltrate in the upper dermis, increasing over time to occupy all of the dermis thickness. By immunohistochemistry, the histiocytes expressed CD68, S100, but not CD1a. This was accompanied by an intense polymorphous inflammatory infiltrate, composed predominantly of plasma cells with mild atypia, prominent nucleoli, but no light chain restriction. Initially the plasma cell infiltrate was periadnexal and interstitial, but eventually became diffuse. Neither peripheral blood alterations nor adenopathies or visceromegalias were noted.

Hached Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia</p><p id="Par8249"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Angiosarcoma represents 5% of all malignant skin tumours. It is an aggressive neoplasia showing blood or lymphatic vessel differentiation. The head and neck are the most common sites.</p><p id="Par8250">We aimed to delineate the clinical and histopathological features of the cutaneous angiosarcoma.</p><p id="Par8251"><bold>Methods:</bold> We report two cases of cutaneous angiosarcoma diagnosed in the year of 2019. The first patient was a 56-year-old man who presented erythematous infiltrated lesion centred by two purple keratotic papules in the nose. The second patient was a 74-year-old man who presented ulcerative lesion with infiltrated border of the scalp for 6 months.</p><p id="Par8252"><bold>Results:</bold> Both patients have had a skin biopsy. Histopathologic examination revealed irregular anastomosing vascular channels in the dermis, lined by endothelial cells with enlarged and hyperchromic nuclei, dissecting collagen bundles, and surrounding vascular structures and eccrine ducts. Initially, for the second case, a melanoma of the scalp was strongly suspected. An immunohistochemical study, for both patients, was done. It was positive for CD31 and ERG and negative for CD34 , HHV-8 and HMB-45. The diagnosis of cutaneous angiosarcoma was retained. A granulomatous rosacea was associated to the angiosarcoma of the nose.</p><p id="Par8253"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Cutaneous angiosarcoma is a rare malignant vascular tumour and predominantly seen in the white‑skinned people.

He sought outpatient care an ulcerated nodular lesion, which was painless and had evolved for 9 months. On examination, the tumour lesion measured about five centimetres in diameter and had a vegetating ulcerative aspect in the pre-sternal region. Underwent surgery for excision of the lesion, after being referred to the pathology service.</p><p id="Par8260"><bold>Results:</bold> The result of the anatomopathological examination was biphasic neoplasia consisting of epithelial and stromal components with a high mitotic index. Immunohistochemical examination reveals biphasic malignant cutaneous neoplasia consisting of a basaloid cell component of eosinophilic cytoplasm, a high nucleus-cytoplasm ratio, and evident nucleoli, forming infiltrative beams with important mitotic activity and follicular differentiation. There is a distinct and intermixed component to the epithelial blocks, consisting of atypical spindle cells and with mitotic activity a myxoid stroma. The immunoassay panel shows positivity for p63 protein in the epithelial component, with a high proliferative index in both components. The set of findings favours low-grade trichoblastic carcinosarcoma.</p><p id="Par8261"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Trichoblastic carcinosarcoma is a recently recognized adnexal neoplasm in the WHO classification of skin.

Biological behaviour and clinical course of AST remains largely unknown. Nevertheless, ancillary diagnostic techniques offer new opportunities.</p><p id="Par8267"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present three clinical cases of skin lesions for female patients of 17, 6 and 44 years old. Local excision was performed and AST diagnosis was established with recommendations to obtain sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. Positive SLN were detected in two cases. Immunohistochemical (IHC) and molecular testing was performed to present more relevant diagnosis.</p><p id="Par8268"><bold>Results:</bold> Intrinsic pattern was observed in IHC reactions with p16 and p21, aberrations at typical chromosomal loci were detected in FISH, and no mutations were identified after HRAS/BRAF genetic testing for a 17 years old patient. No chromosomal aberrations were identified for a second patient after comparative genomic hybridization. Significant cytological atypia, strong positive IHC reaction with HMB-45 and Ki-67 activity 10% were observed in metastatic cells of adult patient’s SLN.</p><p id="Par8269"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> AST diagnosis remained just for a 17 years old patient, meanwhile SN and a Spitzoid melanoma diagnoses were established in the other two cases, respectively.

Some of these proliferations are focal incidental findings and not the primary cause of the alopecia.</p><p id="Par8275"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 57-year old woman, skin type V, presented with multiple ill-defined patches of alopecia in absence of erythema, scale, tufting or follicular plugging. The patient was otherwise fit and well with no relevant past medical history.</p><p id="Par8276"><bold>Results:</bold> Histopathology from the scalp biopsy revealed diffuse loss of hair follicles and multiple cystic structures with ‘tadpole’ appearance lined by ductal epithelium within a hyalinised stroma in the superficial dermis. Rare miniaturised hair follicles and follicular scars were present. Inflammation was minimal. A diagnosis of scarring alopecia with diffuse multiple syringomas was made.</p><p id="Par8277">Mehregan &amp; Mehregan described syringoma-like eccrine sweat duct proliferations in scarring and non-scarring alopecia; they felt that eccrine duct hyperplasia was an incidental finding and did not play a major role in causing alopecia.

Dermatological reactions (keratosis pilaris, pruritus, dry skin, alopecia) are its most common non-haematological adverse effects. Their management is challenging, in the absence of alternative anticancer agents.</p><p id="Par8296"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 49 year old woman presented with a 10 year history of hair thinning and hair loss in the fronto-temporal area with no discrete patches, focal perifollicular scale and mild erythema. Her past medical history was remarkable for chronic myeloid leukaemia treated with Nilotinib.</p><p id="Par8297"><bold>Results:</bold> Histopathology from the scalp biopsies showed an increased number of telogen hair follicles and an increased number of fibrous tracts in the subcutaneous tissue. Interface changes were seen at the infundibulum, with perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate and fibrosis. Partial loss of the sebaceous gland was also present.</p><p id="Par8298">Although clinically non-scarring, a histopathological diagnosis of scarring alopecia consistent with early lichen planopilaris on a background of female pattern hair loss was made.

The creamy coloured lesion was 0,8cm in diameter, localised in the subcutaneous tissue. In the dermis, clusters of mostly epithelioid, and rarely spindled cells with vesicular nuclei forming groups, sometimes micronodular; separated by dense collagenous stroma are seen on a myxoid background. The lesion contains approximately 12-13/10HPF mitoses.</p><p id="Par8340"><bold>Results:</bold> Fibrohystiocytic tumours, muscle derived lesions and neural lesions such as nerve sheath myxoma were considered in differential diagnosis. Immunohistochemical studies showed strong positive staining with vimentin, MITF and NSE. Negative staining of PanCK and EMA and strong positive staining with vimentin supported lesion’s mesenchymal origin. While S100 and SOX10 negativity excluded neural sheath tumours and classical neurothekoma, negative staining of desmin and MyoD1 excluded muscle derived tumours. CD34 negativity excluded dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. GFAP was performed due to lesion’s resemblance of cutaneous meningioma and came out negative.

We present a case of cutaneous metastasis arising from an urothelial bladder carcinoma in a male patient who had undergone a radical cystectomy 17-months previously.</p><p id="Par8405"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 86-year-old male presented with a 20-day history of an ulcerated nodule in his upper lip. His past medical history included a radical cystectomy that he had undergone 17 months previously, due to a high-grade urothelial bladder carcinoma(pT3). Punch biopsy was performed to the patient with suspicion of skin tumour.</p><p id="Par8406"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopic view of biopsy showed subcutaneous infiltration of tumour. The infiltrative neoplastic cells were arranged haphazardly with the loss of polarity. The nuclei were hyperchromatic and, prominent nucleoli were present.

University Hospital of Santiago de Compostela, Spain</p><p id="Par8412"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Risk factors for aggressive behaviour in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) include histological type, the presence of a squamous component, perineural invasion, and the distance to the nearest margin. Yet, lymphovascular invasion is very rarely reported and its relevance remains unknown.</p><p id="Par8413"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 85-year-old woman consulted for a slowly-growing lesion in her nose. Personal medical history included no previous skin diseases.</p><p id="Par8414">Clinical examination revealed a 9 mm, erythematous, indurated, lesion on the tip of her nose.

The histopathologic appearance is sometimes worrisome and may be misleading, raising the suspicion of a synchronous in situ or malignant epithelial overgrowth.</p><p id="Par8432"><bold>Methods:</bold> The aim of our study is to gain further insight into the epidermal hyperplasia associated with a spitzoid melanoma. Emphasis is placed on the importance of immunohistochemistry for establishing the correct diagnosis, as well as on the differential diagnosis with other entities. Similar to basaloid hyperplasia and Borst-Jadassohn phenomenon, the true nature of squamoid epidermal induction is poorly understood.</p><p id="Par8433"><bold>Results:</bold> We present a case of a 42 year old female diagnosed with spitzoid melanoma with peculiar epidermal hyperplasia. On standard examination the tumour exibits characteristic features of a malignant spitzoid lesion with marked atypical epidermal hyperplasia initially considered a synchronous squamous cell carcinoma. Ancillary test were used to document these lesions. In this way the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma was ruled out, and the epidermal changes are considered benign.</p><p id="Par8434"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Sometimes melanoma is associated with pseudoepitheliomatous epidermal hyperplasia. The presence of prominent epidermal changes may make the clinical recognition difficult and lead to confusion with a collision scenario of squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. Furthermore, a pathologist focusing on the epidermal changes may consider a squamous cell carcinoma and fail to recognize the melanoma if, for example, a superficial biopsy in performed. Immunohistochemistry is crucial for establishing the correct diagnosis for this type of lesion and for the differential diagnosis.</p><p id="Par8435"><bold>E-PS-05-052</bold></p><p id="Par8436"><bold>Malignant proliferating trichilemmal tumour- a rare entity with aggressive pathological features</bold></p><p id="Par8437"><underline>S.

Only hundreds of cases are reported, fewer than 50 being well-documented. We report a case of MPTT and discuss associated aggressive pathologic features.</p><p id="Par8440"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 47 –year old woman presented to the Hospital, with 3 large, firm, painless, subcutaneous nodules, in the occipital and vertex region, which have grown fast in recent months. The patient underwent surgery, the tissue fragments being referred to the Pathology Department. For histological examination we used HE stained slides and immunohistochemical staining for CD34, calretinin, EMA and Ki67 antibodies.</p><p id="Par8441"><bold>Results:</bold> Two of the lesions proved to be pilar cysts. The third tumour (occipital region), was a relatively well circumscribed 3.9x3.8x1.2cm nodule; histologically a subepidermal squamous infiltrative proliferation was identified, with multilobular architecture, solid and cystic areas. The cystic areas had centrally dense keratin and necrotic material, lined by squamous epithelium with trychilemmal keratinisation and cytological atypia. The solid lobules displayed marked atypia, epithelial pearls formation, frequent mitoses (7/HPF) and Ki67-90%.</p><p id="Par8442"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Based on CD34 and calretinin intense positive immunoreactions in tumour cells, lacking connection to epidermis and cystic areas resembling proliferating pilar tumour, we made the final diagnosis of MPTT. In short, we present a very rare case of MPTT, its particularity consisted of histological aggressive features: marked cytological atypia, numerous atypical mitotic figures and very high Ki67 index.

The largest bit measured 2 x 1.5 cm and the cut surface was gelatinous.</p><p id="Par8449"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopic examination showed large pools of mucin arranged in lobules, separated by collagenous septae. Epithelial tumour cells arranged in small clusters, tubules and cribriform patterns were floating in the pools of mucin. Individual tumour cells showed scant cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells were positive for CK7, ER, PR and negative for CK20, CDX2, S100p, Chromogranin, Synaptophisin, as the Ki67 was very low.</p><p id="Par8450"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Cutaneous mucinous carcinomas may present with a variety of clinical presentations.

Fernandez</p><p id="Par8540">*Hospital de Navarra, Spain</p><p id="Par8541"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an aggressive malignancy whose only potentially curative treatment is surgery. Most cases are unresectable because of distant metastases or vascular invasion. Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is used as an effort to downstage locally advanced tumours, allowing surgical resection.</p><p id="Par8542"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma treated with NAT and subsequently operated from 2017 to 2019. Changes in radiological and pathological TNM stage and adjuvant treatment were reviewed, paying special interest in tumour regression degree (modified Ryan Scheme), presence of positive nodes, margins status and occurrence of relapses.</p><p id="Par8543"><bold>Results:</bold> Fourteen cases were found aged between 44 and 81. One case showed total response to treatment (GRT0); 10 cases, partial response (GRT2) and 3 cases, low response (GRT3). Nine cases showed positive nodes, 7 of which were not imaged detected previous to NAT. Surgical resection margins were negative in eleven cases. 6/12 cases that received post-adjuvant treatment developed posterior locoregional relapses or distant dissemination (average time to follow-up 10 month)</p><p id="Par8544"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> NAT allows a potentially curative surgical treatment of locally advanced pancreatic tumours, reduce tumour volume and allows negative resection margins.

Herlea</p><p id="Par8549">*Emergency University Hospital Bucharest, Romania</p><p id="Par8550"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Gastric choriocarcinoma accounts for less than 0.1% of gastric cancers, almost always showing admixed adenocarcinoma. We present a case of a 78 year-old woman with recurrent upper digestive tract haemorrhage and subsequent severe anaemia.</p><p id="Par8551"><bold>Methods:</bold> The patient underwent upper endoscopy which revealed a large tumour located in the proximal portion of the stomach. Biopsies were taken and showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. The CT scan identified numerous enlarged perigastric lymph nodes, hepatic and peritoneal metastases. Beta hCG levels were not preoperatively determined. Palliative gastrectomy was performed, as the patient did not respond to conservative therapy.</p><p id="Par8552"><bold>Results:</bold> The specimen showed an 11 cm sessile, ulcerated tumour, located along the lesser curvature of the stomach, also involving the gastroesophageal junction. Microscopically, the tumour had two discrete components: the distal part of the tumour consisted of tubulo-papillary adenocarcinoma, while the proximal portion of the mass was represented by choriocarcinoma. The latter showed cytotrophoblastic nests/sheets inconstantly rimmed by syncitiotrophoblast, with wide areas of haemorrhage and necrosis, and was vaguely reminiscent of squamous cell carcinoma, particularily because it also involved the oesophageal squamous mucosa. The choriocarcinomatous differentiation was confirmed by immunohistochemical stains, which revealed positivity for hCG, PLAP, CK7 and p63.</p><p id="Par8553"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Gastric choriocarcinomas are aggressive, frequently haemorrhagic tumours. Thus, preoperative diagnosis is important and can be established through adequate bioptic samples and preoperative hCG levels. They may also mimic squamous cell carcinoma, but careful evaluation and immunohistochemical stains clarify this issue.</p><p id="Par8554"><bold>E-PS-06-010</bold></p><p id="Par8555"><bold>Metastatic melanoma to an ileostomy reversal specimen – an incidental finding</bold></p><p id="Par8556"><underline>A.

Two discrete indurated areas were found close to the resection margins. They showed focal haemorrhage on cut section and were entirely submitted. Microscopically, two intramural well-circumscribed deposits of 1 and 0,5 cm were found; sheets of pleomorphic epithelioid cells with cytoplasmic granular brown pigment and prominent nucleolated nuclei eroded the overlying mucosa.</p><p id="Par8560"><bold>Results:</bold> The morphology was consistent with metastatic melanoma. According to the clinician, a previous diagnosis of dysplastic nevus was made three years earlier in another unit. This cutaneous tumour, located on the anterior chest wall, was completely excised. Because no other radiologic or endoscopic abnormalities were found during admission, three-month follow-up was decided. Unfortunately, the patient presented shortly before with massive upper digestive haemorrhage. Similar deposits were found along the resected duodenal specimen and in a liver biopsy performed once the patient was stable.</p><p id="Par8561"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Careful macroscopic examination of seemingly bland specimens is of paramount importance in daily practice, especially because complete patient history may sometimes be lacking at the time of processing. In our case, thorough sampling led to better patient care, with targeted therapy being considered at the moment by the multidisciplinary team. Additionally, closer dermatology follow-up should be considered in patients with dysplastic nevi.</p><p id="Par8562"><bold>E-PS-06-011</bold></p><p id="Par8563"><bold>Unusual histopathological findings in cystic lymph node</bold></p><p id="Par8564"><underline>M.

The histochemistry study showed that the microorganisms were PAS positive but were negative for Grocott's methenamine silver stain and mucicarmine. Because of these findings, diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis was made. In the cystic lymph node of the second case were observed epithelial tumour cells and lymphovascular invasion of soft tissues.

Physical examination was unremarkable. An upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsies was performed.</p><p id="Par8584"><bold>Results:</bold> Thickened gastric folds and mottled mucosa were observed endoscopically. Morphology showed diffuse infiltration of gastric mucosa by a monotonous population of small lymphoid cells, expressing CD3, CD5, Bcl-2 and CD8, without expression of CD10 and CD20, and low proliferation index. No intraepithelial lesion, glandular disruption, inflammatory activity or intestinal metaplasia were seen. Immunohistochemistry for H. pylori was negative.

Most patients were diagnosed at early-stage: pT1a (n=3); pT1b (n=2); pT2 (n=1). Histopathology showed tubular (n=3), mucinous (n=2) and poorly cohesive (n=1) histotypes, with intestinal-type adenoma in two cases. EBV-ISH and CMV-IHC were negative in all cases. Digital automated counting of immune cells (nº positive cells/20x power-field) showed abundance of CD4+, GATA3+ and CD8+ T-cells in non-NM(stroma:245/152/181; intraepithelial:8/23/46) and CD4+, CD8+ and FOXP3 T-cells in GC (stroma:133/48/46; intraepithelial:27/33/26).

Although several articles report cases of such instances, very few cases with heterotopic ossification in metastatic colorectal carcinoma have been reported.</p><p id="Par8626"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present the case of a 60-year-old male patient with advanced metastatic colorectal carcinoma presenting with a hypogastric eventration adjacent to a terminal surgical stoma with suspected secondary lesions.</p><p id="Par8627"><bold>Results:</bold> The patient underwent right hepatectomy and liver lobectomy two years ago for metastasis and was currently being treated with chemotherapy. Prior to surgery, positron emission tomography-computed tomography showed an additional liver lesion as well as calcifications on the midline of the anterior abdominal wall, consistent with the suspected peristomal secondary lesions. Histopathological examination of the aforementioned lesions showed multiple metastases of colorectal carcinoma with extensive osseous metaplasia and focal cartilaginous endochondral ossification.</p><p id="Par8628"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Heterotopic ossification or osseous metaplasia is defined by the extra-skeletal formation of bone tissue. This phenomenon is widely found in a variety of neoplasias, benign or malignant in nature. Studies suggest that a stromal pluripotent cell transformation into osteoblasts is involved rather than tumour cell differentiation.

The aim of the study is to assess its expression in gastric carcinomas and its correlation with clinico-pathological features.</p><p id="Par8634"><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-seven consecutive AGCs, treated only with surgery, in 1986 were immunohistochemically investigated for NOVA2 expression as well as ERG (endothelial specific marker) and mismatch repair proteins. Positive NOVA2 nuclei were counted along tumour invasive margin in five consecutive HPFs and the mean value was calculated. NOVA2 values were correlated with clinico-pathological features and statistical analysis was performed with SPSS.</p><p id="Par8635"><bold>Results:</bold> NOVA2 expression was observed in ECs inside the tumour and in the surrounding tissue, but not in tumour cells.

Thus, it is fundamental to identify new specific targets for therapy. As it was seen for ovarian and colorectal carcinomas, our data demonstrates that high levels of NOVA2 are related to poor prognosis and may affect AGCs progression.

We sought to determine the role of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSC) within aggressive areas of these tumours.</p><p id="Par8651"><bold>Methods:</bold> Paired samples were taken from 'indolent' and 'aggressive' areas of tumour from each patient, as defined histologically. Each sample was analysed using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry to determine the mRNA, miRNA and protein expression patterns associated with EMT and CSC. Differences in expression patterns between paired samples were analysed. Additionally, these expression patterns were correlated with clinical outcomes for each patient.</p><p id="Par8652"><bold>Results:</bold> Our molecular studies identified a range biomarkers expressed in GEJA which were significantly associated with adverse clinical outcomes, including tumour regression grade, disease recurrence, overall survival and disease free survival. These biomarkers showed potential for use as prognostic biomarkers individually, or as part of a combined predictive model. Additionally, interrogation of mRNA and miRNA expression data revealed a number of signalling pathways involved in regulation of CSCs in GEJA.</p><p id="Par8653"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Biomarkers of EMT and CSCs hold great promise in GEJA as prognostic aids and in development of drug therapies. Presently, GEJA are often treated with therapies designed for gastric and/or oesophageal adenocarcinomas, yet it is believed that GEJAs represent a biologically distinct subset of tumours. In light of the aggressive characteristics associated with CSC and EMT, accurate delineation and a greater understanding of these processes in GEJA is important to improve our treatment of patients with this disease.</p><p id="Par8654">Funding: BDIAP Trinity Translational Medicine Institute Trinity College Dublin</p><p id="Par8655"><bold>E-PS-06-023</bold></p><p id="Par8656"><bold>Concomitant bifocal Kaposi sarcoma with tubular adenoma and hyperplastic polyp in a background of ulcerative colitis</bold></p><p id="Par8657"><underline>M.A. Diwan*</underline>, N.

The first biopsies revealed severe ulcerative oesophagitis and areas described as suspicious for high-grade epithelial dysplasia. Subsequent biopsies were assessed in our department.</p><p id="Par8678"><bold>Results:</bold> Histologically, a wide area of the epithelium showed ulceration. In its lower third, adjoining the ulcerative lesion, the oesophagus lining was thinner, depicting features of cytonuclear atypia. However, in the context of acute inflammation, these alterations were rather in keeping with the diagnosis of indefinite for dysplasia, probably regenerative. Accompanying these findings, an unusual inflammatory infiltrate, rich in plasma cells, was observed in the sub-epithelial connective tissue.

The immunohistochemical profile included a series of diagnostic biomarkers (EBV, the microsatellite instability profile - MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6, p53, E-cadherin, Muc2, Muc5AC, Muc6, CDX2, CD10, Her2neu)</p><p id="Par8771"><bold>Results:</bold> 12 were male patients with a mean age of 54.33 years and 5 female patients with an average age of 46.8 years. We studied the histopathological parameters, tumour budding, lymphovascular and perineural invasion in all cases. Seventeen cases showed an EBV negative, stable microsatellite phenotype with diffuse nuclear positivity for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6 and diffuse positivity for E-cadherin. The difference in staining was observed with p53, placing them in the fourth and fifth prognostic groups, with subtyping based on aberrant Muc2, Muc5AC, Muc6 and CDX2 expression. Her2neu immunopositivity revealed 4 cases identified as 3+ (positive) and 8 cases established as 2+ (equivocal).</p><p id="Par8772"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The classification of gastric carcinomas based on molecular and immunohistochemical biomarkers is applicable for diagnostic purposes in order to establish de novo gastric cancer prognostic groups and the novo targeted therapies, aside from Trastuzumab eligible patients with Her2neu positivity .

We report a rare case of collagenous gastritis in a teenage Romanian girl.</p><p id="Par8778"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 17-year-old woman was admitted to the Fundeni Clinical Institute, Gastroenterology Department, in January 2020. The patient is known to have iron deficiency anaemia for several years for which she received iron supplements without constant improvement of the haemoglobin levels. Her laboratory profile revealed hypochromic Microcytic Anaemia (Hb 10.60 g/dl) and iron levels of 12μg/dl.</p><p id="Par8779"><bold>Results:</bold> Esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and showed oedema and hyperaemia accompanied by nodularity in the gastric body; duodenal mucosa looked normal. The gastric biopsy performed showed mild chronic gastritis and subepithelial collagen deposits highlighted by tenascin and trichrom stains on both antral and gastric body mucosa. Colonoscopy was also performed and showed a normal mucosal appearance.</p><p id="Par8780"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Considering the rarity of this entity, especially in the paediatric population, the lack of etiological factors and the fact that it has not yet been proven the transition from paediatric-type to adult-type disease, endoscopic and histological follow-up of these patients is mandatory.

In our study, we correlated immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1 with PMS-2 and MSH-6 in colorectal carcinoma</p><p id="Par8786"><bold>Methods:</bold> Seventy nine colorectal carcinoma cases, 48.1% above the age of 60 years and male to female ratio was 1.2:1 were retrieved from Department of Pathology, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore archives from January 2017 to December 2018. Pre-operative treated cases were excluded. PD-L1 (CAL 10 clone), PMS-2 and MSH-6 immunostaining for microsatellite instability was done on paraffin embedded formalin fixed blocks.</p><p id="Par8787"><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 79 cases, most common histological type was adenocarcinoma (88.6%) with grade 2 seen in 57% patients. Most were T- stage 3 (51.9%) and 4 (20.3%) with 51.9% patients having nodal positive status. PD-L1 staining was quantified by intensity of staining and percentage of tumour positive cells. PD-L1 tumour cell intensity and percentage was highly significant with each other along with PD-L1 immune cell intensity and percentage, MSH-6, peritumoral lymphocytic response and significant with PMS-2+ MSH-6 loss of nuclear expression and tumour infiltrating lymphocytes. PD-L1 immune cell percentage had highly significant association with MSH-6, peritumoral lymphocytic response and significant with age, tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, lymphovascular invasion and tumour deposits.</p><p id="Par8788"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PD-L1 tumour cell positivity (&gt;5%) was seen in nearly third (41.1%) of the colorectal carcinomas cases studied.

The diagnosis should be discussed with a multidisciplinary approach as it has uncommon clinical, radiologic and histopathological findings.</p><p id="Par8794"><bold>Methods:</bold> This case report describes the case of a 67 years old woman presented with a perianal mass with no medical history. During perianal examination no rectal mucosal lesion was found, the abscess was the preliminary diagnosis. After the pathologic examination of supericial biopsy, the mass located at ischiorectal fossa was excised. Superficial and excisional biopsy shared similar morphologic, immunohistochemical properties.</p><p id="Par8795"><bold>Results:</bold> Although the spindle and storiform areas with “cigar” shaped nuclei appropriate for the leiomyosarcoma was not included in the first superficial biopsy, immunohistochemistry was supportive for the diagnosis. Gross total excision was performed and macroscopic, microscopic examination revealed a malignant tumour with epithelioid morphology. Carcinomas and malignant tumours with epithelioid morphology were ruled out. Immunohistochemistry revealed that neoplastic cells expressed h-caldesmon, smooth muscle actin, muscle specific actin and smooth muscle myosin. Lenfovascular invasion and focal microscopic invasion of surgical margins were found.</p><p id="Par8796"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Both epithelioid morphology of LMS and ischiorectal fossa location are quite rare.

A polymorphic inflammatory infiltrate was observed in the lesion periphery, which was centred on the submucosa and involved the lamina propria. There were no mitosis, necrosis, capsule formation nor vascular hyalinization. The neoplastic cells showed strong and diffuse expression using antibodies against S100 protein and were not immunoreactive for CD34, DOG1, SMA, CD117, Desmin and GFAP.

We used virtual TMAs to determine the minimum number of tissue cores needed to quantify biomarkers with the same precision as when using WTS in colorectal cancer (CRC).</p><p id="Par8894"><bold>Methods:</bold> Sections from 50 CRCs were stained with H&amp;E, and immunohistochemistry for CD3, CD20, fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and α-SMA, CD68 and CD163. Digitized H&amp;E WTS were divided into tumour centre and invasive margin regions. Virtual TMAs were created by overlaying 8 1mm circles in each region of the H&amp;E WTS. Minimal number of TMA cores was determined by Bland-Altman plots.</p><p id="Par8895"><bold>Results:</bold> For all the biomarkers, a minimum of 4 TMA cores per region was necessary for adequate quantification compared with WTS. However, 3 cores were sufficient for separate analysis of anti-CD3, anti-CD20 and anti-CD68 in the tumour centre. Anti-CD20 had the most heterogeneous expression, while anti-FAP with anti-α-SMA and anti-CD3 were most homogeneously expressed.</p><p id="Par8896"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The virtual TMA technique is a useful method to establish the minimum number of cores to be included when constructing tumour TMAs for biomarker analysis.</p><p id="Par8897">Funding: Health Research Fund of Central Denmark Region.</p><p id="Par8898"><bold>E-PS-06-058</bold></p><p id="Par8899"><bold>The expression of epithelial-cadherin (e-cadherin) and beta-catenin (β-catenin) in colorectal neoplasm</bold></p><p id="Par8900"><underline>U.A.

The aim of this study is to compare the score of E-cadherin expression (membrane and cytoplasm) and β-catenin (membrane, cytoplasm and nucleus) in the colorectal neoplasm.</p><p id="Par8903"><bold>Methods:</bold> One hundred paraffin-embedded colorectal tissue diagnosed as colorectal adenoma, well-differentiated, moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma were examined by immunohistochemistry. The expression was considered positive for E-cadherin and β-catenin when a brown colour was found in the membrane, cytoplasm or nucleus. It was assessed using a score system based on the intensity and extensity.</p><p id="Par8904"><bold>Results:</bold> The results of the study indicate that there was a significant difference between the expression of E-cadherin and histological grading of colorectal neoplasm. Expression of E-cadherin is higher in colorectal adenomas compared to well-differentiated, moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas. Meanwhile, β-catenin expression is higher in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma compared to adenoma and moderately differentiated and well-differentiated adenocarcinomas.</p><p id="Par8905"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The results suggest that down regulated of E-cadherin expression and up regulated β-catenin expression play a role in the development of colorectal neoplasm.

Babál</p><p id="Par8927">*Institute of Pathological Anatomy, Comenius University Bratislava, Slovakia</p><p id="Par8928"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Stercoral perforation (SP) is a rare complication of chronic obstipation, caused by increased pressure of intraluminal contents. It represents only 3 % of all intestinal perforations, with only around 100 cases documented in the literature so far.</p><p id="Par8929"><bold>Methods:</bold> 61-year old obese female patient with chronic obstipation and history of schizoaffective disorder of depressive type treated with combination of antipsychotic therapy, was hospitalized for 53 days for bronchopneumonia followed by urinary tract infection. A week after successful treatment patient died with elevated CRP (289 mg/l) without apparent clinical correlation. Autopsy and subsequent histopathological evaluation of necroptic samples was performed.</p><p id="Par8930"><bold>Results:</bold> Autopsy revealed free air within the peritoneal cavity and considerably dilated large intestine, from 7 cm in diameter in ascending colon to 12 cm in sigma and rectum, fully filled with hardened intestinal contents. Visceral and parietal peritoneum were diffusely thickened, covered with grey-brown sheets. Oval perforation was present 40 cm from anorectal line, on the antimesenteric side of the redundant loop of sigmoid colon. Histologically, the wall of the intestine neighbouring the perforation showed mixed inflammatory infiltrate and superficial ulcerations. Serosa was covered with purulent inflammatory infiltrate with evidence of swift granulation tissue ingrowth, pointing out older age of the lesion.</p><p id="Par8931"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Only 11% of SPs are diagnosed prior to surgery or autopsy, with mortality rate reaching 35%. Patients predisposed to SP are mainly older immobile patients with chronic therapy leading to obstipation – including mainly opioids, anticholinergic drugs or NSAIDs. Particularly prone are psychiatric patients, treated with antipsychotics or tricyclic antidepressants, which markedly promote constipation and might lead to attenuation of clinical symptoms, as in our case.</p><p id="Par8932"><bold>E-PS-06-062</bold></p><p id="Par8933"><bold>Expression of claudin-1 and claudin-4 in the oesophageal mucosa as additional criteria for evaluation of efficacy in GERD therapy</bold></p><p id="Par8934"><underline>S.

The aim was to determine the potential of standard morphological changes and markers of tight junction components as evaluation criteria for the effectiveness of GERD treatment.</p><p id="Par8937"><bold>Methods:</bold> 23 patients with GERD-related symptoms and endoscopic signs and 15 patients as controls were included. Standard proton pump inhibitor (control group) and in combination with chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronic acid on a bioadhesive carrier (study group) were used. Mucosal biopsies from distal oesophagus were taken for analysis by histopathology and claudin-1, claudin-4 and Ki-67 expression assessment by immunohistochemistry.</p><p id="Par8938"><bold>Results:</bold> GERD-specific alterations in the oesophageal mucosa were confirmed. Regression of clinical, endoscopic and histopathological parameters was noted in both groups after 4 weeks from the onset of treatment (p &lt; 0,05). In both groups expression levels of claudun-1 were statistically higher after therapy (p &lt; 0,05) whereas claudin-4 levels weren’t significantly affected (p&gt;0,001). Migration of claudin-1 expression towards the upper layers of oesophageal mucosa was revealed also. The Ki-67 level was lower after treatment, especially at the margins of the erosions (p &lt; 0,05) . The expression levels of both claudins did not correlate with clinical features and had a weak correlation with histopathological parameters including dilated intercellular spaces.</p><p id="Par8939"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The absence of significant differences between treatment options concerning reverse development of morphological parameters were established.Taken together, the expression of tight junction-related component claudin-1 and Ki-67 can be used as additional criteria for evaluation of efficacy in GERD therapy.</p><p id="Par8940"><bold>E-PS-06-064</bold></p><p id="Par8941"><bold>Immature teratoma of the greater omentum-case report and literature review</bold></p><p id="Par8942"><underline>C.

Case was attended at Lugala Lutheran hospital in Singida, Tanzania and histology was reported at Mutokiti diagnostic laboratory. Demography and clinical information were recorded. Gross and microscopic photos were taken. Histological diagnosis was confirmed by the routine Hematoxylin and eosin (H/E stain).</p><p id="Par8946"><bold>Results:</bold> A 20 years old female underwent laparotomy due to a swelling originating from the greater omentum. Tumour was removed and tissue sent for histology. Histology showed partly cystic lesion with variable differentiation including immature endodermal glands, Gut and respiratory tract epithelium. Mesodermal were adipose tissue, cartilage and bone fragments. Ectodermal derivatives characterized by squamous epithelium with its adnexal. Focally glial tissue was found. Final diagnosis was Immature teratoma of greater omentum.</p><p id="Par8947"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Omental teratomas may be difficult to diagnose clinically as it may present in protean ways due to its malignancy potential as it was in our case which was suspected to be omental tuberculosis. It is necessary for pathologist to have high index of suspicion, sample careful and examine histologically for the evidence of immature elements that are consistent with immature teratomas. Due to malignant potential of omental teratoma chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy might be needed on additional to surgery.</p><p id="Par8948"><bold>E-PS-06-065</bold></p><p id="Par8949"><bold>Schwannoma in gastrointestinal system, a rare entity: report of two cases</bold></p><p id="Par8950"><underline>B.

Schwannomas are seldomly seen gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumours, mostly in stomach, rare in lower oesophagus and colon.</p><p id="Par8953"><bold>Methods:</bold> S-100, SOX-10, CD117, SMA(smooth muscle actin), DOG1, CD34 stains were used.</p><p id="Par8954"><bold>Results:</bold> Our first case, a 59-year-old male submitted to hospital with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Endoscopic examination was performed which showed a round submucosal tumour with a central ulceration and bleeding over the upper body of the stomach. Microscopic examination revealed a mass with spindle cells, positive for both S-100 and SOX10, but nonreactive for CD117. Our second case, 43-year-old male patient had upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding. A nodular mass lesion 2 cm proximal to Z line was described by endoscopic examination.

The patient underwent gastrectomy.</p><p id="Par9021"><bold>Results:</bold> Grossly, a nodular, ulcerated, 4 cm in diameter tumour was found. The histological examination revealed a tumoral proliferation composed of small-sized epithelioid cells, few fusiforme, with solid architecture, low nuclear and cellular pleomorphism. The mucosa was spared. Tumour cells were positive for DOG1, CD117; NSE and S100 were focally positive; Synaptophysin and Chromogranin were negative. Ki 67 index was 3% and the mitotic rate was 7/20HPF. SDHB staining is not available in our service. Following these findings we could disprove the initial clinical suspicion of a recurrent paraganglioma of the stomach and the diagnosis was Gastric GIST, category 5.</p><p id="Par9022"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Based on the clinical history and exclusion of a pulmonary lesion, we suggested that a Carney-Stratakis syndrome is very likely.

Primary melanoma involving the digestive tract accounts for &lt;1% of gastrointestinal malignancies. Metastatic melanoma to the small bowel is rare, with a reported incidence of 2-5% and is commonly diagnosed late or post-mortem.</p><p id="Par9100"><bold>Methods:</bold> We report a case of a 71 year old male patient, with unremarkable history and without any suspicious cutaneous lesion, presenting with nonspecific symptoms suggestive of small bowel obstruction. Routine laboratory tests revealed a mild ferropenic anaemia. A CT scan was performed showing an occlusive tumour in the ileum and a large left inguinal lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent segmentary enterectomy.</p><p id="Par9101"><bold>Results:</bold> The excised specimen revealed an ulcerated exophytic 17cm tumour. The histopathology report showed a multinodular proliferation of epithelioid cells, some with intracytoplasmic melanin pigments, extending to the subserosa. The cells were positive for S100, T311 and HMB45. The inguinal lymph node and other seven mesenteric were also invaded by the same tumour. Criteria favouring primary melanoma include absence of other primary site or negative lymph nodes but cases should be evaluated carefully even in the absence of melanoma history based on the fact that some of the cutaneous melanomas can regress spontaneously. The case was signed out as small bowel melanoma favouring metastasis due to presence of inguinal lymphadenopathy involvement.</p><p id="Par9102"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Small bowel obstruction due to melanoma is unusual. Both primary melanoma and metastatic melanoma of the small bowel are rare entities. Metastatic melanoma of small bowel has a higher prevalence than primary tumours.

However, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is often responsible for toxic damage to the non-tumour liver. The presence of chemo-induced liver damage can have a negative impact on the functional reserve of the liver. Our study aimed to evaluate the hepatotoxicity induced by neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with colorectal liver metastases and to assess its prognostic impact.</p><p id="Par9145"><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed 50 cases of colorectal liver metastases treated by different neoadjuvant chemotherapy protocols and targeted therapies. These cases were diagnosed at the pathology department of the university hospital Mongi Slim of La Marsa over a period of four years and six months (January 2014 - July 2018).</p><p id="Par9146"><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age of the patients was 56 years with a sex ratio (M/F) of 1.38. Histological examination of the non-tumour liver revealed 28 cases of steatosis, two cases of steatohepatitis, 33 cases of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome and three cases of regenerative nodular hyperplasia. Median overall survival was 24 months. The prognostic factors were the number of liver metastases, the neoadjuvant chemotherapy protocol type and the use of targeted therapies.</p><p id="Par9147"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Hepatotoxicity of neoadjuvant chemotherapy can lead to a high risk of postoperative morbidity. However, its impact on postoperative mortality has not been entirely established</p><p id="Par9148"><bold>E-PS-07-004</bold></p><p id="Par9149"><bold>An unexpected diagnosis of ectopic pancreas in the liver</bold></p><p id="Par9150"><underline>O. Belkacem*</underline>, F. Limaiem, M.D. Zran, S. Gharbi, R. Ayadi, S. Bouraoui</p><p id="Par9151">*Department of Pathology, University Hospital Mongi Slim La Marsa, Tunisia</p><p id="Par9152"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> The ectopic pancreas is defined by the presence of pancreatic tissue in an abnormal situation, with no anatomical relationship to the main gland. We herein report a new case of an incidentally discovered ectopic pancreas in the liver.</p><p id="Par9153"><bold>Methods:</bold> This is the case of a 54-year-old hypertensive patient operated on two years previously for a sigmoid adenocarcinoma classified as pT3N1b. The evolution was marked by the installation of multiple metastases, which were predominant in the right hepatic lobe, hence, the initiation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (4 FOLFOX - ERBITUX cures). The patient underwent a right lobectomy.</p><p id="Par9154"><bold>Results:</bold> Histological examination confirmed the presence of colorectal liver metastasis. There was associated a focus of pancreatic heterotopia including acini and excretory ducts organized in lobule. There were no islets. According to the Heinrich classification system, the heterotopic pancreas was classified as type 2. The postoperative course was uneventful, however, during the follow-up period; the patient developed liver metastases in the left hepatic lobe.</p><p id="Par9155"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The diagnosis of heterotopic pancreas prior to surgery is difficult due to its non-specific clinical signs and symptoms. Diagnosis can only be established based on histopathological examination.</p><p id="Par9156"><bold>E-PS-07-005</bold></p><p id="Par9157"><bold>An unusual and rare metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma: gingiva</bold></p><p id="Par9158"><underline>B.

Genc Erdogan</p><p id="Par9159">*Trakya University Medical Faculty, Turkey</p><p id="Par9160"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Hepatocellular carcinoma mostly presents with multiple intrahepatic occurrence and metastasis. Approximately one third of the patients develop extrahepatic metastasis-mostly to lung. Oral cavity, especially gingival metastasis is very rare with less than 20 cases in English literature.</p><p id="Par9161"><bold>Methods:</bold> 60-year-old male patient is presented with diarrhoea, nausea and fatigue ongoing for 2 months. Patient had spider angiomas on his face and palmar erythema. Peripheral blood test showed anaemia, increased AST, ALT, ALP and GGT with HBV DNA 49000 IU/ml. There was no evidence of acute inflammation. USG revealed 20x19x15 cm heterogeneous liver mass on the right lobe.</p><p id="Par9162"><bold>Results:</bold> Patient also had an ulcerative oral mucosal nodule of 2 cm diameter which slightly bleeds and causes pain and discomfort. An initial oral mucosal biopsy was performed by otolaryngologist before the scheduled liver tru-cut biopsy. Biopsy showed a diffuse trabecular infiltration of polygonal cells which had abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm under the normal stratified squamous epithelium of the gingiva. There was also focal yellow/light brown pigmentation in the cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistrically, pancytokeratin was weakly positive while vimentin was negative. MelanA, HMB45 and S100 was negative and Ki67 index was high (%60). TTF1 was weakly cytoplasmic positive while Heppar was diffusely strong positive and pCEA showed canalicular staining pattern.</p><p id="Par9163"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Final diagnosis was hepatocellular carcinoma metastasis to gingiva.

Initial simple steatosis could evolve to NASH and subsequently to end-stage cirrhosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between histology and disease stage.</p><p id="Par9169"><bold>Methods:</bold> We examined 7 liver biopsies from patients, aged from 3 to 18 years, admitted to our Hospital between 2001 and 2013. Immunohistochemical assessment for Cytokeratin 7, Cytokeratin 19 and Alpha-SMA were performed.</p><p id="Par9170"><bold>Results:</bold> Patients were classified into two groups based on the histological score: the first group including 5 patients with mild steatohepatitis and 2 patients with moderate steatohepatitis; the second group showed severe inflammation and diffuse ballooning degeneration with progressive disease.</p><p id="Par9171"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> NAFLD represents one of the most important liver disease. The prevalence of NAFLD among obese children is rising up to 40-70%. Liver biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH and is fundamental for evaluating the degree of necro-inflammatory changes and fibrosis. Liver biopsy in children with risk factors could allow early diagnosis, increasing the chances of regression and reducing the progression of the liver damage in adolescence.</p><p id="Par9172"><bold>E-PS-07-007</bold></p><p id="Par9173"><bold>Light chain deposition disease associated to multiple myeloma in liver: an unusual presentation</bold></p><p id="Par9174"><underline>E.

Velasco Albendea</p><p id="Par9175">*Hospital Universitario Torrecárdenas, Spain</p><p id="Par9176"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Light chain deposition disease (LCDD) is a monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease with similar clinical-pathological manifestation to amyloidosis. The most frequent chain is Kappa and it can be associated to neoplastic disorders such as Multiple Myeloma or lymphoproliferative diseases.</p><p id="Par9177"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 49 years old male with previous diagnosis of Multiple Myeloma, costal plastocytoma and renal failure facing dialysis since 4 years ago, consulted for a generalised itching and dyspepsia. They just found out a colestatic pattern with Alcaline Fosphatase and GGT increased levels, without alterations in imaging tests. Autoimmunity and viral study were negative so they took an hepatic biopsy.</p><p id="Par9178"><bold>Results:</bold> The sample showed preserved hepatic architecture with diffuse sinusoidal rigidity due to linear deposits of an unknown material in Disse spaces resembling amyloid deposits. Immunochemistry demonstrated Kappa deposits that were negative to Congo Red or green in polarised light. After diagnosis, the patient levels of bilirubin increased and an hepatic failure caused him death.</p><p id="Par9179"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> LCDD consists in the deposition of monoclonal light chains in multiple organs. At first glance it is a challenge for histopathological diagnosis due to its specific characteristics and amyloidosis resemblance. This case is difficult because it rarely affects liver when amyloidosis frequently does and clinical manifestations of hepatic failure and cholestasis seen are rare in this entity. To add, diffuse hepatic infiltration has been described essentially as an autopsy finding.</p><p id="Par9180"><bold>E-PS-07-008</bold></p><p id="Par9181"><bold>Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma diagnosis</bold></p><p id="Par9182"><underline>L.

With poor prognosis, there is lack of standard criteria for diagnosis and treatment.</p><p id="Par9185"><bold>Methods:</bold> A series of 89 hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) were studied concerning 54 consecutive patients undergoing resection or liver transplantation. According to 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) histopathological criteria and CK7/CK19, αSMA actin and vimentin immuno-expression in single or clusters of tumour cells, HCC-CCs were searched in this group of tumours.</p><p id="Par9186"><bold>Results:</bold> Formerly classified as HCC, 8 cases expressed CK7 and CK19 where 5 cases presented combined trabecular and pseudo-glandular growth pattern. Vimentin was expressed in 6 cases and one case was αSMA positive. Microvascular invasion or intrahepatic satellite nodules were not present. Within 6 years after curative surgery, 4 cases recurred. Alcoholic liver disease was the clinical background for all patients and all were male.</p><p id="Par9187"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma is rare and frequently under-recognized due to the lack of clearly applied diagnostic criteria.

Physical examination showed no palpable splenomegaly or superficial lymph node swellings. Laboratory results included ALP, LDH, CEA and AFP levels were within normal ranges. CT imaging showed a hypodense mass, suspected as an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and FNB was performed.</p><p id="Par9194"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopic examination showed diffuse and monotonous infiltration of typical monocytoid lymphoid cells and lymphoepithelial lesions observed on some bile ducts infiltrated with these small- to medium- sized lymphocytes. Immunohistochemistry findings were positive for CD20, CD79a and PanB, whereas they were negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, bcl6, cyclinD1, CD23 and DBA44. Ki67 was estimated 1%. The patient was diagnosed with primary hepatic MALT lymphoma, specifically a low-grade malignant extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma.</p><p id="Par9195"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> According to literature review, the preoperative diagnosis of this tumour remains a challenge, due to the scarcity of specific clinical and imaging signs and should be considered in any patient at any age who presents with a liver mass or infiltration.</p><p id="Par9196"><bold>E-PS-07-012</bold></p><p id="Par9197"><bold>Hepatobiliary schistosomiasis, a case report</bold></p><p id="Par9198"><underline>A.

Hepatobiliary schistosomiasis can present with multiple cystic lesions that may be clinically and radiologically simulate inflammatory pseudo tumour or malignant liver lesions in appropriate clinical settings.</p><p id="Par9201"><bold>Methods:</bold> 70 year old male with a history of right partial nephrectomy for clear cell renal cell carcinoma having an uneventful post operative follow up for 2 years, underwent a surveillance CT scan. Multiple hepatic cystic lesions were identified and subsequent MRI and PET scan were performed for further evaluation and revealed suspicious for metastasis. Partial hepatectomy was performed.</p><p id="Par9202"><bold>Results:</bold> Biochemical indices of the liver were within normal. Macroscopically, there were multiple discrete cystic lesions in the liver parenchyma. Solid tan nodules were not seen. Histological examination revealed multiple necrotic hyalinised nodules with granulomatous inflammation within liver and dense neutrophil infiltration with microabscess formation. Within the central necrotic area are seen non-viable parasites eggs and part of worm in keeping with parasitic infestation, in keeping with Schistosomiasis. The eggs, not the worms, initiate the pathophysiology, which give rise to hepatic granulomata formation which is mediated by MHC class 11-restricted CD4+ T cells.</p><p id="Par9203"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Hepatobiliary schistosomiasis is clinically and radiologically simulate inflammatory pseudo tumour or malignant liver lesions, either primary or secondary.

Detected PSR positive areas in VSS data was divided into two groups; 5-50 μm^2 area (separated small area: SSA) and 50-10,000,000μm^2 areas (connected large area: CLA), and their % was evaluated.</p><p id="Par9210"><bold>Results:</bold> CLA was distributed mainly in Glisson/septal area. While, SSA was observed in interlobular area and small area not detected as CLA in CLA-distributed area. CLA and IS showed moderate correlation (R=0.58986), which was identical to the data in the literature. While, SSA and IS showed no correlation (R=0.12653). The average of CLA and SSA was 7.8 % and 2.7 % without no correlated between them (R=0.15931). Interestingly, SSA+CLA and IS showed moderate correlation (R=0.53112).

Lloveras Rubio</p><p id="Par9277">*Hospital del Mar, Spain</p><p id="Par9278"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease that most commonly affects the lungs and lymphoid system. Hepatic involvement is found in up to 80% of patients. However, evidence of hepatic dysfunction are infrequent and histological evaluation is only required in atypical cases.</p><p id="Par9279"><bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed four cases of sarcoidosis hepatic involvement with histological confirmation. Two patients presented dissociated cholestasis with concomitant cutaneous, lacrimal and lung involvement. The other two underwent a percutaneous hepatic biopsy because of a chronic transaminasemia of unknown aetiology in absence of pulmonary or lymphatic disease.</p><p id="Par9280"><bold>Results:</bold> The patients were middle-aged women and a 35-year-old man. Histological findings were a predominantly portal or periportal-based non-caseating granulomatous inflammation formed by sarcoid-type granulomas in different evolutive stages. These compact epithelioid granulomas showed multinucleated giant cells with occasional eosinophils and characteristically intragranulomatous fibrosis highlighted by reticulin and collagen fibres special stains. Fungal and acid-alcohol resistant bacilli infections were ruled out with additional studies. After clinical and serological correlation, a diagnosis of confirmation was made in two cases whereas a first diagnosis of suspicious was made in the other two. Although the clinical management of hepatic sarcoidosis is controversial, corticosteroid-based therapy was initiated and remission of the hepatic alterations was achieved.</p><p id="Par9281"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Hepatic involvement is frequent in systemic sarcoidosis (50-80% of the cases), and its usually asymptomatic Histological confirmation is required only in cases with atypical clinical presentation, such as analytical dissociated cholestasis, mass forming lesions in imaging technics or portal hypertension of unknown origin. On the other hand, isolated liver sarcoidosis might be the first clinical manifestation of the disease.</p><p id="Par9282"><bold>E-PS-07-022</bold></p><p id="Par9283"><bold>Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of gallbladder: a case report</bold></p><p id="Par9284"><underline>I.

Also a lymph node from the hepatic hilum was resected. On gross examination a tumour at the fundus of the gallbladder was revealed, 6,5 cm in greater diameter, extending to the neighbouring hepatic parenchyma.</p><p id="Par9288"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopy of the tumour and the lymph node (H-E stains) revealed a poorly differentiated carcinoma, consisting of round or fusiform cells with hyperchromatic nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli, arranged in nests or sheets. Less than 7% of the tumour resembled to a typical Biliary-type adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells were positive for CK8/18 (dot-like), Synaptophysin, Chromogranin, CD56 and p53.

It looks similar to clear cell HCC but with different prognosis. We report a case to add data in order to define prognosis and behaviour of this new subtype.</p><p id="Par9296"><bold>Methods:</bold> The patient is a 58-year-old man with previous diagnosis of chronic viral hepatitis B and long-time risk alcohol consumption. He came to our hospital from Romania for hypertransaminasemia and a hyperechoic liver mass 6 cm diameter. After transarterial chemoembolization it recurred, as surgical resection was not possible (located at hilum) . Liver transplant was performed.</p><p id="Par9297"><bold>Results:</bold> Explant liver showed a 7cm nodule with ill defined borders and extensive areas of necrosis and fibrosis. The surrounding liver showed micronodular cirrhosis with septa and very scarce steatosis. The tumour was a solid macrotrabecular mass extensively necrotic in central areas. There was a peripheral surviving area composed principally of tumour cells with abundant clear cytoplasm. On high power examination, tumour cells showed numerous tiny droplets of fat. Similar to microvesicular stetatosis and stained with adipophilin antibody. Also there were some cells intermingled with clear cytoplasms and ill-defined hyaline lumps. Macrovesicular steatosis was absent. No pericellular fibrosis was found. Lymphovascular invasion was present although the viable tumour was small and moderately differentiated.</p><p id="Par9298"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> "Lipid rich HCC" can look similar to clear cell HCC , steatohepatitic HCC or even be confused with a steatotic nodule if well-differentiated. It has been classificated as "provisional subtye" because more data are needed. We describe a case, presented for first time in relation to virus B and alcohol, with lymphovascular invasion and poor prognosis, in order to add knowledge to this new entity with very few cases previously reported.</p><p id="Par9299"><bold>E-PS-07-024</bold></p><p id="Par9300"><bold>Intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct: a case report</bold></p><p id="Par9301"><underline>M.

IPNB is rarely seen in clinical practice in Egypt. Therefore, it is important that pathologists become familiar with its histopathological features for accurate diagnosis.</p><p id="Par9304"><bold>Methods:</bold> Herein, we present a case of 59-year-old Egyptian female with an accidentally-discovered mass. Radiological examination revealed a partially cystic, partially solid focal lesion involving the whole right lobe. CA19-9 was elevated. The patient underwent extended right hepatectomy. Pathological evaluation and immunohistochemical staining of CK7, CK20, ER and PR were done.</p><p id="Par9305"><bold>Results:</bold> Grossly, multiple polypoid masses were projecting into the lumen of a cystically dilated large bile duct with intracystic haemorrhage. Microscopically, there were prominent papillary proliferations with delicate fibrovascular stalks that lacked an ovarian-like stroma as evidenced by negative ER and PR. Epithelium showed multistep progression from low grade to high grade intraepithelial neoplasia without an invasive component and CK7/CK20 positivity indicating its pancreatobiliary epithelial origin. Thus excluding mucinous cystic neoplasm and proving the diagnosis of intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct.</p><p id="Par9306"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> IPNB is a rare premalignant variant of the bile duct neoplasms, considered as the biliary counterpart of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas. It should be differentiated from other cystic lesions of the liver and bile duct like mucinous cystic neoplasm that has no communication to the bile duct system and has an ovarian-like stroma, at least focally positive for ER and PR, essential for its diagnosis.</p><p id="Par9307"><bold>E-PS-07-025</bold></p><p id="Par9308"><bold>Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver: a case report</bold></p><p id="Par9309"><underline>M.

Pathological&amp; immunohistochemical assessment are necessary for an accurate diagnosis.</p><p id="Par9312"><bold>Methods:</bold> Here we present a case of 7-year-old female presenting with abdominal distension and dyspnoea. Radiological examination revealed a cystic lesion near totally replacing the right hepatic lobe with clinical suspicion of mesenchymal hamartoma. The patient underwent extended right hepatectomy. Pathological evaluation, immunohistochemical study using CD68, heppar-1 and CD34 and PAS staining were done.</p><p id="Par9313"><bold>Results:</bold> Gross examination revealed a mass measuring 23cm on greatest dimension replacing most of right hepatic lobe. Cut sectioning showed alternating glistening greyish-white solid areas and cystic soft gelatinous areas with areas of haemorrhage and massive necrosis.</p><p id="Par9314">Histological examination revealed infiltration by undifferentiated oval to spindle cells and bizarre multinucleated giant cells in a myxoid background with massive necrosis. Malignant cells exhibited high degree of anaplasia, indistinct cell borders, cytoplasmic hyaline globules, frequent mitosis. Immunohistochemical staining was negative for heppar-1, CD34, CD68. The cytoplasmic hyaline globules were positive for PAS stain thus proving undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of liver and excluding other liver tumours.</p><p id="Par9315"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of liver is a rare malignant neoplasm of paediatric age group that could be unexpected clinically.

It can have a wide spectrum of manifestations and show different patterns of hepatic injury. DILI can present as a Drug-induced Autoimmune Hepatitis (DI-AIH).</p><p id="Par9321"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present the case of a 68-year-old female that consulted with epigastralgia, itching and choluria. The patient reported having recently taken Levofloxacyn. She had been treated with Levofloxacyn on a previous occasion with no associated symptomathology. Initial blood-work revealed hyperbilirubinemia (5,2 mg/dl) and hypertransaminasemia (AST/ALT: 1320/2091 UI/L). Viral serologies were negative and no autoantibodies (ANA, AMA, anti-LKM, ASMA) were detected.</p><p id="Par9322"><bold>Results:</bold> Follow-up analysis showed an increase in the level of transaminases and subsequently a liver biopsy was performed.

Virology negative, AFP within normal range. Surgical resection of the tumour was done. Pathological H&amp;E and immunohistochemical assessments (Hep-par1, chromogranin, synaptophysin, CD56, smooth muscle actin, LCA, CD34,TTF1&amp; Ki67) were done.</p><p id="Par9396"><bold>Results:</bold> Gross examination revealed soft greyish mass measured 13x10x6cm, with haemorrhagic cut surface. Microscopic examination revealed small to intermediately sized uniform population of tumour cells demonstrating abundant cytoplasm with round smooth contour nuclei and vesicular nuclear chromatin arranged around vascular spaces. No desmoplastic reaction was seen. Immunohistochemical study revealed that the tumour cells were negative for heppar1, LCA, CD34, TTF1 &amp; SMA and positive for CD56, synaptophysin &amp; chromogranin, Ki67 index of 50%. Diagnosis of PHNEC was done after exclusion of all origins by PET-CT and other investigations to exclude other primary sites. Three months later the patient developed recurrence tumour in the liver with metastasis to omentum and the stomach.</p><p id="Par9397"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Primary hepatic neuroendocrine tumour, despite being rare, already could be diagnosed after thorough investigations to exclude other primary sites.</p><p id="Par9398"><bold>E-PS-07-037</bold></p><p id="Par9399"><bold>Combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma mimicking focal nodular hyperplasia – a case report</bold></p><p id="Par9400"><underline>A.L.

We present a case of cHCC-CC that clinically mimicked a benign tumoral proliferation.</p><p id="Par9403"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 58 years old female was hospitalized with an expansive process in segment IV of the liver. Intraoperative echography described a well-circumscribed tumour, showing a capsule and central hypoechoic area, which was considered as suggestive for focal nodular hyperplasia. However, the patient underwent surgery, followed by gross examination and microscopic analysis.</p><p id="Par9404"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopy revealed a well-circumscribed malignant proliferation of hepatoid cells with a trabecular pattern (well-moderate hepatocellular carcinoma), areas of solid and cribriform pattern, with desmoplastic stroma (cholangiocarcinoma), as well as intricate areas showing intermediate features. Tumour necrosis was present. Lesions of portal hepatitis were seen on the background hepatic parenchyma. Immunochemistry showed positivity for OCH1E5, Glypican-3 in hepatoid areas and positivity for CK7, CA19.9, MNF116 in ductal areas, and overall negativity for CK20, CDX2, TTF1, Chromogranin A, Synaptophysin, NSE. There was a proliferation index of 10% with Ki-67. All these features were consistent with a diagnosis of cHCC-CC.</p><p id="Par9405"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma is a rare entity and this particular case, mimicking focal nodular hyperplasia highlights the importance of the pathological examination and immunohistochemical confirmation, even though the clinical and imaging context suggests a benign tumour.</p><p id="Par9406"><bold>E-PS-08Digestive Diseases Pathology - Pancreas</bold></p><p id="Par9407"><bold>E-PS-08-001</bold></p><p id="Par9408"><bold>Pancreatic insulinoma associated with pancreatic heterotopia: a clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study</bold></p><p id="Par9409"><underline>R.

Hematoxylin-eosin stain and immunohistochemical studies were performed, including synaptophysin, chromogranin, beta-catenin, actin, CD34 and S100. Previous fine needle aspiration samples were reviewed.</p><p id="Par9432"><bold>Results:</bold> Grossly, the lesion was a homogeneous, solid nodule measuring 1.8 x 1.8 cm. Histologically we observe a well-circumscribed lesion composed of disarranged ductal, acinar and neuroendocrine cells embedded in a hyalinized or fibrocellular stroma. The lesion showed pushing margins with no infiltration of the surrounding pancreatic parenchyma. Some areas were composed of fibroblastic elements with non-atypical large nuclei. Beta-catenin stain was expressed focally in the fibroblastic-like cells, whereas the remaining were negative. Two previous fine needle aspiration cytologies were reviewed and diagnosed as mucinous neoplasms, based on the presence of scant and non-displastic columnar epithelium and abundant mucin.

We present a case of a rare variant of MTC which caused diagnosis difficulties on FNA cytology.</p><p id="Par9570"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 59-years-old female presented for bilateral thyroid mass. Neck ultrasound identified multiple nodules in both thyroid lobes. A high calcitonin serum level raised the suspicion of MTC. A FNA was performed in a ultrasound suspicious small nodule, situated in upper part of the right lobe.</p><p id="Par9571"><bold>Results:</bold> The smear was highly cellular with two cell-types: small plasmacytoid cells with single or double monomorphic nucleus, corresponding to conventional MTC, and clusters and isolated bizarre giant cells, with highly pleomorphic nuclei, associated with mitotic figures. These unusual cytological features prompted a differential diagnosis with anaplastic carcinoma. The gross examination of the surgical specimen revealed, apart multiple goitrous nodules, an 8mm white-tan nodule with central calcification. On microscopy, the same two cells-types as in cytology were found: those corresponding to conventional MTC but also giant, binucleated or multinucleated cells with highly pleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleolus. In immunohistochemistry both cell-types expressed Calcitonin, CEA and Chromogranin and were negative for Thyroglobulin.</p><p id="Par9572"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The microscopical features and the immunohistochemical panel confirmed the diagnosis of giant cell MTC.

Yellowish area corresponded to a proliferation of large oncocytic cells. Proliferation index (Ki67) was 3%. p53 was not overexpressed and no loss of repair proteins was observed. Whitish area corresponded to a high-grade proliferation of granular eosinophilic cytoplasm cells with hyperchromatic nuclei. Proliferation rate (Ki67) was 15%. P53 overexpression was objectified, in addition to loss of MSH2 and MSH6. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) was performed in both tumour areas as well as in normal tissue. Somatic mutations were identified in p53 and MSH2 in the high-grade tumour area.</p><p id="Par9622"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A remarkable percentage of adrenocortical carcinomas show morphological and molecular heterogeneity. This fact must be taken into account when making a correct sampling of the specimen. High-grade tumour area was related to somatic mutations in p53 and MSH2.

Some variants, however, have an increased risk of recurrent disease and aggressive behaviour. Tall cells variant (TCV) of PTC, which is defined by the WHO-2017 classification as having ≥30% of tall cells, is recognized as an aggressive neoplasm. Here we describe the pathological findings of a peculiar thyroid nodule.</p><p id="Par9628"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 43-year-old female, euthyroid, with no relevant pathological history, presented with a 5-month-old palpable cervical mass. Thyroid ultrasound showed a 4 cm isoechogenic nodule in the right lobe, TI-RADS3. Ultrasound-guided FNAC was performed using a 23G needle, resulting in a diagnosis of malignancy (PTC). Total thyroidectomy was performed, and the entire gland was included for study.</p><p id="Par9629"><bold>Results:</bold> Specimen of 26g, consisting of right lobe (4×1.5x0.5cm) and left lobe (3.6×1.7×0.5cm). In the right lobe a 4.2×1.7cm tan tumour with a poorly-developed thin-capsule and finely granular appearance was found. Histologically, papillae and typical nuclear changes of conventional PTC could be seen, with 10-20% of the tumour showing areas of TCV. Twenty microcarcinomas (&lt;1mm) were found, with bilateral affectation. Vascular and lymphatic invasion, as well as, lymph-node infiltration were identified.</p><p id="Par9630"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We describe a PTC with tall cells showing unusually aggressive pathological features.

All tumours were positive for at least two neuroendocrine markers. The proliferative index (Ki67) ranged between 1 and 90%, and was strongly correlated (p&lt;0,05) to the biological behaviour, grade, stage and to the expression of CgA and Synaptophysin in tumour cells.

Then, those were stained with anti-Lamin-A antibody and anti-Emerin antibody. The staining intensity was evaluated and scored (0-3) by two independent observers. The average number of intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions in a high-power field was also examined.</p><p id="Par9697"><bold>Results:</bold> A weak correlation (R = 0.3654) was observed between the staining intensities of Lamin-A and Emerin. On the other hand, Lamin-A staining intensity tended to be stronger in the BRAFV600E mutation positive group than the negative group (p = 0.0688). While, there was no difference in Emerin staining intensity between 2 groups (p = 0.1490). The number of intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions was 2.48/HPF in the BRAF mutation positive group and 1.31/HPF in the negative group, although there was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.1829). Our data indicated that Lamin-A expression would be decreased and intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions would be less frequently appeared in BRAF mutation negative PTC.</p><p id="Par9698"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Lower expression of Lamin-A and Emerin results in swelling and elliptical changes of the nuclei.

The microscopical examination showed a well-defined lesion of microfollicular architecture with papillary-like nuclei. In the centre of the nodule an area with distinctly different histologic features was present: cells arranged in islands and cords with central necrosis. The tumour cells presented abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, marked nuclear pleomorphism and numerous atypical mitoses.

The aim of this study was to review published evidence on PD-L1 expression in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), for which little is known.</p><p id="Par9736"><bold>Methods:</bold> Pubmed, Embase and Scopus databases were systematically searched. Studies on PD-L1 expression in MTC and its correlation with clinicopathological variables and survival were included. A random-effect meta-analysis was performed for PD-L1 expression, odds ratios (ORs) for association with clinicopathological variables and hazard ratios (HRs) and risk ratios (RRs) for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).</p><p id="Par9737"><bold>Results:</bold> Of 670 records, 5 studies were included. Pooled prevalence of PD-L1 expression was 12.4% (CI 4.4-23.2%, I2 83%, τ2 0.02). No significant association of PD-L1 expression was found with sex, size, TNM stage, heredity, laterality, multifocality. Weak association was found with nodal metastasis (OR 1.98, CI 0.96-4.07, I2 0%, τ2 0.001).

Most ESNs harbour t(7;17)(p21;q15) which results in a fusion between JAZF1 and SUZ12. Here we describe an ESN with yet undescribed genetic alteration with a potential target for biological treatment.</p><p id="Par9813"><bold>Methods:</bold> The medical records, imaging tests, pathological findings and genetic studies of the patient have been studied and are presented.</p><p id="Par9814"><bold>Results:</bold> A 35 years old patient presented with uterine bleeding that lasted for 6 months following a labour. Ultrasound demonstrated a 1.6 cm uterine mass. Hysteroscopy revealed a 3.5 cm mass bulging into the uterine cavity. On histological evaluation the resected mass showed a cellular tumour of bland oval to spindle cells with multiple arterioles. The tumour cells stained positively for CD10, SMA, desmin, ER and PR (caldesmon, CD117 and WT1 were negative) and the tumour was diagnosed as an ESN. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on RNA extracted from the tumour paraffin block using the Archer FusionPlex Sarcoma kit.

The case was referred to our department with the diagnosis of ovarian neoplasm with peritoneal carcinomatosis.</p><p id="Par9848"><bold>Results:</bold> In the hysterectomy specimen we identified conventional leiomyomas, with no other pathological findings. The right ovarian tumour was a multilocular cyst, with papillary projections on both the internal and the outer surface of the lesion, measuring 18/10/5 cm; histological sections revealed a serous cystadenoma with focal epithelial proliferation. We found small nodules, with diameters of 2-6 mm, disseminated throughout the omentum; histopathologic examination exhibited interlacing bundles of smooth muscle cells with myofibroblasts and fibroblasts; the immune profile (positivity for smooth muscle actin, desmin and progesterone receptors) was supportive for the diagnosis of disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis.</p><p id="Par9849"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Disseminated peritoneal leiomyomatosis is a rare, benign entity, which clinically and macroscopically can easily mimic disseminated intra-abdominal malignancies, especially when associated with an ovarian tumour.

The only reported case of a seromucinous borderline tumour(SMBT) with a mural anaplastic carcinoma nodule was associated with good prognosis.</p><p id="Par9926"><bold>Methods:</bold> We report a second case of SMBT with a mural anaplastic carcinoma nodule with an aggressive clinical course.</p><p id="Par9927"><bold>Results:</bold> A 79-year-old patient presented with bilateral ovarian tumours. After surgery, a diagnosis of bilateral pT1c SMBT with microinvasive carcinoma(&lt;5 mm) and one mural anaplastic carcinoma nodule was rendered. The anaplastic carcinoma was composed of large, clear and anaplastic cells positive for cytokeratins, PAX8, and p53 “wild-type”. Peritoneal washing was positive for neoplastic cells. Hotspot KRAS mutations in the mural nodule and tumour were not found. She underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. Eighteen months later, disseminated lymphadenopathy was found. FNA of an axillary lymph node confirmed metastatic adenocarcinoma morphologically and immunohistochemically akin to the anaplastic carcinoma nodule. Shortly after, the patient died due to a pulmonary thromboembolism.</p><p id="Par9928"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although SMBT have excellent prognosis, the presence of an anaplastic carcinoma component in a mural nodule likely renders its prognosis unpredictable. Advanced age, positive peritoneal washing and involvement of the ovarian surface might also explain the unexpected aggressive course of this case.</p><p id="Par9929"><bold>E-PS-11-027</bold></p><p id="Par9930"><bold>Association of HEY2 gene rs13328928 polymorphism with the risk of endometrial hyperplasia</bold></p><p id="Par9931"><underline>A.

Fewer than twenty cases have been reported, most occurring metachronous to a bladder TCC. We report a case of an exophytic, non-invasive vaginal TCC occurring 6 years after a non-invasive bladder TCC.</p><p id="Par9990"><bold>Methods:</bold> An anterior pelvic exenteration was required for excision of the vaginal tumour. The bladder mucosa was inflamed but otherwise unremarkable. The vaginal tumour comprised a large, exophytic, carpet-like growth consistent with a non-invasive TCC. When reviewed with the original non-invasive bladder TCC, the morphology was very similar with both displaying regions of squamous differentiation.</p><p id="Par9991"><bold>Results:</bold> The pathogenesis of a vaginal TCC can be difficult to determine but could include a primary lesion, metastatic spread from the bladder, direct invasion from the bladder and implantation via seeding from the urinary tract.</p><p id="Par9992">To determine the pathogenesis, DNA extracted from the original bladder TCC and vaginal TCC were analysed by single nucleotide polymorphism array to assess copy number variation and copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH).

They are usually small and incidental finding during surgery.</p><p id="Par10068">We present a 34-year old patient with previous history of uterine bleeding.</p><p id="Par10069"><bold>Methods:</bold> The patient was misdiagnosed in another institution as miscarriage. Due to persistent elevation of the HCG serum levels (from 2350 IU/L to 5980 IU/L), ultrasound examination was performed, which led to suspected left ectopic tubal pregnancy. Five days after receiving methotrexate, the patient was again admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and vomiting. Left fallopian tube was surgically removed.</p><p id="Par10070"><bold>Results:</bold> Histopathologic examination confirmed ruptured ectopic tubal pregnancy in the isthmic portion. Small, 4 mm firm yellow nodule was attached to the fimbriae. On microscopic examination, the nodule was well-demarcated and consisted of intersected fibroblasts and hyalinized collagen bundles with few slit-like or cystic spaces covered with benign epithelium. Stromal cells were focally positive for inhibin and CD10, whereas epithelial cells coexpressed vimentin and cytokeratin 7, as well as oestrogen receptor.</p><p id="Par10071"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Ectopic pregnancy in this patient might have potentially been caused by the presence of tubal adenofibroma. Even though only few cases of coexistent ectopic tubal pregnancy and serous adenofibroma of the fallopian tube have been published in the literature, ectopic tubal pregnancy associated with other benign tumours, such as adenomatoid tumour, leiomyoma or mature cystic teratoma have been reported. These tumours might lead to partial obstruction of the fallopian tube or mimic ectopic pregnancy.</p><p id="Par10072"><bold>E-PS-11-045</bold></p><p id="Par10073"><bold>Incidental primary extranodal ovarian diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL): a case report</bold></p><p id="Par10074">N.

Primary ovarian lymphomas are rare and the prognosis is better. We describe a primary ovarian DLBCL in a 57-years-old woman who underwent surgery for a cyst in the fallopian tube.</p><p id="Par10077"><bold>Methods:</bold> We received left fallopian tube measuring 6cm long and 0,5cm in diameter and ovary whose dimensions were 4x1,5x0,3cm. There was a paratubal cyst measuring 7cm in its greatest dimension. The frozen sections were negative ( benign paratubal cyst). On permanent sections there were two lesions in the ovary measuring 0,5 and 1,3 cm respectively.</p><p id="Par10078"><bold>Results:</bold> The first one was a benign transitional (Brenner) tumour. The second one was composed of a diffuse proliferation of relatively large pleiomorphic cells with vesicular nuclei and often prominent nucleoli. The immunohistochemical survey showed: Vimentin(+), LCA(+), KerAE1/AE3(-), CD20(+), CD3(-), Bcl2(-), Bcl6(+/-), CyclinD1(-), CD10(-), CD68(-), CD10(-), absence of clonal light chains. The proliferation index was 60%. The diagnosis was DLBCL,NOS with a further note for additional tests to prove the origin. A bone marrow trephine biopsy was performed which was negative, as other diagnostic imaging techniques. So the final diagnosis was primary DLBCL, NOS. The patient received 8 circles of RCHOP, and she is free of disease, one year later.</p><p id="Par10079"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Primary ovarian lymphomas are rare. Their prognosis is better than secondary lymphomas which have to be excluded clinically.

We evaluated oestrogen levels and compared with the percentage of secretory cells in the fallopian tubes. Oestrogen receptor (ER) and Bcl-2 protein expression was assessed immunohistochemically. Secretory/stem cell outgrowth (SCOUT) represented expansion of at least 20 secretory cells.</p><p id="Par10131"><bold>Results:</bold> Immunohistochemical stain for oestrogen receptor and Bcl-2 visualized secretory cells, distinct from ciliated epithelial cells with weak ER and no Bcl-2 expression.

The uterine origin is extremely rare, only few cases have been reported hitherto.</p><p id="Par10139"><bold>Methods:</bold> We report a 66 year-old woman with a background of vaginal bleeding. Magnetic Resonance image showed a uterine enlargement of 16 cm, involving all the wall thickness. With a diagnosis of uterine sarcoma, the patient was undergone a surgical radical hysterectomy. The tumour involved all entire uterine thickness, yet no intracavitary lesion was identified.</p><p id="Par10140"><bold>Results:</bold> The histology revealed a series of contorted papillae with non-stratified nuclei and fine chromatin giving a clear appearance. By immunochemistry (ICH) the cells expressed neither oestrogen nor progesterone receptors, whereas were positive for GATA-3 and CD10. The Ki 67 was high; &gt;80%.

Tumour samples were evaluated grossly, and then microscopic examination of histological slides was carried out.</p><p id="Par10172"><bold>Results:</bold> Gross examination revealed a cylindrical shape rubbery tumour, 50 cm long, 4 cm in diameter. Its surface was smooth, grey-pink in colour, covered with a thin translucent capsule. In the section, the tumour was fibrous, with severe oedema and multiple small cysts with a diameter of up to 0.2 cm. Cysts were filled with a slightly unclear grey liquid. Histologically neoplasm was represented by elongated spindle-shaped cells that formed solid fields. It had minimal cell atypia and rare mitotic figures.

Petruleva</p><p id="Par10198">*Belarusian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, Belarus</p><p id="Par10199"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Malignancy of ovarian struma is reported in less than 5% of cases. Papillary carcinoma, as in the thyroid gland, is more common here. We present a rare case of a clear cell variant of papillary cancer in struma ovarii.</p><p id="Par10200"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 68-year-old woman has been hospitalized for a painful palpable tumour of the left ovary. After salpingo-oophorectomy, the material was examined. Macroscopically, the ovary was enlarged as a tumour node 5.0 cm in diameter. The cut surface was brown, with multiple cysts filled with jelly-like contents and solid areas. Histological and immunohistochemical studies were performed.</p><p id="Par10201"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopic evaluation of this tumour revealed a conventional type struma composed of typical small to medium sized follicles lined with cuboidal epithelium and filled with an eosinophilic colloid. In addition to this tumour there were areas significantly differed in structure. This thyroid-type tissue showed crowding follicles with irregular contours and papillary structures. They were composed predominantly of clear cells with optically empty cytoplasm. The nuclear alterations were close to those of conventional thyroid papillary carcinoma (oval shape, clearing, ground glass appearance, membrane irregularity, pseudoinclusions). Immunohistochemical staining was positive for TTF1, PAX8, Thyroglobuline. This tumour was diagnosed as a struma ovarii with a clear cell variant of papillary carcinoma.</p><p id="Par10202"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Clear cell variant of malignant struma ovarii is an extremely rare lesion. The biological nature of this tumour and its behaviour are unknown. In this case, no metastases were detected.

Past history included a large vulval cutaneous leiomyoma. There was a family history of multiple leiomyomata in her mother and sister at an early age.</p><p id="Par10208"><bold>Methods:</bold> She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy, myomectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy for multiple large solid and cystic lesions. The largest was a smooth muscle tumour of uncertain malignant potential(STUMP) and the remainder were benign leiomyomata. This unusual presentation raised suspicion of Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Carcinoma (HLRCC) which carries a risk of aggressive renal cell carcinoma. She was referred to clinical genetics.</p><p id="Par10209"><bold>Results:</bold> Sanger sequencing of the Fumarate Hydratase(FH) gene which is responsible for HLRCC was carried out which showed no evidence of a mutation at 1q43. SNP array analysis of 6 tumours including the cutaneous lesion and a leiomyoma from the proband’s sister was carried out. No loss of heterozygosity at the FH locus was detected. However, deletions of 1p were seen in five of the tumours with retention of the same 1p haplotype. Deletions of 13q were seen in three. The results indicate the absence of a germline pathogenic variant in the FH gene which is associated with HLRCC. However, deletion of 1p is a recurrent but rare finding in leiomyomata.</p><p id="Par10210"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Detection of recurrent 1p deletion with retention of the same haplotype in multiple lesions in the family is highly unusual and suggestive of a familial variant in a tumour suppressor gene in this region causing a dominant predisposition to leiomyomata and as yet unknown risk of renal cancers.</p><p id="Par10211"><bold>E-PS-11-065</bold></p><p id="Par10212"><bold>Placental metastases of maternal anaplastic thyroid carcinoma: a case report</bold></p><p id="Par10213"><underline>I.

The umbilical cord measured 42 cm and showed no abnormalities. Microscopically, the tumours were composed of cells with marked atypia, eosinophil cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei with prominent nucleoli. The infiltrate was confined to the maternal space, occupying perivillous spaces, but no villous infiltration was identified.

She was diagnosed with an endometrial polyp with focal complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia in D&amp;C. She underwent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.</p><p id="Par10225"><bold>Results:</bold> Macroscopic examination revealed a 2.5cm well-circumscribed soft mass, with a yellow cut surface, on the anterior surface of the fundus and one small intramural leiomyoma of 0.5cm. In the endometrial cavity there was a 2cm endometrial polyp, with an early clear cell carcinoma. Microscopically, the intramural tumour proved to be a lipoleiomyoma.</p><p id="Par10226"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Lipoleiomyomas are found incidentally during surgery for other reasons. They are associated with hyperoestrogenic-related conditions. Our findings are in concordance with the ones referred in the literature, of concomitant gynaecologic malignancy. In conclusion the presence of adipocytes in an otherwise normal leiomyoma should lead to further detailed clinical and pathological evaluation in order not to overlook a coexistent gynaecologic malignancy. Although lipoleiomyomas have a favourable prognosis, the pathogenesis and clinical significance of these rare neoplasms remain to be clarified.</p><p id="Par10227"><bold>E-PS-11-070</bold></p><p id="Par10228"><bold>Recurrent struma ovarii with incidental peritoneal inclusion cysts.

Osteoclastic giant cells (OGCs) have been reported mainly in pancreatic and breast carcinomas. OGCs squamous cell carcinoma in uterine cervix is an unusual histological variant.</p><p id="Par10248"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present a case of a 79-year-old woman with a 4-month history of irregular vaginal bleeding. Colposcopy was performed and a cauliflower-like mass was identified at the front lip of the uterine cervix. Biopsy was performed.</p><p id="Par10249"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopically the tumour was composed of infiltrative nests of poorly differentiated nonkeratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Interspersed in between these tumour cells were numerous osteoclastic giant cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with devoid of nuclear atypia. Immunohistochemistry was performed using P63, cytokeratin (pankeratin-CK), Vimentin, CD68, CD20, and CD3. CK and P63 were strongly positive in the squamous component and negative in the OGCs, while Vimentin and CD-68 were strongly positive in the giant cell population and negative in the squamous component.

This case illustrates that clear cells and stemness in HGSC can cause multiple immunohistochemical pitfalls, thereby mimicking a dysgerminoma component.</p><p id="Par10272"><bold>Methods:</bold> A unilateral ovarian neoplasm of a 77-years-old lady was referred to an academic laboratory for further investigation. The reason for the referral included the presence of clear cell areas associated with a bizarre immunohistochemical staining pattern, evoking the diagnosis of a dysgerminoma. Additional immunohistochemical stainings and targeted next-generation sequencing were performed to establish the final diagnosis.</p><p id="Par10273"><bold>Results:</bold> A unilateral ovarian mass with prominent atypia, numerous mitoses and necrosis showed clear cells with associated CD117 and PLAP expression, and focal immunoreactivity for glypican-3 and podoplanin. The tumour showed diffuse expression of EMA, CK-AE1/AE3, PAX8 and WT1, without immunoreactivity for OCT4 and SALL4. The tumour showed a mutation-type p53 staining pattern and harboured a pathogenic TP53 missense mutation. This profile corresponded with a HGSC, and not with a dysgerminoma.</p><p id="Par10274"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> HGSC of tubo-ovarian origin is a malignant neoplasm with heterogeneous morphology, comprising various architectural patterns and diverse cytological aspects, which often coexist within a single tumour. Clear cell areas may mimic other tumour types, thereby causing diagnostic confusion. The expression of CD117, PLAP, glypican-3 and podoplanin in HGSC might indicate stemness, i.e. the tumour acquires pluripotency, probably indicating a more aggressive behaviour. Future studies should investigate whether stemness in HGSC identifies a patient subgroup with poor prognosis.</p><p id="Par10275">Funding: M.R.

Because systemic disease was not detected, we reported reactive kappa restricted plasmacytosis with Russell bodies</p><p id="Par10324"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The real incidence and importance of Russell body accumulation within the germinal centre in lymph node is unknown because of rarity. So, presence of aggregates of plasma cells with Russell bodies demonstrating kappa or lambda light chain clonality should not be mistakenly interpreted as a tumour, especially with the absence of additional histopathological and clinical features.</p><p id="Par10325"><bold>E-PS-12-007</bold></p><p id="Par10326"><bold>Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease: case report of two teenagers in Brazil</bold></p><p id="Par10327"><underline>M.

Japan described it in 1972.The disease has been found worldwide, predominantly in Asia, but remains rare in the United States and Europe. We report two cases of Kikuchi-Fujimoto's disease.</p><p id="Par10330"><bold>Methods:</bold> The morphologic characteristics associated with immunohistochemical study were evaluated according to scientific literature.</p><p id="Par10331"><bold>Results:</bold> The 14-year-old male patient presented subclavicular mass, fever, joint pain, prostration and weight loss with the diagnostic hypothesis of tuberculosis. The 18-year-old female patient presented painful cervical lymphadenomegaly, a history of contact with pigeons and cats and the diagnostic hypothesis of toxoplasmosis or lymphoma. Both had histopathological characteristics compatible with the diagnosis of Kikuchi-Fujimoto's disease, research for alcohol-resistant bacillus and negative fungi and benign evolution after diagnosis. The histopathological findings included nodal architecture distorted by areas of coagulative necrosis, with abundant carioretic debris, surrounded by histiocytes, T lymphocytes and plasmacytoid monocytes, in addition to the absence of neutrophils and eosinophils.</p><p id="Par10332"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Differential diagnosis with lymphoma, inflammatory, autoimmune and infectious conditions is important when facing lymph nodes with these findings.

At diagnosis a balance between tissue availability and the size of the initial immunohistochemistry panel can be problematic, especially if the diagnosis is unexpected. In this context immunohistochemistry stains can be misleading.</p><p id="Par10353"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present three case studies encountered within the Oxford Haematopathology Service, illustrating pitfalls with interpreting immunohistochemistry stains in the setting of lymphoma diagnosis. The cases are supported by a literature review, on the role of immunohistochemistry in lymphoma diagnosis and known, along with the lesser known, lymphoma markers (Oct 3/4, Gata-3, Pax-8, CD79a, cyclin D-1, CD 45 and CD 99).</p><p id="Par10354"><bold>Results:</bold> There are numerous new monoclonal antibodies in use for immunohistochemistry diagnoses. They are particularly useful for tumour lineage distinction. But there are issues of sensitivity and aberrant expression in differential diagnosis e.g. cancer of unknown primary and as highlighted by three case studies, primary lymphoma. It is important for pathologists, especially sub specialists to keep up to date with specific antibody patterns to be able to appropriately interpret them.</p><p id="Par10355"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Sensitivity of immunohistochemistry stains means they cannot be relayed on solely for diagnosis, morphology and clinical context still remain vital in the diagnostic process.</p><p id="Par10356"><bold>E-PS-12-011</bold></p><p id="Par10357"><bold>Case report: small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (SLL/CLL) coexisting with Langerhans cell histiocytosis</bold></p><p id="Par10358"><underline>A.

Fine needle biopsy (FNB) of lumbar spine showed no pathological findings.</p><p id="Par10361"><bold>Methods:</bold> Blood tests showed prominent eosinophilia, considered as a side effect of the antibiotic treatment. The antibiotics were changed, however eosinophilia remained. Further imaging studies revealed a cavity in the lung, inaccessible for FNB, and inguinal lymphadenopathy. Multiple testings for tuberculosis (quantiferon and bronchoscopy) were negative.</p><p id="Par10362"><bold>Results:</bold> Biopsy of bone marrow showed 8-9% infiltration by SLL/CLL (positive for CD20, PanB, CD79a, CD-23, bcl-2, weakly positive for CD5 and negative for Cyclin-D1, bcl-6 and CD30). Because of the persisting eosinophilia, a month later we received an inguinal lymph node, with partially disrupted architecture, diffuse infiltration of lymphoid cells, similar to those in the bone marrow, and aggregates of histiocytic cells with elongated nuclei, prominent nuclear grooves and folds and strongly positive for S-100 and CD-1a.

Although a CMML was suspected, according to the WHO 2017 diagnostic criteria, follow up was necessary. Two more SB showed epithelioid histiocytes intensely positive for CD68, CD11c, CD15, MNDA and CD123, partially for CD1a and CD56 and negative for S100, MPO, CD34 and CD117. NGS in BM identified SRSF2 and IDH2 point mutations. Finally, a mutational analysis by pyrosequencing technique from a SB resulted with the same IDH2 base change as the one in the BM.

Different screening techniques are available for detection of Thalassemia but most are expensive. Pakistan is a resource-poor country and every diagnostic laboratory is not well equipped to screen this disease. Naked Eye Single Tube Red Cell Osmotic Fragility Test (NESTROFT) is a reliable &amp; cost effective screening method. Our study sought to evaluate the efficacy of NESTROFT as a screening tool for detection of beta thalassemia trait in Pakistani population.</p><p id="Par10386"><bold>Methods:</bold> All participants requesting a complete blood count were enrolled in the study. After obtaining informed consent, NESTROFT was performed using freshly prepared 0.36% buffered saline. Turbidity in the tubes indicated that the individual was positive for beta thalassemia trait.

We present a diagnostically challenging and very unusual case of EBV positive γ-HCD.</p><p id="Par10394"><bold>Methods:</bold> A right cervical lymph node biopsy from a 78-year-old lady with generalised lymphadenopathy was submitted to histopathology. Routine haematoxylin-eosin sections and a broad panel of immunohistochemistry were performed. In view of the histological findings serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation was requested. Review of the clinical record did not identify features of auto-immunity or a cause for immunocompromise other than age.</p><p id="Par10395"><bold>Results:</bold> Histology showed diffuse effacement of node architecture by a malignant infiltrate of medium to large cells, many with evidence of plasmablastic differentiation. The tumour cell population was positive for CD79a, with very few scattered CD20 positive cells but a significant number of CD138 positive cells. The neoplastic cells were negative for CD5 , CD10, CD56, cyclin D1 and EMA. The tumour was positive for EBV and had a very high proliferation fraction. Serum electrophoresis revealed a broad monoclonal IgG band without associated light chains.

Unlike other organs, storiform fibrosis and obliterative phlebitis are not peculiar; 5 subtypes are described: multicentric Castleman’s disease-like, reactive follicular hyperplasia-like, interfollicular expansion and immunoblastosis, progressively transformed germinal centre-type and inflammatory-pseudotumor-like IgG4.</p><p id="Par10402"><bold>Methods:</bold> We report the case of a 75 yrs old man with a painless and mobile 3 cm inguinal subcutaneous nodule, present for 2 years. Histologically it was entirely occupied by hyalinized fibrous tissue, with very few lymphocytes at the periphery and scattered plasmacells with an IgG4/IgG ratio of 1:1.

The patient turned out to have elevated serum IgG4 level (1940 g/L) and monoclonal gammopathy IgMK. A systemic IgG4-related disease could also be suspected: the year before he was hospitalized for an acute hepatitis of unknown origin and many years before he was subjected to Wirsung-jejunostomy and cholecystectomy for chronic calcific unspecified pancreatitis with pseudocysts of the pancreatic head and chronic cholecystitis. A more correct clinical framework could now save costs and improve patient's quality of life.</p><p id="Par10404"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Type V IgG4-LAD can mimic several benign and malignant lesions, in primis nodal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour and other mesenchymal tumours such as schwannomas and solitary fibrous tumour. Because of its rarity, the natural course and prognosis are uncertain. An improper diagnosis can preclude the detection of a IgG4-related disease, leading to fibrous progression, mechanical obstruction or organ dysfunction and to delay in prompt treatment with glucocorticoid, immunosuppressive agents or other.</p><p id="Par10405"><bold>E-PS-12-019</bold></p><p id="Par10406"><bold>A case study of prolonged febrile illness, diagnosed with a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), after CT-PET scan and lymph node biopsy</bold></p><p id="Par10407"><underline>A.G.

Histologically, neoplastic cells had round to ovoid vesicular nuclei with small conspicuous nucleoli aggregating in several foci and forming a multinodular mass. Lymphoplasmacytic infiltration was noted within the nodules but it was prominent especially between the nodules. In immunohistochemistry, neoplastic cells were positive for several follicular dendritic cell (FDC) markers such as CD21 and podoplanin. EBV was not detected in both neoplastic cells and lymphocytes by chromogenic in situ hybridization. The mass was diagnosed with FDCS. Despite the increase of IgG4-positive plasma cells, postoperative study showed no evidence of IgG4-related disease.</p><p id="Par10420"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We report a case of FDCS with abundant IgG4-positive plasma cells involving a lymph node near salivary gland.

Rahilly</p><p id="Par10451">*NHS Lothian, United Kingdom</p><p id="Par10452"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD) is a rare histiocytic neoplasm. BRAF mutations have emerged as potential molecular markers of ECD, but diagnosis hinges on histological identification of infiltrative histiocytic proliferations in the appropriate clinical and radiological context of disseminated mass lesions.</p><p id="Par10453"><bold>Methods:</bold> Retrospective review of histology, immunohistochemistry and molecular results was undertaken, with correlation to ehealth records and radiology. The importance of clinical and radiological context in interpretation of cytology and histology, and the critical role molecular testing played in establishing the diagnosis of ECD are discussed.</p><p id="Par10454"><bold>Results:</bold> We present a 56yo female with clinical and radiological features of malignancy of unknown origin with mediastinal (including pericardial effusion), skeletal, abdominal and retroperitoneal disease. Two diagnostic samples were available: pericardial fluid, containing abundant large CD68-positive histiocytes in an otherwise inflammatory background, and retroperitoneal biopsies, containing a predominantly fibroinflammatory lesion with dispersed large histiocytes, initially interpreted as reactive. Clinical correlation raised the possibility of ECD, and both samples were re-examined revealing occasional atypical histiocytes and a single Touton giant cell within the pericardial fluid, and dispersed, single foamy histiocytes within the biopsy. Mutation testing demonstrated analogous BRAF mutations in both pericardial and retroperitoneal samples, supporting a diagnosis of ECD.</p><p id="Par10455"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> While a fibroinflammatory ‘background’ is frequently cited within prevailing histological descriptions, in this case our observation is of a predominant fibroinflammatory lesion with only dispersed, mildly atypical histiocytes that lacked the foamy cytoplasm or Touton giant cell forms reported to exemplify ECD. Our case highlights the necessity for appropriate clinical and radiological context, and the potential value of BRAF testing in diagnosis of ECD.</p><p id="Par10456"><bold>E-PS-12-025</bold></p><p id="Par10457"><bold>Primary effusion lymphoma involving intrasinusoidal’s liver and spleen</bold></p><p id="Par10458"><underline>L.

The patient underwent PAAF, whose smear showed atypical keratinized squamous cells, suggesting a metastatic carcinoma as the first diagnostic possibility. The patient underwent parotidectomy and homolateral lymphadenectomy.</p><p id="Par10478"><bold>Results:</bold> The histopathological evaluation revealed multiple metastasis of keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma and a diffuse mature lymphoid infiltrate whose immunophenotype was CD79a, CD20, CD5, CD23, CD43, BCL-2 positive and CD10, BCL6, Cyclin D1 negative (consistent with CLL). A more in-depth evaluation of clinical history revealed a previous preauricular squamous cell carcinoma three years earlier.</p><p id="Par10479">There is a significantly high rate of SPMs in patients with CLL. Solid-organ cancers like lung/bronchus carcinoma and melanoma are the more frequent, but skin cancers as SCC are also reported.

The cells were uniform, small basaloid cells with round dark nuclei some with mitotic figures. Characteristic anucleated eosinophilic ghost cell clusters were seen in the hyalinized stroma. Immunohistochemical staining showed the tumour cells were strongly positive for p63, focally positive for p53 and negative for calretinin and cytokeratin 7. Ki67 proliferation index was %80.

Histological diagnosis made on surgical pieces were reviewed and GFAP, B-catenin and DOG-1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed on all retrieved cases.</p><p id="Par10574"><bold>Results:</bold> In our series of 20 cases, all PA showed a immunoprofile GPAF+/B-catenin-/DOG1-, and all BCA were GPAF-/B-catenin+/DOG1+. GFAP positive cases showed focal or diffuse cytoplasmic staining. Cases with focal staining tended to be in mesenchyme-like cells adjacent to epithelial nests. B-catenin positive cases had at least 3% positive nuclear staining. DOG-1 positive cases showed cytoplasmic staining in the basal cell component.</p><p id="Par10575"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In our experience this IHC panel is useful in this differential diagnosis where even though both entities are benign, PA has a higher recurrence and malignancy rate, so a correct diagnosis has important prognostic implications. Besides, although some literature reports comment on the expression of these markers in different salivary gland tumours, to the best of our knowledge, there are no reports comparing its expression in PA and BCA.</p><p id="Par10576"><bold>E-PS-13-007</bold></p><p id="Par10577"><bold>HPV related multiphaenotypic sinonasal carcinoma</bold></p><p id="Par10578"><underline>M.

We report a new case of this very rare entity, almost exclusively observed in adults, around 60 years.</p><p id="Par10591"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 51 year-old woman presented a rapidly progressive recurrence of a sinonasal tumour, of doubtful histological initial diagnosis. CT-scan and MRI showed a 60mm tumour invading the nasal fossa, maxillary, ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinuses, the cribriform plate, coming in contact with the meninges. Pet Scan showed no metastases. After debulking of the tumour, chemotherapy, endoscopic resection and radiochemotherapy were performed.</p><p id="Par10592"><bold>Results:</bold> The histological material came from the debulking performed before chemotherapy. The tumour was necrotic and showed heterogeneous features: a predominant round blue small cell component with numerous mitoses, some pseudo-rosettes and true rosettes; spindle cells on a myxoid matrix and a nest of cartilage; an epithelial component, glandular, and squamous with a "foetal" appearance.</p><p id="Par10593">The small round cells were positive for Synaptophysin, CD56 and Chromogranin A. PS100 was negative, but highlighted in some areas a network of sustentacular cells. A few cells were desmine and myogenin positive. Cytokeratin AE1/AE3 was positive in the epithelial component and in dispersed small round cells. Proliferative Index (Ki67) was 70%, with hotspots of 100%.</p><p id="Par10594"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma is a very rare tumour, thought do develop from somatic pluripotent stem cells of the olfactory neuroepithelium.

Chia*</underline>, F. Petersson, J.H.Y. Lum</p><p id="Par10598">*Department of Pathology, National University Hospital, Singapore</p><p id="Par10599"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> High-grade transformation of adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC-HGT) confers poorer prognosis than conventional AdCC, with frequent early metastases and significantly shorter median survival time. Due to the significantly increased proliferation, AdCC-HGT may be receptive to systemic chemotherapy. The high-grade component is reported to morphologically resemble poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma and only rarely high-grade myoepithelial carcinoma. We report a case of AdCC-HGT where the transformed area retains some architectural features of conventional AdCC, potentially mimicking conventional high-grade AdCC.</p><p id="Par10600"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 67-year-old woman presented with right-sided paraesthesia of the anterior mandible and poor fitting dentures. Radiological imaging showed an ill-defined mass extending from the right sublingual gland to the midline of the mandible with destruction of the alveolar bone. Anterior mandibular resection confirmed a widely infiltrative mass of the right sublingual gland with bone invasion.</p><p id="Par10601"><bold>Results:</bold> Histopathologic findings showed a 4.6 cm mass predominantly composed of irregular, frequently cribriform tumour islands containing basaloid cells with marked nuclear atypia, limited cytoplasm and brisk mitotic and apoptotic activity. Several foci of necrosis were identified. A distinct transition zone and a minor component of conventional low-grade AdCC was present. Immunohistochemistry revealed loss of the biphasic (luminal/abluminal; CD117/p63) pattern, diffuse CD117 expression and approximately 70% nuclear labelling with Ki-67.</p><p id="Par10602"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> AdCC-HGT may be composed of cribriform islands of basaloid cells; features allowing separation from conventional AdCC include marked nuclear atypia, loss of biphasic pattern, necrosis and increased proliferative activity. High proliferative activity of AdCC-HGT may influence response to systemic chemotherapy.</p><p id="Par10603"><bold>E-PS-13-010</bold></p><p id="Par10604"><bold>IDH2 mutations in sinonasal tumours: are they restricted to SNUCs?

Wassef</p><p id="Par10606">*Gustave Roussy, Paris-Saclay University, Biopathology Department, Villejuif, France</p><p id="Par10607"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> IDH2 mutations have been described in different types of poorly differentiated sinonasal tumours but the nosology is still unclear. We report a case of poorly differentiated sinonasal tumour with IDH2 R172G mutation and areas of high grade Olfactory Neuroblastoma (ONB).</p><p id="Par10608"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 52 years old man presented with a skull base tumour involving the ethmoid sinus and the lamina papyracea. Biopsies were performed, allowing an extensive pathological and molecular investigation.</p><p id="Par10609"><bold>Results:</bold> Biopsies highlighted a heterogeneous tumour made of lobules and nests of atypical cells with a moderately abundant cytoplasm, round to ovoid nuclei and a clear chromatin. In some areas atypia were more severe. Immunohistochemistry showed quite a diffuse expression of keratins, a focal expression of 3 neuroendocrine markers and the presence of focal sustentacular S100 positive cells. A targeted DNA sequencing panel showed an IDH2 R172G mutation.</p><p id="Par10610">IDH2 mutations have initially been described in Sinonasal Undifferentiated Carcinoma (SNUC). They were then reported in tumours displaying frank neuroendocrine immunophenotype, i.e. LCNEC or ONB. This case brings new arguments to the presence of IDH2 mutations in tumours other than SNUCs.</p><p id="Par10611"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> IDH2 mutations are not restricted to SNUC. They can occur in poorly differentiated sinonasal tumours showing some degree of neuroendocrine differentiation and notably Large Cell Neuroendocrine Carcinoma or high grade ONB. To clarify the nosology of those sinonasal tumours, IDH2 mutation should consistently be evaluated in poorly differentiated sinonasal tumours, LCNECs and high grade ONBs.</p><p id="Par10612"><bold>E-PS-13-011</bold></p><p id="Par10613"><bold>A pulsatile mass behind tympanic membrane</bold></p><p id="Par10614"><underline>A.

Otoscopic examination revealed a reddish pulsatile mass behind tympanic membrane. Ear computed tomography showed a 4 mm lesion in the middle portion of the right tympanic membrane.</p><p id="Par10618"><bold>Results:</bold> Patient underwent surgical resection via postauricular approach. The tympanic membrane was reconstructed with temporalis tissue.</p><p id="Par10619">Histological examination revealed a neoplasm composed of thin-walled dilated vascular structures surrounded by round cells, with sharply defined cell borders, eosinophilic cytoplasm and centrally placed nucleus without atypia; immunohistochemistry studies revealed positivity of the tumour cell for smooth muscle actin and CD34. A GVM was diagnosed, with free resection margins.</p><p id="Par10620"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> GVM are slow-growing benign vascular lesions representing the most common primary neoplasms of the middle ear. Pathologically, they may be misinterpreted as haemangiomas or venous/arteriovenous malformations depending on the degree of vascular proliferation. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice; they’re usually encapsulated and may show irregular borders leading to the possibility of recurrence if the nodule is not completely excised.

However, some types of ameloblastoma that may contain several of these definitions outside the classification as hybrids are also described in the literature.</p><p id="Par10705"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 58-year-old male patient presented with a complaint of mass in the left lower jaw and gingival region, which has been around for 6 months. A 40x25 mm sized lesion was observed in the anterior left half of the mandible, which thinned the bone cortex. With these findings, the patient underwent a curettage biopsy for diagnosis.</p><p id="Par10706"><bold>Results:</bold> Excisional material's total size was 1.5x1.5x0.4 cm. In histopathological examination, the lesion was observed as solid in places and forming adenoid/duct-like areas. Basophilic mucoid material, stellate reticulum cells and mesenchymal elements are seen in these spaces. Peripheral cells exhibiting prominent palisading of the basal cells nuclei with reverse polarity with ameloblast-like pattern.</p><p id="Par10707">The immunohistochemical findings;CK19,CK14,PanCK focally and strongly positive,CK7 negative,p16 focally cytoplasmic and nuclear positive, P53 focal positive, Ki-67 was found about %15-20.</p><p id="Par10708"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Adenomatoid odontogenic tumour(AOT) and adenoid ameloblastoma with dentinoid distinction can be problematic. Adenoid ameloblastoma with dentinoid has duct-like structures without palisading cells, ameloblastomatous areas, stellate reticulum-like cells.</p><p id="Par10709">The most important feature of this lesion is its local recurrence when compare with AOT. Evans et al. and Ide et al. had described their cases of a recurrent lesion that was initially diagnosed as adenomatoid odontogenic tumour after the recurrence and after reviewing all histologic findings, they named it adenoid ameloblastoma with dentinoid.</p><p id="Par10710"><bold>E-PS-13-025</bold></p><p id="Par10711"><bold>Schneiderian type papilloma of the middle ear</bold></p><p id="Par10712"><underline>B.

Due to embryological and anatomical closeness, it can develop in different localizations: pharynx, lacrimal sac, middle ear.</p><p id="Par10715"><bold>Methods:</bold> 63 year old female patient. She applied with unilateral hearing loss, otorrhea and otalgia. The lesion was excised in the patient whose lesions were detected in the middle ear.</p><p id="Par10716"><bold>Results:</bold> Excisional material with a total size of 1.5x1x0.4 cm was sent for histopathological examination. Hematoxylin and eosin stained slides examined. When we looked at the microscopic findings; lesion has a papillomatous appearance. The surface of this lesion has columnar cells and also included goblet cells. Chronic inflammatory cells and oedema were observed in the submucosa.</p><p id="Par10717"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Schneiderian type papilloma of the middle ear is a rare tumour. The first case was described by Stone et al.in 1987.</p><p id="Par10718">The excision of the lesion is sufficient in the treatment of these cases, there is no clear information in terms of recurrence or malign transformation since the total number of reported cases is around 30. In this respect, it is necessary to follow up the cases.

Keskin*</underline>, Z.L. Cinel</p><p id="Par10722">*Marmara University, Turkey</p><p id="Par10723"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Oral focal mucinosis is the name given to the oral form of cutaneous focal mucinosis. This lesion generally appears smooth round asymptomatic elevation from around. This lesion's aetiology is unknown but probably cause is overexpression of hyaluronic acid by fibroblasts.</p><p id="Par10724"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 64 year old female patient presented with a lesion on the tip of tongue. The lesion was approximately 7mm in diameter and round in shape, firm and sessile. The mucosal surface of the lesion was smooth, not ulcerated and showed no colour change. Excisional biopsy was performed.</p><p id="Par10725"><bold>Results:</bold> Macroscopically, the diameter of the lesion was 0.6 cm. Hematoxylin&amp;Eosin and Alcian blue &amp; Periodic acid–Schiff(PAS) stained microscopic slides are examined. On H&amp;E slide, lesion surface was stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium and the underlying connective tissue stroma was composed of loose fibro-myxoid stroma with fibroblasts. Alcian blue and periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) staining of the mucinous part of the tissue demonstrated a positive reaction with Alcian blue and a negative reaction with PAS.</p><p id="Par10726"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Oral focal mucinosis is a very rare case on tongue; reported cases are less than 10. Histopathological distinction is necessary from diseases with a myxomatous stroma: Myxoma, mucocele, nerve sheath myxoma, focal myxedema, and mucoid degeneration of fibrotic lesions. Clinically, these lesions cannot be distinguished, so excision is recommended.</p><p id="Par10727"><bold>E-PS-13-027</bold></p><p id="Par10728"><bold>Solitary fibrous tumour of the thyroid</bold></p><p id="Par10729"><underline>K.

The resected mass was grossly yellowish white, and microscopically consisted of a diffuse growth of fibroblast-like, bland spindle cells which were embedded in a large amount of collagen fibres. The mass was relatively well-circumscribed but contained many thyroid follicles within it. Tumour cells were immunoreactive for STAT6 and CD34.</p><p id="Par10734"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In our case, SFT of the thyroid showed production of abundant extracellular collagenous matrix and an infiltrative growth with entrapment of follicles, thus closely stimulating desmoid-type fibromatosis.

Objective.to study the effect of sodium thiopental and fentanyl on mast cell (MC) degranulation in the mesentery in rats when modelling septaplasty.</p><p id="Par10740"><bold>Methods:</bold> Wistar rats were simulated with septoplasty using fentanyl (1group, 5 rats) and sodium thiopental (2 group, 5 rats). 5 rats were a control group (CG). After surgery, rats were sacrificed on 2nd day and the mesentery was stained with toluidine blue. MC with varying degrees of degranulation (0-3) were counted in 20 fields of view.</p><p id="Par10741"><bold>Results:</bold> In 1&amp;2groups, type0 MC number was significantly less(22.267±2.45&amp;29.5±6.73, respectively)than in the CG(40.45±6.2)(p&lt;0.001).In 1group, type0 MC number &amp;type1(22.31±3.48) prevailed, over 2types(2.04±0.33)&amp; 3(1.18±0.24) (p&lt;0.001), but type2 TC was greater than 3rd(p&lt;0.01).In 2group, there was an increased content of 1type TC(43.76±7.99), compared with other types of TC degranulation in 2group(p&lt;0.001). 2type(1.22±0.22)as well as in the 1group prevailed over 3type(0.67 ± 0.13)(p &lt;0.001).

Purpose: to study the local effect of septoplasty modelling in rats during nasal septum scarification.</p><p id="Par10748"><bold>Methods:</bold> In 10 male rats of the Wistar strain of the experimental group (ExpG), the mucous-perichondrium layer of the nasal septum was scarified. The control group consisted of 5 male rats. Animals were slaughtered 3 days after surgery. After decalcification of the facial skeleton of rats, histological sections were stained with H&amp;E. For statistical analysis of the results, the Mann-Whitney test was used.</p><p id="Par10749"><bold>Results:</bold> In ExpG, at the sites of nasal septum scarification, the leukocyte shaft was 45.43±1.07 μm. The average values of this indicator for each rat in ExpG did not differ (p&lt;0.001). There was oedema, hyperaemia and diapedetic haemorrhage in the submucosa. Focal periductal mononuclear infiltrates in the gland. A narrowing of the common nasal passages was noted due to oedema, which covered the nasal septum adjacent to the damage zone.</p><p id="Par10750"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Scarification of NS in rats is accompanied by characteristic inflammatory phenomena, both in areas of direct damage and in areas close to them.

Arai</p><p id="Par10754">*Shizuoka General Hospital, Japan</p><p id="Par10755"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> CASTLE is rare but a well-established thyroidal tumour as “intrathyroidal thymic carcinoma”. Recently, one case of CASTLE arising in the parotid gland was reported (Head Neck 2017: 40: E1-E4). We reported herein one extremely rare case of salivary CASTLE.</p><p id="Par10756"><bold>Methods:</bold> We collected “basaloid/myoepithelial carcinoma” from a pathology file during 2009-2020. We re-estimated it, histologically, and immunohistochemically. The patient was 47 years-old female, involving the sense of incongruity at her left neck. MRI indicated an ill-defined mass in the left submandibular gland. The submandilectomy was performed. Sequentially, the late lymph node metastasis was found. After 3 years, distant metastases were found.</p><p id="Par10757"><bold>Results:</bold> Histologically, the tumour showed the nest-like or sheet-like pattern of short-spindle or basaloid atypical cells with hyalinous stroma. Stromal lymphoid cell infiltration was scanty. The tumour cells showed clear nuclei with short spindle-shaped cytoplasm and one swollen nucleolus, and focally squamous metaplasia. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells were positive for CK5/6, p63, CD5, c-kit and EGFR, whereas they were negative for CK14, aSMA, NCAM, and synaptophysin. Ki-67 labelling index is 52%.</p><p id="Par10758"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We finally diagnosed it as salivary CASTLE, due to CD5 positivity and negativity for both neuroendocrine markers and myoepithelial markers, except for p63/p40 and CK5/6. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of CASTLE arising in the submandibular gland. The origin of salivary CASTLE remains unknown. We discuss the differential diagnosis of salivary CASTLE from myoepithelial carcinoma, lymphoepithelial carcinoma or basaloid carcinoma of the salivary glands.</p><p id="Par10759">Funding: A Grant-in-Aid for Medical Research Support Project of Shizuoka Prefectural Hospital Organization in 2019 of Japan (to KK).</p><p id="Par10760"><bold>E-PS-13-033</bold></p><p id="Par10761"><bold>Aggressive neoplasia in the maxillary sinus in women in the eighth decade of life - case report and literature review</bold></p><p id="Par10762"><underline>F.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is the most common salivary gland tumour in the sinus tract. The aim of this case is to identify the clinical-pathological features of sinus-nasal ACC.</p><p id="Par10765"><bold>Methods:</bold> Patient (60years) who debuted with left periorbital asymmetric facial tumour, with decreased visual acuity associated. In CT a tumour with a greater diameter of 47 mm was found with intense heterogeneous enhancement in the left maxillary sinus extending anteriorly to the subcutaneous cellular tissue and posterolaterally to the buccal space, eroding the walls of the sinus and without adenopathies.</p><p id="Par10766"><bold>Results:</bold> Under the optical microscope, this tumour is characterized by the presence of small, round cells of uniform appearance that are grouped into cylindrical structures, in which several lights containing hyaline or mucous material can be observed. The immunohistochemical: CK19, c-kit, CK5/6, EMA (luminal), p40 and p63 (basal) positive. ACC is a malignant tumour with a poor prognosis, very rare in the maxillary sinus with respect to other head and neck locations, but with a high recurrence rate. In contrast, the rate of metastasis appears to be lower than that observed for tumours of the salivary glands.</p><p id="Par10767"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Predictors of survival in SNACC include age, comorbidity status, grade, and stage. Surgery is associated with improved survival and remains the mainstay of therapy, whereas the roles of radiation therapy and chemotherapy require future investigation, where pathology has the main perspective.</p><p id="Par10768"><bold>E-PS-13-034</bold></p><p id="Par10769"><bold>A rare case of metastasis of breast carcinoma to buccal mucosa mimicking acinic cell carcinoma</bold></p><p id="Par10770"><underline>K.

A case is presented here.</p><p id="Par10773"><bold>Methods:</bold> A PubMed search was carried out for previous cases, using the reference terms “buccal mucosa”, “breast metastasis” and “acinic cell carcinoma”. A 62-year-old woman was referred to oral-maxillo-facial outpatient department for evaluation of an ulcerated left buccal mucosal lesion.</p><p id="Par10774"><bold>Results:</bold> The biopsy from the ulcerated lesion of the buccal mucosa revealed a tumour arranged in acinar/cribriform pattern with papillary like structures and some glandular structures. The features are reminiscent of acinic cell carcinoma.

Our case is complicated by the long interval of time (6 years) from primary breast tumour detection. Most of the reported cases have an interval of 2 years. The combination of medical history and a panel of immuno-histochemical stains and interest in both breast and salivary gland pathology are key to achieve the correct diagnosis as shown in our case.</p><p id="Par10776"><bold>E-PS-13-035</bold></p><p id="Par10777"><bold>Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus – an extremely rare diagnosis of the oral cavity</bold></p><p id="Par10778"><underline>H.

The specimen was submitted for histology. After fixation in formalin solution, and inclusion in paraffin, 3–5 μm sections were stained with H&amp;E for conventional evaluation. Morphologic features such as presence of mucin containing cells, and &gt;60% population of the oncocytic cells were assessed.</p><p id="Par10836"><bold>Results:</bold> Permanent sections stained with H&amp;E revealed a neoplasm that had replaced a wide area of the right soft palate. Morphological features included nests, trabeculae and aggregates of polygonal shaped cells. These cells had moderately pleomorphic nuclei, focally prominent nucleoli, and abundant amount of granular eosinophilic cytoplasm. OMEC must accounts for &gt;60% of the oncocytic cell population. Occasional cells containing intracytoplasmic mucin which were highlighted by special stain mucin.</p><p id="Par10837">Immunohistochemical stains were performed and demonstrated cytokeratin-7 strong positivity. There was patchy positivity of p63 and p40 in the neoplastic cells. Thus, the final diagnosis was that of salivary gland neoplasm with extensive oncocytic change and admixed mucocytes favouring oncocytic mucoepidermoid carcinoma.</p><p id="Par10838"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Mucoepidermoid carcinoma composed of exclusive oncocytes and rare mucocytes is a rare morphologic variant. Oncocytes are large epithelial cells that contain bright eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm &amp; can potentially be confused with oncocytoma or oncocytic carcinoma. Diagnosis of all oncocytic lesions is important for correct treatment. A pathologist must remain aware of the rare diagnosis of OMEC of the palate which has a good prognosis according to the recent studies.</p><p id="Par10839"><bold>E-PS-13-043</bold></p><p id="Par10840"><bold>Eosinophilic ulcer of the tongue: a case and confusing clinical entity</bold></p><p id="Par10841"><underline>M.

Its etiopathogenesis is not clear, but trauma plays an important role in the development.</p><p id="Par10844"><bold>Methods:</bold> Here we report a case of eosinophilic ulcer in 74- year old woman, which presented with a symptomatic ulcer on the right lateral border of the tongue. Clinically, the lesion manifests as an isolated ulcer with indurated borders and a yellow fibrinous floor. A biopsy is indicated to rule out malignancy.</p><p id="Par10845"><bold>Results:</bold> We received a fragment measuring 1.4x0.7cm. Histopathological examination showed an ulcerated surface of the lingual mucosa. The background of this ulceration is characterized by the presence of fibrino-leucocytic exudate associated with a dense and pleomorphic inflammatory infiltrate with several eosinophils with sheets of lymphocytes, plasma cells and neutrophils extending deep into the mucosa and submucosa, underlying muscle. No cellular atypia was observed. The diagnosis of eosinophilic ulcer of the tongue was retained.</p><p id="Par10846"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Eosinophilic ulcer of the tongue is a rare chronic benign ulcerative lesion often misdiagnosed as oral malignancy. Its histogenesis remains controversial. Generally surgical excision resolves it spontaneously within few weeks.

EMP usually occurs in the head and neck region (80%), with the nasopharynx and sinonasal cavities being the most common. Involvement of the tonsil is unusual.</p><p id="Par10852"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 58-year-old man presented with a history of discomfort during swallowing of 10 days duration. On clinical examination there was a firm swelling in the right tonsillar area. His medical history was unremarkable. A biopsy of the right tonsil was performed.</p><p id="Par10853"><bold>Results:</bold> Histologic examination showed a monotonous infiltrate composed of discohesive plasma cells characterized by eccentrically placed round nuclei. Immunohistochemical staining revealed reactivity for CD138, CD56, CD79a, ΕΜΑ, bcl-2. Tumour cells were CD20, CD30, bcl-6, CD5, CD 10, CD15, AE1/AE3 negative. A diagnosis of extramedullary plasmacytoma was made.</p><p id="Par10854"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The exact incidence of EMP is unknown, but they are rare, accounting for only 3%-4% of all plasma cell malignancies. The diagnosis of tonsillar EMP is important not only because it is a rare neoplasm but also because it mimics many reactive lesions and malignant neoplasms at this site. FNA may provide inconclusive results. Immunohistochemistry played a crucial role in differentiating it from other conditions involving plasma cells. Solitary EMP is managed with radiotherapy, surgery, or both.</p><p id="Par10855"><bold>E-PS-13-046</bold></p><p id="Par10856"><bold>Primary malignant melanoma of the mandible: a rare entity</bold></p><p id="Par10857"><underline>E.

The aim of our study is to gain further insight into this very rare entity by evaluating localization, histopathological characteristics and differential diagnosis with other head and neck tumours.</p><p id="Par10926"><bold>Results:</bold> We report the case of a 62 year old male with a a giant laterocervical lipomatose mass. The ultrasound suggested a benign fatty tissue tumour which was then surgically removed. However, on histopathological examination, the diagnosis of sialolipoma was established.</p><p id="Par10927"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Sialolipoma is usually located in the parotid gland, followed by the palate for minor salivary glands. Major gland sialolipoma occurs more frequently in males while minor gland sialolipoma is more frequent in females and is usually less than 2 cm in diameter. Therefore a male with 8x5x3 cm laterocervical sialolipoma probably arising from a minor salivary gland is extremely unusual for a tumour that is particularly rare anyway.

During a business trip to Berlin and Göttingen(1833-1835) N.I. Pirogov produces a large number of autopsies, while he believed that German doctors and surgeons of that time were little acquainted and not sufficiently interested in the most basic pathological processes.

Hirth</p><p id="Par11027">*Federal University of Ceará, Medical School, Dept. of Pathology, Brazil</p><p id="Par11028"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> The infections caused by fungi, like a mucormycosis, are uncommon, but are significant due to their aggressive nature, for the challenge of diagnosis and high mortality (40 - 100%), despite the antifungals and medical therapy currently available. It should be considered a differential diagnosis of synovial diseases in immunocompromised patients and an appropriate histopathological investigation should be performed. The article aims to describe and discuss case of sphenoid mucormycosis in immunocompetent patient.</p><p id="Par11029"><bold>Methods:</bold> Male, 62 years old, shows frontal, pulsatile and daily headache. Cranial tomography (CT) suggests inflammatory sphenoid sinusopathy associated with fungi. Unspecified clinical treatment was performed. Five years later, headache returns. CT shows continuous expansive infiltrative formation at the base of the skull. Transsphenoidal surgery was performed, using the chordoma hypothesis. Anatomopathological: fungal colonization, suspected mucormycosis. After investigation, immunocompetence was confirmed.</p><p id="Par11030"><bold>Results:</bold> Mucormycosis is an invasive, rare and severe fungal infection. Acquired with inhalation of microorganisms of the order Mucorales present in the decomposing organic material. It presents with invasion of paranasal sinuses, common jaw, sphenoid changes, cavernous sinus, orbits and cranial cavity. Uncommon in the immunocompetent. As signs and symptoms can be observed: fever, nasal ulcer, periorbital or facial oedema, decreased visual acuity, ophthalmoplegia and headache.</p><p id="Par11031"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Mucormycosis has an atypical presentation in individuals without immune compromise.

We report a case with ulcero-infiltrative lesion in the tracheostoma area 10 years after laryngectomy due to laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), whose biopsy was negative for neoplasia and amastigotes were identified.</p><p id="Par11037"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 59-year-old man from Manaus (North of Brazil) underwent laryngectomy and tracheostomy for glottic SCC in 2007.In 2017, he presented an ulcero-infiltrative lesion, bleeding in the peritraqueostoma region adjacent to the tracheoesophageal prosthesis. Incisional and endoscopic biopsy was performed, which showed subacute inflammation and absence of neoplasia. Due to suspected recurrence, the tracheoesophageal prosthesis was removed and a new biopsy was performed.</p><p id="Par11038"><bold>Results:</bold> ML in North of Brazil is caused by Leishmania braziliensis and represents the reactivation of a parasitized macrophage metastasized to the cartilage during primary infection. Differential diagnosis includes neoplasm and granulomatous diseases. Tumour recurrence in the tracheostoma area after resection of SCC of the larynx is a serious complication. The analysis of the histological preparations obtained from the biopsy showed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, sections of ulceration with formation of granulation tissue and, in the chorion, the presence of isolated or aggregated Leishmania amastigote forms within some macrophages. Thus, the diagnostic conclusion was ML. The samples were negative for neoplasia. Patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin and is well, with no evidence of disease.</p><p id="Par11039"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Rare case of ML simulating tumour recurrence demonstrates the need for the clinical-epidemiological diagnosis and laboratory confirmation of the disease in order to establish the diagnosis and enable adequate treatment of the patient, as demonstrated in the reported case.</p><p id="Par11040"><bold>E-PS-15-003</bold></p><p id="Par11041"><bold>Gastrointestinal basidiobolomycosis in a young adult patient: a case report</bold></p><p id="Par11042"><underline>A.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the severest form of leishmaniasis and fatal if left untreated. In Mediterranean countries, like Spain, it usually occurs in rural areas.</p><p id="Par11060"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present the case of a 71-year-old man from a village in the mountains, who presented with hepatosplenomegaly and pancytopenia. In clinical and radiological examination no other adenopathies were found. Initially, a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate were performed, which showed plasmacytosis with no light chain restriction and absence of parasites, respectively. Flow cytometry showed no monoclonal peak.</p><p id="Par11061"><bold>Results:</bold> Due to the worsening of hypersplenism syndrome, constant fever and progressive weight loss an urgent splenectomy was performed. histological examination of the spleen showed a loss of the normal architecture: disrupted lymphoid follicles sometimes replaced by hyaline deposits, white pulp atrophy, not feasible distinction between red and white pulp and presence of numerous plasma cell aggregates in the red pulp. Intracytoplasmic Leishmania amastigotes were observed with Hematoxilin-Eosin and Giemsa stains, and a polymerase chain reaction confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was treated with amphotericin B showing continuous improvement.</p><p id="Par11062"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> It is important to keep in mind that a negative result in bone marrow aspirate is not definitive to exclude a diagnosis of VL, in fact some studies conclude that splenic aspiration in experienced hands has higher sensitivity compared to bone marrow aspiration.

She was otherwise asymptomatic. Ultrasound investigation identified a 3.5 x 2.5cm, well-circumscribed nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid, which on fine-needle aspiration cytology revealed features consistent with a follicular neoplasm. The patient went on to have a hemithyroidectomy.</p><p id="Par11069"><bold>Results:</bold> Histopathological examination confirmed a diagnosis of follicular thyroid carcinoma but also identified several sarcocysts in skeletal muscle fibres adjacent to the pyramidal lobe. The patient’s travel history was reviewed, which revealed she had visited Tioman Island, Malaysia, in 2010, where the largest outbreak of muscular sarcocystosis reported to date occurred between 2011-2012. Review of 502 muscle biopsy specimens in the Department of Neuropathology, Glasgow, did not identify any additional cases.</p><p id="Par11070"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Confirmed cases of muscular sarcocystosis are rare. Prevalence in western countries is low and infection in this case was probably acquired in Tioman Island. Symptoms may include myalgia, muscle weakness, fever, and headache, but infection can be asymptomatic. Definitive diagnosis relies on identifying sarcocysts in a muscle biopsy, which should prompt a detailed travel history, if encountered incidentally.

Sapargaliyeva*</underline>, B. Alibekov, V. Grinberg</p><p id="Par11098">*Pathology Bureau of the City of Almaty, Kazakhstan</p><p id="Par11099"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> A diagnosis of opisthorchiasis represents a clinical problem due to the absence of pathognomonic signs of disease and not informative duodenal juice microscopy (MAb-ELISA). Histological diagnosis allows objectifying clinical diagnosis, even in cases when parasite detection is a morphological finding.</p><p id="Par11100"><bold>Methods:</bold> We report a case of acute opisthorchiasis in a man (age 65). The diagnosis was established during a histological examination of a colon biopsy in a patient with an alleged clinical diagnosis of opisthorchiasis. The patient complained about discomfort in the upper left quadrant of the abdomen and diarrhoea. The pain was regulated by painkillers.</p><p id="Par11101"><bold>Results:</bold> The patient underwent a full examination, but the results of the physical examination were normal. All stool samples were negative. However, the results of the MAb-ELISA test were positive (May 15), so the patient was treated with anti-parasitic drugs (May 23-25). Two weeks after a colonoscopy was performed, and the doctor took tissue samples for biopsy (June 5). Histological examination of a colon revealed fragments of adult flukes, which confirmed the diagnosis of opisthorchiasis. An analysis of the clinical manifestations of opisthorchiasis and the results of laboratory tests indicated acute opisthorchiasis, caused by O. viverrini. The features of this case included moderate pain, diarrhoea, and weight loss of 20 kg.</p><p id="Par11102"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The infection proceeded according to the type of acute enteritis and colitis, although usually acute opisthorchiasis caused by O. viverrini is asymptomatic or reminds of acute cholecystitis. Fragments of adult flukes were found in the colon mucosa. The foci of reactive inflammation of the mucosa during endoscopic examination reminded a polyp.</p><p id="Par11103"><bold>E-PS-15-013</bold></p><p id="Par11104"><bold>Chronic Q fever - a rare disease diagnosed by molecular methods</bold></p><p id="Par11105"><underline>M.

C. burnetii is a fastidious pathogen which cannot be routinely cultivated, thus microbiological diagnosis is challenging.</p><p id="Par11108"><bold>Methods:</bold> Specimens from fistula secretions were evaluated via cytology and culture-independent, panbacterial PCR resolved with next-generation sequencing (16S rRNA gene sequencing).</p><p id="Par11109"><bold>Results:</bold> We report on a case of a 9-year-old female operated because of a valvopathy with pulmonary stenosis in her first year of life. Heart surgery required the use of prosthetic material and the procedure was performed in Kazakhstan. Since the surgery a chronic fistulating mediastinitis was present which did not respond to any therapy and no infectious agent could be identified. However, 16S rRNA gene analysis of specimens from the purulent secretions of the fistulas showed high loads of C. burnetii DNA. This was confirmed by C. burnetii specific PCR from the serum of the patient and C. burnetti specific serology.</p><p id="Par11110"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We identified a rare case of chronic Q fever in association with prosthetic material after cardiac surgery. C. burnetii has a tropism to thoracic organs (lungs, heart) and normally infection occurs via inhalation of infectious dust or direct contact with C. burnetii carrying animals (goat, sheep). In our case, however, the pathogen was most probably acquired during surgery. Noteworthy, accurate microbiological diagnosis could only be achieved via molecular methods.</p><p id="Par11111"><bold>E-PS-15-014</bold></p><p id="Par11112"><bold>Histologic and molecular manifestations of cardiac failure due to Puumala virus infection - an autopsy study</bold></p><p id="Par11113"><underline>M.

Although acute cardiac failure has been described in Puumala virus infection, a histologic and/or molecular proof of heart infection is lacking so far.</p><p id="Par11116"><bold>Methods:</bold> We report on 2 autopsy cases which were performed because of acute cardiac failure in the setting of Puumala virus infections. Histologic and molecular (RT-PCR) studies from tissues including the heart were performed.</p><p id="Par11117"><bold>Results:</bold> Histology showed the typical interstitial haemorrhages in the medulla of kidneys, a hallmark lesion in Puumala virus infection. In addition, a prominent perivascular lymphomononuclear inflammatory infiltrate was seen surrounding small vessels and capillaries in the myocardium, as well as in the lungs and kidneys. Endothelial cells showed prominent attenuation suspicious of virus mediated endothelial cytotoxicity. No histologic changes of myocarditis, such as immune mediated myocyte damage, were evident. Semiquantitative analysis via RT-PCR showed the highest viral load in the myocardium compared to kidneys and lungs. Interestingly, also multifocal ischemic changes of the myocardium were evident on histology.</p><p id="Par11118"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our findings suggest that Puumala virus infects also myocardial vessels (endothelia) to a large extend. The corresponding prominent immune response directed against the infected endothelia might lead to multifocal ischemic damages of the myocardium, thereby leading to the clinically seen sudden cardiac failure.</p><p id="Par11119"><bold>E-PS-16 IT in Pathology</bold></p><p id="Par11120"><bold>E-PS-16-001</bold></p><p id="Par11121"><bold>A survey on digital pathology and safe workplace station awareness amongst histopathology registrars in the West Midlands Deanery - England</bold></p><p id="Par11122"><underline>L.

Artificial intelligence offers different approaches in pathology diagnosis based on pattern recognition of lesions or entities. The source of machine learning procedures should be a well-documented collection of images.</p><p id="Par11133"><bold>Methods:</bold> Over the last ten years we have progressively collected images macro and microscopic in .jpg format of all the cases studied in our hospital, currently reaching a total around 800.000. Microscopic images are taken by pathologists at the moment of diagnosis selecting the most representative areas that lead to the diagnosis and allow by themselves to identify the lesional categories.</p><p id="Par11134"><bold>Results:</bold> To retrieve the image information we initially designed a search engine based on a MySQL database, presenting collections of thumbnails of the images linked to the diagnosis, introduced from the queries typed in a web form. Later the IT team in our hospital developed, based in a open source algorithm (Phase Stretch Transform ) for image recognition, a solution to identify images among our collection, of similar features as those selected by the pathologist in the same way through a web form. The concordance is not yet perfect, but similarities to the original image bring in most instances an answer with a thumbnail collection of cases with the same diagnosis.</p><p id="Par11135"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Daily practice in pathology allows to collect a huge number of images of the diagnosed cases.

We present a pilot study assessing attitudes to sharing of educational cases on the digital platform in this manner.</p><p id="Par11157"><bold>Methods:</bold> Educational cases on the diagnostic DP platform were identified by a consultant histopathologist, and links circulated by email. Cases included ‘spot diagnoses’ and more complex exam-type cases. Trainees were invited to submit an ‘answer’ by email to the educator or through an anonymous online survey. Educational comments were subsequently circulated by email to all. Trainee feedback was collected using SurveyMonkey(R).</p><p id="Par11158"><bold>Results:</bold> Feedback was provided by 7/9 participants. All had prior diagnostic exposure to the digital platform. All agreed that this teaching format was appealing, and that remote educator feedback enhances educational value. However, trainees also noted that simple signposting of cases by an educator without additional feedback could be helpful. Specific comments included that multiple trainees could access the digital cases simultaneously, that it offered provision of easy access to teaching cases without potentially making them unavailable for multidisciplinary team meetings, and that it offered useful exposure to cases across specialties. Potential collation of educational comments alongside cases was suggested to be of value longer term.</p><p id="Par11159"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Diagnostic digital images are a promising resource for facilitating and enhancing histopathology education, allowing cases to be shared in a timely manner with multiple trainees. Educational experience is enhanced by educator feedback which can be specific to trainee needs, but simple signposting of cases is also valuable. It allows regular exposure across specialties in specialist centres and provides opportunity for educators to teach in a more time-flexible manner.</p><p id="Par11160"><bold>E-PS-16-007</bold></p><p id="Par11161"><bold>International PathArt Photomicrography Contest: artistic reflections of pathologists’ colourful daily lives through the microscope and introducing pathology to the public</bold></p><p id="Par11162"><underline>E.

It was already proved effective in evaluating early melanocytic lesions. Raman Microspectroscopy may detect and identify breast cancer on surgical margins.</p><p id="Par11205"><bold>Methods:</bold> The analysis of three sets of human breast tissue samples collected through breast conserving surgery and classified by control histopathology as containing (1) invasive carcinoma, (2) in situ carcinoma, or (3) “healthy” breast tissue. RMS probing of 10 μm thick, digitally dewaxed tissue sections to detect and identify the composition and distribution of molecular biomarkers specific to each tissue set.</p><p id="Par11206"><bold>Results:</bold> According to a Principal Component Analysis, Raman Microspectroscopy probing successfully distinguished the three sets of samples, and further identified biochemical traits specific to each tissue set, namely its distinct content and distribution of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.</p><p id="Par11207"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Improving clinical outcomes for breast cancer patients requires faster, more objective diagnostic tools, particularly within the operating room. One promising approach is in loco tissue analysis for biochemical differences, potentially much faster and more specific than conventional histopathology.

Ajetunmobi*</underline>, A. Torres-Rendon</p><p id="Par11212">*Department of Cellular Pathology, University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, United Kingdom</p><p id="Par11213"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Melanomas show morphological heterogeneity and are thus challenging to diagnose on H&amp;E. Melanocytic markers are effective in their identification. However aberrant expression of non-melanoma markers remains a pitfall. The authors document the expression of neuroendocrine markers in a mucosal melanoma</p><p id="Par11214"><bold>Methods:</bold> A right maxillary antral mass in a 77yr old male showed on microscopy sheets of malignant epithelioid and spindle cells with enlarged, pleomorphic nuclei and basophilic cytoplasm. Differential diagnoses were sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma, and olfactory neuroblastoma. Immunostaining was performed with a panel including but not restricted to epithelial [AE1/AE3, EMA], neuroendocrine [ synaptophysin, NSE] and melanocytic [S100,melanA and HMB-45] markers.</p><p id="Par11215"><bold>Results:</bold> The tumour cells were positive for all three melanoma markers and negative for cytokeratins, hence excluding a neuroendocrine carcinoma. The characteristic lobularity and sustentacular cells of an olfactory neuroblastoma were absent, hence ruling out this entity. In the light of the aforementioned positive expression of melanocytic antibodies, a diagnosis of a sinonasal melanoma was made. However, expression of synaptophysin and NSE was observed in up to 50% of the tumour cells.</p><p id="Par11216"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> With regard to cancers of unknown origin/primary, melanomas should be included in the differential diagnosis of tumours expressing neuroendocrine markers. The co-expression of both melanocytic and neuroendocrine markers, as well as the loss of melanocytic markers are possible and seemingly frequent scenarios in melanomas and should be considered to avoid diagnostic and hence management errors.</p><p id="Par11217"><bold>E-PS-17-002</bold></p><p id="Par11218"><bold>Development of an expanded microsatellite instability panel with automated data analysis</bold></p><p id="Par11219"><underline>C.

Varma</p><p id="Par11220">*Thermo-Fisher Scientific, United States</p><p id="Par11221"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Microsatellite instability testing has been used to study Lynch Syndrome and in immuno-oncology research. However, clinical researchers have indicated that current solutions to detect MSI have limitations, including insufficient markers for applications across multiple tumour types and cumbersome data analysis.</p><p id="Par11222"><bold>Methods:</bold> To facilitate further clinical research on MSI, Thermo Fisher Scientific has developed the Applied Biosystems™ TrueMark™ MSI assay. This multiplex fluorescent PCR panel consists of eight markers used historically in Lynch syndrome and MSI identification as well as five novel quasi-monomorphic homopolymers. Two human identification satellite tandem repeats are included for sample traceability.</p><p id="Par11223"><bold>Results:</bold> Fourteen of the 15 amplicons are less than 180 base pairs in length to maximize robustness in degraded FFPE samples. This 15-plex fluorescent PCR fragment analysis assay is performed via a standard capillary electrophoresis workflow and requires low input DNA (2ng). The included software automatically detects unstable microsatellite markers and sample contamination or mix-up. To demonstrate the utility of the expanded panel and software solution, we performed a retrospective study using FFPE research samples derived from colon, gastric, and endometrial cancers. This assay produced high concordance with immunohistochemistry and fewer ambiguous results relative to the Promega MSI assay due to the expanded marker set.</p><p id="Par11224"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The combination of our expanded marker set and automated data analysis software constitutes an important tool for studying microsatellite instability.

The personal history revealed a xeroderma pigmentosum diagnosed at the age of 6 months. Physical exam found a right pelvic mass. The ultrasound exam concluded to a 20 cm, solid, ovarian tumour with ascites. The patient had laparotomy.</p><p id="Par11232"><bold>Results:</bold> In gross, we received 21 cm white mass with haemorrhagic and necrosis areas. The pathologic exam reported a poor differentiated sex-cord tumour with dominantly rhabdomysarcomatous component. This component was dense and arranged in diffuse sheets.

Here, we present a new strategy to detect this rare tumour through a standard DNA methylation array analysis.</p><p id="Par11247"><bold>Methods:</bold> The DNA methylation profile obtained on an Infinium Human Methylation EPIC BeadChip array (Illumina, USA). The data were compared to a given dataset against more than 15'500 reference datasets mostly derived from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus. The analysis considers both the DNA methylation profile and the copy number variations, extracted by conumee.</p><p id="Par11248"><bold>Results:</bold> Indicated a high similarity of NUT midline carcinoma to squamous carcinomas of the lung (NSCLC_SC) when compared by dimension reduction (UMAP). As opposed to NSCLC_SC, NMC has a flat genome and a circumscribed loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 15q, adjacent to the NUTM1 locus.

Herein, we presented a novel SOS1-ALK fusion and the efficacy of crizotinib to an advanced NSCLC patient who harbouring this type of fusion.</p><p id="Par11331"><bold>Results:</bold> A 52-year-old Chinese man with left upper lobe primary NSCLC and synchronous multiple lung metastases. The EUS-FNA of palpable left supraclavicular lymph nodes and results of immunohistochemistry staining supported lung adenocarcinoma metastasis. By using NGS assay, we found the tumour had SOS1-ALK fusion rather than other actionable mutations. In that case, the patient took the first line crizotinib and experienced a remarkable tumour response to it and tolerance well until written.</p><p id="Par11332"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Considering this rare SOS1-ALK fusion and remarkable response to ALK-inhibitor, it is worthful to aware of the presence of SOS1-ALK fusion in NSCLC to guide target therapy.

We present a rare case of a patient initially diagnosed as IgA nephropathy with thrombotic microangiopathy which subsequently was diagnosed with visceral leishmaniasis.</p><p id="Par11348"><bold>Methods:</bold> Light microscope, immunofluorescence, electron microscope and real time PCR</p><p id="Par11349"><bold>Results:</bold> A male patient aged 43, presented with acute renal failure, nephrotic range proteinuria and microscopic haematuria. His immunologic control demonstrated ANA1:1280, positive lupus anticoagulant and positive anti-SSA and anti-SSB. Clinically, the patient was suspected for an autoimmune disorder. The renal biopsy showed an IgA nephropathy (M0E0S1T0-C0 according to the Oxford Classification) accompanied by severe thrombotic microangiopathy, acute and chronic. The subsequent clinical and laboratory investigation revealed visceral leishmaniasis.

In the first biopsy the patient aged22years and presented proteinuria, microscopic haematuria and creatinine 1.2mg/dl. Light microscope showed a morphologic pattern of FSGS with some intracapillary hyaline pseudothrombi without global glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), inflammation or arterial intimal thickening.</p><p id="Par11357"><bold>Results:</bold> Ten years later, a second biopsy was performed due to appearance of nephrotic syndrome and increase of creatinine (2.2mg/dl). Apart from FSGS and intracapillary pseudothrombi, the biopsy showed global glomerulosclerosis, significant glomerular basement membrane (GBM)thickening with segmental duplications and foamy material into the duplicated GBMs, the capillary lumens and the arterial walls. IFTA progressed from absent to 50% of the cortex area. Interstitial inflammation was superimposed as well as arterial lesions. Immunofluorescence in both biopsies showed C3 deposition.</p><p id="Par11358"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In the second biopsy, EM showed lipid vacuoles massively accumulated in mesangial, subendothelial, intramembranous and subepithelial locations, forming huge hump and fingerprint-like lipid accumulations. Moreover, lipid accumulation was noticed in the interstitial tissue, tubular basement membranes and arterial walls. Accumulation and expansion of lipid material, triggering IFTA and global glomerulosclerosis, seems to be the underlying cause of progressive renal damage and nephrotic proteinuria in patients with LCAT deficiency.</p><p id="Par11359"><bold>E-PS-18-005</bold></p><p id="Par11360"><bold>Primary hyperoxaluria diagnosed on bone marrow biopsy in a renal transplant patient</bold></p><p id="Par11361"><underline>Á.

The most severe form is caused by deficiency of a liver-peroxisomal enzyme. Its defect leads to the conversation of glyoxylate to oxalate. Oxalate forms insoluble crystals with calcium accumulating in multiple organs.</p><p id="Par11364"><bold>Methods:</bold> 58-year-old woman had renal transplantation two years ago. Since infancy she had recurrent chronic pyelonephritis and nephrolithiasis resulting in end stage kidney disease. Few month after transplantation elevated paraproteins were detected. On serum electrophoresis gamma fraction showed a peak of monoclonal IgG kappa. Pathologic vertebral fracture was also revealed. Therefore, bone marrow biopsy was performed to exclude plasma cell myeloma.</p><p id="Par11365"><bold>Results:</bold> Bone marrow biopsy showed trilineage haematopoiesis with maturation. There were also areas rich in needle-shaped, birefringent calcium-oxalate crystals arranged in rosettes, surrounded by a foreign body giant cell reaction. Abnormal plasma cell proliferation was not detected. The diagnosis was oxalosis with secondary granulomatous reaction.</p><p id="Par11366">The patient received a renal transplant. Six months after renal transplantation, the renal function progressively decreased.

The first renal biopsy was performed when she developed haematuria and proteinuria. The second renal biopsy was performed 2 years later because of increased proteinuria despite the patient receiving treatment for SLE.</p><p id="Par11376"><bold>Results:</bold> The first renal biopsy revealed most glomeruli showed a bubbly appearance of the basement membrane with focal mesangial expansion histologically. IF analysis showed positivity only for IgM in the mesangial area, and there was no immune deposits by EM, but we found slight podocytic infolding into the basement membrane. The second renal biopsy showed podocytic infolding was still apparent and more evident than before by EM.</p><p id="Par11377"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Most of PIG cases have underlying autoimmune disease. The condition affects women more frequently, and the average age of patients is 37.5 years. These clinical aspects seem to correspond to those of collagen diseases. It remains under debate as to whether this entity is a new disease of the podocytes of represents a non-specific reaction of the podocytes.

Ethical clearance was obtained. Immunohistochemistry was done using IDH-1 R132H, p53 and EGFR monoclonal antibodies. Cases were reviewed using the WHO Classification (2016). Membranous and cytoplasmic staining of EGFR and IDH-1R132H monoclonal antibodies respectively were regarded positive, nuclear staining of p53 mouse antibody was regarded positive.</p><p id="Par11596"><bold>Results:</bold> Males constituted a majority of cases, 50 (61.7%). Male - Female ratio was 1.6:1. Mean age was 30.6 years. There was a tendency for tumours to be of higher WHO grades with increasing age, albeit glioblastoma cases tended to present at younger ages. The higher WHO grades were more likely to be located supratentorially. Glioblastomas accounted for most of the diagnosis 39 (48.1%), followed by pilocytic astrocytomas at 23 (28.4%). There was a low positive cytoplasmic expression of IDH-1 with only 3 (3.7%) being positive, 8 (9.9%) showed a positive nuclear expression for mutant p53 while 17 (21%) showed membranous positivity for EGFR expression.</p><p id="Par11597"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Glioblastomas in this study presented in younger patients.

However, few other neoplasms match its heterogeneity. While the name "glioblastoma multiforme" is no longer in use, it perfectly encompasses the variable histology of this tumour.</p><p id="Par11603"><bold>Methods:</bold> The glial nature of most glioblastomas becomes apparent during microscopic evaluation but, with the increase of stereotaxic needle biopsies, new difficulties arise.</p><p id="Par11604">We present the case of a 65 years old man, admitted to our hospital with seizures and left crural paresis.

Rashid*</underline>, A. Haider</p><p id="Par11614">*Hamad General Hospital, Qatar</p><p id="Par11615"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Calcifying pseudoneoplasm of the neuraxis is a rare benign lesion with around 60 reported cases. It is predominantly found in young adults without gender predilection. It carries good prognosis unlike the other common calcifying lesions of the brain.</p><p id="Par11616"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 30-year-old male with no known co-morbidities was brought by ambulance, reported to be convulsing for a few minutes by his roommate after which he became sleepy but was fully conscious when the paramedics arrived. An MRI head with contrast showed a well-defined lesion in left parietal lobe with areas of curvilinear enhancement along with calcification.</p><p id="Par11617"><bold>Results:</bold> Possibility of a long-standing vascular malformation with calcification was raised. Craniotomy with complete resection of the lesion was done. Histopathological analysis showed a calcified lesion composed of chondromyxoid matrix in a nodular pattern exhibiting radial fibrillarity at the periphery focally covered by palisading spindled to epithelioid cells with little fibrous stroma, calcification and osseous metaplasia. Adjacent brain parenchyma showed Rosenthal fibres.</p><p id="Par11618">Upon immunohistochemistry, the spindle cells stained positive for Epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), Vimentin and Progesterone receptor (PR).

We report a case of ossified retroperitoneal schwannoma which was detected simultaneously with kidney cancer.</p><p id="Par11625"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 52-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with a tumour of the left kidney 3.7 cm in diameter. The examination revealed an additional tumour of the retroperitoneal space 12.0 cm in diameter. The kidney tumour was resected, and the retroperitoneal tumour was removed. The connection between them was not revealed. Histological and immunohistochemical studies of these tumours were performed.</p><p id="Par11626"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopically the kidney tumour was a clear cell renal cell carcinoma, G1. The second tumour had a different structure. It was composed of closely packed, hyperchromatic spindle-shaped cells, in some places mitotically active with Ki-67 up to 20%. There were areas of sclerosis, hyalinization, xanthomatous and inflammatory cell infiltration, irregularly spaced vessels, and foci of ossification of various sizes. Immunohistochemically, cellular cites arranged in bundles or interlacing fascicles were S-100, SOX10 and NSE strongly positive. This tumour was diagnosed as a benign schwannoma with severe degenerative changes including ossification (“ancient” schwannoma) and cellular areas (Antoni A).</p><p id="Par11627"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Ossification in schwannomas is a very rare process and may complicate the diagnosis. Correct assessment of the whole tumour structure and the use of immunohistochemical markers help to avoid diagnostical mistakes.

Neuroimaging described an irregular, heterogeneously contrast-enhancing mass with surrounding oedema and hemosiderin deposits in the temporal-cerebellar region.</p><p id="Par11634"><bold>Results:</bold> The intraoperative consultation surprisingly revealed two different lesions. The temporoparietal mass showed typical features of glioblastoma while the one in the cerebellopontine angle revealed a schwannoma with a predominant Antoni A pattern.

Histopathologic examination of the mass which was hard in consistency revealed an inflammatory infiltrate in a background of sclerosis with conspicuous concentric pattern around small-calibre arterioles. Inflammatory infiltrate was rich in eosinophils, accompanied by lymphocytes and plasma cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed to rule out IgG4-related disease. Staining for CD34 was present on endothelial cells in sclerotic nodules.

Usually, the histopathology parallels the etiopathogeny and risk factors of this condition. Our short case series present the morphological aspects of PAS, correlated with pathophysiological and clinical background.</p><p id="Par11868"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present five cases with different degrees of PAS, diagnosed between 2009-2019, at the “Elena Doamna” Obstetrics and Gynaecology University Hospital of Iasi. The postpartum hysterectomy specimens have been histologically assessed by routine, trichrome, and CD146 immunohistochemical techniques. Maternal age, gestational age, degree of adherence/invasion, implantation site intermediate trophoblast, villous trophoblast, decidua, basal plate myometrial fibres have been evaluated.</p><p id="Par11869"><bold>Results:</bold> Three cases presented direct adherence of chorionic villi to the myometrium (placenta accreta), one case presented implantation site intermediate trophoblast (ISIT) between myometrium and villous tissue (placenta accreta), and one case presented the penetration of placental villi through the uterine wall (placenta percreta), all cases with partial (one case) and complete (four cases) absence of the decidua basalis. Two cases of placenta accreta presented myometrial fibres in the basal plate. The characteristic excessive ISIT invasion as well as maternal vascular changes were highlighted through immunostaining with CD146. The most unexpected case was of the patient of 17 years, in which the degree of myometrial invasion was the most advanced.</p><p id="Par11870"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Immunohistochemistry represents a useful tool for avoiding diagnosis pitfalls in placenta accreta.

We present the case of lethal multiple pterygium syndrome with extreme morphological changes, clinically manifested as intrauterine foetal death at 25th gestational week.</p><p id="Par11876"><bold>Methods:</bold> Conventional foetal autopsy, placenta histomorphology, post-mortem foetal radiography, array-based comparative genome hybridization as well as whole-exome sequencing of foetus and parents (Agilent SureSelect Human All Exon) followed by bioinformatical gene filtration analysis were employed.</p><p id="Par11877"><bold>Results:</bold> Postmortal foetal radiography was unremarkable. We found a male foetus with a dorsal multilocular cyst contacting 300 ml of serous liquid, muscular atrophy and pronounced skin webbing around neck and all peripheral joints with very limited passive flexion and extension. The face was deformed with open and luxated mandibula and open eyes. There was no sign of lip cleft. The internal examination demonstrated partial diaphragm agenesis with intrathoracic herniation of spleen and colon, cardiac dislocation, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Foetal histology revealed calcified thrombus in renal vessels. The placenta was macrosomic with the histopathological findings of foetal vascular malperfusion. Surprisingly, no mutations usually associated with the condition were detected.</p><p id="Par11878"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This case of multiple pterygium syndrome is featured by the prominent neck and joint webbing, muscular atrophy, cystic hygroma as well as some secondary changes. The normal cervical vertebra and male sex exclude Turner, Noonan, and Klippel-Feil syndromes. Whole-exome sequencing was unexpectedly negative for the known associated mutations. The condition is usually linked to gene mutations in embryonic acetylcholine receptors, actin-binding receptor, and skeletal muscle calcium release channel.</p><p id="Par11879"><bold>E-PS-22-005</bold></p><p id="Par11880"><bold>Nasal glial heterotopia: a case report</bold></p><p id="Par11881">N.

The Lin–Weiss–Bisceglia scoring system, used for the adult counterpart tumours, was applied: if an oncocytic tumour shows at least one or more major criterions, it is classified as “malignant”.</p><p id="Par11904"><bold>Results:</bold> A 7-year-old boy and a 6-months-old girl presented a mass, respectively, weighed g 80 and g 65, and measuring cm 6x5x3.5 and cm 5x4x2.5. Both tumours were composed almost entirely of cells exhibiting oncocytic morphology. In the first case a unique atypical mitosis, &gt;5 mitoses per 50 high-power fields, as well as a focal sinusoidal invasion of tumour capsule were identified. In the second case a high mitotic index, rare, atypical mitoses, foci of necrosis and sinusoidal invasion were seen. Both tumours were classified as “oncocytic adrenocortical carcinomas”.

The foetus examinated now was again prenatally genetically diagnosis as Fuhrmann syndrome.</p><p id="Par12009"><bold>Results:</bold> Phokomelia of the lower limbs was the dominant feature, furthermore signs were micro-retrognatia and hypertelorism. Radiology confirmed missing ulnae, oligo- and syndactyly, highly hypoplastic pelvis and aplasia resp. shortening of the lower limbs. Internal autopsy revealed as additional malformations a split uvula, left sided diaphragmal defect, consecutive herniation of the left liver lobe, the spleen and stomach into the thorax, a two-part pancreas and a lung sequester on the left side. Histology, though slightly hampered by autolysis, displayed organs’ development according to gestational age. Likewise, brain was developed according to gestational age.</p><p id="Par12010"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our case presents malformations typical for AARR syndrome.

TC examination revealed an abdominal mass, as well as multiple nodules. Patient underwent laparotomy showing multiple omental nodules. Partial omentectomy with numerous nodules, ranging from 4 to 40 mm, was performed for histological examination.</p><p id="Par12033"><bold>Results:</bold> Histologically, nodules were composed of relatively bland-looking spindle cells arranged in a fascicular growth pattern with focal whorling. Mitoses were rare (2mitoses/10HPF) and focal areas of necrosis was seen. Desmoplastic stromal reaction was absent. Tumour was reminiscent of an infantile fibrosarsoma. Immunohostochemically neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin, desmin, WT-1 (nuclear staining-C-terminus) and EMA. The clinical presentation and the polyphenotypic immunoprofile suggested the diagnosis of DSRCT with unusual morphology, which was supported by the detection of EWSR1-WT1 fusion gene (PCR).

However, studies using different HNF4α clones showed variable results. We aim to investigate the expression of HNF4α in IMA and non-mucinous adenocarcinoma (NMA) using different HNF4α clones.</p><p id="Par12141"><bold>Methods:</bold> Two commercially available HNF4α antibodies (clones H9 and H1415) were used to examine HNF4α expression in 30 IMA and 40 NMA cases. The intensity and proportion were separately evaluated by three pathologists, and an average Histoscore (range, 0-300) was calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimal cut-off value, sensitivity and specificity of each clone.</p><p id="Par12142"><bold>Results:</bold> The IMA group showed a significantly higher mean Histoscore than the NMA group for both H1415 (136.1 vs. 6.3) and H9 (60.3 vs. 2.7) (p&lt;0.001 for both comparisons). Using ROC curve to determine the Histoscore cut-off value at 27.65 (clone H1415) and 14.85 (clone H9), H1415 showed a higher sensitivity (83.3% vs. 70.0%) with similar specificity (95.0% vs 95.0%) compared to H9.</p><p id="Par12143"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results demonstrates that HNF4α expression is significantly higher in IMA compared to NMA and is a reliable marker for distinguishing IMA from NMA. Although both clones show high specificity for IMA, clone H1415 is more sensitive compared to H9, and the stronger staining intensity of clone H1415 also makes it more suitable for usage in clinical practice.</p><p id="Par12144"><bold>E-PS-24-011</bold></p><p id="Par12145"><bold>Alveolar adenoma of the lung</bold></p><p id="Par12146"><underline>T.

Pleural EH is a sporadic tumour whose etiopathogenesis is not well defined.</p><p id="Par12244"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present the case of a patient in the second decade of life who debuted with a left pleural effusion, bilateral pleural and pulmonary nodules in the context of a left lower lobar pulmonary mass confirmed by thoracic CT and body PET. Cultures and PCR for negative mycobacteria.</p><p id="Par12245"><bold>Results:</bold> Under the optical microscope, nests of abnormal endothelial cells, consisting of epithelioid or histiocytoid cells, were seen. The nuclei of the cells are eccentric, vacuolated and similar to the cells in the signet ring. The cytoplasm is eosinophilic, with vacuoles of different sizes in the cytoplasm of some tumour cells. Immunohistochemistry was positive for CD31, D2-40 and focally for calretinin, HMB-45 and CEA, being negative for CD-34, CK7, napsin A, TTF-1, pancytokeratin, common leukocyte antigen, WT-1 and e-cadherin.

MECs are characterized by mucus secreting, squamous and intermediate-type cells, subclassified as low or high-grade tumours. More than 50% of MECs affect population under 30 years.</p><p id="Par12252"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 31-year-old woman in 36th week of gestation was admitted due to haemoptysis. Bronchoscopy revealed bronchial intraluminal mass, obstructing the orifice of the right lower lobe. Transbronchial needle aspiration and biopsy were performed. Prior to surgical treatment, caesarean section was carried out with good neonatal outcome. Afterwards, video-assisted thoracoscopic right lower lobectomy with mediastinal lymph node dissection was done.</p><p id="Par12253"><bold>Results:</bold> On transbronchial biopsy the diagnosis of MEC was obtained. Immunohistochemistry showed p40 positivity, TTF-1 negativity and Ki67 up to 15% in hot spots.

Benign neoplasms of the tracheobronchial tree are rare, and lipomas are one of the most uncommon. Endobronchial lipomas (EL) represent 0.1–0.5% of all lung neoplasms.</p><p id="Par12280"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present the case of a 73-year-old man with a clinical history of lung adenocarcinoma with a contralateral pedunculated, white, “polyplike” lesion founded during a follow-up flexible bronchoscopy.

Imaging revealed large intra-abdominal masses with multiple peritoneal nodules. Biopsy was performed and showed, in both cases, a proliferation of small round cells arranged in nests separated by a slightly cellular fibrous tissue. These cells have a scanty, poorly delimited cytoplasm and monomorphic hyperchromatic nuclei. Mitoses are rare. Some cells had a rhabdoid appearance.

Its prevalence depends on the location and is much more common in soft tissue than bones. Herein we report a rare case of bone malignant mesenchymoma.</p><p id="Par12381"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 72-year-old male patient with a history of myasthenia gravis was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of progression of the disease. A thoracic computer tomography was conducted and revealed large tumour of the right eighth rib. Core needle biopsy followed by standard pathological evaluation and ancillary genetic tests were performed.</p><p id="Par12382"><bold>Results:</bold> The biopsy showed pleomorphic neoplasm with complex morphological pattern. Foci of chondroblastic (S100 and SOX9 positive), osteoblastic (SATB2 positive) and rhabdomyoblastic (desmin and myogenin positive) differentiation were present. Due to the fact that all three components showed malignant features and no IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were detected, final diagnosis of chondroblastic osteosarcoma with heterologous rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation was made. Next generation sequencing (NGS) using FusionPlex Kit did not reveal any genomic abnormalities.</p><p id="Par12383"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although malignant mesenchymoma of bone is a very rare tumour, such entity should be kept in mind in case of complex bone neoplasm. It is also important to underscore that chondroblastic osteosarcoma undergoing heterologous differentiation is a different entity than a dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma. In keeping with complex genomic alterations reported in osteosarcomas with absence of common genetic lesions our NGS analysis has not revealed any potentially targetable molecular alterations.</p><p id="Par12384"><bold>E-PS-25-007</bold></p><p id="Par12385"><bold>A perivascular epithelioid cell tumour (PEComa) in the retroperitoneum, with a pattern recalling lymphangioleiomyomatosis of the lung – a case report</bold></p><p id="Par12386"><underline>J.R.

Also, have a characteristic immunophenotype.</p><p id="Par12389"><bold>Methods:</bold> We describe a case of a 38-year-old woman, admitted to the hospital with a spontaneous pneumothorax. During work-up, TC revealed a retroperitoneal, solid mass and an endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (EUS-FNAC) was performed. Afterwards, she underwent excisional surgery.</p><p id="Par12390"><bold>Results:</bold> EUS-FNAC revealed groups of monotonous spindle cells. The pathology specimen with a lacerated surface, measured 42mm in greatest dimension. On histology, we observed a mesenchymal neoplasm, comprised of spindle cells with granular, light eosinophilic cytoplasm, oval nuclei and small nucleoli, organized in fascicular pattern and interconnected with vascular channels. These were immunorreactive for Podoplanin and the spindle cells marked for smooth muscle and melanocytic antibodies, confirming the diagnosis of a PEComa with lymphangioleiomyoma pattern. We counted 2 mitosis per 50 HPF, without other high grade features. Due to an incomplete surgical margin, invasion and neoplasm's complete size were not assessable, thus lacking features to apply the Folpe criteria for malignancy.</p><p id="Par12391"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PEComas with lymphangioleiomyoma pattern can arise in the retroperitoneum, even without clear context of lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

It displays a specific chromosomal translocation t(X;18)(p11;q11) that provokes a SS18-SSX fusion gene. SS of the hand has distinct clinical behaviour and treatment opportunities.</p><p id="Par12413"><bold>Methods:</bold> Man, aged 29, presented with a swelling of the right palmar aspect of his hand. Radiologically, a soft tissue palm mass was detected without any relationship or erosion to adjacent bones. CT of thorax, CNS and abdomen (-). After surgery: multinodular, compact, centrally cystic, whitish/grey tumour, measuring 5,5X5cm. Paraffin-embedded tissue was stained with hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry. Molecular analysis was performed.</p><p id="Par12414"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopically, a neoplasm, composed of spindle cells arranged in a fascicular or “herring-bone” pattern, was revealed. The cells were ovoid, fairly uniform with hyperchromatic nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli. Mitoses: 19/HPF(X40). Necrosis: (+ in &lt;50% of tumour). Focally, calcification, osteoid and woven bone formation was present, resembling osteosarcoma, osteogenic or extraskeletal. The differential diagnosis comprised mainly osteosarcoma, clear cell sarcoma of soft parts, malignant solitary fibrous tumour, MPNST and synovial sarcoma. Immunohistochemistry: Vimentin(+), EMA(+/-), CKAE1/AE3(+ in single cells), bcl2(+), CD99(+), TLE-1(+), S100(+), MelanA(-), HMB45(-), CD34(-), Desmin(-), Ki67(8-10%).

Herein we report a case of a PEComa in posterior mediastinum, displaying aggressive histological features.</p><p id="Par12476"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 36-year-old male patient, locksmith, without previous relevant medical history, was admitted in hospital due to a “heavy” chest sensation and dyspnoea, with nocturnal worsening. MRI revealed a well circumscribed posterior mediastinum mass, 9,5cm of largest diameter without contrast enhancement. Surgery was performed.</p><p id="Par12477"><bold>Results:</bold> Grossly, a 221g solid yellow mass with 9,5cm of greatest dimension. Microscopically the neoplasm consisted of polygonal, epithelioid or spindle shaped cells with large granular eosinophilic cytoplasm and prominent nuclear atypia. Multinucleated and bizarre cells were identified, frequently featuring lipidic vacuoles. Occasional atypical mitotic figures were identified and tumoral necrosis was also present. Immunohistochemistry revealed multifocal expression of the melanocytic markers Melan-A and HMB45 and the myogenic marker desmin. No expression of cytokeratins, smooth muscle actin, S100 protein or SOX10 was observed. Our diagnosis was PEComa with aggressive histological features. Adjuvant local radiotherapy was performed.

MRI suggested synovialosarcoma. On biopsy specimen, the tumour grows as diffuse, expansile sheats. The tumour was composed of large cells with pale to eosinophile abundant cytoplasm. Nuclei were reniform, with prominent nucleoli. Excision was performed. Histologically, the lesion was well-demarcated without infiltrative growth. There were two types of regular mononuclear cells: small in size histiocyte-like and larger epithelioid cells. There were extremely rare multinucleated osteoclast-like giant cells.

We present a case of MIPL which was difficult to diagnose pre‑operatively and discuss several differential diagnosis.</p><p id="Par12492"><bold>Methods:</bold> We report the case of 67-year-old women who presented with multiple abdominal hard masses. A CT-scan of the abdomen revealed numerous masses in the abdomino-pelvic cavity, which was characterized by two components, a fatty density and a non-adipose solid portion. It showed also thickening of the antro-pyloric, duodenum and colonic wall.</p><p id="Par12493"><bold>Results:</bold> Digestive endoscopy revealed submucosal masses protruding in the gastric and colic lumen. Endoscopic and CT-guided biopsies were realized and several diagnoses were suggested: inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour and desmoid fibromatosis. A laparotomy was performed to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Numerous fatty nodules and masses were identified within the greater omentum, the mesentery and the meso-colon. The complete resection was impossible to perform due to the large number of nodular lesions and the involvement of the gastro-intestinal wall. Histological analysis of an omentum mass revealed mature adipocytes and scattered hyperchromatic pleomorphic cells. Immunohistochemically, tumour cells were positive for MDM2. FISH demonstrated MDM2 gene amplification. The final diagnosis was of a MIPL.</p><p id="Par12494"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A pre-operative diagnosis of a MIPL may be challenging due to the rarity and lack of awareness of the tumour. The location and the multiplicity of these tumours in the present case make it unique. Although uncommon, liposarcoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis for masses involving the gastrointestinal tract, particularly if there is significant or unusual involvement of the surrounding adipose tissue.</p><p id="Par12495"><bold>E-PS-25-023</bold></p><p id="Par12496"><bold>Pulmonary artery intimal sarcoma: a case report</bold></p><p id="Par12497"><underline>F.

Symptoms and imaging of pulmonary IS mimic pulmonary thromboembolism (PE). We report a case of IS of the right main pulmonary artery.</p><p id="Par12500"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 59 year old female presented to the primary care with chest pain and shortness of breath. She was thought to have possible central right PE but imaging was not typical. Repeat CT scan and EBUS revealed a high-grade sarcoma. Subsequent right pneumonectomy showed a solid mass within the main pulmonary artery.</p><p id="Par12501"><bold>Results:</bold> Histology demonstrated a cellular neoplasm originating from the arterial wall and occluding the lumen. The morphology was of a poorly differentiated, mainly patternless, neoplasm, with areas of necrosis, and easily identifiable mitoses. Focally intersecting bundles of spindle cells, as well as more epithelioid and multinucleated giant cell forms were noted. Nuclear pleomorphism was prominent. On immunohistochemistry the tumour was positive for desmin, SMA, focally for EMA. It was negative for AE1/3, caldesmon, CD31, CD34, S100, Melan A, HMB45, CD117 and DOG1. EGFR polysomy was identified. MDM2 was not amplified. The diagnosis of intimal sarcoma was made. The lesion was excised by a narrow margin. The patient underwent post-operative radiotherapy.</p><p id="Par12502"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The pulmonary artery IS is a rare aggressive tumour, often mimicking PE.

The aim is to describe a case of retroperitoneal angiomyolipoma misdiagnosed as ovarian tumour.</p><p id="Par12645"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 50 year old woman presented with a right, pelvic and painless mass. There was no familiar or personal history. The physical examination was clean. An abdominal ultrasonography was revealed an ovarian mass with large haemorrhagic and necrotic areas. Torsion of fibrothecoma was clinically suspected.</p><p id="Par12646"><bold>Results:</bold> Macroscopically, it was an 18 cm, encapsulated and dark brownish mass with large foci of necrosis and haemorrhage. The microscopic examination concluded to retroperitoneal angiomyolipoma, as tumour was composed of variable proportions of adipose tissue, spindle cells, epithelioid smooth muscle cells and abnormal thick-walled blood vessels.

This study presents the case of a 69YO male who was admitted to the neurosurgery clinic 2 weeks after the onset of a left hemiparesis, mimicking the symptoms of a stroke.</p><p id="Par12670"><bold>Methods:</bold> Physical examination revealed a parieto-temporal, subcutaneous, immobile, mass. Cranial CT examination has revealed a iodine absorbing mass in the right cerebral hemisphere that dislodged the brain and invaded the superjacent bones. Further CT examination of the full body revealed a prostatic mass and multiple destructive lytic lesions in the axial skeleton and ribs. Bloodwork did not reveal anything unusual.</p><p id="Par12671"><bold>Results:</bold> The tumour was surgically removed and sent to Pathology. Based on the histopathological features in concordance with IHC reactions (positive for CKAE1/AE3, NKX3.1, EMA and negative for CK7, Synaptophysin, GATA3, CDX2, TTF-1, HER2neu and CK HMW), the diagnosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma metastasis was established.

Axial skeleton metastases from a prostatic adenocarcinoma are somewhat a common finding, whereas the calvarium is an unusual location for such entities. Calvarium metastasis that precede the primary tumour diagnosis of prostate cancer are rare, and unfortunately, a sign of an end stage disease.</p><p id="Par12673"><bold>E-PS-27-008</bold></p><p id="Par12674"><bold>Molecular and immunohistochemical evaluation of BAP-1 in bladder and comparison with luminal-basal subtyping</bold></p><p id="Par12675"><underline>B.

There are very few molecular and immunohistochemical studies about BRCA1-associated protein-1(BAP-1) in bladder. We aimed to evaluate BAP-1 expression molecularly and immunohistochemically and determine subtypes with GATA-3 and Cytokeratin5/6 immunohistochemical stains.</p><p id="Par12678"><bold>Methods:</bold> Tumour and normal tissues of 11 patients with known primary bladder tumours were taken freshly during the operation. We applied BAP-1 antibody with reverse transcription-PCR and Western Blot method. In addition,150 non-invasive and 150 invasive tumour paraffin blocks were selected from transurethral resection materials. GATA-3, Cytokeratin5/6 and BAP-1 immunohistochemical stains were applied and evaluated in total 300 cases.</p><p id="Par12679"><bold>Results:</bold> BAP-1 protein expression levels were increased in tumour tissues compared to normal tissues in Western Blot (9 of 11). In the immunohistochemical evaluation of BAP-1, the muscle invasive group (solid morphology) showed statistically significant severe expression. GATA-3 expression severity and percentage, showing luminal subtype, was statistically significantly higher in the non-invasive group. The expression severity of Cytokeratin5/6, showing basal subtype, was statistically significantly higher in the muscle invasive group.</p><p id="Par12680"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this study, molecular BAP-1 protein expression levels, which have not been studied in bladder before, were found to be higher in the tumour tissues than the normal tissues. It was concluded that immunohistochemical BAP-1 evaluation may also vary according to tumour grade and papillary morphology. Also, it was determined that GATA-3 and Cytokeratin5/6 immunohistochemical stains can be used for basal and luminal subtyping of bladder tumours and especially the degree of invasion is compatible with this subtyping.</p><p id="Par12681"><bold>E-PS-27-009</bold></p><p id="Par12682"><bold>Tubulo-villous adenoma with invasive adenocarcinoma component of the female urinary meatus</bold></p><p id="Par12683"><underline>I.D.

We describe a case of villous adenoma associated with invasive adenocarcinoma developed in female external urethral orifice.</p><p id="Par12686"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 69‐year‐old woman was admitted at the Urology Department. Physical examination showed an exophytic lesion circumferentially anchored at the upper part of the urinary meatus. The patient had no significant past medical history. Gynaecological and gastroenterological exams were normal. Tumour resection was performed. The excised specimen was specifically processed through paraffin embedding technique for standard histological and immunohistochemical exams.</p><p id="Par12687"><bold>Results:</bold> Gross examination showed a polypoid, fleshy mass, of 1.2 cm diameter. Histopathology revealed an epithelial tubulo-papillary proliferation lined by normal and pseudostratified columnar epithelium showing nuclear crowding, hyperchromasia, and goblet cells, with focal areas of low- and high-grade dysplasia. Several zones of invasive adenocarcinoma were identified in lamina propria. The epithelial proliferation was CK 20 and CDX2 positive, CK7 negative; Ki67 varied from 30% (adenoma) to 90% (malignant component).</p><p id="Par12688"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The final diagnosis was tubulo-villous adenoma associated with invasive adenocarcinoma, originating in the urinary meatus. The main differential diagnosis of villous adenoma of the urinary tract is a possible metastatic adenocarcinoma from adjacent anatomical sites (particularly from colon). The key elements of this case consist in the very rare location - the external urethral orifice, and the evidences for the malignant transformation.</p><p id="Par12689"><bold>E-PS-27-010</bold></p><p id="Par12690"><bold>Immunohistochemical findings in vasitis nodosa - case report</bold></p><p id="Par12691"><underline>M.I.

These ducts were lined by a single layer of cuboidal to columnar epithelium with clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm and round to spindle shaped nuclei with hyperchromasia and coarse granular chromatin.

Herein, we present a renal cystic tumour from our routine practice.</p><p id="Par12736"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 41-year old woman, without relevant clinical history, started with intermittent low back pain with three weeks of duration. Abdominal-pelvic computed tomography revealed the existence of a renal multilocular cystic lesion, with thick septations, and consequently was submitted to radical nephroureterectomy.</p><p id="Par12737"><bold>Results:</bold> Macroscopically, there was a well-circumscribed capsulated cystic multiloculated tumour with 8 cm, with non-communicating cysts with variable sizes and thick septa with translucent content, and focal spongy microcystic areas. Histologically, the cysts were lined by flat to columnar epithelium sometimes with hobnail features and eosinophilic to amphophilic cytoplasm, without atypia; the stromal component ranges from hypocellular and collagenous to hypercellular spindled areas, often with an ovarian stroma-like appearance, without atypia and mitoses; the stromal cells were immunoreactive for smooth muscle actin, desmin, CD10, oestrogen and progesterone receptors. These features were consistent with the diagnosis of adult cystic nephroma.</p><p id="Par12738"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Adult cystic nephroma is a rare renal biphasic tumour with epithelial and stromal components, mainly benign. Rarely, it can have an aggressive behaviour, especially in malignant transformation cases. This tumour typically occurs in perimenopausal women with a mean age of 52 years, in contrast to our younger patient. The hormonal imbalance is an important etiological factor in the histopathogenesis of this tumour.</p><p id="Par12739"><bold>E-PS-27-017</bold></p><p id="Par12740"><bold>Papillary prostate ductal adenocarcinoma mimicking papillary urothelial carcinoma in bladder transurethral resection</bold></p><p id="Par12741"><underline>S.

It can be diagnostically challenging when encountered in organs other than prostate. Here we present a papillary PDA mimicking papillary bladder neoplasm.</p><p id="Par12744"><bold>Methods:</bold> This case is about an 80-year old man who presented with nocturia and urgency. Computer tomography showed diffuse thickening of the bladder wall and polypoid structures projecting to luminal space. Therefore, he underwent transurethral resection (TUR) of the urinary bladder.</p><p id="Par12745"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopic examination showed a tumour composed of focal cribriform and mostly of papillary structures with fibrovascular cores lined by tall, pseudostratified columnar epithelium with high-grade nuclei in keeping with the initial clinical diagnosis of papillary urothelial carcinoma. There was extensive crush artefact. In some areas papillary fronds were lined by single layer of cuboidal or hobnail cells with crowded, round-to-ovoid hyperchromatic nuclei reminiscent of a nephrogenic adenoma with papillary architecture. The tumour was negative for cytokeratin-7, GATA3, p63 and PAX8. Past disease history revealed high grade prostate acinar adenocarcinoma with ductal component. The additional immunostains showed tumour to be positive with NKX3.1, PSAP and PSA.</p><p id="Par12746"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PDA should be always kept in mind when evaluating metastatic carcinomas showing papillary or cribriform architecture in elderly male patients. Unusual histological findings such as hobnail cells or tall columnar cells with high grade nuclei should raise the possibility of PDA when encountered in urinary bladder papillary neoplasms.</p><p id="Par12747"><bold>E-PS-27-018</bold></p><p id="Par12748"><bold>Low-grade oncocytic tumour of the kidney, an emerging entity: a report of two cases and review of the literature</bold></p><p id="Par12749"><underline>M.

MCC metastases to the testis are an exceptional occurrence, with only eight cases reported to date in literature. We hereby report the ninth.</p><p id="Par12837"><bold>Methods:</bold> We report the case of a 58-year-old man with history of MCC of the wrist and multiple recurrences. Thirty-seven months after the initial diagnosis, the patient started complaining of scrotal oedema. Further inspections disclosed a solitary, indurated, moderately echogenic nodule within the left testis. Laboratory workup was unremarkable, including normal serum AFP, β-HCG and LDH. The patient underwent radical orchiectomy.</p><p id="Par12838"><bold>Results:</bold> Macroscopic examination revealed a 60×49×40mm white to tan, ovoid, solid, centrally necrotic mass, almost completely replacing the testicular parenchyma. On light microscopy, the mass corresponded to a highly cellular, monotonous proliferation of small, blue, round cells, exhibiting a solid growth pattern, extensively infiltrating the seminiferous tubules. Lymphovascular invasion was easily identified. On higher magnification, tumour cells were often arranged in an organoid/trabecular fashion, displaying scant eosinophilic cytoplasm, hyperchromatic enlarged nuclei, coarse chromatin, visible nucleoli and brisk mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong diffuse immunoexpression of neuroendocrine markers; dot-like paranuclear immunostaining for CK20 and CK8/18; negativity for CK7, CD45, PLAP, OCT 3/4, TTF-1 and PS100.

His clinical examination revealed a slightly elevated serum prostate specific antigen, while the digital rectum examination was negative. A simple suprapubic prostatectomy was performed. A focus of limited “prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN)-like” ductal adenocarcinoma of Gleason’s pattern 3 was detected.</p><p id="Par12855"><bold>Results:</bold> Histologically, several crowded, basophilic glands were observed in an area of 10mm, lined by more than 2 layers of cells, with hyperchromatic, cylindrical nuclei. Immunohistochemical analysis was negative for high molecular weight cytokeratin (CK903/34BE12) in these glands, thus confirming the absence of basal cells and differentiating it from high grade PIN (HGPIN). Contrary to the other, poorly differentiated variants of prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) (cribriform, solid, single-cell), the “PIN-like” pattern behaves similar to Gleason’s score 6 (3+3) (Grade Group 1) acinar prostate adenocarcinoma, lacking therefore of substantial metastatic ability.</p><p id="Par12856"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> It is important to recognize “PIN-like ductal adenocarcinoma” as a separate entity from the other ductal adenocarcinoma variants and from HGPIN due to major differences in clinical behaviour. In fact, the term “ductal” has been proposed to be omitted from this type of cancer. In conclusion, the option of active surveillance with close clinical follow-up, serial biomarker evaluation, imaging and biopsy can be considered as a safe management option.</p><p id="Par12857"><bold>E-PS-27-032</bold></p><p id="Par12858"><bold>Renal hydatid cyst misdiagnosed and treated as a cystic renal tumour: a diagnostic pitfall</bold></p><p id="Par12859"><underline>M.

Hmissa Belhaj Salah</p><p id="Par12860">*Department of Pathology, Sahloul University Hospital of Sousse, Tunisia</p><p id="Par12861"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> The hydatid disease is a parasitic infestation caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus granulosus. The renal hydatid cyst is uncommon compared to those hepatic or pulmonary. Most patients remain asymptomatic for years and hydatiduria is the only pathognomonic symptom.</p><p id="Par12862"><bold>Methods:</bold> We report a rare case of renal hydatid cyst misdiagnosed and treated as a renal tumour.</p><p id="Par12863"><bold>Results:</bold> A 45-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented with left lumber pain with haematuria. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) displayed a left renal mass with cystic and solid components, showing discreet enhancement. The mass was classified as Bosniak-IV. The diagnosis of renal malignant tumour was made. The patient underwent a lumbotomy. The mass was adherent to the perirenal fat. A nephrectomy with surrenalectomy was performed. The gross specimen showed a renal cyst (9x7x6cm). The cyst contained multiple internal smaller cysts recalling the appearance of the hydatid cyst. The microscopic study showed an acellular eosinophilic laminated membrane lined by a germinal layer. The diagnosis of renal hydatic cyst was made.</p><p id="Par12864"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Although the renal hydatid cyst is relatively rare, this diagnosis must be considered in patients with renal cystic masses. Preoperative diagnosis is challenging, especially in type IV cysts which can mimic a renal tumour and lead to overtreatment.</p><p id="Par12865"><bold>E-PS-27-033</bold></p><p id="Par12866"><bold>Bilateral synchronous testicular germ cell tumours with discordant histology: a case report</bold></p><p id="Par12867"><underline>N. Herlihy*</underline>, A. Haider</p><p id="Par12868">*UCLH, United Kingdom</p><p id="Par12869"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Synchronous bilateral testicular cancer (SBTC) is a rare occurrence, accounting for only 0.5-1% of new testicular cancers; most BTC develop metachronously. In most published case series of SBTC, bilateral seminomas comprise the majority; discordant histology has been reported in 15-70%.</p><p id="Par12870"><bold>Methods:</bold> Discordant histology in SBTC can be challenging from the perspective of staging and management and is associated with poorer survival outcomes compared to patients with concordant histology. Here we present a case report of a 34-year-old patient who presented with a large left sided testicular mass.</p><p id="Par12871"><bold>Results:</bold> The patient was found to have bilateral testicular tumours on ultrasound, accompanied by elevated alpha-fetoprotein (946 kIU/L), human chorionic gonadotropin (59.8 iU/L) and lactate dehydrogenase (555 iU/L). He had no risk factors for testicular cancer, including cryptorchidism. He underwent a bilateral radical inguinal orchidectomy. Microscopically, Stage pT3 embryonal carcinoma was diagnosed in the left testicle and Stage pT1 classical seminoma in the right testicle, neither of which had any other germ cell component. The patient proceeded to adjuvant bleomycin, etoposide and platinum chemotherapy.</p><p id="Par12872"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Nonseminomatous components in SBTC are often reported as a broad category; the occurrence of synchronous seminoma and embryonal carcinoma has rarely been described.

It has characteristic morphology, and the fusion of the EWSR1-WT1 genes is diagnostic for it.</p><p id="Par12878"><bold>Methods:</bold> We report a case of 27-year-old man with tumour swelling of right testical, who underwent unilateral orchiectomy.</p><p id="Par12879"><bold>Results:</bold> Histologically was the tumour composed of nests and anastomosing cords of small blue cells with scant eosinophilic cytoplasm, oval nuclei, prominent nucleoli and frequent mitoses. Comedonecrosis and monocellular necrosis with massive lymphangioinvasion were observed. A remarkable desmoplastic stromal reaction was a part of the tumour. Immunohistochemical examination with positivity of CK AE1/AE3, EMA, desmin, NSE, PLAP and negativity of WT1, Syn, Chrom, Trombomoduline, S100, HMB45, GFAP, CD117, CK5/6, CK7, CK20, AFP, CEA, BerEP4, CD30 and CD99 was also performed. The characteristic EWSR1-WT1 gene fusion was detected by the genetic examination.</p><p id="Par12880"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Paratesticular localization of DSRCT is very rare and it can be present with an isolated mass or with metastatic disease. Orchiectomy and local surgery is preferred method of local control. Patients with DSRCT have very poor survival rate, but patients with DRSCT of paratesticular localization have better outcomes. However, our patient could not undergo full follow-up therapy due to numerous comorbidities. He died after fourteen months of reduced therapy.</p><p id="Par12881"><bold>E-PS-27-035</bold></p><p id="Par12882"><bold>Low-grade oncocytic renal cell carcinoma: one case report</bold></p><p id="Par12883">C.

The CT-scan shows a rounded, 48 mm tissue renal process. Macroscopic examination showed a lower polar renal neoplasm. Histological examination revealed a carcinomatous tubulo-alveolar architecture with solid foci. The tumour cells are oncocytic, with slightly atypical nuclei presenting mitotic figures.</p><p id="Par12887">Tumour cells expressed cytokeratin7 and did not express CKit.</p><p id="Par12888"><bold>Results:</bold> LORCC is an emerging renal neoplasm. The main differential diagnoses are oncocytoma and chromophobic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The LORCC shows a solid architecture or similar to the oncocytoma with more marked nuclear atypia and mitosis. In the presence of nuclear atypia and mitoses without the irregular appearance of nuclear contours and peri-nuclear halots of chromophobic RCC, the LORCC is strongly suspected. The LORCC shows an IHC profile Ckit-/CK7+ against an IHC profile Ckit+/CK7+ in the eosinophilic variant chromophobic RCC and the onocytoma.</p><p id="Par12889"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> LORCC is an oncocytic renal neoplasm which has a specific morphology and immunohistochemical profile (CD117-/CK7+), not yet recognized by the WHO, but represents an emerging entity.

Kazachkova</p><p id="Par12893">*South Ural State Medical University, Russia</p><p id="Par12894"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> The combination of ASAP and PIN worsens the prognosis for carcinoma. Therefore, there is a need to clarify the morphogenetic relationship between PIN, ASAP and prostate carcinomas of various grades, which may be done by studying mucin production.</p><p id="Par12895"><bold>Methods:</bold> We evaluated prostate biopsy samples of 90 patients divided into 6 groups according to the morphological diagnosis: the combination of ASAP and PIN and the carcinomas of Grade Groups 1-5. Normal prostate tissue samples served as controls. We performed Pas-reaction, alcyan blue staining (pH 1,0; 2,5), and immunohistochemical staining with 34betaE12, D2-40, and P504S antibodies. We applied non-parametric statistical methods.</p><p id="Par12896"><bold>Results:</bold> The prevailing ASAP phenotype was D2-40 (−), 34betaE12 (−), and P504S (+). In ASAP with PIN, neutral mucins were detected in greater numbers than in adenocarcinomas. Acid mucins were detected in all 6 groups. The highest level of their expression was recorded in Grade group 1 adenocarcinoma [Me = 68 (23-75) and the lowest level was in Grade group 5 [Me = 50 (32-80)]. In combination of ASAP and PIN, acidic mucins were scarce, and their expression was the lowest in comparison with other groups [Me = 28 (16-34)] (p = 0.0001). Sulphated mucins were detected only in PIN foci. Sulphated mucins were absent in ASAP foci and in adenocarcinomas.</p><p id="Par12897"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In PIN foci, sulphated mucins are characteristic components of the secretion localized in the apical part of the cytoplasm of the luminal epithelium. They are not typical of ASAP foci and adenocarcinomas of all grade groups.</p><p id="Par12898"><bold>E-PS-27-037</bold></p><p id="Par12899"><bold>Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient renal cell carcinoma (RCC): a case report of a rare subtype</bold></p><p id="Par12900"><underline>S.

Ekinci</p><p id="Par12901">*Gazi University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Turkey</p><p id="Par12902"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> SDH is the key enzyme that connects the tricarboxylic acid cycle and mitochondrial electron transport chain and inherited in an autosomal fashion in contrast to other mitochondrial complexes. SDH-deficient RCC is a newly described rare entity.</p><p id="Par12903"><bold>Methods:</bold> A-24-year old male who presented with haematuria was investigated. A mass lesion was detected in the left kidney by radiologic examination. The subsequent nephrectomy revealed an exophytic mass located at the superior part of the left kidney. The tumour was well-circumscribed and had a tan-brown-red cut surface. Haemorrhage and partial cystic change were noted.</p><p id="Par12904"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopically, the tumour had a pushing border, entrapping benign tubules at the periphery. The neoplastic cells demonstrated a variably solid or nested architecture, had eosinophilic to clear wispy cytoplasmic vacuoles or inclusions that represented the large mitochondria. The nuclei had homogenous chromatin with inconspicuous nucleoli. The tumour stroma showed areas of hyalinization. The differential diagnosis primarily included eosinophilic variant of clear cell carcinoma, eosinophilic solid and cystic RCC and SDH-deficient RCC. Immunohistochemically the tumour cells express kidney-specific cadherin, SDH-A. Diffuse loss of expression for SDH-B was noticed in tumour cells. There was no concomitant TFE3 or cytokeratin 20 expression. Post-surgery PET-CT screening was negative for a residual or metastatic tumour.</p><p id="Par12905"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The defining abnormality of SDH-deficient RCCs is double-hit inactivation of the SDH-related genes. Long term follow-up is recommended for syndromic manifestations such as pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma, GIST, pulmonary chondroma, or pituitary adenoma. Early surgical intervention is recommended. Targeted therapies for VEGF, mTOR and tyrosine kinase may be administered in cases with metastatic disease.</p><p id="Par12914"><bold>E-PS-27-039</bold></p><p id="Par12915"><bold>Large nested variant urothelial carcinoma: a case report</bold></p><p id="Par12916">E.

Orchidectomy was performed</p><p id="Par12939"><bold>Results:</bold> The macroscopic examination revealed a well-circumscribed, homogenous, solid firm and white mass measuring 2,5 cm. Histopathological evaluation revealed a nodular growth of tubules and occasional clusters and cords of tumour cells which are round, with eosinophilic cytoplasm and elongated nuclei. A mild nuclear atypia was found without mitoses. The stroma was fibrous. No necrosis or embols were detected. On immunohistochemistry, tumour cells were positive for inhibin, calretinin and were negative for PLAP, AFP and CD30. The final diagnosis was Sertoli cell tumour of the testis, NOS.

Varied aetiologies have been ascribed to it especially inflammatory, traumatic and iatrogenic causes. It is usually benign and self-limiting but may indicate more serious underlying organic pathological changes.</p><p id="Par12954"><bold>Methods:</bold> Although a haemangioma is one of the most common soft tissue tumours, most of them are superficial lesions, with a predilection for the head and neck region.

S.haematobium which is endemic to Africa and the Middle East, is the species that infects the genitourinary system. People acquire the disease though contact with water containing infected snails.</p><p id="Par12973"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present a case of a 54 year old immigrant who came to our hospital with haematuria and was subjected to biopsy because of cystic changes observed at the posterolateral wall of the bladder during cysteoscopy.</p><p id="Par12974"><bold>Results:</bold> Microscopically we observed urinary bladder fragments covered by urothelium, containing in the lamina propria and the muscularis propria calcified eggs of the S.haematobium which are highly immunogenic, surrounded by dense collagene. The deposition of the eggs of S.haematobiumin the bladder may induce an intense granulomatous host immune response but may also elicit a network of dense concentric calcifications as in our case.</p><p id="Par12975">A prostatic polyp containing benign glands within loose stroma, covered by columnar epithelium was also recognized.

Tumoral cells were either arranged in cords, nests or isolated, showing abundant basophilic cytoplasm, sometimes with signet ring cells features. These findings were suggestive for a tumour infiltrating the bladder from outside. In immunohistochemistry tumour cells were positive for CTK7 and GATA 3, ER, Mammaglobin, and negative for GCDFP-15, E-Cadherin, PR, WT1, p63, HER-2. Gastro-intestinal origin of the tumour was excluded due to negativity for CTK20 and CDX2. The morphological aspect and the immunohistochemical profile lead to a diagnostic of a metastasis of breast cancer in the bladder.</p><p id="Par12984"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Even though bladder metastasis from breast cancer are uncommon, this possibility must be taken into consideration in patients with a history of breast cancer. Clinical data and immunohistochemistry are mandatory for establishing a correct diagnosis.</p><p id="Par12985"><bold>E-PS-27-050</bold></p><p id="Par12986"><bold>Case report: primary urinary bladder adenocarcinoma</bold></p><p id="Par12987"><underline>R.

Dema</p><p id="Par12996">*Department of Pathology, Emergency Clinical County Hospital “Pius Brinzeu” Timisoara, Romania</p><p id="Par12997"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Testicular adrenal rest tumours (TART) is an important complication of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), now a rarely encountered pathology due to hormonal treatment. We herein report an unusual and challenging case of TART and discuss its clinical and histological particularities.</p><p id="Par12998"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 37-year-old patient with bilateral testicular masses underwent surgical resection of the left testicle and after three years of the right testicle and left spermatic cord, due to suspicion of malignant recurrence based on the clinical and imaging features. For the histological diagnosis we used HE and IHC stained slides (CD56, Vim, Inhibin-α, Calretinin, Syn, Melan A, AR, CD10, Ki67).</p><p id="Par12999"><bold>Results:</bold> Both lesions consisted of solid islands and trabecules of Leydig-like, polygonal cells with some nuclear pleomorphism, reduced mitotic activity, granular eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm, with areas of inflammatory-type necrosis and fibrosis which separate the tumoral islands, characteristics which in a adrenal tumour would represent aggressive features. The remaining parenchyma presented atrophic features. Based on family history, clinical and morpho-immunohistochemical features, we reached the final diagnosis of TART.</p><p id="Par13000"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> TART is a very rare lesion, the only one diagnosed in the last 20 years in our department. Having the particularity of a diagnosis at such an old age, we want to underline the importance of a differential diagnosis with a malignant Leydig cell tumour, because of the histological similarities of these two lesions, but different evolution and treatment options.</p><p id="Par13001"><bold>E-PS-27-053</bold></p><p id="Par13002"><bold>Role of ureteroscopic biopsy in diagnosis of upper tract urothelial carcinoma</bold></p><p id="Par13003"><underline>K.L.W.

Salmond</p><p id="Par13004">*Department of Pathology, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, United Kingdom</p><p id="Par13005"><bold>Background &amp; objectives:</bold> Most upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas are invasive at the time of diagnosis, being associated with a poor prognosis. Accurate diagnosis is essential for management.</p><p id="Par13006">Our objective was to determine the performance parameters of ureteroscopic biopsy in our tertiary centre.</p><p id="Par13007"><bold>Methods:</bold> We retrospectively identified and reviewed relevant documents of patients who underwent endoscopic examination for a suspected upper tract malignancy from January 2012 to August 2017. Biopsy and resection pathology reports were analysed for the histological diagnosis, grade and stage. False negative samples were reviewed by an experienced uropathologist.</p><p id="Par13008"><bold>Results:</bold> Of 115 biopsies, all 68 biopsies reported as malignant were true positives (100%specificity). Of the 47 benign or non-diagnostic biopsy reports, 32 were true negatives and 15 were considered false negatives (82.3%sensitivity). Review of false negative cases found no diagnostic errors. Grade concordance was 52.6% for WHO1973 and 65% for WHO2004. Grade 1 and 3 biopsy results predicted 24% and 67% chances of having subsequent muscle invasive disease respectively.</p><p id="Par13009"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In our centre, endoscopic biopsy of the upper urinary tract showed high diagnostic accuracy and specificity. The sensitivity was also reasonably high. False negative cases did occur, presumably due to sampling error. Although the grade concordance was marginally lower than other studies, it appeared to have no impact on the strong predictive value for pathological stage. Overall, pathological assessment of ureteroscopic biopsies is a useful tool in the investigation and management of suspected upper urinary tract tumours.</p><p id="Par13010"><bold>E-PS-27-054</bold></p><p id="Par13011"><bold>Histopathological study of five cases of sex cord stromal tumours of testis, with a short review of the current literature</bold></p><p id="Par13012"><underline>A.

Involvement of retroperitoneal parenchymal organs is extremely rare.</p><p id="Par13023"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 54-year-old man presented with left flank pain of four weeks duration. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a renal tumour which is primarily located in the hilum of the left kidney. The patient underwent nephroureterectomy since the radiologic findings were suspicious for urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis.</p><p id="Par13024"><bold>Results:</bold> Macroscopically, the tumour was well circumscribed and lobulated, 7,5x7x5,5 cm in size, and located in the renal sinus with a light yellow cut surface. Microscopically, the tumour consisted of a solid proliferation of interlacing bundles of spindle cells without nuclear atypia, mitotic figures and necrosis. A peripheral cuff of lymphoid aggregates was seen. Small clusters of xanthomatous cells intermixed with the spindle cells were also observed. The tumour cells showed diffuse strong positivity for S-100 protein. CD68 was positive in xanthomatous cells. Pan-cytokeratin, CK7, CK8/18, SMA and desmin were negative.</p><p id="Par13025"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Renal schwannomas are rare neoplasms which occur in the renal hilum in majority. Morphology of the tumour is similar to those seen elsewhere in the body.

Malignant behaviour has been reported but prognostic factors are largely undetermined. Herein we report a case of a malignant epithelioid angiomyolipoma.</p><p id="Par13031"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 40-year-old female patient without previous relevant medical history was admitted to hospital due to asthenia, anorexia, weight loss and periods of fever and night sweats. CT revealed a contrast-enhancing 17cm solid mass in the left kidney. Nephrectomy was performed.</p><p id="Par13032"><bold>Results:</bold> Grossly, a solid 17cm yellow mass in the kidney was observed infiltrating the perirenal adipose tissue. Histological examination revealed a tumour mainly composed of epithelioid cells with large granular amphophilic cytoplasm and prominent nuclear atypia, arranged in discohesive nests. Areas of spindle cells with frequent bizarre features and multinucleate giant cells with occasional lipidic vacuoles were observed. Frequent atypical mitotic figures, extensive necrosis and venous vascular invasion were identified. By immunohistochemistry, Melan-A and HMB45 expression was observed. Our diagnosis was epithelioid angiomyolipoma with aggressive features. At follow-up, lung metastasis was identified at 6 months post-surgery and vertebral metastasis at 10 months. Despite sirolimus treatment, death occurred 13 months after surgery.</p><p id="Par13033"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Despite unequivocal evidence of malignant potential, the prevalence of aggressive behaviour in epithelioid angiomyolipomas is extremely variable across studies and prognostic factors are still in debate.

There were 8 cases diagnosed in 5 years. Diagnosis was set with Hematoxylin – Eosin stains and supported by immunohistochemical assays (Synaptophysin, Chromogranin, CD56). Cell proliferation rate was extremely high (&gt; 90%) for all cases.</p><p id="Par13084"><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age was 74,6 years and Male:Female ratio 6:2. The predominant site was the urinary bladder (75%) followed by the ureter (12,5%) and renal pelvis (12,5%). Six urothelial tract small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (n=6) were infiltrating muscularis propria and two (n=2) were extending beyond. Also, in two cases (in the ureter and the urinary bladder) (n=2), several heterologous characteristics were observed, such as squamous cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated urothelial carcinoma NOS, chondrosarcoma and osteosarcoma In six cases (n=6) there was evidence of in situ and infiltrative urothelial cell carcinoma, whereas in two cases (n=2) the small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma coexisted as component of an otherwise typical urothelial carcinoma.</p><p id="Par13085"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Most of small cell neuroendocrine carcinomas of the Urothelial Tract were localized in the urinary bladder and they extended into muscularis propria at the time diagnosis.

We assessed ratio of Vim cytoplasmic and membranous expression.</p><p id="Par13099"><bold>Methods:</bold> 36 samples of prostate cancer (PCa) were stained immunohistochemically with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to Vim (ThermoFischer Scientific, 1:1000). Staining was assessed semiquantitatively using a light microscope, x200 magnification.

Membranous vimentin staining was present in 29 (80.6%) cases, cytoplasmic – in 35 (97.2%). Among them in 0 and 3 (8.3%) cases membranous staining was more prevalent than cytoplasmic according to percentage of stained cells (in 5 (13.9%) cases equal scores) and WSI, respectively. In most cases the percentage of cells with membranous staining was much lower, but staining intensities were higher, than for cytoplasmic staining. No statistically significant correlations were found between prevalence of membranous staining and disease pT category, Gleason score or previous neoadjuvant hormonal therapy, this may be due to a small sample size.</p><p id="Par13101"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Vimentin is mostly expressed in cytoplasm, but membranous staining can also be seen in practically all cases, mostly in a small proportion of cells. These cells with membranous expression may correspond to cells with CSC features, but this hypothesis needs further evaluation using conventional CSC markers or functional assays.

It is appreciated that the course and prognosis of WT in adults is worse than in children.</p><p id="Par13107"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present 2 cases of WT in adult patients, that were treated in Minsk City Clinical Oncological Dispensary (MCCOD).</p><p id="Par13108"><bold>Results:</bold> In a patient K., 28 years, a tumour of the right kidney, 160*65*113 mm was found, reaching the right lobe of liver. Surgery was performed, histological examination verified WT with lymphovascular invasion and spread outside the kidney. Synchronous metastases to abdominal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, peritoneum, right lung and liver capsule were seen on additional examination. The patient died 3 months later.</p><p id="Par13109">Patient S., 35 years, was first admitted with papillary thyroid cancer (diffuse sclerotic variant) with bilateral metastases to cervical lymph nodes. In October 2013 tumour of the right kidney was seen, WT (mostly blastema and epithelial components) was diagnosed after nephrectomy. No signs of WT progression are seen.</p><p id="Par13110"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These two cases show different patterns of WT course with quick lethal outcome in case of late diagnosis and long disease-free period in case of early radical treatment. This once more emphasizes the necessity of early diagnosis and different diagnostic procedures to differentiate WT from renal cell carcinoma.</p><p id="Par13111"><bold>E-PS-27-069</bold></p><p id="Par13112"><bold>Renal carcinoma with angioleiomyoma-like stroma</bold></p><p id="Par13113"><underline>P.

The following case helps review, discuss and provides further insight into the diagnosis of this type of cancer.</p><p id="Par13116"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 77-year old lady, with a history of total left nephrectomy due to an angiomyolipoma, presented a solid tumour on her right kidney. The sample of the partial right nephrectomy, measuring 5.5 x 4.7 x 2.7 cm, showed a well-defined neoplastic lesion, with a white-reddish, heterogeneous coloration, measuring 3.5 x 3.4 x 2.7 cm.</p><p id="Par13117"><bold>Results:</bold> Histologically it`s constituted by atypical glandular structures immersed in a muscular-like stroma, accompanied by thick-walled vessels. Neoplastic epithelial cell cytoplasm was abundant, varying from light to pale, microvacuolated or eosinophilic. Immunohistochemical markers CK7, CK34βE-12 and vimentin were intensely and diffusely positive in the epithelium, with focal CD10+, demonstrating muscle differentiation in the stroma (actins HHF-35 and 1A4, caldesmon, desmine were positive), while HMB45 and Melan-A were negative. These types of tumours may be variants of clear cell carcinomas, or papillary clear cell renal cell carcinomas, but they may also represent a specific sub-group. Although their low malignant potential, when associated with tuberous sclerosis, they may present with affected lymph nodes.</p><p id="Par13118"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The few cases reported, have not demonstrated the characteristic chromosome abnormalities such as (3p) deletion, (7) or (17) trisomies, therefore the relationship with the morphological spectrum of renal carcinoma with mutated TCEB1 cannot be established.

Some of them may be clinically relevant. We evaluated the frequency of muscle invasive bladder cancer in our experience and its association with variant morphology.</p><p id="Par13124"><bold>Methods:</bold> All consecutive cases of invasive urothelial carcinoma from Imagepat Laboratory (Salvador, Bahia, Brazil) were included. All cases from January 2017 to October 2019 were reviewed. Overall, 45 cases had no divergent differentiation while 46 showed some form of variant morphology.</p><p id="Par13125"><bold>Results:</bold> The most common divergent differentiation was squamous which was present in 18/46 cases (39%) ranging from 5-95% of tumour area. The second most common was micropapillary – seen in 13/46 (28%), (range:&lt;5-80%). Third, plasmacytoid was observed in 9/46 (20%) (range: 30-90%). These were followed by poorly differentiated 8/46 (17%) (range: 20-100%), glandular 5/46 (11%) (range: 10-50%), giant cell 3/46 (7%) (range: 30-100%), and sarcomatoid 2/46 (4%) (range: 30-90%). The frequency of muscularis propria invasion was 18/36 (50%) in patients with urothelial carcinoma with no divergent differentiation. This rate was lower than the rate seen in patients harbouring urothelial carcinomas with squamous component 12/14 (86%).</p><p id="Par13126"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The rate of muscle invasive carcinoma did not differ between tumours without divergent differentiation and those with micropapillary, plasmacytoid and poorly differentiated morphology.

Most commonly affected sites are a single testicle, followed by the epididymis and spermatic cord.</p><p id="Par13141"><bold>Methods:</bold> We report the case of a 66-year-old male presenting with pain in the left groin, extending to the upper scrotum and exacerbated with movement and coughing. Ultrasound examination revealed an abnormal mass in the left inguinal canal, interpreted as incarcerated inguinal hernia. Upon surgical exploration, the epididymis and tunica vaginalis appeared thickened and firm. A left orhiectomy was performed.</p><p id="Par13142"><bold>Results:</bold> Macroscopically, tunica vaginalis of the left orhiectomy specimen was tan-brown and diffusely thickened, as well as the epididymis. The spermatic cord appeared grossly normal. Histological studies showed the presence of multiple foci of granulomatous vasculitis, affecting medium-sized and small-sized arteries of the testicle, epididymis and tunica vaginalis, with fibrinoid necrosis and surrounding mixed inflammation including macrophages, small lymphocytes, plasma cells. Testicular parenchyma showed no histological alteration.</p><p id="Par13143"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Testicular vasculitis is a rare entity, which can be easily overlooked.

The histological examination of the rectal tumour revealed a low-grade adenocarcinoma NOS, while the renal tumour presented a particular morphology, with tubular architecture, focal spindle cell areas and stroma with fibrous and mucinous appearance. The tumour cells were positive for CK7, cytokeratin 34βE12, EMA and Vimentin and negative for RCC, CD10, CK20 and CDX-2. The Ki-67 proliferation index was 5%.
