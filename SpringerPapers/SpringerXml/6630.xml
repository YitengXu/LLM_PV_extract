Reports also indicated PGRN-mediated neuroprotection in models of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease; thus, increasing PGRN levels is a promising therapeutic for multiple disorders. To uncover novel PGRN regulators, we linked whole-genome sequence data from 920 individuals with plasma PGRN levels and identified the prosaposin (<italic>PSAP</italic>) locus as a new locus significantly associated with plasma PGRN levels. Here we show that both PSAP reduction and overexpression lead to significantly elevated extracellular PGRN levels. Intriguingly, PSAP knockdown increases PGRN monomers, whereas PSAP overexpression increases PGRN oligomers, partly through a protein–protein interaction. PSAP-induced changes in PGRN levels and oligomerization replicate in human-derived fibroblasts obtained from a <italic>GRN</italic> mutation carrier, further supporting PSAP as a potential PGRN-related therapeutic target. Future studies should focus on addressing the relevance and cellular mechanism by which PGRN oligomeric species provide neuroprotection.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Increasing progranulin (PGRN) levels is a promising approach for treating frontotemporal dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Most FTD-causing <italic>GRN</italic> mutations are autosomal dominant and introduce a premature stop codon through nonsense or frame-shift mutations. Individuals with these mutations are PGRN haploinsufficient due to decay of the mutant messenger RNA (mRNA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Importantly, two patients were recently identified with homozygous loss-of-function <italic>GRN</italic> mutations, which caused adult onset neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis is a lysosomal storage disorder that leads to an accelerated accumulation of lipofuscin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, suggesting that adequate levels of PGRN are necessary to maintain proper lysosomal function.</p><p id="Par5">Individuals with <italic>GRN</italic> mutations clinically present with varying symptoms, leading to diagnosis other than FTD in some patients, including Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. While most <italic>GRN</italic> cases show frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 pathology at autopsy, Alzheimer’s disease pathology has also been reported. A common <italic>GRN</italic> variant, possibly leading to a partial reduction in PGRN levels, has further been suggested as a genetic risk factor for FTD and related neurodegenerative disorders, emphasizing the important role of PGRN in the development of multiple diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

Thus, PGRN upregulation could be a therapeutic approach for multiple neurodegenerative disorders. In recent years, several research groups have conducted studies to identify regulators of PGRN levels. Most notably, the drug suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid was shown to increase <italic>GRN</italic> transcription while alkalizing reagents and vacuolar ATPase inhibitors increased PGRN levels in a post-translational manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, no PGRN-modifying therapies are currently available to patients with neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we used a genetic approach to identify novel PGRN regulators. Using 920 Mexican-American, non-demented individuals from 20 families, we performed the largest family-based genome-wide association study (GWAS) to date using a combination of whole-genome sequencing (WGS), imputation and PGRN plasma measurements for those individuals. In addition to confirming the chromosome 1p13.3 sortilin (<italic>SORT1</italic>) locus, which was previously implicated in PGRN regulation, this study led to the discovery of a genome-wide significant association between plasma PGRN levels and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on chromosome 10 at the prosaposin (<italic>PSAP</italic>) and cadherin 23 (<italic>CDH23</italic>) locus. Follow-up <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies identified PSAP as a novel regulator of both PGRN levels and PGRN oligomerization.

More than half of the individuals were whole-genome sequenced, while genotypes of the other individuals were generated by imputation (Methods section). The SNP most strongly associated with plasma PGRN levels was rs646776 located near the PGRN receptor <italic>SORT1</italic> on chromosome 1 (linear regression; <italic>P</italic>=8.11 × 10<sup>−42</sup>; <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), replicating our earlier findings which were based on a smaller GWAS using roughly 300,000 SNPs (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>). For this SNP, we observed a 0.78 s.d. increment on the average plasma PGRN level for each copy of the minor C-allele.

SNP rs1867977 showed a 0.28 s.d. decrement on the average plasma PGRN level for each copy of the minor T-allele.

These similarities rendered PSAP the most likely candidate PGRN regulator in this chromosomal region. We therefore queried the WGS data to determine possible <italic>PSAP</italic> functional variants which might affect its levels and/or function. While no <italic>PSAP</italic> coding variants were identified, SNP rs7869 (linear regression; <italic>P</italic>=3.04 × 10<sup>−7</sup>; <italic>D</italic>′=0.854 and <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.384 with rs1867977) resides within the <italic>PSAP</italic> 3′ untranslated region (UTR) (genome.ucsc.edu). SNP rs7869 is a common variant in the San Antonio Family Study (SAFS) cohort (minor allele frequency=48%) and part of a large linkage disequilibrium block. Importantly, when we re-analysed the GWAS conditioned upon the rs7869 genotypes, no residual association was detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1941">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), supporting that the observed association in this region is in fact driven by the linkage disequilibrium block represented by rs7869. To establish to what extent the rs7869 minor T-allele might affect <italic>PSAP</italic> expression, we performed mutagenesis on a firefly luciferase construct containing 1,116 bp of the <italic>PSAP</italic> 3′ UTR to create two clones containing either the rs7869 major C- or minor T-allele. HeLa cells showed a significant increase in firefly luciferase activity (mirroring PSAP promoter activity) when transfected with the minor T-allele (Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test; <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.002, <italic>n</italic>=13; <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>). To examine the effect of rs7869 in the context of PSAP directly, we created plasmids containing the human <italic>PSAP</italic> coding sequence along with its endogenous 3′ UTR containing either the rs7869 major C- or minor T-allele (<italic>PSAP</italic>+3′UTR-C and <italic>PSAP</italic>+3′UTR-T, respectively). Both wild-type and mutant rs7869 constructs were transfected into HeLa cells, after which PSAP mRNA and protein levels were quantified. A GFP-expressing vector was co-transfected with these <italic>PSAP</italic>+3′UTR plasmids to serve as a transfection efficiency control. While <italic>PSAP</italic> mRNA levels were not different between cells transfected with either <italic>PSAP</italic>+3′UTR plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1941">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>), total PSAP protein levels were significantly increased on transfection with <italic>PSAP</italic>+3′UTR-T as compared with <italic>PSAP</italic>+3′UTR-C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1941">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). Taken together, these results suggested that rs7869 regulates PSAP protein levels. In our initial GWAS cohort, each copy of the minor T-allele of rs7869 was associated with a decrease in plasma PGRN levels in our GWAS cohort (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). These results reveal a possible reciprocal relationship between PSAP and PGRN levels, in which individuals carrying the rs7869 T-allele have high levels of PSAP and low plasma levels of PGRN.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Functional analysis of rs7869-dependent regulation of PSAP and PGRN levels.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Luciferase activity quantification in HeLa cells transfected with either pMir-REPORT-rs7869C or pMir-REPORT-rs7869T constructs.

Thus, it is possible that changing PSAP levels alters the ratio of monomeric to dimeric, or possibly higher oligomeric species of PGRN, which might result in decreased epitope recognition by the PGRN ELISAs. To address this possibility, we first denatured proteins in conditioned media from either control- or PSAP-transfected cells using guanidine-hydrochloride (HCl) at varying concentrations before running the PGRN ELISAs. To ensure the guanidine-HCl did not disturb the antibody complexes in the ELISA plate, the final concentration of guanidine-HCl remained 0.5 M or less and all sample results were compared with PGRN standards containing the same final concentration of guanidine-HCl. The R&amp;D Systems ELISA requires the use of undiluted media to detect PGRN, so low guanidine-HCl concentrations (0.1 and 0.5 M) were used for denaturing. In contrast, we used a high guanidine-HCl concentration (4 M) to denature media samples measured on the Adipogen PGRN ELISA plates, which requires the use of diluted samples.

We observed discrepant findings when comparing PGRN levels as measured by immunoblot and ELISA on PSAP overexpression in cell culture which we were able to attribute, at least in part, to the commercial ELISAs’ inability to accurately detect higher molecular weight PGRN species present in these samples. Crosslinking and subsequent immunoblotting indicated that while both PSAP overexpression and knockdown increased total extracellular PGRN levels, PSAP knockdown specifically increased monomeric PGRN levels in cell media, while PSAP overexpression increased PGRN species with dimeric and oligomeric molecular weights. Similar PSAP-mediated effects were observed in U251 glioblastoma astrocytoma cells and in patient-derived fibroblasts from a <italic>GRN</italic> mutation carrier and an unaffected relative, where both PSAP knockdown and PSAP overexpression increased extracellular PGRN levels; yet, in the case of PSAP knockdown, monomeric PGRN species were increased while PSAP overexpression increased dimeric PGRN species. Supporting evidence for the presence of PGRN oligomers was provided by treating media samples with guanidine, by the detection of higher molecular weight PGRN species via native gel electrophoresis, and by media protein crosslinking. The realization that commercially available PGRN ELISA assays may inadequately detect the various PGRN species that exist <italic>in vivo</italic> needs to be considered and might have implications for studies using these ELISAs to identify PGRN regulators or in studies related to the natural history of PGRN levels in human biospecimens and future treatment trials. Equally as important for PGRN-related therapeutics will be to determine the mechanism by which PSAP knockdown and/or overexpression increase extracellular PGRN levels. A likely candidate involved in these processes is the SORT1 receptor utilized by both PGRN and PSAP. The data provided herein exclude the possibility that PSAP overexpression merely out-competes PGRN for SORT1 binding; however, we cannot rule out potential PSAP-related changes in SORT1 localization and/or modification that might have downstream effects on PGRN.</p><p id="Par25">The possible existence of PGRN dimers was first published in 2010 by Okura <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> who detected PGRN-immunoreactive bands at ∼80 and ∼130 kDa from human monocyte-derived macrophage media. A more recent report by Nguyen <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> showed that the majority of secreted and circulating PGRN exists at a dimeric molecular weight. Therefore, it is conceivable that dimeric PGRN is the more biologically relevant and functional PGRN form. Contrastingly, it is also possible that monomeric PGRN turnover is more rapid, and thus exists at levels below the detection limits in these fluids. Additional research is required to further elucidate the PGRN species that exist in various fluids and tissues, and to address to what extent the different PGRN forms, either monomeric or oligomeric, might be responsible for PGRN-dependent neuroprotection. This is crucial since both PSAP knockdown and overexpression are able to increase total extracellular PGRN levels in human-derived cell lines, but only one of these strategies may be a beneficial therapeutic avenue. Second, it will be critical to further characterize the molecular mechanisms behind PSAP-induced PGRN oligomerization. In this respect, it is important to note that PGRN might form a complex with other proteins, producing an extracellular PGRN species identified at a molecular weight similar to a PGRN homodimer. Since the molecular weight of fully glycosylated PSAP and PGRN is similar (∼70 and ∼80 kDa, respectively), PSAP–PGRN heterodimers might be easily interpreted as PGRN homodimers. Our current data <italic>in vitro</italic> already indicates that at least a subset of PGRN is bound to PSAP and that the C-terminus of PSAP is not required for this interaction. If in fact a subset of dimeric PGRN is composed of PSAP–PGRN heterodimers, this may explain why loss of PSAP in cell culture caused an increase in the monomeric form of extracellular PGRN. On the other hand, we cannot exclude that extracellular PSAP regulates the formation of PGRN homodimers or oligomerization with other proteins. Furthermore, it remains unknown whether the PSAP/PGRN interaction is required for the effect of PSAP on PGRN levels. If future studies are able to determine the specific region of PSAP required for PSAP–PGRN binding, it may be possible to elucidate the relationship between these two phenomena.</p><p id="Par26">Finally, we assessed the <italic>in vivo</italic> consequence of <italic>Psap</italic> deficiency using a knockout mouse model previously generated to study lysosomal storage disorders. In support of our human plasma and cell culture data, we observed an increase in Pgrn protein levels in brain tissue from <italic>Psap</italic> knockout mice, but only in the full knockout and not in heterozygous <italic>Psap</italic>+/− mice. Importantly, this effect on intracellular Pgrn levels is not unique to <italic>Psap</italic> knockout mice since a previous report showed that ablation of another critical lysosomal protein, cathepsin D, also resulted in upregulation of Pgrn and other lysosomal proteins, likely due to lysosomal enlargement or lack of lysosomal-dependent degradation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. The intracellular changes in Pgrn and other lysosomal proteins may, therefore, reflect a dysfunction of the lysosomes in this model system, and are independent from PSAP’s extracellular effects on PGRN levels revealed in our studies. This would be supported by the fact that we did not observe an increase in brain intracellular Pgrn levels in mice heterozygous for Psap loss. In contrast, mice with 50% loss of Psap did show a marked increase in plasma Pgrn levels, indicating that partial Psap reduction is sufficient to increase extracellular Pgrn <italic>in vivo</italic>. This is in line with the TFEB translocation assay that we performed in HeLa cells after PSAP knockdown, which excluded the possibility that PGRN is increased in response to PSAP reduction due to PSAP-mediated lysosomal dysfunction. These findings are exciting and suggest that while complete loss of PSAP has overall detrimental outcomes and results in lysosomal storage disease, it is possible that partial loss of PSAP might have beneficial effects. In fact, no reports have been published to describe health deficits in individuals heterozygous for <italic>PSAP</italic> mutations. Thus, mildly reducing PSAP levels might be a promising therapeutic for increasing extracellular PGRN.</p><p id="Par27">Taken together, this study is the first to identify PSAP as a PGRN regulator. Our functional assessment of PSAP-mediated changes in PGRN also furthered our understanding of PGRN-related methodologies and biology for consideration in future PGRN assessments. First, our data revealed that the current commercially available ELISAs commonly used for PGRN measurements in human fluids do not detect all PGRN forms. This has potential consequences for PGRN-related therapeutics in which PGRN ELISAs are being proposed as a tool to monitor the efficacy of PGRN-targeting pharmacological agents. Second, our findings are the first to exemplify a PGRN regulator that mediates not only total PGRN levels, but also PGRN oligomeric composition. A better understanding of the involvement and functional mechanisms of different PGRN oligomeric species will be greatly important in the PGRN field.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Initial subjects cohort and whole-genome sequencing</title><p id="Par28">The WGS data was kindly shared by the T2D-GENES project (unpublished data).
