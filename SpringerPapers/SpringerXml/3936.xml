This questions the relevance of the widespread aqueous testing for real world application. In this study, we aim to determine the processes responsible for the dissolution discrepancy. Experimental parameters known to diverge in both systems are individually tested for their influence on dissolution of an Ir-based catalyst. Ir dissolution is studied in an aqueous model system, a scanning flow cell coupled to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Real dissolution rates of the Ir OER catalyst in membrane electrode assemblies are measured with a specifically developed, dedicated setup. Overestimated acidity in the anode catalyst layer and stabilization over time in real devices are proposed as main contributors to the dissolution discrepancy. The results shown here lead to clear guidelines for anode electrocatalyst testing parameters to resemble realistic electrolyzer operating conditions.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Dissolution of Ir catalysts varies widely between PEM water electrolysers and aqueous electrolytes.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Global warming is driving the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energies. To support the transfer, economically promising alternatives to petrochemical processes for all sectors have to be established<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Owing to its high energy density, low chemical complexity, and high efficiency, hydrogen is among the best candidates for energy storage and distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. If hydrogen production from water electrolysis (WE) is fully supplied by renewable energy sources, greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by 75%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Therefore, research funding on upscaling WE technology is increasing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Currently, technologies, based on liquid alkaline and acidic solid electrolyte are equally considered. Classical alkaline electrolyzers lack the option of dynamic operation necessary for direct coupling to fluctuating energy sources, and solid electrolyte anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyzers are not at a technology readiness level suitable for upscaling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Acidic proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers consisting of membrane electrode assemblies (MEA), which lack these disadvantages, are the preferred system for upscaling in the short term<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">It is generally accepted that acidic conditions and high potentials at the anode side of PEM water electrolyzers (PEMWEs) where the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) takes place, demand for materials with high catalytic activity, and corrosion stability. Such criteria are only satisfied for electrocatalysts based on scarce noble metals such as iridium (Ir) and, to a lesser extent, ruthenium (Ru). Although their current implementation in PEMWEs is not hampered by their cost, upscaling fabrication of MEAs with these metals is expected to be a major cost driver at the GW scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, a significant part of research activities on WE are focused on the reduction of noble metal content in PEMWE anodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">For the state-of-the-art Ir catalysts, a cornerstone in fundamental research studies has been to maximize Ir utilization, specifically, to increase their OER mass activity whilst reducing noble metal content without a significant loss in activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The use of high-surface-area catalyst supports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, highly active perovskites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, and multimetallic materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> are employed to reduce the noble metal content. However, stability has to be monitored as a second major descriptor in electrocatalyst design and synthesis, as OER catalysis also triggers catalyst dissolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Activity and stability evaluations of newly developed catalysts are performed ex situ in the classical three-electrode electrochemical cell setup with acidic electrolyte to simulate the acidic pH environment of PEMWEs anodes in presence of Nafion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Current-potential profiles are recorded and analyzed for activity evaluation. For stability evaluations, however, more sophisticated methods were developed, such as electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, scanning flow cell (SFC) coupled to an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (SFC-ICP-MS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and post-analysis of electrolyte and catalyst layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, comparative data of catalyst stability in both systems show that degradation in aqueous systems does not represent the conditions in PEMWE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">Recent results from our group, based on aqueous SFC-ICP-MS measurements and end-of life data from PEMWE, indicate an underestimation of the actual catalyst lifetime of several orders of magnitude, ranging from days in aqueous to years in MEA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In this work, the relevance of S-numbers, a new metric for OER catalyst lifetime estimation, measured in aqueous systems for real application based on end-of-life data of PEM electrolyzers, is discussed. As end-of-life data is rarely found for Ir-based electrolyzers, the data set of a system using RuO<sub>2</sub> as anode material published by Ayers et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> was compared with the same material measured in SFC-ICP-MS. It was found that the PEM electrolyzer outperforms the aqueous system by about three orders of magnitude, leading to a significant increase in the estimated lifetime of the electrolyzer in comparison to the same catalyst in the aqueous system. A similar concept, the activity-stability factor, was developed in parallel by Kim et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">In this work, we aim to reveal the experimental factors responsible for the observed OER catalyst dissolution differences between aqueous model systems (AMS) and PEMWEs. We evaluated how the parameters that diverge between the systems such as catalyst loading, mass transport conditions, Nafion binder content, and electrolyte pH influence Ir dissolution. Also, we aim to determine the real dissolution rates of MEAs for PEMWEs using a custom-made full cell setup devised to prevent galvanic precipitation of catalyst dissolved species under OER operation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Iridium OER catalyst dissolution: aqueous model versus MEA systems</title><p id="Par9">The dissolution behavior of OER catalysts in AMS is already well studied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Utilizing online measurements, the dissolution behavior of OER catalysts under various electrochemical conditions has been shown. To put the results presented in this section into context, it is important to highlight the commonalities and differences between MEA and AMS. In AMS, the employed electrolyte, mostly an acid or base, is diluted by the reactant, deionized (DI) water. As schematically shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, the reaction products, H<sub>2</sub> at the cathode side and O<sub>2</sub> and protons at the anode side, as well as dissolution products, such as Ir<sup>3+</sup>, diffuse into the bulk. Hence, to measure dissolution, it is sufficient to take aliquots of electrolyte from the solution. Utilizing flow cells, which directly transport reaction products from the reaction site downstream (if coupled) to analytical techniques such as ICP-MS, the dissolution behavior can be directly correlated to the electrochemical operation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Degradation processes of OER catalysts in aqueous and polymer electrolyte.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic drawing of degradation processes in a classical aqueous electrolysis cell in aqueous electrolyte and <bold>b</bold> schematic drawing of degradation processes in MEA. <bold>c</bold> Dissolution stability of IrO<sub>x</sub> under OER conditions in aqueous electrolyte, measured in SFC-ICP-MS, and polymer electrolyte, measured in a precipitation-free MEA device, expressed in the S-number metric.

Owing to the long lifetime of MEA electrolyzers, however, EOL data are scarce. Furthermore, measurements of dissolution products in MEA are more complicated than in AMS. As schematically shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, electrolyte and reactant are decoupled in MEA by placing the polymer electrolyte between the electrodes and circulating DI water as the reactant at the backside. Reaction products, H<sub>2</sub>, and O<sub>2</sub> escape through porous transport layers at the respective electrodes, whereas H<sup>+</sup> is transported through the PEM towards the reaction site at the cathode. In this system, dissolution products of OER catalysts have two ways to escape the anode catalyst layer: through the anode water cycle or the membrane towards the cathode side. Furthermore, galvanic replacement (GR) of dissolution products with stainless steel tubes, often employed in MEA test setups, can lead to an underestimation of dissolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">Hence, to reliably determine dissolution in MEA and realistically compare results with AMS, several factors have to be controlled. The water level in the anode compartment and the water flow at the cathode outlet through electroosmotic drag have to be monitored at all times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the amount of iridium depositing in the membrane has to be estimated. Also, GR should be excluded as a measurement factor.</p><p id="Par12">For such purpose, a dedicated MEA setup without metallic parts in the anode water cycle was developed and employed in this study. Cell components involved in electronic conduction, namely titanium flowfields and current collectors, are coated with gold or platinum to prevent GR. Samples are taken from the anode water cycle and the cathode outlet and analyzed separately by ICP-MS.

Although Ir loading in aqueous studies rarely exceeds 10 µg<sub>Ir</sub> cm<sup>−2</sup>, loading in MEA is typically ~1–2 mg<sub>Ir</sub> cm<sup>−2</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. S-numbers of catalyst spots with different loading is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, where loading is varied between 10 µg<sub>Ir</sub> cm<sup>−2</sup> and 250 µg<sub>Ir</sub> cm<sup>−2</sup>. The obtained S-number values are comparable and in the same order of magnitude. Hence, we can exclude the influence of loading on the dissolution discrepancy.</p><p id="Par19">The second study was different SFC operating flow rates. Given the flow rate uncertainty in PEMWE MEA systems, contrasting with its precise control in our SFC-ICP-MS setup, we evaluated the impact of SFC flow rate by variations within one order of magnitude. The flow rate of electrolyte to the ICP-MS was here varied between 66 µl min<sup>−1</sup> and 740 µl min<sup>−1</sup>. S-numbers for these experiments are virtually equivalent as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>. As the flow rate effectively dictates the mass transport rate of dissolved species from the electrode interface to the bulk electrolyte, a possible Ir redeposition mechanism should be affected by it as well. Based on the results obtained, these mass transport phenomena do not seem to play a key role in the AMS-MEA catalyst stability differences.</p><p id="Par20">The third parameter variation tackled the dissolution–redeposition equilibrium of Ir-dissolved species, which can occur during MEA water circulation owing to low flow rates and slow mass transport in thick catalyst layers. To simulate such conditions in AMS, and enable a potential dissolution–redeposition mechanism, electrochemically dissolved iridium has to be present in the electrolyte in relevant concentrations. Therefore, Ir was electrochemically dissolved from polycrystalline iridium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> (see the experimental section for further details) and then intentionally incorporated into the acidic electrolyte used. The iridium concentration in the electrolyte is determined by ICP-MS and adjusted accordingly. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) shows the S-number of IrO<sub>x</sub> spots measured with 1 µg<sub>Ir</sub> l<sup>−1</sup> dissolved iridium in the electrolyte. This value is similar to a recent publication, where Ir concentrations in MEAs were measured<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Also, it is in the same order of magnitude as the concentrations measured in our MEA study (see supplementary note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). As observed with the previous parameters, S-number values are comparable to the baseline experiment. Hence, equilibrium states between dissolution and redeposition are unlikely to largely contribute to the Ir dissolution discrepancy.</p><p id="Par21">The fourth evaluated parameter is the influence of Nafion content in the catalyst layer on Ir dissolution. Unlike OER rotating disk electrode experiments, where no Nafion is required, it acts as a catalyst layer binder in SFC-ICP-MS to avoid particle detachment. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref> shows the S-numbers of IrO<sub>x</sub> spots with different Nafion contents, varied here between 5 and 50 wt% vs. the total catalyst content. Interestingly, the dissolution rate of catalysts spots with 5 wt% Nafion in the catalyst layer is significantly larger from the other Nafion contents. Indeed, the stability differs from baseline measurements by an order of magnitude, with an S-number of 8 × 10<sup>3</sup>. We hypothesize that, at lower Nafion contents, dissolved iridium mass transport from the catalyst layer to the electrolyte bulk might be more efficient. A local saturation might hereby inhibit dissolution. As baseline measurements have a Nafion content of 33 wt%, whereas MEA electrodes were produced with 9 wt% Nafion content in this study, Nafion content will have a role in stability observations. However, different constraints have to be met for measurements in both systems. In SFC-ICP-MS, Nafion predominantly acts as a binder in the catalyst layer to avoid particle detachment. On the other hand, in the more complex MEA system, Nafion has not only an influence on the integrity of the catalyst layer, but also on features such as contact resistance with the porous transport layers (PTL). As Nafion contents employed in this study rather open the gap between AMS and MEA instead of closing it, this rather leads to an underestimation than an overestimation of the stability discrepancy.</p><p id="Par22">The fifth study carried out is the variation of the working electrolyte pH value, varied here between 1 and 3 (experimental dissolution profiles shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). To ensure a similar ionic strength, a sulfate salt was added to electrolytes with pH&gt;1. The resulting S-numbers, shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>), significantly differ from each other. Although the S-number metric obtained for pH 1.5 is still similar to the reference measurement (pH 1), a significant difference is observed for pH 2 and 3. Such difference in stability is a factor of three: for pH 1, S-number = 6 × 10<sup>4</sup> whilst for pH = 3, S-number = 1.8 × 10<sup>5</sup>. It should be noted that local pH at the electrode under OER conditions might be lower owing to the worsened buffer capacity of electrolytes with higher pH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">MEA environments for PEMWE are, according to the literature, highly acidic owing to the use of Nafion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. The observations, made here in AMS, however, indicate, that the activity of protons in MEA electrolysis might be lower than generally accepted.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, the differences in S-numbers between AMS (1) and MEA decrease to less than one order of magnitude when circulating diluted acid through the MEA water feed (2). These differences cannot be related to a sole factor. Loading, flow rate, dissolved species, timescale or Nafion content, although not relevant factors in AMS, might play a role in MEA and have to be addressed in a follow-up study. However, the higher complexity of the MEA does not allow tangible conclusions on the main contributor. When operating an MEA with DI water on the same timescale (3), the S-number increases by two orders of magnitude, indicating a pH shift between AMS and MEA as a main contributor to the dissolution discrepancy. After 2 weeks of operation, the S-number of the MEA increased by more than one order of magnitude (4). At this timescale, based on lifetime calculations from the S-number, the catalyst in the aqueous system would already have been degraded completely. Hence, a stabilization on a larger timescale can be treated as the second main contributor to the dissolution discrepancy. As STEM-energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) only detects small amounts of iridium in the membrane close to the anode catalyst layer, iridium depositing in the membrane can be ruled out as a large contributor.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Scheme on the proposed main contributors to the dissolution discrepancy.</title><p>Schematic drawing of the factors contributing to the OER catalyst dissolution discrepancies between AMS and MEA.

PEMWE anodes are assumed to operate under highly acidic conditions due to protons generated at the anode side during operation. However, literature is scarce regarding actual pH value estimation under PEMWE operation.

However, these results might not be representative for conditions in the anode catalyst layer as the local pH can decrease owing to proton generation in the water-splitting reaction. The results shown in this study indicate that proton activity in MEA environment is supposedly lower as estimated from the concentrations. Thus, it is likely, that the effective pH in MEA environment is less acidic as generally accepted in the literature.</p><p id="Par33">These results indicate that future research should emphasize more on two aspects of MEA development: real conditions in the anode catalyst layer and effects in the catalyst/membrane interface.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusions and outlook</title><p id="Par34">In summary, we show that stability measurements performed in AMS have to be treated carefully regarding their relevance for long-term PEMWE applications.

The resulting dropcasted Ir catalyst exhibited a diameter of 6 mm and a loading of 10 µg cm<sup>−2</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Electrochemical measurements</title><p id="Par43">Electrochemical bulk measurements were carried out in a homemade H-cell. Each compartment was filled with 28 ml 0.1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (Merck Suprapur diluted with Merck Milli-Q) before the experiment. The working electrodes and reference electrodes (Basi, 3 M Ag/AgCl) were immersed in one compartment whereas the counter electrodes (glassy carbon, SIGRADUR G, HTW) were immersed in the other compartment. The compartments were covered with Parafilm to avoid evaporation of electrolytes. Convection in the system for equal distribution of dissolution product was enabled through Ar-purging of the anode compartments. Samples were taken by an automated liquid handler (Gilson GX-271). The electrochemical protocol (Gamry Interface1000 B) was started after the first sample was extracted. The total volume of electrolyte in both compartments was kept between the initial 28 ml and 24 ml at any time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>MEA measurements</title><sec id="Sec17"><title>MEA preparation</title><p id="Par44">For the experiments with the PEMWE setup, square format 5 cm<sup>2</sup> active cell area MEAs were prepared by a decal transfer method. As catalyst for the OER at the anode side, the same Alfa Aesar IrO<sub>x</sub> 2H<sub>2</sub>O Premion powder was applied as in the SFC and H-Cell experiments. The anode catalyst loading was 1.03 ± 0.07 mg<sub>Ir</sub> cm<sup>−2</sup> for all tests. For the hydrogen evolution reaction at the cathode side, carbon-supported (Vulcan XC72) platinum nanoparticles catalyst (45.8 wt% Pt/C; TEC10V50E from Tanaka, Japan) with loadings of 0.30 ± 0.14 mg<sub>Pt</sub> cm<sup>−2</sup> was used. To prepare the catalyst inks, catalyst powder, 2-propanol (purity ≥ 99.9 % from Sigma Aldrich, Germany), and Nafion<bold>®</bold> ionomer solution (20 wt% ionomer; D2021 from IonPower, USA) are mixed for 24 h using a roller mill and 5 mm zirconia grinding balls. The decals were coated with a Mayer-rod coating machine on 50 µm PTFE foil (from Angst+Pfister, Germany). Finally, MEAs were hot-pressed (3 min at 155 °C, 2.5 MPa) using the decals and different Nafion<bold>®</bold> membrane types 117 (180 µm thickness), 212 (50 µm thickness) and 211 (25 µm thickness). By evaluating the weight differences (±15 µg; XPE105DR microbalance from Mettler Toledo, Germany) of the PTFE decals before and after hot pressing, the individual catalyst loadings of the MEAs were calculated. All anodes have an ionomer content of 9 wt%, whereas all cathodes have an ionomer to carbon mass ratio of 0.6/1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>MEA measurements</title><p id="Par45">To prevent any precipitation of dissolved Iridium in the cell or in the test rig a special PEMWE setup was developed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Cell</title><p id="Par46">The cell uses a two-piece monopolar plate concept consisting of a metal flowfield sheet and a plastic body. The flowfield plates are made from 3 mm grade two titanium sheet with laser cut single serpentine channel (equal 1 mm land and 1 mm channel spacing). To prevent galvanic plating of iridium, the titanium flowfield plates are gold-coated (0.5 µm by physical vapor deposition and another 5 µm galvanic coating on top). Finally, the metal flowfield plates are inserted into a fitted plastic body made from polyoxymethylene (aqueous tests) or polytetrafluoroethylene (second design for aqueous and diluted sulfuric acid tests). The plastic body allows for media transport from the serpentine flowfield inside the cell without contact to metal surfaces to the in- and outlet fittings made from polypropylene (PP) at the face sides of the monopolar plates. At the anode side, an expanded titanium metal sheet (250 µm thickness, Sylatech, Germany) with 5 µm platinum coating is used as a porous transport layer between MEA and flowfield. The cathode side PTL is a carbon fiber paper (TGP-H-120 from Toray, Japan, no MPL) with a thickness of 370 µm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Test rig</title><p id="Par47">A fully automated test rig (E40 by Greenlight Innovation, Canada) equipped with a potentiostat and a booster (Reference 3000 and 30 A booster, Gamry, USA) was used as the basis for the integration of a metal-free anode water cycle and cathode exhaust water collector. Borosilicate glass bottles of 0.5 l to 1 l volume were used as the anode water cycle setup tank. A membrane pump (NF30 from KNF, Germany) and PE/PTFE tubes were used to feed the cell with water at a rate of ~300 ml min<sup>−1</sup>. To maintain an elevated temperature of ~55–60 °C in the cell, the setup tank glass bottle is tempered by a heater plate (IKA, Germany). To initially clean the setup from ionic impurities a deionizer cartridge is used (Leycopure mixed bed resin from Leyco, Germany), which is bypassed during the actual dissolution experiment. The anode water samples were tapped from the cycle directly behind the cell. As there was no water cycling at the cathode side, the cathode water samples were taken from the PP cathode exhaust water collector bottle. Its reservoir volume was ~10 ml and was continuously flushed at the cathode water exhaust rate of 8.2 ± 0.4 ml h<sup>−1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Measurement procedure</title><p id="Par48">Before starting the dissolution tests, the anode water cycle is cleaned up at elevated temperature for at least 12 h by running the water through the deionizer cartridge to remove eventual ionic impurities released from the setup (feed water processed by ULTRA CLEAR® TP ultrapure water system from Evoqua, USA). After the cleaning period, the cartridge is bypassed and the first 10 ml water sample (standard volume for all samples) is tapped from the cycle without contact to the cell as a clean reference. In the next step, the cell is mounted and water is run through the cell for 10 min without current. At the end, again 10 ml water is tapped from the cycle. Subsequently, the current density was set to 0.2 A cm<sup>−2</sup> for 10 min and another water sample was tapped. Thereafter, the current is set to 2 A cm<sup>−2</sup> where it stays for the rest of the experiment. Anode water samples are tapped after holding intervals of 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 1 h, and successive every 24 h. Cathode samples are taken for the first time 3 h after the start of the test and then also every 24 h. During the aqueous tests with fixed anode side water volume the tapped water, the consumed water, and the water lost to the cathode by electroosmosis is replaced by ultrapure feed water. In contrast, during the acidic tests and the aqueous tests with variable water volume, the tapped, consumed or electroosmotically transported electrolyte volume is not replaced and the initial volume of water or 0.1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is gradually reduced. At the end of the dissolution test, both flowfields were purged with nitrogen and the cell was held for at least 12 h at 1.2 V cell voltage to avoid anode side catalyst reduction by permeating hydrogen from the cathode side or the membrane. In addition, for the last two tests with gradually reduced water/acid volume, polarization curves and electrical impedance spectroscopy were made to reveal the end-of life performance of the aged MEAs. The MEAs are extracted in a glove bag and stored under nitrogen until spectroscopic analysis/STEM graphs were made.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Scanning transmission electron microscopy</title><sec id="Sec23"><title>Sample preparation</title><p id="Par49">Samples were embedded in Araldite 502 epoxy resin and cured overnight at 60 °C. Ultrathin sections with a nominal thickness of 100 nm were cut with an RMC Boeckeler PowerTome using a Diatome ultra 45° diamond knife.

High-angle annular dark-field was chosen as imaging mode, owing to its high contrast between atoms with low atomic number Z (membrane: F, C,..) and a high atomic number (Ir, Au, Ti). The chemical composition was determined via EDX (X-Max 150 silicon drift detector, Oxford Instruments; Software: Aztec Version 3.3, Oxford instruments) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and a probe current of 300 pA.</p><p id="Par51">STEM micrographs were post-processed with ImageJ. As the samples have an average thickness of 100 nm while the penetrating depth of the electron beam can be several micrometers, EDX analysis contains background elemental information like copper from the TEM-grid. For reasons of simplification, only elements of interest (Pt, Ir, Au, Ti, C, F, and O) are shown in the elemental point measurements.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>J.K., M.M, M.R., and S.C. acknowledge funding by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) within the Kopernikus Project P2X under the grant number 03SFK211-2.
