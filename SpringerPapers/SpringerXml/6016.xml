The pumped storage is the most mature technology, which is characterized with having large capacity, long service lifespan and low unit cost. However, the construction of the pumped storage power station is restricted by geographical conditions, the construction period is longer, and the overall investment is large. The compressed-air energy storage has the advantages of large capacity, long operation time, long service lifespan, etc. And also it is capable of supplying combined heat, cold, and electricity by converting the compressed-air into other alternative energy.

In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], the 2050 development scenario in China is simulated, which shows that the energy storage demand will be between 560 and 780 GW. Meanwhile the electricity demand will attain between 2 and 3 billion kWh without considering grid constraints among regions in China. However, the large scale application of energy storage technology still faces challenges both in the technical and economic aspects.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Technology challenges</title><p id="Par46">First of all, the development of energy storage technology requires the innovation and breakthrough in capacity, long-lifespan, low-cost, high-security for electrochemical energy storage. And also, physical storage technology with high-efficiency, low-cost is required. Secondly, the research should be focused on the energy storage simulation and operation optimization in multiple applications, which can support the application of energy storage technology from theoretical viewpoint, and develop demonstration projects and comprehensive evaluation to promote the industrialization and commercialization of energy storage. At the same time it is necessary to establish a complete and rigorous professional cohesion, reasonable classification, transparency, openness and energy storage standards, which will provide strong support for research and development, production and application of energy storage, and promote the development of energy storage technology and related industries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Economic challenges</title><p id="Par47">Currently, energy storage industry in China is still facing with challenges of lack of policy support, high cost, unclear application value, unhealthy market mechanism and other issues. Two aspects should be considered in the future: on the one hand, it is necessary to propose energy storage system solutions with the participations from electricity users, electrical enterprises, researcher, economical organizations and social originations, and on the other hand, the suitable industry market mechanism and the subsidy policy should be promoted. We should encourage numerous researches and applications of energy storage, establish a sustainable development model and achieve commercial operation of energy storage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Prospects of energy storage technology development</title><p id="Par48">VLPGO (twelve of the largest power grid operators) has launched an investigation into renewable energy development and energy storage planning in different countries. The United States, Japan, Spain, China and other countries have taken the wind, solar and other non-fossil fuels energy into consideration in the long-term energy planning. With the trends of rapid power system expansion and large-scale renewable energy development, each country has undertaken the grid planning for next 10â20 years taking into consideration the energy storage, and various types of energy storage technologies are evaluated and many demonstrations have been planned or built, which can vigorously promote the development and application of energy storage technology in the smart grid. According to the investigation results, energy storage is deployed as fast response product for frequency regulation service in many counties, and most power system companies are willing to purchase this service.</p><p id="Par49">Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) has classified and outlined fourteen categories for energy storage technology applications in power systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Energy storage has significant impacts on large-scale renewable energy grid integration, load shifting, postponing power grid constructions and improving power system security. These will also create a great opportunity for energy storage development at the same time. Based on the Woori conjecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], the value of global energy storage will increase by 26% annually in the future, the market value of global energy storage will be up to $16 billion in 2020.

Although Chinese energy storage industry is still faced with problems such as lack of policy support, unclear technical specification, small scale, high cost, low value and unhealthy mechanism, etc, the rapid application development of future energy storage industry is a foregone conclusion due to its capability in increasing renewable energy penetration level and improving electric energy efficiency.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par51">In this paper, the technology profile of global energy storage is analyzed and summarized, focusing on the application of energy storage technology. Application scenarios of energy storage technologies are reviewed, taking into consideration their impacts on power generation, transmission, distribution and utilization. The general status in different applications is outlined and summarized. Ultimately, the challenges of scale-up application in energy storage and development prospect of future energy storage technology are expressed. The result indicates that, the energy storage has been widely applied in power systems connected with renewable energy generation. It also shows clear commercial benefit and prospect in the fields of peak shaving and frequency regulation of power systems, etc. The energy storage application in distributed generation and microgrid also keeps increasing, and it has shown great progress in the field of power transmission and distribution. The energy storage technology will play an important role in every stage, ensuring a safe, stable, economical operation of power systems, and it has broad application prospect. The development and expansion of energy storage technology not only depend on the improvement in storage characteristics, operational control and management strategy, but also requires the cost
