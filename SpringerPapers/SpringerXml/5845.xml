id="Par1">Solar energy generated by grid-connected photovoltaic (GCPV) systems is considered an important alternative electric energy source because of its clean energy production system, easy installation, and low operating and maintenance costs. This has led to it becoming more popular compared with other resources. However, finding optimal sites for the construction of solar farms is a complex task with many factors to be taken into account (environmental, social, legal and political, technical-economic, etc.), which classic site selection models do not address efficiently. There are few studies on the criteria that should be used when identifying sites for solar energy installations (large grid-connected photovoltaic systems which have more than 100 kWp of installed capacity). It is therefore essential to change the way site selection processes are approached and to seek new methodologies for location analysis. A geographic information system (GIS) is a tool which can provide an effective solution to this problem. Here, we combine legal, political, and environmental criteria, which include solar radiation intensity, local physical terrain, environment, and climate, as well as location criteria such as the distance from roads and the nearest power substations. Additionally, we use GIS data (time series of solar radiation, digital elevation models (DEM), land cover, and temperature) as further input parameters. Each individual site is assessed using a unique and cohesive approach to select the most appropriate locations for solar farm development in the Valencian Community, a Spanish region in the east of Spain.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Solar energy</kwd><kwd>Solar radiation</kwd><kwd>Solar farms</kwd><kwd>Grid

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Sources of renewable energy (RE) have become a necessary alternative with which to face the growing and essential energy demand in the twenty-first century. Over the last decade, solar energy has emerged among the different types of REs (biomass, wind, geothermal and solar) as one of the most promising RE sources to replace fossil fuels in meeting the world’s future energy needs (Trappey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2016</xref>). The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that solar power could provide as much as 11% of the world’s electricity production in 2050. However, this depends on a large number of countries implementing incentive schemes to promote solar energy production in the following decades, so that investment costs decrease (Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">From 2000 to 2016, the predominant RE source in Spain was wind power, followed by hydro and solar power (Red Eléctrica de España <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>). Due to the orography of the Iberian Peninsula, and its location in the Northern hemisphere (its latitude and longitude coordinates being 36° 00° N and 43° 47″ N), Spain enjoys favorable conditions for both small- and large-scale solar energy production through cutting edge technology. It is for this reason that our localization strategy analysis focuses on power stations using photovoltaic (PV) technology to produce energy.</p><p id="Par4">There are numerous studies which review the most suitable technologies for these systems. Some of them focus on the materials used in the production of PVPs (photovoltaic panels) and other P such as voltage drops and network losses in the large-scale integration of PV power generation into electric distribution systems. Other studies explore the topologies used to interconnect PVPs with inverters (grid connectivity) and the technology developed for inverters in order to compare their efficiency, control, cost, and weight, and analyze future trends (Trappey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2016</xref>; Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011</xref>; Nemet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>). In contrast, there are few publications which review the criteria for assessing the land use potential for solar farm development (large grid-connected PV power plants which have more than 100 kWp of installed capacity).</p><p id="Par5">Finding the best location on which to install a solar farm is vital for the sustainability and economic feasibility of such projects. Traditional plans for PVP investments have been somewhat arbitrary, mainly because planners of solar power plant projects have barely considered analyzing them at a regional scale. Furthermore, previous studies assessing the potential of PVP investments in one area usually only used solar energy maps (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>; Xin-gang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>), or solar energy maps and technology (Chakraborty et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2015</xref>; Chakraborty et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>) although this is currently changing. Capital outlay for energy production is known to depend largely on the abundance of the resource and the distance to the point of energy end use. The availability of solar resource varies considerably as follows: (i) on a global scale between climates zones; (ii) on a local scale due to variations in terrain orientation, slope, elevation, etc.; and (iii) depending on the orographic conditions. Consequently, if the sun is to be used as a source of energy, it is convenient to carry out an in-depth study on the basis of location criteria to find optimal sites for the installation of PV power plants.</p><p id="Par6">Developing land use strategies is essential for the rational and sustainable use of non-renewable natural resources such as land, since they allow this resource to be used in a planned, sustainable, and appropriate way (Akıncı et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>). Indeed, knowledge and assessment of the area are vital for territorial planning, which is a complex process, firstly, because highly diverse factors related to the object of planning must be taken into account, and secondly, because of the difficulty of carrying out a joint analysis of all these factors (Galacho-Jiménez and Ocaña-Ocaña <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">The literature has extensively examined site selection issues for different land sustainable uses:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par8">Irrigated agriculture: Akıncı et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2013</xref>) determine suitable lands for agricultural use in the Yusufeli district of Artvin (Turkey) using parameters such as great soil groups, land use capability classes and sub-classes, soil depth, slope aspect, elevation, erosion degree, and other soil properties; Ismail et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>) produce soil suitability maps for different types of irrigation land uses and consider the following as land suitability criteria: slope gradient, soil properties like depth, erosion, drainage, infiltration rate, available water holding capacity, stoniness/rockiness, salinity, exchangeable sodium percent, and calcium carbonate content; Mendas and Delali (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>) use multi-criteria analysis to produce a map with the best pieces of land for sustainable agriculture (productive and profitable agriculture that protects the environment and that is socially equitable), their main criteria being drainage, permeability, potential of hydrogen, electrical conductivity, active limestone, cation exchange capacity, soil texture, soil useful depth, slope, availability of labor, and proximity to roads.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par9">Ecosystem services: Geneletti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2013</xref>) develops a set of metrics to compare land use policy scenarios and to analyze their effects on the provision of ecosystem services including water purification, soil retention, carbon sequestration, provision of habitat for species, and timber production. These authors consider criteria such as elevation, slope, aspect, soil type, erosion, land cover proximity to infrastructure and urban areas, and proximity to existing plantations.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10">Landfills: Al-Ruzouq et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2018</xref>) take into account social, economic, and environmental aspects like the distance to main roads, residential areas, airports, city boundaries, and wells, in addition to other aspects like elevation, slope, geology, and hydrology to select the most appropriate locations for landfills; Afzali et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2014</xref>) also study the availability of suitable sites for waste disposal using the following criteria: groundwater depth, distance of water resources to surface, slope, permeability, faults, environmentally sensitive areas, distance to residential areas and main roads, land use, and floodplains; for Khodaparast et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2018</xref>), the main factors in selecting suitable locations for waste disposal include slope, distance from urban and rural areas, surface water protection, land use and the distance from access roads, power lines, wells, saline groundwater zones, fault zones, historical sites, and airports.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11">Tourism: Cetin et al.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2017</xref>), for their part, examine site vulnerability to natural threats and produce a forest fire risk map assessing factors such as slope gradient and aspect, altitude, land cover, distance to settlements and roads, wind speed, vegetation index, annual rainfall, and temperature.</p><p id="Par16">As may be seen from the numerous references, there are many studies on soil and location suitability for different uses and activities.</p><p id="Par17">Renewable energy strategies for sustainable development, particularly solar energy planning, require studying both the impact of PVPs at regional and local levels and the suitability of the areas for solar farm development (Chakraborty et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>). Moreover, an important part of the solar energy planning process is to determine the factors or criteria that affect the availability of this resource. It is therefore essential to consider all aspects (technological, economic, and environmental), since it is a complex process which needs complete information about a wide range of criteria and their implications for deciding on the available areas.</p><p id="Par18">Topographical and soil features are among the most relevant factors for solar energy planning. Their analysis involves a large variety and amount of physiographic data, which include climate characteristics such as solar radiation; internal soil characteristics such as natural fertility, depth, texture, and geology; and external soil characteristics such as slope, land cover, erosion, orientation, elevation, flood risk, and accessibility.</p><p id="Par19">Currently, there are approaches available, based on geographical information systems (GISs) and spatial analysis, which can provide considerable support to management and decision-making processes (Mendas and Delali <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>). These tools make it possible to interpret spatial components and site information for solar farm land use and any technology chosen.</p><p id="Par20">In our study, the criteria for deciding on one location or another are defined by examining the literature on accessibility (Janke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>; Gastli and Charabi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010</xref>), grid connection (Janke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>), orientation and slope (Janke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>; Gastli and Charabi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010</xref>; Sánchez-Lozano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2016</xref>), land cover (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>; Janke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>), and latitude and longitude (Jo and Otanicar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2011</xref>). Sánchez-Lozano et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2016</xref>) introduce criteria to evaluate jointly the following aspects: soil properties, slope, orientation, grid connection, solar radiation, and temperature. Based on this review, we synthesized all the information, chose the criteria, and then defined a preliminary list. This list of criteria was submitted for approval by a group of experts on solar PV farms. Based on their assessment, we established the final list of criteria for the site selection of PV farms (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">However, according to the literature reviewed, there are some knowledge gaps associated with solar farm site selection. Firstly, the literature considers only a limited number of variables and does not distinguish the excluding aspects that make solar farm projects unfeasible for certain areas (risk areas, legal exclusion, etc.) from those aspects that simply limit or condition the activity (slopes, orientation, temperature, radiation, etc.). Secondly, technology criteria are not taken into account when in fact, depending on the type of technology chosen, solar farm activity may be limited to a greater or lesser degree in certain locations (Maleki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>). Thirdly, grouping criteria might not be possible due to the small number of variables used, i.e., the criteria considered may not allow us to identify the most advantageous areas. For instance, the distance to transmission lines could emerge as an important factor when comparing areas with abundant solar energy resources at local and regional levels and when the values of solar radiation are similar in all the area studied (Yushchenko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par22">Thus, although our methodology is developed based on the aforementioned literature review, an alternative approach is proposed for treating the solar planning criteria. The analysis is carried out in two stages: first, certain areas are excluded, which simplifies the subsequent analysis and allows for further information to be included; and secondly, the aspects to be considered when selecting locations are examined, and classified into criteria and sub-criteria in order to carry out more detailed partial analyses using specific criteria.</p><p id="Par23">This two-step approach combines legal, political, and environmental aspects with geographic and technical-environmental criteria, which include solar radiation intensity, local physical terrain, environment, climate, location, and the distance to roads and the nearest power substations. Additionally, we use GIS data (time series of solar radiation, digital elevation model (DEM), land cover, and temperature) as further input parameters. Each individual site is assessed using a unique and cohesive approach to select the most appropriate locations for solar farm development in the Valencian Community, a Spanish region in the east of Spain. Our aim is to provide an innovative system for spatial planning problems by creating an argumentation map to analyze the different factors that determine the areas not excluded.</p><p id="Par24">The objective of this study is thus to provide a methodology with which to identify potential PV power generation sites in a specific area and thereby support the development of new PV power stations as well as strategic RE planning. Moreover, the results of our study can help find potential areas for solar farm development in any country.</p><p id="Par25">Further research might include other criteria like building costs and local demand which can also affect site selection. They could be applied in further steps to assess the candidate locations and select the suitable areas (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), but these criteria are specific to particular farm projects. Our research work here stops at the second level of analysis.</p><p id="Par26">This paper is divided into the following sections: after this introduction, information is provided on the area of study and the parameters used in the solar farm site analysis. Next, there is a description of the GIS tool used for data criteria management, as well as its integration for the area selection. This is followed by the results and discussion. The final section presents the conclusions together with some final comments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Area of study</title><p id="Par27">We apply the proposed GIS-based approach to select locations for the installation of solar power plants in the Valencian Community, a Spanish region in the east of Spain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Study area of the Valencian Community in Spain</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10661_2019_7871_Fig1_HTML.jpg" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par28">In 2017, there were approximately 5 million inhabitants residing in this area, which represents 10.5% of the total population in Spain and occupies the second position in terms of population density (more than 210 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref>.

In fact, the Valencian Community is a region that consumes more energy than it produces, with a negative balance of approximately more than 2 GWh.</p><p id="Par30">The aim of the Valencian Government is to give priority to RE sources rather than conventional ones, promoting actions that intensify their contribution to energy production in the region at the expense of fossil fuels. Although the main objective is to reach at least a 16% share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption, the final goal is to achieve a greater use of REs. The orographic conditions of the Valencian Community are propitious for the installation of new PV power plants, which would help reach the proposed objective. The Valencian Institute of Cartography, supported by the Valencian Government, has an important set of maps<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> available that provide comprehensive information on relevant spatial criteria for site selection, showing environmental protected areas, and high mountain and forest areas, as well as suitable land for agriculture. In addition, there are maps with infrastructure data containing the high- and low-voltage power lines of the Valencian Community. Maps from the Spanish National Geographic Institute were also used in our study. Solar radiation data was obtained from the European Commission PVGIS (Photovoltaic Geographical Information System) website. All this information was used to select the most suitable sites in the region for the construction of PV power plants.</p><p id="Par32">In the Valencian Community, the elevation declines gradually from west to east. The maximum altitude is over 1800 m, and solar radiation is from a minimum of 179.3 W/m<sup>2</sup> to a maximum of 219.7 W/m<sup>2</sup>. The highest solar energy densities occur in southern areas with more than 200 W/m<sup>2</sup>. Given the great availability of solar energy resources, the Valencian Community has the potential to develop PV power stations (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>DEM and solar radiation in the Valencian Community</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10661_2019_7871_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Land use criteria for solar farm analysis</title><p id="Par33">There is a considerable amount of different criteria to be taken into account in the installation of solar power plants.

These conditions are set by the economic policies and environmental regulations made by the government of the region under study. In our paper, we consider those established by the Spanish government and the Valencian regional government, according to the division of competences set out in the Spanish Constitution. The reason for using legal exclusion criteria is that, for example, in the case of land classified as urban only houses or factories can be built there, while solar parks cannot be installed (Law 10,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2004</xref>). Other areas which must be excluded are nature reserves, national parks, natural monuments, and other environmentally sensitive areas, which are protected due to their natural outstanding or unique value, as well as historical and tourist monument sites (Law 42,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2007</xref>), and rivers (Janke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>; Gastli and Charabi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>). Other areas that have to be removed in our study are those included in the Natura 2000 network, which are also considered nature reserves: Sites of Community Importance (SCI), Birdlife Special Protection Areas, as well as cultural heritage sites (Law 10,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2004</xref>). PV installations can affect the movement of migratory birds and cause deforestation and the creation of physical barriers which damage wildlife, etc. (Sanchez-Lozano et al. 2016).</p><p id="Par55">Other environmental criteria which lead to exclusion are areas with risks involved, such as floods, landslides, and windy areas, or with geological characteristics that make the area unsuitable for installing PVPs.</p><p id="Par56">Once the <italic>areas not excluded</italic> are identified, we step into the second decision level in which geographical location criteria are used. Solar radiation is the main and decisive factor (Gastli and Charabi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010</xref>; Janke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>) at this level. In the case of the Valencian Community, solar radiation is above the minimum level required (more than 5 h/day: min 179.3 W/m<sup>2</sup> to max 219.7 W/m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p id="Par57">In order to make the construction of the solar farm easier and taking into view possible repair and maintenance issues, those sites closer to roads are considered to be more suitable (Gastli and Charabi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010</xref>; Janke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>). The distance to the nearest electricity network is also a determinant factor (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>). Difficulty in connecting PV-generated electricity to the grid depends on the location of the site. The transmitting distance to grid connections (substations) is also essential, since power losses make it harder to achieve a real supply of RE electricity (Song et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par58">Other site features, such as land slope, should be taken into consideration, i.e., those sites with a steep gradient where it is difficult to install solar panels should be excluded. Gastli and Charabi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2010</xref>) recommend flat terrain or gentle slopes facing south with less than a 5% graded slope for large-scale PV power plants. According to Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>), fields flatter than 5° are a technical requirement to ensure that all the PV modules can be installed at an optimal tilt angle. For Chiabrando et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>), there is an optimal module tilt which depends on the latitude (at 46° north latitude this can be found between 30° and 35° if the time period of the analysis is 1 year), and for a case study they analyze a medium sloped hill of 20°. The orientation of the panel is another factor which affects the output of PV modules. The optimal module orientation is always south (or north in the southern hemisphere).</p><p id="Par59">According to Janke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>), the ideal locations for solar farms in terms of land cover are those with short vegetation, such as shrubs, prairie, grasses, scrub, steppe, agriculture, logged areas, or barren lands, which would not reduce solar insolation. Areas that are not suitable are those with sparse but taller vegetation (pine and juniper trees) or wetlands, due to their ecologic importance. Non-ideal areas are those whose land cover contains pine, subalpine, and aspen forests or areas on which it would be difficult to develop solar projects because of their inaccessibility or instability, or those areas which are not already developed. Areas with dunes, bedrock and scree, ice, cliffs, canyons, alpine tundra, and mines, as well as developed areas, also fall within this category.</p><p id="Par60">Altitude and temperature are also factors that condition the normal functioning of solar panels and the production of solar energy. High altitude increases the difficulty of building PV power plants and can affect the transmission facilities. The highest solar energy densities occur in desert areas with high altitude and dry climate. Altitudes higher than 5800 m are not recommended, although it depends on the study area (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>). According to Skoplaki et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>), areas with average temperatures below 10° and above 20° should be excluded.</p><p id="Par61">Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the different criteria and the factors that affect the installation of PVPs and that can be directly or indirectly quantified.

Vector features are more suitable for representing boundaries and other geometric spatial objects.

On the one hand, it is important to bear in mind that the environmental, legal, and political criteria that determine the areas not excluded are specific to each country, and within each country they depend on the regional and local regulations for urban and territorial planning. The criteria for selecting areas with high potential for solar power development are the same everywhere, and it is highly probable that they have the same importance. However, it is recommendable to identify the stakeholders in each country or region and to conduct a survey with them to define the importance of each criterion, since a different weight can be given to each one of them. In the case of our study, we profited from an important geographic database available from the Valencian government, which allowed us to carry out a more accurate study and make the results more reliable.</p><p id="Par82">It should be pointed out that the final outcome of 22 alternative locations does not provide a comparison of their suitability in relation to the others, both in technical and environmental terms as well as in economic terms. Site selection involves screening a large geographic area to select a limited number of suitable locations (alternatives). Alternative locations identified by the screening must be assessed further which will lead to finding the most suitable site among all alternatives.</p><p id="Par83">In future studies, it would be advisable to use additional information and seek out expert opinions to create a ranking of suitable areas. It would also be interesting to incorporate the economic information of the selected areas to be able to identify the <italic>geographically and economically suitable locations</italic>, which would be the third decision level. And finally, using these areas as an object of further analysis, a public participation process should be undertaken (fourth decision level), whereby the society or population of the area in question can decide what the best locations are in order to protect high-value landscapes, generate job opportunities, and foster rural development.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Afzali</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sabri</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Rashid</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Samani</surname><given-names>JMV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Inter-municipal landfill site selection using analytic network process</article-title><source>Water Resources Management</source><year>2014</year><volume>28</volume><issue>8</issue><fpage>217</fpage><lpage>2194</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s11269-014-0605-3</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Akıncı</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Özalp</surname><given-names>AY</given-names></name><name><surname>Turgut</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Agricultural land use suitability analysis using GIS and AHP technique</article-title><source>Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</source><year>2013</year><volume>97</volume><fpage>71</fpage><lpage>82</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.compag.2013.07.006</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Al-Ruzouq</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Shanableh</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Omar</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Al-Khayyat</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Macro and micro geo-spatial environment consideration for landfill site selection in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates</article-title><source>Environmental Monitoring and Assessment</source><year>2018</year><volume>190</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>147</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s10661-018-6538-1</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cavazzi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Dutton</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">An Offshore Wind Energy Geographic Information System (OWE-GIS) for assessment of the UK’s offshore wind energy potential</article-title><source>Renewable Energy</source><year>2016</year><volume>87</volume><fpage>212</fpage><lpage>228</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.renene.2015.09.021</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cetin</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Zeren</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Sevik</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Cakir</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Akpinar</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">A study on the determination of the natural park’s sustainable tourism potential</article-title><source>Environmental Monitoring and Assesment</source><year>2018</year><volume>190</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>167</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s10661-018-6534-5</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR6"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chakraborty</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Sadhu</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Pal</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Technical mapping of solar PV for ISM -an approach toward green campus</article-title><source>Energy Science &amp;
