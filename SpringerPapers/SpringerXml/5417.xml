This technology is realized integrating in a single system (1) a Stirling engine (mRT-1K) from a pre-engineering design of Allan J. Organ; (2) a micro-heat exchanger technology, to reduce the net transfer unit deficit on the hot side of the heat engine; (3) a customized pellet boiler, able to extract electrical and thermal power; and (4) a customized hydraulic circuit, connecting the cool side of the Stirling engine and the heat generation on the second section of the pellet boiler. The objective of this paper was to present a new technology for the micro-cogeneration of energy at a distributed level able to be integrated in domestic dwellings. Most part of the available biomass is used in buildings for the generation of thermal power for indoor heating and, in minor cases, for hot sanitary water. In the Province of Trento, 88% of the biomass is used for this purpose. The full system is actually under integration for the test phase and not yet tested. The first tests on the single components have confirmed preliminary results on the Stirling engine with respect to the tolerances, pressurization, and proper integration of the electrical generator-driven control system. The pellet boiler has been tested separately, confirming an overall thermal efficiency of 90%.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>micro-cogeneration</kwd><kwd>Stirling engine</kwd><kwd>pellet boiler</kwd><kwd>renewable energy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2011</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2011</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13705_2011_Article_5.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Sustainable Development</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Policy, Economics and Management</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Policy, Economics and Management</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1186/2192-0567-1-5" ext-link-type="doi">10.1186/2192-0567-1-5</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The cogeneration of energy at a distributed level is one of the leading arguments in large part of energy policies related to renewable energy resources and systems. The actual marketable solar systems for domestic and distributed applications (photovoltaic [PV] and solar thermal) suffer notable limitations: (1) The low overall (electrical) efficiency of PV systems creates a small collected energy from the available space, sometimes restricted in the surface to a few square meters; (2) the stagnation temperatures on solar thermal collectors are actually limiting the diffusion of solar thermal systems; and (3) fixed and non-retrofittable systems may generate energy in an intermittent manner not aligned with the auto-consumption profile of domestic spaces.</p><p>On the other end, the growth of the distributed energy generation is far above all previsions, not only in new energy markets but even in highly industrialized countries. In Germany, more than 50% of the 43-GW installed power in 2009 is in the hands of individuals and farmers, on all sectors of solar, wind, biomass technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. At the distributed level, an increasing number of technologies are approaching the market, such as new and efficient PV or concentrated photovoltaics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; micro-combined heat and power [m-CHP] solutions based on solar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], fuel cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], or biomass; and technologies for the efficient production of thermal energy such as ground source heat pumps, air heat pumps, and solar thermal.</p><p>The development of new cogeneration systems based on non-intermittent sources able to be coupled and eventually hybridized with other sustainable technologies is highly required. A compact micro-cogeneration system based on a pellet boiler integrated with a Stirling engine is presented, realized compatibly with the market-levelized energy cost. This paper presents, for the first time, the different stages of the development of such m-CHP biomass technology.</p><p>Such system (see Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) integrates a Stirling engine (mRT-1k) in a customized pellet boiler properly realized to generate thermal power for heating and eventual cooling, electricity, and hot sanitary water. Four main themes have led to the development of this proposal:<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Technological layout for the micro-cogeneration pellet boiler</bold>.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13705_2011_Article_5_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Improvements in combustion technology allow the adaptation of a retrofitted combustion chamber with the Stirling heat exchanger in a new efficient solution, optimizing the electricity generation, the heat removal from different parts of the system at different temperatures, and the overall efficiency.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Optimized Stirling engines and new compact heat exchanger technology can reduce the costs and improve the performance of small heat engines, so they can operate with higher proportions of Carnot efficiency on the working temperatures (~600°C) from the combustion burner.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The high cost and low power efficiency of gas-fuelled m-CHP systems, combined with increases in natural gas prices, both absolute and relative to electricity prices, can undermine the financial viability of gas-fuelled m-CHP.

The overall efficiency obtained by the best and state-of-the-art technologies is comparable to those on natural gas or fossil fuel boilers, with values above 80%. The m-CHP generation from a pellet or wood burner is a potential added value to the base technology.</p><p>A market analysis reveals that Italy is the first European country in the specific market sector of the pellet stoves, accounting for 800,000 domestic systems installed at 2008 and 380,000 units produced in 2006. It adds a growth of 300% in the last 5 years (2003-2008) in pellet consumption and use. To have a comparison data, in Europe, there have been 4.4 Mt produced in 2006 with respect to 8.4 Mt in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the European energy market, biomass has a share of 51% with respect to the energy produced by renewable sources, of which 85% comes from domestic plants and about 15% from industrial plants (multistage combustion, gasification, pyrolysis processes). In addition, the direct production of thermal energy from renewable sources, about 97%, comes from biomass combustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, 97% of all direct thermal energy from renewable sources comes from biomass combustion.</p><p>A recent report from Frost and Sullivan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] showed that biomass can provide a strong support to renewable energies in the European context. This source provides currently two thirds of the specific sector and has a strong growing margin since the raw material produced in the EU 25 territory is increasing. The same report underlines the biomass context, which is wrongly considered an energy resource of the past, that financing support for technological development can provide solutions for an advanced system, reduction of costs (the conversion ratio €/kW is one of the more advantageous in the market, with costs lower than 2,000 €/kWe), environmental sustainability, and lower levels of impact.</p><p>The present project aims to realize a system which is capable of covering a part of the demand for electrical energy and the demand for thermal energy for heating and hot sanitary water purposes.</p><p>Following are some considerations on domestic system for cogeneration:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>There is a good match between production and demand of electrical energy since a pellet stove is mainly used during the part of the day which also has an electrical demand. For this reason, most of the electrical energy is consumed locally.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Modularity of the generation system: The system can support different demands of electrical and thermal power.

Since the wood production is at least one order of magnitude higher, the whole potential electrical production is 35 TWh/year, which is roughly one tenth of the electrical production in EU from nuclear plant.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The pellet boiler m-CHP system</title><p>The pellet cogeneration boiler is based on the integration between a Stirling engine and a biomass pellet boiler. The subcomponents of the specific technology are under integration. They include a Stirling engine, the <italic><underline>mRT-1k</underline></italic>, pre-engineered by Allan J. Organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The overall system is designed as illustrated in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The Stirling engine is integrated directly inside the combustion chamber. Its heat exchanger is immediately above the burner. The Stirling engine can start operating and generating electrical and thermal power after a transient time to keep the engine at proper working conditions (hot and cold temperatures, energy flow through the heat exchanger). A drive control electronic system activates the Stirling engine controlling the generator and making it working as a motor.</p><p>A spiral screw, electronically controlled, advances the pellet. The burner is designed to provide stoichiometric primary air to realize a flame of 18 kW<sub>th</sub>. The pellet boiler is mainly composed of (1) a burning chamber connected to primary air which is blown inside using a forced flow system; (2) an internal water circuit to remove thermal power after the Stirling engine and maintain the exhaust temperature in the range of 80°C; and (3) an external water boiler to store thermal energy for the heating of the indoor environment and the production of hot sanitary water. The hydraulic system comes from the boiler; the water is pumped inside the cold end of the Stirling engine to cool and maintain a temperature of about 45-50°C. It goes to the boiler heat remover and goes back to the water boiler at a temperature of about 75°C. The mass flow of the pellet and the water will be calibrated as a function of the energy balance able to maintain the system in a steady-state thermal condition. The electrical power is derived by the engine adapting to the specific condition of the grid connection and acting through a load management system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Measurement system</title><p>The integrated technology will be provided with a centralized measurement and control system (see Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). It will be directly connected to the different subcomponents. The controller monitors temperatures in and out from the boiler water jacket, inside the Stirling engine, in the expander cylinder, in the compression cylinder, at the input and at the output of the water circuit, at the exhaust of the boiler, the volume flow on the water circuit passing though the Stirling, and inside the pellet boiler. Furthermore, the pressure sensors, both for dynamic and absolute values, are positioned inside the Stirling engine on the heat exchanger and before the compression cylinder; the pellet mass flow sensor is located at the input of the burner. In such a way, the energy and mass balance will be monitored.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Measurement and control system for the m-CHP technology</bold>.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13705_2011_Article_5_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The system has been provided with thermostatic control for high temperature to activate control on the combustion chamber and stop the biomass flow to the burner in case of alarm. The system first activates the water circulation through the Stirling and the water jacket; secondly, the burner is started. The control system will monitor the transient until a threshold temperature. At that condition, the Stirling engine is activated by the generator used as a motor using the drive control as the engine speed control. The rated power will be reached.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>The cogeneration engine</title><p>The mRT-1k engine is a 1-kW air-charged (14-bar gauge) reciprocating Stirling engine.

The impact at the local level can either be supported by the local Energy Agency of the Province of Trento to small-scale biomass conversion plants and installations with respect to bigger cogeneration biomass power plants. A lot of the local activities are on the way to realize a whole chain of stakeholders involved at the local level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to extend some acknowledgements mainly to the Editor, to Dagmar Fiedler, to Michael Narodoslawsky, and all colleagues at TU Graz and eseia [European Sustainable Energy Innovation Alliance].
