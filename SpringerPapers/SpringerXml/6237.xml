BN has an interlayer spacing of 3.3A<sup>0</sup> which is similar to that of graphene, but smaller than that of the other 2D nanomaterials. BN is bioinert, and stable under harsh chemical and thermal conditions. When combined with thin film composite and mixed matrix membrane architectures, BN can help achieve high permeance, dye rejection, and desalination. Laminar membranes assembled by BN nanosheets do not swell uncontrollably in aqueous environments unlike graphene oxide. BN nanomaterials have a large specific surface area which implies more adsorption sites, and are inherently hydrophobic in nature, which means the adsorbent in its powder form can be easily separated from contaminated water. BN adsorbents can be regenerated by treating with chemicals or heating to high temperatures to remove the adsorbate, without damaging the BN, due to its thermal and chemical inertness. BN nanomaterials have the potential to circumvent the current shortcomings of membranes and adsorbents, while greatly enhancing the performance of membranes and adsorbents for water remediation.</p></sec><sec id="ASec1"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="Par2"><fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42252_2023_42_Figa_HTML.png" position="anchor" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hexagonal boron nitride</kwd><kwd>2D nanomaterials</kwd><kwd>Membrane</kwd><kwd>Adsorbent</kwd><kwd>Dye and antibiotics removal</kwd><kwd>Desalination</kwd><kwd>Antifouling</kwd><kwd>Oil–water separation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/42252_2023_Article_42.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry and Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">The availability of clean water is one of the most critical issues globally, now more so than ever. With the ever-expanding population of the world and the diminishing sources of fresh groundwater, it is proving increasingly challenging to meet the clean water needs of the modern world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There is an urgent need for innovation and technology to face the global water challenge. Amongst the most prevalent ways of water remediation, membrane-based filtration methods hold the reins compared to their counterparts due to their high separation efficiency, low thermal energy input, and high-quality output. Polymer-based membranes are the most prevalent in all the filtration regimes – microfiltration (MF), ultrafiltration (UF), nanofiltration (NF), reverse osmosis (RO), as these are easy to process on an industrial scale, and their properties can be tuned to suit the end requirement. In the RO and NF regimes, polyamide-based thin-film composite (PA-TFC) membranes currently rule the market as these are easy to process, offer control over the thickness of the active polyamide layer, and most importantly, have high rejection rates of salts and other micropollutants. However, the current state-of-the-art polyamide desalination membranes are only twice as porous as they were 20 years ago, with the same selectivity.</p><p id="Par4">These membranes are still chlorine intolerant, which makes disinfection cumbersome and increases membrane fouling and thus reduces its filtration capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Water transport occurs through the solution-diffusion mechanism- a relatively slow process. NF and RO membranes suffer from low flux, severe fouling, and high energy input. In addition, RO systems require post filtration steps like remineralization. These are some of the reasons that led to the Government of India to completely ban the domestic usage of RO, unless required.</p><p id="Par5">Although the research on PA-TFC membranes continues to move ahead at full throttle, these shortcomings have prompted researchers to search for alternative materials. Considering that there is a need for a breakthrough membrane technology with high water-to-solute selectivity if the needs of future generations are to be met, 2D nanomaterials seem to be the ideal candidates for this purpose. The isolation of graphene in 2004 at the University of Manchester sparked a revolution in the study and application of 2D nanomaterials in various disparate fields. Membrane technology is no exception. The last decade has seen an explosion of research on water filtration membranes based on these nanomaterials. 2D nanomaterials possess nanometer level thickness, leading to higher flux, large surface area, which results in numerous transport pathways and greater area for solute-surface interaction, vast array of tunable properties that can be tailored to meet the filtration needs, and nanometer-thick transport channels and pores. These nanomaterials can be incorporated into the polymer matrix to obtain mixed matrix membranes, they can be free-standing porous 2D membranes, or can be deposited as an active layer atop a support membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The numerous ways in which nanomaterials can be used to enhance the performance of existing membranes and to fabricate completely new high-performance membrane systems is what propels the thriving research. These materials have been the focus of extensive research in the last few years. This review aims to bring the reader up to date by highlighting the work done on BN-based water purification membranes specifically and Graphene, MXenes and MoS<sub>2</sub> based membranes generally. Unless mentioned otherwise, BN here implies hexagonal boron nitride.</p><p id="Par6">BN is made up of boron and nitrogen arranged alternatingly forming a hexagonal pattern in each monolayer. The monolayers follow an ABAB stacking pattern, due to the van der Waals forces between the monolayers as well the partial positive and negative charges on boron and nitrogen respectively. In the following sections, a few studies on graphene and graphene oxide, dichalcogenides, MXenes are discussed followed by a thorough survey of membrane applications and the role as an adsorbent of hexagonal boron nitride, which is the material of focus of this article. This review for the most part includes only the experimental studies involving these nanomaterials. As this review focuses on BN, the reader is referred to other general works on GO, MXenes, Dichalcogenides in their respective sections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>2D nanomaterials for water purification (membranes)</title><p id="Par7">While the transport of solutes, water and other solvents occurs through solution-diffusion in RO membranes, and through convection in the UF and MF membranes and a combination of convection and diffusion in NF membranes, the transport in 2D NMs occurs through molecular sieving through nanochannels and nanopores, and electrostatic interactions. 2D nanomaterials possess a host of desirable properties. A few have even been found to be anti-bacterial. The sections on each of the nanomaterials will illustrate, through studies, the properties that make these materials superior in water filtration applications.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Graphene and graphene oxide</title><p id="Par8">Studies on membranes based on graphene and its derivatives have burgeoned in the last few years because of their potential to enhance, if not replace, the performance of current water purification membranes. This can be attributed to the thinness, large surface area, vast array of tunable properties, pliability in terms of functionalization, mechanical strength, antimicrobial activity, and low density of graphene and its derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In pristine graphene, carbon atoms that are sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized are arranged in a hexagonal pattern in a single layer, about 0.34 nm thick [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The atomic-level thickness of the layers results in very thin laminar membranes with high flux, even thinner than the typical 100 nm polyamide active layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Additionally, graphene shows better resistance to chlorine compared to polyamide. In its pristine form, graphene is impermeable to water. This can be circumvented by introducing nanopores into the sheets, as demonstrated in a modelling study by Suk and Aluru. Water flux observed was greater than that of CNT when the pore diameter was larger than 0.8 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although other studies have corroborated the high water permeability values along with salt rejection via sieving through the nanopores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], fabrication of large, leak-free single layer graphene with controlled pore size and pore size distribution on an industrial scale remains an issue. On the other hand, graphene oxide (GO) is a derivative of graphene made by chemical oxidation and ultrasonic exfoliation of graphite and is easy to fabricate on a large scale. Depending on the degree of oxidation, GO consists of graphene sheets with hydroxyl, epoxide, carboxyl, and carbonyl groups in varying fractions, which increases the interlayer spacing to over 0.6 nm. These sheets can be easily stacked to form laminar structures held together by hydrogen bonding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Multilayer GO membranes are highly permeable to water because of the porous microstructure which includes the space between the edges of adjacent sheets, wide channels at wrinkles, and nanopores in the sheets. The latter contributes negligibly to multilayer structures. The selectivity of these membranes depends on the interlayer spacing, electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged sheets and ions, and ion adsorption effects like cation-π and metal coordination to the sheets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The major shortcoming of GO membranes, due to the presence of hydrophilic groups, is their uncontrollable swelling and instability on hydration, which largely increases the interlayer spacing and affects sieving ability. This can be controlled to an extent by reducing or chemically cross-linking the GO sheets, or stitching them to a polyamide layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Other shortcomings of GO multilayered membranes include low mechanical stability and low desalination capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Extensive work has been done on membranes based on graphene and its derivatives in the past decade. For detailed reviews of the same, the reader is directed to references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD)</title><p id="Par9">TMDs are a class of materials with the formula MX<sub>2</sub> where M is a transition metal element from groups IV, V or VI and X is S, Se or Te, i.e. chalcogens. These materials form laminar structures of the form X—M—X, with the chalcogen atoms in two hexagonal planes separated by a plane of metal atoms. Adjacent layers are held together by weak van der Waals forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. One TMD that has been extensively studied for applications in electronics, and more recently in membranes is MoS<sub>2</sub>. With the S atoms above and below the Mo plane, these layers are smooth due to the absence of functional groups unlike in GO, which can result in unimpeded water flow due to low hydraulic resistance. The absence of extruding hydrophilic functional groups also means that van der Waals forces dominate instead of weak electrostatic forces and lead to stability in aqueous media. As each sheet is made up of 3 atomic layers, MoS<sub>2</sub> is robust under pressure unlike GO where the nanochannels tend to undergo elastic deformation under pressure. Due to an abundance of S atoms, MoS<sub>2</sub> has highly negative zeta potential which imparts good dispersibility. There are numerous ways to obtain the 2D nanosheets of these materials, which have been discussed in detailed in refs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Laminar structured MoS<sub>2</sub> membranes can be fabricated for molecular separation. Sun et al. were the first to report such a membrane through vacuum filtration of chemically exfoliated MoS<sub>2</sub> sheets on to a polycarbonate porous support. The resulting membrane showed 3–5 times higher permeance than GO, with similar rejection performance for 3 nm sized molecules for the same membrane thickness. The thin sheets partially overlap leading to many empty spaces which serve as the nanochannels. These nanochannels were found to be unperturbed even under high pressure, unlike in GO where the nanochannels suffer elastic deformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Another study which corroborated these observations was conducted by Wang et al. An MoS<sub>2</sub> membrane was fabricated by vacuum filtration onto a PES porous support post organolithium intercalation and forced hydration. The interlayer spacing was 1.2 nm (free spacing 0.9 nm) post hydration, which remained unchanged even after soaking in water for 3 days. In comparison, the interlayer spacing of GO of similar thickness increased from 0.8 nm to 5.2 nm following excessive swelling. On drying, the interlayer spacing was 0.62 nm (free spacing 0.3 nm), same as that of bulk MoS<sub>2</sub> due to the restacking of the sheets, which makes it almost impermeable to water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Ries et al. reported stable MoS<sub>2</sub> free-standing membranes through covalent functionalization with acetamide, methyl, and ethyl-2-ol groups using organohalides. The membranes exhibited superior desalination and organic molecule rejection compared to GO based laminate membranes. Through molecular dynamics simulation of water flow in the nanochannels, the team observed that the water velocity is enhanced in methyl functionalized membrane compared to the pristine one. This was attributed to the pinning of water molecules right underneath the S atoms due to the interactions between highly polarized O–H and Mo-S bonds, which slowed the local velocity in the pristine MoS<sub>2</sub> membrane.</p><p id="Par12">On the other hand, the methyl groups substituted some of the pinning points and enhanced the overall velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. MoS<sub>2</sub> sheets with nanopores also hold the potential to work as desalination membranes. In a simulation study by Heiranian et al., a 0.2–0.6 nm<sup>2</sup> area pore in an MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayer could reject 88% ions and predict a pure water flux 2–3 times that of other nanoporous 2D materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Many other studies have been carried out with MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets- one group recently designed an MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets-silk nanofibril hybrid membrane inspired by nacre shell structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], another group developed a MoS<sub>2</sub>/GO hybrid membrane for dye and salt removal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Numerous studies have also reported the ability of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets to adsorb heavy metals from water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>MXenes</title><p id="Par14">MXenes (pronounced Maxenes) are a class of 2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides that were discovered in 2011 by researchers at Drexel University [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. MXenes have a general formula of M<sub>n+1</sub>X<sub>n</sub>T<sub>x</sub> (<italic>n</italic> = 1–3), where M, as an early transition metal (such as W, Mo, Cr, Ta, V, Nb, Hf, Zr, Ti, Y, or Sc), X is carbon and/or nitrogen, and T denotes the surface termination groups such as fluorine (–F), oxygen (–O), chlorine (–Cl) and hydroxyl (–OH), and x represents the number of surface functionalities. The surface functionalities are a result of the etching and exfoliation of the MAX phase generally in aqueous media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the precursor MAX phase, the A (Al or Si) layer is sandwiched within octahedral M<sub>n+1</sub>X<sub>n</sub>, where the strong M-X bond has a mixed covalent/metallic/ionic character whereas the weak M-A bond is metallic in nature. Exploiting the weak nature of the M-A bond, the A layers can be selectively etched out keeping the structure intact going from the 3D MAX phases to a 2D morphology. What makes MXenes stand out is the numerous possible combinations of transition metals. The goal is to find the stable ones, currently an area of great interest for researchers. Titanium based MXenes have been explored the most, such as Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub>, Ti<sub>2</sub>C<sub>1</sub>T<sub>x</sub> with nitrides, carbides and carbonitrides. Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> can be obtained, for example, by etching the MAX phase Ti<sub>3</sub>AlC<sub>2</sub> with hydrogen fluoride. The unique structure of MXenes imparts various characteristics such as high surface area, hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, high electrical conductivity, ease of functionalization. These properties make them ideal for use in energy storage applications, electronics, sensors, catalysis, environmental remediation, water purification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Like other 2D nanomaterials, MXenes can be used as a filler in polymeric composites, or directly as a membrane on top of a support layer. MXenes have also been shown to be antibacterial, good adsorbents, and have ultrafast water transport and ionic sieving abilities.</p><p id="Par15">Ren et al. created a Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> membrane though vacuum assisted filtration of its colloidal solution containing 1 nm thick sheets, on to a PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) support. The membrane showed greater selectivity for metal cations than GO. The ion selectivity was based on charge as well as the hydrated size of the ions, indicating the potential use of MXenes for water softening. MXenes are negatively charged. MXenes reject cations with hydration shell bigger than the interlayer spacing. MXenes can selectively aid ion permeation for cations which have a hydrated diameter smaller than the interlayer spacing such as Na<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. The Na<sup>+</sup> ions intercalate into the MXene gallery easily and get attached to the sheets on either sides, eventually leading the sheets covered with Na<sup>+</sup> to repel each other and slightly expands the gallery, resulting in higher permeation. On the other hand, for divalent and trivalent cations, the mechanism is slightly different. When these multivalent ions penetrate into the MXene gallery, there is a slight expansion in the gallery first, but as more multivalent ion enter the galley the electrostatic attraction between the cations and the negatively charged MXene sheets overtakes, tightening the gallery and slowing down the permeation of multivalent cations. Higher permeance was observed compared to GO membrane of the same thickness, which could be because of the narrow, uniform 2D nanochannels of 6.4 A<sup>0</sup>, due to the high aspect ratio of the sheets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Biofouling is a major problem in membrane filtration, which is why membrane materials that exhibit antibacterial properties are desired. In a study by Rasool et al., antibacterial action of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>Tx colloidal solution was observed against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis). The MXenes damaged bacterial cell membranes, releasing its cytoplasmic material. They were also found to have higher antibacterial activity than GO, for the same colloidal concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although it has been experimentally demonstrated that MXenes show antibacterial activity, the exact mechanisms for the same are still under active research. Rasool et al. observed that the bactericidal activity of MXenes is concentration dependent, and damages the bacterial cell membrane through direct penetration. This study does not however conclude on the contribution of reactive oxygen species, if any, on the bacteriocidal activity of MXenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Further, another work by Rsool et al. extended the above mentioned work to study the effect of MXene membrane aging on its bactericidal properties by keeping the membrane in ambient atmosphere for 1 month. Surprisingly, they observed enhanced bactericidal activity after aging the membrane, compared to the freshly made membranes. This was attributed to the formation of anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> and defective 2D carbon on aging of the MXene membrane, which along with the MXenes aid in physical penetration of the bacterial cell membrane.

The boron and nitrogen atoms are covalently bonded with a partial positive and partial negative charge on boron and nitrogen respectively and arranged alternatingly, in a hexagonal manner, in each (mono)layer. The nanosheets consist of a few hexagonal boron nitride layers with an interlayer spacing of 0.33 nm, held together by weak van der Waals forces. Due to the electronegativity difference, the electron pairs of the B-N σ bond are more confined towards nitrogen than boron. In the case of graphene, there is complete delocalization and equal sharing of the π electrons between the C atoms, whereas the lone pair of the p<sub>z</sub> orbital of nitrogen is only partially delocalized with that of boron, resulting in partial positive and negative charges on boron and nitrogen atoms respectively. This results in a stacking pattern where the B of each layer is between the N of the layers above and below it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Typically, exfoliated BN is in the form of flakes consisting of 2–5 monolayers, but can vary according to the synthesis, exfoliation and further functionalization routes. The lateral dimensions of the flakes are 100–300 nm, while the lateral size of bulk BN can be 2-10 µm. BN has a density of about 2.2 g/cc, a melting point of around 2800 ℃ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

Pristine BN is inherently hydrophobic in nature.</p><p id="Par19">BN possesses high chemical inertness and oxidative resistance due to its structure. 2D laminar membranes made by stacking BN flakes have numerous nanochannels with large surface area because of the flakes’ high length to thickness (aspect) ratio. The higher aspect ratio makes the nanochannels tortuous for contaminants. It also simultaneously increases the likelihood that the contaminants come in contact with the surface of the hBN flakes, to prevent or enhance their permeation through specific interactions, depending on the end requirement. The surface of BN is overall negatively charged, which has been attributed to the presence of adsorbed hydroxyl groups, according to Pendse et al. At a higher pH, an abundance of hydroxyl groups results in higher negative charge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

The excellent adsorption capacity has been attributed to the polarity of the B-N bond (which makes it particularly suitable for metal ion chemisorption), high specific surface area, and surface defects. A major advantage of BN as an adsorbent for organics is its high thermal stability, making the regeneration relatively easy by simply heating to high temperatures to burn the adsorbed organics, making it reusable. Additionally due to the inertness of hBN to harsh chemicals, substances adsorbed onto hBN can be removed by treated them with these harsh chemicals, while BN remains intact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

For membrane applications, a high yield of BN with large lateral dimensions is desired to stack the sheets to make galleries which create tortuous pathways for contaminants, as mentioned earlier. There are many methods for fabricating BN, including chemical vapor deposition, epitaxy, mechanical and chemical exfoliation. Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages. Chemical vapor deposition and epitaxy involve high temperatures and gaseous atmospheres which produce BN with inherent defects over which there is little control, but the number of layers and the dimensions over a large scale can be controlled in these methods. On the other hand, mechanical and chemical exfoliation, though relatively cost-effective and good for large scale production, have low yield and produce flakes with a broad size distribution and offer no control over the number of layers. Other techniques include pulsed laser deposition, physical vapor deposition and pyrolysis of boron and nitrogen containing compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

Modelling and simulations studies on water and ion transport through nanopores in the BN monolayers and through the interlayer spacing, have demonstrated enhanced transport performance. Simulation studies by Gorbanfekr et al. show that the water transport is faster between the layers of BN due to low friction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].

Since this review focuses on the experimental studies on filtration performance of BN based membrane architectures, only a few simulation studies are mentioned on the same. From the above studies, it can be concluded that the absence of functional groups lead to a friction free transport of water through the nanochannels made by stacking hBN sheets into a gallery, assuming non porous sheets. If the hBN sheets have pores, it can further aid in the transport of water by reducing the path traveled by the water molecules through the hBN gallery, while rejecting ions with hydration shell greater than the size of the nanopores. Further modification of the nanopores with functional groups such as hydroxyl or fluorine has been proposed to aid in the ion rejection through the nanopores through specific interactions between these and the ions.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>System of nanoconfined water molecules (red and white balls) between BN membranes (blue and pink balls) with nanometric interlayer distance <italic>h</italic> for typical <bold>a</bold> Density Functional Theory and <bold>b</bold> Molecular Dynamics supercells.

The porous nanosheets showed fast absorption kinetics and high mass uptake (up to 33 times their own weight for ethylene glycol) compared to other common adsorbents of oils and organic solvents. This has been attributed to adsorption, capillary effects, and intercalation because of the hydrophobic nature and polarity of the B-N bond. The porous nanosheets outperformed other absorbents for dye sorption as well. The absorbent was easily collected as the nanosheets floated on water and were regenerated by heating in air or solvent extraction, which were possible because of the excellent thermal and chemical stability of BN.

A 99.99% separation was obtained for oil/water emulsions, pharmaceuticals were filtered up to 14L/g and organic dyes up to 9.3L/g.

PVA was added to an aqueous dispersion of exfoliated BN, followed by ethyl benzoate, which resulted in a homogeneous emulsion post sonication. The BN sheets would adsorb at the liquid–liquid interface, form a rigid shell around the droplets, and prevent coalescence.

To demonstrate this, Zahirifar et al. incorporated BN into PVDF to develop a membrane for air-gap membrane distillation via non-solvent induced phase separation and BN was added to the casting solution.

Since a high temperature of 1100 ℃ was used for the synthesis, nitrogen, hydrogen chloride and ammonia gases are released from the decomposition of guanidine hydrochloride, which created pores of a few tens of nanometers in the boron nitride nanosheets over a micron in their lateral dimensions. Here, the porosity is due to the pores in the nanosheets as well as the spaces between the sheets themselves. After the oils and organic solvents were adsorbed from water, the group studied the XRD patterns of the BN adsorbent before and after the adsorption process. According to the XRD patterns, the interlayer spacing in the porous boron nitride nanosheets increases slightly as the oils and organic solvent molecules intercalate into interlayer spacing due to its porosity and inherent hydrophobicity. The percentage change in the interlayer spacing would depend on the adsorbate and the adsorbent-adsorbate affinity as well. Comparatively, the interlayer spacing of commercial bulk BN remains unchanged even after saturation with oil and organic solvent. This ability of porous BN to slightly swell and accommodate adsorbent molecules while still maintaining its structural stability has been correlated to its greater adsorption capacity compared to the commercial bulk BN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Liang, G. et al. came up with a creative route to synthesize a nanonet from BN nanofibers, with NH<sub>4</sub>BF<sub>4</sub> and NaN<sub>3</sub> as precursors while using CS<sub>2</sub> as a catalyst through a solvothermal process at 260 °C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

The nanospheres showed preferential adsorption for basic yellow 1, an aromatic dye molecule even in the presence of CuSO<sub>4</sub>, a heavy metal ion. This has been attributed to the specific non-covalent interaction between the aromatic rings and hBN, similar to the π-π interactions observed in graphene and its derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].

The activated BN had a ribbon like structure, which were porous and rough. The BN obtained here had a d-spacing of 0.35 nm, which is slightly greater than that of hBN (0.33 nm). The activated BN performed better than porous BN and activated carbon as well, in the case of adsorption of Co<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Pb<sup>2+</sup>, tetracycline, methyl orange and congo red. According to the group, the surfactant added during synthesis helped increase the surface area and pore volume and the adsorption ability, but the exact mechanism is yet to be elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Apart from the presence of functional groups, the number of defect sites and the degree of crystallinity also influences the performance of BN. Li, Jie, et al. synthesized BN fibres which was more crystalline in nature which they claim imparts stability to the adsorbent during the absorption–desorption process, compared to the activated BN using a surfactant in their previous work (discussed in the previous paragraph). They further activated these fibres with a mixture of sulphuric acid and nitric acid treatment, which created defects and functional groups at the edges of BN while maintaining its crystallinity mostly intact (as corroborated by their XRD plots and TEM micrographs) and increasing the absorption capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Rod like porous hBN has been synthesized by Song et al. for antibiotic adsorption, specifically tetracycline-based compounds here. The microporosity and mesoporous nature is concluded from the adsorption isotherms and the adsorption–desorption hysteresis curves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. hBN has been synthesized in various forms for adsorption of different antibiotics, and bisphenol A as well, which is a toxic substance prominent in the food packaging industries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">In the above-mentioned work, the different forms of BN were synthesized as a powder, and used as a powder for the adsorption experiments, which tends to agglomerate during adsorption and desorption, which can limit its performance. Hence, Jie Li et al. synthesized activated BN embedded with NaOH groups, in a 3D form to increase the surface area of interaction of the pollutants with the adsorbent, while maintaining structural stability. NaOH-3D BN was prepared to adsorb HCOH and simultaneously act as a support for its catalytic degradation. Its porous structure has been attributed to the interfacial spaces between the nanoflakes. HCHO removal on NaOH-3D BN were much higher than those of the NaOH-embedded commercially activated carbon and the NaOH-embedded activated BN. NaON-3D BN was regenerated just by using an electric hair dryer and retained its HCHO adsorption capacity of 90.5% for 15 cycles. The embedded NaOH converts the toxic HCHO to relatively less toxic methoxy and formate salts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">Yanming Xue et al., fabricated a boron nitride porous monolith (BNPM) for dye and heavy metal removal as well as oil–water separation. The group first prepared a boric acid-dissolved formaldehyde-dicyandiamide resin as the precursor in the form of a rod-like monolith, which was porous because of the gases formed during the resin solidification reaction, which bubbled through to escape and resulted in a porous precursor monolith. This precursor solid was then pyrolyzed above 1000 ℃ in ammonia atmosphere under ammonia flow to obtain a BN porous monolith. The BNPM showed excellent oil adsorption capacity and could be easily regenerated by burning the adsorbed organic substances in air. BNPM also showed high adsorption for rhodamine B dye and Copper (II) ions from water due the hydroxy and amine groups residing on the walls of micropores and holes of BNPM. The dye was removed from BNPM using ethanol. The group explained how the hierarchical structure enhances the adsorption of oil, dye, or organic molecules onto boron nitride. Although the boron nitride is in its turbostatic form, the concept of a hierarchical structure for adsorption can be applied for applied across different materials, and boron nitride in its hexagonal form as well. The macropores allow unrestricted pathways for pollutants to diffuse though. The large number of micropores then provide abundant surfaces for the pollutants to adsorb onto. Since boron nitride is inherently hydrophobic, the micropores allow oils to flow into and fill up the pores through capillary action. Next, the surface interaction plays the major role in adsorption of dye molecules and heavy metal ions. The pore walls, pore network, nodes and defects present in the structure of boron nitride, as well the functional groups (if any) influence the dye and heavy metal adsorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].

Due to the aggregation tendency of these powders during absorption process, their uptake could be hindered. To circumvent this, three-dimensional (3D) architectures can be made with 2D nanomaterials. These 3D architectures are lightweight, have very low densities, and can create hierarchical porous structures while retaining the inherent features of 2D nanomaterials. These 3D forms are also relatively easier to handle compared to the powder form of BN, that is, to deploy and recover because of their structural stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>].

The CS<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub> and NCNS gases released aided in the foaming. they obtained a low-density 3D WG foam with pore sizes ranging from a few nanometers to microns.

However, numerous challenges must be overcome to realize their full potential. The synthesis routes for fabricating most nanomaterials are complex, long-winded, and expensive, and often involve hazardous chemicals. For example, hydrogen fluoride is used to etch out Aluminium from the MAX phase of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In the case of BN, its chemical inertness is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it makes BN adsorbents easy to regenerate, prevents swelling and retains the sieving performance of laminar membranes in various solvents, but on the other hand renders the functionalization of BN quite difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. More effective, high-yielding methods of functionalization of BN are needed to alleviate these issues. When incorporated into a polymer matrix, aggregation of the nanomaterials presents a problem, which can be controlled by modifying the latter to aid matrix-filler interaction and dispersion. Laminar membranes formed by stacking these nanomaterials swell or disperse on hydration, which can affect the separation efficiency and durability. Unstable structures can also be leached out during filtration. Attaching additional functional groups, covalently cross-linking the sheets, and using the right porous support would solve these issues. Most filtration studies are conducted with a feed solution of one or few model micropollutants, which is far from the real feed water composition. Experiments, along with modelling and simulation studies must be carried out with complex feed matrices containing different types and levels of pollutants representative of the real compositions. This helps understand the selectivity of the 2D BN nanomaterials-based membrane for one pollutant in the presence of others.</p><p id="Par53">Although laminar membranes of 2D nanomaterials show high water permeance, their desalination capacity has not yet reached that of polyamide membranes. Their selectivity depends on the electrostatic interaction and size-based exclusion. Engineering the surface charge and the nanochannels according to the desalination needs without compromising on the water permeance, would lead to the ideal desalination membranes. Transport mechanisms in 2D nanomaterials is an attractive field of study, as there is lot more yet to be understood, through modelling and simulation studies aided by carefully designed experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Large scale, cost-effective manufacturing of defect-free BN nanomaterials with controlled dimensions, pore size and pore size distribution remains a challenge as quality of the material varies considerably across manufacturers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. The limited data on the environmental and health risks of engineered nanoparticles, although much less than perceived, can hinder plant operators and regulators from adopting nanomaterials-based products in treatment plants. Therefore, more studies must be conducted on the environmental impacts of each of these engineered nanomaterials, especially in the presence of other pollutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. From the review of the ongoing research efforts on BN nanomaterials, it can be concluded that BN nanomaterials possess remarkable potential in leading the new generation of water purification membranes and adsorbents, and it is worth investing our time and effort to overcome barriers to herald a new generation of architectures for efficient water purification.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>SA wrote the main manuscript text and prepared the figures SB: Gave critical inputs and insights to various section of this review.
