Though the light-harvesting and charge-separation functions of these proteins have been studied in depth, their potential as charge storage systems has not been investigated to the best of our knowledge. Here, we report prolonged storage of electrical charge in multilayers of photoproteins isolated from <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic>. Direct evidence for charge build-up within protein multilayers upon photoexcitation and external injection is obtained by Kelvin-probe and scanning-capacitance microscopies. Use of these proteins is key to realizing a ‘self-charging biophotonic device’ that not only harvests light and photo-generates charges but also stores them. In strong correlation with the microscopic evidence, the phenomenon of prolonged charge storage is also observed in primitive power cells constructed from the purple bacterial photoproteins. The proof-of-concept power cells generated a photovoltage as high as 0.45 V, and stored charge effectively for tens of minutes with a capacitance ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 F m<sup>−2</sup>.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Photosynthetic proteins are used to harvest solar energy in bio-photovoltaics, but are typically not investigated for charge storage.

In a general sense, the term biophotonic process refers to a phenomenon related to the interaction of biological matter with photons<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Some of the most widespread and impactful examples are the photophysical and photochemical processes that take place during the initial steps of photosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These involve the interaction of light-harvesting complexes with incoming photons to form pigment excited electronic states, ultrafast (picosecond time scale) energy transfer to efficiently move excited state energy to a reaction centre (RC) pigment–protein, and trapping of energy through photochemical charge separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Besides being the core biophysical processes in nature, the processes of energy harvesting, conversion, and storage underlie many existing energy technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In energy research, these three processes are usually realized separately through a modular device architecture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, with each requiring optimization and effective interfacing to achieve a high overall efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Typically, solar, thermal, chemical, or mechanical energy harvested through a variety of mechanisms is converted into electrical energy and, if not used directly, stored using a capacitor or a battery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. As there are losses involved at each stage, considerable efforts have gone into the development of hybrid systems where two or more of the three processes are combined. In some cases, energy harvesting and conversion systems might be one and the same, but devices typically have a distinct system performing the energy storage function. An emerging example of a hybrid system is the “self-charging” power cell or supercapacitor, the basic function of which is to harvest and convert ambient energy into electricity and continuously charge a battery or capacitor to ensure a sustainable supply of power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The majority of these power cells are based on piezoelectric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> or triboelectric<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> nanogenerators that harvest ambient (bio)mechanical energy and store converted energy in supercapacitors or batteries. Fewer attempts have been made to develop self-charging power cells that harvest light energy, these mainly involving the hybridization of dye-sensitized solar cells with supercapacitors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Hybrid devices have also been described in which Li-ion batteries are photocharged by perovskite solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and recently a hybrid self-charging power cell was reported that combined a photoelectrochemical cell with a redox-flow battery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. These hybrid power cells typically contain a light-harvesting/conversion system and an electrical energy storage system combined into a single-device architecture, sometimes with a common electrode.</p><p id="Par5">On studying the light harvesting and charge transport properties of a purple bacterial photosynthetic protein, multilayers of the protein are able to store the photo-generated charges for a long time spanning tens of minutes. Investigating the origin of this phenomenon and demonstrating the implication this can have for energy research formed the basis of this work. Microscopic and macroscopic evidence of this phenomenon are presented using Kelvin-probe force microscopy (KPFM), scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM), photochronopotentiometry, cyclic voltammetry (CV), and galvanostatic charge–discharge studies.</p><p id="Par6">Exploiting the “prolonged charge storage” behavior, we construct photoprotein-based biophotonic power cells (BPCs, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) in which the light harvesting, energy conversion, and charge storage processes are integrated within a single, multifunctional material. This has been realized through the use of a pigment–protein complex from a natural bacterial photosystem that absorbs energy across the solar spectrum and transiently stores harvested energy through charge separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Such photosystems either in the form of isolated protein complexes or as whole bacterial cells are increasingly studied for biophotovoltaic and bioelectronic applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The particular photoprotein used, the so-called PufX-deficient RC-light harvesting 1 (RC-LH1) complex from the photosynthetic bacterium <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> (<italic>Rba</italic>.) <italic>sphaeroides</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), is an integral membrane pigment–protein made up from a central RC domain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, c</xref>, cyan) surrounded by a cylindrical LH1 antenna complex (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, d</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Following the absorption of solar energy by the bacteriochlorophylls (BChls) and carotenoids of the LH1 domain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), the key energy conversion event is a four-step electron transfer between a pair of BChl molecules (P) at one end of the RC protein and a ubiquinone molecule (Q<sub>B</sub>) at the opposite end (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. This forms a charge-separated state (P<sup>+</sup>Q<sub>B</sub><sup>−</sup>) around 1 μs after photoexcitation that is stable for a few seconds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). To fabricate a simple device that generates and stores the photogenerated charges, films of concentrated photoprotein of varying thickness are sandwiched between a transparent fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass front-electrode and an n-doped silicon (n-Si) back electrode (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e, f</xref>).

This enabled formation of a protein multilayer of regular area and thicknesses between 0.1 and 2 mm. After partially drying the protein under a vacuum a precleaned n-type silicon counter electrode was sandwiched with the protein-coated FTO electrode and the cell was sealed. The result was a densely packed protein multilayer formed in the absence of any additional electrolyte to act as a charge carrier. For reference, a single RC-LH1 complex has a maximum diameter of ~13 nm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> which means that a closely packed, 0.1 mm-thick multilayer should be the equivalent of a minimum of ~7700 stacked protein monolayers, and ~154,000 monolayers for a 2 mm film.

This can be attributed to multiple oxidation or reduction events within individual complexes and/or propagation of trapped electrons or holes deeper into the multilayer through slow interprotein electron transfer. Regarding the former, it has been estimated from electrochemical titrations that an LH1 ring can store up to eight BChl cations without undergoing irreversible photo-oxidative damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>, and multiple negative charges can be accumulated on the quinone and bacteriochlorin cofactors of the RC when the rate of reduction of the photo-oxidized RC by an external donor exceeds the rate of charge recombination or quinone oxidation by an external acceptor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In addition, RCs contain a single dissociable Q<sub>B</sub> ubiquinone that can undergo double reduction, the second reduction being accompanied by double protonation, and preparations of RC-LH1 complexes typically contain 10–15 molecules of ubiquinone in the space between the RC and the surrounding LH1 ring that can exchange with the quinone at the Q<sub>B</sub> site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. As a result it is plausible that a single RC-LH1 complex could accumulate more than one positive or negative charge if adjacent to an electrode that can act as an acceptor/donor. Regarding charge propagation, as RCs undergo charge separation under illumination, each can be treated as an electric dipole. In an ideal scenario where all dipoles were aligned with positive ends facing one electrode and negative ends facing the other, charge storage in the device could be possible without any transport mechanism in the active layer. However, since such a device configuration with perfectly aligned dipoles is unrealistic for proteins assembled into a multilayer, charge storage in the device is likely to also rely on the transport of charges between complexes in those layers closest to the surface of either electrode. It is highly probable that interprotein interfaces in the device act as charge localization sites allowing charges to hop from one state to other before they reach the electrodes. Incoherent hopping of charge carriers from site to site is known to be a dominant transport mechanism in disordered systems and has also been studied previously in photosynthetic systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Such gradual penetration of long-lived trapped charges into the photoactive protein multilayer through electron hopping between adjacent proteins could also be a factor in the slow discharge of the photovoltage on terminating the illumination period. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Although not of the same nature as the capacitive origin of voltage build-up in dry protein multilayers in this device, trends of slow photoresponse have been previously observed in liquid biophotoelectrochemical cells despite the addition of electron transport mediators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, where slow rise and decay in photovoltage were the direct effect of slow electrolyte diffusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">It should be noted that while charge transport could play an important role in the build-up of a charge difference between electrodes, it is crucial that long-range transport from one electrode to the other is avoided as this would counteract the charge storage ability of the BPC. In an ideal dielectric capacitor, there will not be any charge transport through the device and the charge storage is achieved purely by the accumulation of charges at the electrode/dielectric interface. In the BPCs the protein layers in the center of the device therefore serve the function of an insulating layer that enables the build-up of charge at the electrode/protein interfaces.</p><p id="Par12">A factor in the use of RC-LH1 complexes as a material for charge storage is that it is known from experiments employing conductive atomic force microscopy that individual complexes conduct electrical current under an applied bias<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Such experiments typically interrogate a monolayer of protein oriented on a conductive surface, and it has been suggested that electron tunneling across an LH complex is facilitated by the carotenoid cofactors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. However, multilayers of these proteins, arranged randomly with respect to an applied bias, would not be expected to conduct electrical current over a long range. Given this, a possible reason that the photovoltage supported by an RC-LH1 multilayer increased as its thickness increased up to 500 µm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) is that the effective resistance of the multilayer also increased, enabling the build-up of a larger potential difference. Such an explanation seems more plausible than positing that thicker layers produced higher voltages because they were more absorbing, as photochemical activity leading to trapped charges would be expected to be confined to a minority of the structure comprising (probably several) protein layers close to either electrode, rather than the entire thickness of the multilayer. The decrease in photovoltage achieved by films thicker than 500 µm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) is attributed to poor light penetration to the n-Si back electrode and its adjacent RC-LH1 proteins that lessens the accumulation of negative charge at this interface.</p><p id="Par13">The <italic>Rba. sphaeroides</italic> RC-LH1 photosynthetic complex is modular (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b–d</xref>), and the RC and LH1 proteins can be purified as separate, functional entities (absorbance spectra shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). BPCs formed from isolated RCs or LH1 complexes also generated a photovoltage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). On comparing charge–discharge characteristics for 500 μm protein films, it was found the photovoltage reached at the end of a standard 200 s illumination was the highest for the combined RC-LH1 complex and lowest for the LH1 protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>). The light harvesting capacity of isolated RCs is limited to its six bacteriochlorins and one carotenoid (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), but each RC-LH1 complex has an additional 32 BChl and 32 carotenoid light-harvesting pigments (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b, d</xref>). The lower photovoltage achieved by a film of RCs is therefore likely attributable to a strongly diminished light harvesting capacity even though, as they are smaller than an RC-LH1 complex, the concentration of RCs in a packed multilayer would be expected to be greater. Although the pigment content of the isolated LH1 antenna protein is closer to that of RC-LH1 complexes, the absence of the RC means that light harvesting is not translated into a meta-stable charge separation, but rather energy is lost as emission and heat. Nevertheless, a photovoltage is still obtained because LH1 is capable of acting in a manner akin to an organic semiconductor, injecting excited electrons into the FTO electrode and becoming positively charged, or receiving electrons from the n-Si electrode and becoming negatively charged (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). However, the number of photo-accumulated charges is likely lower than in RC or RC-LH1 complexes because the lifetime of the LH1 excited state (estimated as 680 ps at room temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>) is very short relative to the 1–5 s lifetime of the charge-separated state formed in RC and RC-LH1 complexes.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photocharging and dark discharging of photoprotein films. <bold>a</bold> Bulk charge–discharge characteristics of 500 μm films of three different photoproteins namely, reaction centres (RC), light harvesting 1 complexes (LH1) and reaction centre-light harvesting 1 complexes (RC-LH1), exposed to 100 s illumination. <bold>b</bold>–<bold>d</bold> KPFM (Kelvin-probe force microscopy) surface potential maps of <bold>b</bold> RC, <bold>c</bold> LH1, and <bold>d</bold> RC-LH1 films before, during and after a 2 min period of illumination; scale bars denote 200 nm. <bold>e</bold>–<bold>g</bold> Changes in surface potential before, during and after a 2 min period of illumination of <bold>e</bold> RC, <bold>f</bold> LH1, and <bold>g</bold> RC-LH1 films</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2019_8817_Fig4_HTML.png"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Kelvin-probe microscopy to assess potential build-up and decay</title><p id="Par14">Charging and discharging of the different types of BPC were further investigated by recording the surface potentials of the three types of protein film by KPFM.

In good accord with the trend in overall device photovoltage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>), the averaged surface potential shift (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e–g</xref>) was highest for the RC-LH1 films (~30 mV) and lower for LH1 or RC films (~15 mV). The time for relaxation of the surface potential shift was also longest for RC-LH1 films (~15 min) and shortest for RC films (~3 min) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e–g</xref>). These relaxation times of minutes confirmed that the potential shifts were due to the photogeneration of trapped charges rather than photochemistry within individual proteins, where relaxation occurs in a few seconds.</p><p id="Par15">The KPFM and macroscopic photovoltage measurements indicated that all three proteins can generate and store charge.

The phenomenon unveiled not only casts new light on the photonic and electronic properties of the photosynthetic proteins but also presents a promising application in energy research. Looking to future developments, a key feature of the BPCs described in this report was the use of protein multilayers to generate the photovoltage and store charges. As these films were fabricated by simply drop-casting a concentrated solution of detergent-solubilized protein into a pre-formed well it is to be expected that individual proteins had a random orientation within the multilayer. One way to possibly boost the photovoltages obtained may be to control the orientation of individual RC-LH1 proteins throughout the multilayer such that there is alignment of the dipoles created between the P and Q<sub>B</sub> termini of the RC on photoexcitation. Large photovoltages obtained from micron thick crystals of the Photosystem I (PSI) RC from <italic>Pisum sivatum</italic> (pea) in response to strong (1.1 W cm<sup>−2</sup>) 660 nm laser excitation have been attributed to a superposition of photoinduced dipoles across uniformly oriented PSI proteins within the crystal lattice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. In the present case, imposing a uniform alignment on the RC-LH1 complexes within a film could both maximize desired redox interactions at each electrode surface (i.e., Q<sub>B</sub> oxidation at the FTO-glass anode or P<sup>+</sup> reduction at the n-Si cathode) and align the dipoles created across individual RC-LH1 complexes, both of which could potentially lead to a higher photovoltage. However, it is worth noting that achieving such control over protein orientation in a thick, multilayer film is challenging, and an attractive feature of the unoriented protein films used in the present work is their simplicity of fabrication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Biological materials</title><p id="Par20">Integrated power cells were prepared using either the PufX-deficient RC-LH1 complex from the purple photosynthetic bacterium <italic>Rba. sphaeroides</italic> or the component RC or LH1 proteins.
