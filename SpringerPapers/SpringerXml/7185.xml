Despite the success, the lack of understanding of the detailed mechanisms of actions, and the achievements of antibiotics, phased off the use of UBI from the 1950s. The emergence of novel viral infections, from HIV/AIDS to Ebola, from SARS and MERS, and SARS-CoV-2, bring back the attention to this therapeutical opportunity. UBI has a complex virucidal activity, mostly acting on the immune system response. It has effects on lymphocytes (T-cells and B-cells), macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and lipids. The Knott technique was applied for bacterial infections such as tuberculosis to viral infections such as hepatitis or influenza. The more complex extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) is also being applied to hematological cancers such as T-cell lymphomas. Further studies of UBI may help to create a useful device that may find applications for novel viruses that are resistant to known antivirals or vaccines, or also bacteria that are resistant to known antibiotics.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>UV light</kwd><kwd>UBI</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>Blood cells</kwd><kwd>Antigen-presenting cells</kwd><kwd>Viral infections</kwd><kwd>Cytokines</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/12016_2020_Article_8811.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Medicine &amp; Public Health</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Allergology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Immunology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Internal Medicine</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Medicine</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The interaction of light with matter such as proteins, molecules, and atoms, as well as biological samples from viruses to bacteria and cells, is at the core of many fundamental sciences and methods currently used in diagnostics and therapeutics.

The UV germicidal action is a well-known method for killing or inactivating microorganisms by damaging their nucleic acids and unsetting their DNA.

In the case of UBI, the principle of action is different from far-UV, as UV is acting mostly as an enhancer of the immune system rather than a direct killer of the viruses. UBI exposes the blood to UV light to amplify the immune system response and kill the viruses. The ways UBI acts on the immune system are everything but well established, the same as the antiviral effects. The many far past experiences demonstrated the technique was helpful for many pathologies; however, it was administered without a clear detailed understanding of the mechanisms of action.</p><p id="Par9">Viruses absorb much more energy than the red and white blood cells and get more damaged by UV light. The killed viral fragments create a vaccination-like response. This strengthens the immune system response to the specific pathogen. This may explain why treating only a small amount of blood with UBI may induce a significant immune system response. UBI is in principle an immune-modulating therapy, which may help also with viral infections. It has never been tested so far for SARS-CoV-2.</p><p id="Par10">This work aims to review the literature concerning the uses of UV light that could be beneficial for SARS-CoV-2 infection, in air, but especially through the blood via UBI. The more complex extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), which is under certain aspects an evolution of the Knott UBI being applied to hematological cancers such as T-cell lymphomas, is here only mentioned, but not discussed into details. The mechanism of action of ECP is also not completely understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. It is believed that a combination of psoralen and UVA radiation causes apoptosis (programmed cell death) of some of the affected T cells, which returned to the body, trigger the immune system to recognize antigens on the T cells and destroy them. The less-damaged monocytes phagocytose apoptotic T cells. Monocytes exposed to radiation progress into dendritic cells that diminish the immune response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Direct UV Antiviral Effects in Air</title><p id="Par11">UV light has significant effects on airborne viruses. Far-UV is capable to deactivate viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. UV has shown effects on the sterilization of materials. The use of ultraviolet light against airborne disinfection was first demonstrated more than 8 decades ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Far-UVC may become effective against all types of airborne viruses including new strains. It may also reduce the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses. It may work against SARS-CoV-2. Airborne-induced microbial diseases such as tuberculosis may also be targeted. An approach to stop airborne pathogen spread with UVC radiation is being established. The airborne antimicrobial efficacy of UV light has long been recognized through a direct method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Germicidal UV light is capable of inactivating both drug-sensitive and multi-drug-resistant bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and different strains of viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Despite the importance, the use of germicidal ultraviolet light among the public remains limited because of the phototoxicity of the conventional UVC light which is carcinogenic and cataractogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In contrast, low-power far-UVC light with a wavelength from 207 to 222Â nm efficiently deactivates viruses and bacteria without damaging the skin or the eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Due to its short wavelength, far-UVC light does not penetrate the nonliving outer layers of the human skin or eyes, while since the sizes of the bacteria and the viruses are much smaller (as previously written, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is 60 to 100Â nm in diameter), far-UVC light can penetrate and inactivate such small organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">The germicidal efficacy studies of far UVC light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], were performed by exposing bacteria on a surface or in suspension to the irradiation. A major pathway for the spread of influenza A virus is through aerosol transmission. The same is true for SARS-CoV-2. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], far-UVC light of 222-nm wavelength efficacy used to inactivate airborne viruses carried by aerosols was also compared to conventional 254-nm germicidal lamps used to inactivate airborne microbes. The 222-nm far-UVC light was used to deactivate the influenza A virus (H1N1) carried by aerosols using a UV irradiation chamber. The chamber generated aerosol droplets like those generated by human coughing and breathing. The aerosolized viruses in the irradiation chamber were exposed to UVC lamps.</p><p id="Par13">Inactivation of H1N1 with the 222-nm far-UVC light followed an exponential disinfection model, with an inactivation cross section of D<sub>95</sub>Â =Â 1.6Â mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. For a comparative study, using a similar experimental procedure with a standard 254Â nm germicidal UVC lamp, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] identified a D<sub>95</sub> value of 1.1Â mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> for the H1N1 virus. A 222-nm far-UVC light and 254-nm broad-spectrum germicidal light had similar results for aerosolized viral inactivation, with the advantage that far-UV is not harmful to humans. Both regions of the spectrum were found to be effective in the inactivation. The exact cause of inactivation may not be identical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Opposite to standard germicidal broad-spectrum UVC light of 254-nm wavelength, far-UVC light is not cytotoxic to human cells/tissues in vitro or in vivo [10â12]. Thus, spreading the SARS-CoV-2 virus in open spaces such as halls occupied by a large number of peoples could be prevented safely by using this technique.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Direct and Indirect UV Antiviral Effects in Blood</title><p id="Par14">In addition to the use of the antiviral properties in the air mentioned above, the UV UBI is certainly a fascinating opportunity to work against viral infections in patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This technique has been popular, but then it has been forgotten in time. UBI was already used 80Â years ago on a routine basis to treat numerous diseases. These diseases included asthma, septicemia, tuberculosis, pneumonia, arthritis, and poliomyelitis. The discovery of antibiotics of higher commercial values and the poorly understood mechanisms of action of UBI overlooked the benefits of UBI. The initial studies were performed by numerous physicians in the USA starting from 1928. Then, studies were also conducted by scientists in Russia and East European countries when the technique was dismissed in the West during the 1950s. The use of UBI remains mostly controversial. Due to the development and usefulness of antibiotics, the application of UBI declined rapidly. Although very crucial, it has now been almost completely forgotten. However, UBI is an attractive approach to treat infections. This is used as a therapy for immune-modulation and as a parameter for normalizing the blood parameters. The resistance of microorganisms in the blood to UV irradiation is not fully understood. A low and mild dose of UV is effective in killing microorganisms by inhibiting their DNA synthesis. The important observation is that any type of DNA damage in the host cells is repaired by the DNA repair enzymes. But, it is understood that the action of UBI to manage septicemia is not due to UV-induced killing of bacteria in the blood only. An approximately 5â7% of blood is necessary for the treatment with UV to have the optimum benefit. UBI enhances the phagocytic ability of numerous neutrophils and dendritic cells, inhibits lymphocytes, and oxidizes the blood lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, the oxidative power of UBI has mechanisms in common with other therapies such as ozone therapy or oxygen therapy. Similarities between ECP with psoralens and UBI also exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. But, significant differences between UBI and ECP are found in their mode of action. For example, UBI stimulates the immune system, while the ECP process is immunosuppressive.

This process involved removing approximately 3.5Â mL/kg of venous blood, citrating it as an anticoagulant, and then passing it through a radiation chamber. The exposure time per unit of blood was selected at 10Â s. The wavelength of light was set at 253.7Â nm. The UVC was obtained by a quartz burner of mercury. The blood was re-perfused as quickly as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

Although known for the past 90Â years, the detailed description of the mechanisms of action UBI is not available yet. Therefore, there has been always confusion in the use of this radiation for medical purposes. As stated before, UV demonstrated effects in the sterilization of water and surgical instruments. On this basis, it was believed that the use of UV against infection also depended on the direct destruction of the pathogens. Confusion also exists since UBI was used to treat a wide diversity of diseases.</p><p id="Par18">The UBI is capable of altering many properties of blood as well as leukocytes as demonstrated by in vitro results. For example, the UVI increases the percentage of stimulating cells in leukocytes and controls mitogen-induced media. Importantly, the UVI can reverse the production of cytokine and block its release. It also disturbs cell membrane stabilization. The UBI has numerous effects on red blood cells. Anaerobic situations can inhibit the process because UV light can induce the removal of potassium ion from the cells. Kabat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] had proved that UV radiation can alter the osmotic characteristics of red blood cells, their submicroscopic structures, and the breakdown of specific nucleotides. Different irradiation periods ranging from 1 to 5Â h were chosen to investigate these roles. This study showed that a decreased value of ATP increases the values of other nucleotides. The UV radiation also increased the hypotonic sodium and potassium cation values and the ratio of the red blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Irradiation of Rh-positive blood with UV light increases the immune adsorption activity. To identify the immune absorption activity, a varying degree of UV irradiation was applied to the cells of red blood and leukocyte-thrombocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Immunoabsorption activity was increased spontaneously when irradiation was conducted in these systems. But, this was not a permanent effect since this property was decreased in the leucocyte system after 2Â days.</p><p id="Par20">Poly-dextran was used to determine the decreased level of erythrocytes of the cell surfaces during UV irradiation. This helped transfused erythrocytes for better survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. To identify the superior effect of auto-transfused blood after the exposure of UV irradiation, modifications of the structures of the erythrocytes was helpful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].

It has been found that a small dose of UV (0.1Â J/cm<sup>2</sup>) enhances the concentration of hydrogen peroxide by the biggest polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The function of UBI through the assistance of neutrophils to accelerate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be stopped using numerous molecules including arachidonic acid, lysophosphatidylcholine, and Î±-tocopherol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The high amount of IC-IgG and IgM or low IC-IgM demonstrated an opposite property in inflammatory diseases when an increased UBI was given to auto-transfusion blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Due to the iNOS enzyme triggering, the production of nitric oxide (NO) by neutrophils was realized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. A fresh synthesis of NO is possible of UV irradiation, and this method generates TNF-alpha. UV irradiation with a small dose of 75.5Â J/m<sup>2</sup> maintained the physiological homeostasis. A high dose of 755 to 2265Â J/m<sup>2</sup> given to neutrophils caused damage by enhancing the amount of the breakdown product of NO. Cycloheximide because of its protein inhibition properties can stop the activation of iNOS and NO in the presence of UV irradiation. A direct relationship exists between NO and TNF-alpha concentration, and this can be found from experiments on a high dose of UV-irradiation (755Â J/m<sup>2</sup>) against neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">An experiment on UV for 30Â days was performed in rabbits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. It was seen that the generated chronic stress is due to a combination of hydrodynamic and UBI affecting neutrophils and eliminating coagulation. UBI helped to improve the bodyâs performance against hydrodynamic and unpredictable stress. UBI helped to enhance the organization and process structure in the activation of neutrophils stopped the coagulation of blood and changed the atherogenic condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">UBI has effects on lymphocytes, T-cells, and B-cells. UBI generally helps to decrease lymphocyte viability. The UVC irradiation is believed to be the most efficient among three UV spectral ranges. The cell budding activity can be stopped by the UVB and UBC radiation. These radiations can also minimize antigen-producing ability of the component of the cells. Numerous properties including cell-surface interaction, calcium mobilization method, cytokine production/release, and a few sub-cellular processes can be modified by UV irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The âComet assayâ was used to identify DNA-strand breakage because of single-cell gel electrophoresis. This was an evidence of DNA repair, indicating that lymphocytes were highly fragile to this UVB irradiation.

The photoirradiation is not seen. However, a significant number of T-cells are killed within 48 to 72Â h with a low dose of UVB irradiation (LD50 0.5â1Â mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. A compatible dose-dependent reduction of cytokinesis noted after 3Â days of irradiation. This is because of a direct relationship between the loss of viability and the production of cytokine. Interestingly, the pattern and ratio of CD4 and CD8 are not altered compared to the non-radiated control group. This suggests that the T-cell subsets were not selectively affected.</p><p id="Par27">The UV irradiation is capable of inducing phosphorylation of tyrosine in B cells through a cross-attachment with the immunoglobulin of the surface. This observation is, in fact, similar to the production of calcium ion in T cells. On this basis, it indicates that UV irradiation of lymphocytes activates phosphorylation of tyrosine and calcium ion signals. Therefore, the calcium ion channels in the membrane of the lymphocytes are affected due to UV irradiation. This irradiation destroys DNA by activating cellular signal-transduction pathways. On the other hand, based upon the dose, the UV irradiation activates phosphorylation of tyrosine in lymphocytes and controls calcium ion signal in Jurkat T cells. Moreover, the picture immunoglobulin of the surface remains identical to the UV-promoted tyrosine phosphorylation in B cells. It is shown that CDÂ +Â and CD8Â +Â T cells can react during UV irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Following a similar study, Spielberg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] showed that UV-induced lymphocyte inhibition indicated an alteration of calcium ion homeostasis when comparing UV with gamma irradiation. Gamma radiation has different properties on lymphocyte membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Besides, the presence of calcium channels in the membrane of lymphocyte can be found by the indo-1 staining and cytofluorometry technique. Intracellular calcium ion [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i kinetics was estimated in human peripheral blood leukocytes during UVC or UB irradiation. Jurkat cells were used as a standard in this functional assay. The UV-induced concentration increase of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i was mainly possible because of incoming of extracellular calcium. The T-cells were more affected than non-T-cells due to this process. The concentration of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i was increased within 2 to 3Â h of irradiation. A dose-dependent behavior was observed in this experiment, and a maximum point was reached for both UVB and UVC. UV induced a significant [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i growth in T-cells than in non-T cells, and this increase is because of the activity of the extracellular calcium. The intensity of UV irradiation on the plasma membrane decreased its sensitivity to react with certain lectins (phytohemagglutinin) in the cultures of mixed leukocytes.</p><p id="Par29">Several studies indicated that lymphocytes irradiated by UVR were unable to create genetically different cells in lymphocyte culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].

A specific amount of total body irradiation and donor marrow cells in the presence of blood was used for this experiment. This in vivo test was conducted in dogs. The control group of animals that was permeated with blood failed to accept the bone marrow grafts. But, acceptance was seen in the group that was given UV-mediated blood before the transplantation.

The ACI rats received Lewisâs heart, and it was transfused with donor type of blood in the presence or absence of UV irradiation at different weeks period. The occurrence of a lymphocyte reaction indicated that the ACI group was weaker compared to Lewis counterpart. A consistent result was observed in the other two groups.

A mixture of irradiated and non-irradiated blood was examined for PhA functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. This study indicated an increase of 1.4â1.7 times of PhA. This suggests that monocytes and granulocytes can be improved by mixing UV-irradiated blood to people.

Consequently, non-responsiveness was noted when UV-LC or UV-SAC are mixed with Th1 cells. It should be noted that the loss of responsiveness was not because of the generation of soluble suppressor factors. This was long-lasting, Ag-specific, and MHC-restricted. This finding was explained due to the failure of a costimulatory signal which was possible by UVB irradiation. This explanation was supported because UVB-LC or UVB-SAC did not help unresponsiveness.</p><p id="Par38">UBI has effects on platelets. Low UV doses are associated with low hydrogen peroxide production in platelets. The hydrogen peroxide production increases as the dose increase above 0.4Â J/cm<sup>2</sup>. Pamphilon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>] demonstrated that platelet concentrates (PC) become non-immunogenic following UVR and 5Â days of storage in sterilized cell containers.

But, the glucose level becomes lower with a 3000Â J/m<sup>2</sup> irradiation dose of 310Â nm mean wavelength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. UVB irradiation of PC decreases the CD14 and increases the loss of monocytes. This observation may be due to an inhibition process that up-regulates ICAM-1 and HLA-DR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].

The UV irradiation is relevant to lipid peroxidation of blood cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. This occurred at the membrane of the cells. UV irradiation of blood can activate arachidonic acid to get metabolized by cyclooxygenase. This process can initiate the lipid autoperoxidation towards free radicals and the photolysis of the photooxidants. The lipid photoperoxidation method produces lipid hydroperoxides.</p><p id="Par40">UV-irradiated lipid emulsion increases ROS by monocytes. This process creates greatly atherogenic oxidized LDL in the blood. Rabbits were injected with a UV light-oxidized parenteral lipid emulsion, lipofundin. Then, blood samples were taken with EDTA after a specific time of the lipofundin treatment. The UV-oxidized lipofundin showed reduced chemiluminescence from monocytes relative to a Fe<sup>3+</sup>-oxidized lipofundin. But, the effect of lipofundin treated with UV light lasted 2.3 times longer. UV-oxidized lipofundin can effectively activate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production than monocyte-oxidized LDL under identical conditions. The lipid peroxide amount was increased after the injection of oxidized lipofundin.

The TBARS method was used to identify the photooxidation of tryptophan which is associated with the peroxidation of low-density and high-density lipoprotein unsaturated fatty acids. UVB is also able to destroy vitamin E and carotenoids. But, UVA radiation is unable to destroy tryptophan.</p><p id="Par42">The lipoproteins contained in the suction blister fluid of healthy humans were oxidized by UV radiation of 290 to 385Â nm wavelength. This experiment well simulates the interstitial fluid feeding of the epidermal cells. It was found that apolipoprotein B of LDL and apolipoprotein A-I and II of HDL undergone modifications underneath UV irradiation. Similar irradiation with wavelengths 290 to 385Â nm modified the Trp (tryptophan) residue of serum albumin required to photo-oxidation. UVA irradiation of undiluted suction blister fluid produced A-I aggregation. The lipoproteins were not broken. UV irradiation of suction blister fluid was able to make a fragment of antigenic apolipoprotein B, and then, it was polymerized. Reactive oxygen radicals in the suction blister fluid resulted from the lipid peroxidation occurred in the HDL. UV light irradiation may be relevant to produce inflammation and degeneration by inducing photo-oxidation of lipoprotein. This may lead to systemic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">The redox status of this system is important. It is discovered that, depending on the dose, the UV irradiation can stimulate the myeloperoxidase (MPO) and the NADPH-oxidase enzymes in donor blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Two doses of UV light chosen were75.5 and 151.0Â J/m<sup>2</sup>. The higher dose triggered much more free radicals and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Two groups were divided based on MPO function and UV light dose. In group 1, the low enzyme activity increased following UV exposure at 75.5 and 151.0Â J/m<sup>2</sup>. In group 2, the MPO activity conversely decreased. Increasing the dose, the activity of MPO did not increase. Lipid peroxidation (LPO) was also evaluated after UV exposure of the blood. Two groups were separated based on the blood content of LPO products and the dose of UV exposure. UV irradiation at low concentration (75.5â151.0Â J/m<sup>2</sup>) decreased initially the high LPO values but increased initially low LPO values. In phagocytes, NADPH-oxidase works as a photo-acceptor for UV light. Irradiation produces augmented superoxide production and decreased intracellular pH activating an enzyme complex. UBI may prevent damage by free radicals by improving the activity of numerous antioxidants. After spinal cord injury in rabbits, 186 rabbits were divided into control, blood transfusion, injured, and UV treatment groups. UV irradiation of wavelength 253.7Â nm and dose 5.68Â mW/m<sup>2</sup> was used for the treatment group over 48 to 72Â h following surgery for spinal cord injury. Measurements were taken of free radical signals (FR) as well as enzymatic activity of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX). It has been found that superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase became higher in the treatment group. But, the FR and MDA of this group decreased compared to the other subdivisions. This suggests that UBI decreased the content of MDA and FR in the spinal cord tissue. These two factors also responsible for higher SOD activity and increased GSH-PX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">The mechanisms of UBI have always created confusion for the general public and medical professionals. It is because germicidal UV light (UVC) is employed to maintain the sanity of many items. It is used to sterilize water, or disinfect surfaces, to control infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, many believe that the UBI acts by killing the pathogens, bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that may be present in the body. But, no evidence supports this belief. Therefore, the mechanisms of action of UBI must be found through some other actions UV has on the various components of blood. Of course, the mechanisms of action of UBI are many and complex. After having proposed some of the ways UBI affects the various components of the blood, we attempt to draw a few general conclusions. First, UBI exemplifies âhormesisâ or âbiphasic dose-responseâ techniques. This phenomenon is well-reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. In principle, any toxic chemical substance, any toxic drug, or any other attack, such as ionizing radiation, hyperthermia, or oxidative stress, may become beneficial, protective, and therapeutic, if the dose is low enough. If the dose is high, the benefits or effects may disappear. This is established in the Knottâs original experiments on dogs where only 5 to 7% of the total blood volume was the optimal amount irradiated.</p><p id="Par45">UBI may have three different types of effects on different types of blood. In the case of neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells, UBI activates phagocytosis, increases the secretion of NO and reactive nitrogen species, and converts the DC phenotype from immunogenic to tolerogenic. Perhaps this reduces the effects of a cytokine storm. In the case of lymphocytes, the actions of UBI is to inhibit/kill various types of lymphocytes. This is established because the cell-death pathways and the apoptotic signaling are found in lymphocytes. The killing of the lymphocytes can also reduce inflammation. UBI can also oxidize blood lipids and lipoproteins. This increases oxidative stress. A short burst of oxidative stress may be beneficial. A continued chronic level of oxidative stress is detrimental. Many antioxidant defenses become up-regulated after brief exposure to oxidative stress. This is one of the fundamental mechanisms responsible for many aspects of hormesis. The oxidative function of UBI has similarities with ozone therapy and oxygen therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Discussion and Conclusions</title><p id="Par46">UV to disinfect may certainly be used also for SARS-CoV-2, and far-UV lamps may certainly be used to deactivate airborne viruses in rooms, offices, and walkways of shopping centers, hospitals, universities, public buildings, companies, or airports.

The major reason for this is the skepticism by mainstream media towards âthe cure that time forgotâ UBI, which has been only used in recent times by the alternative medicine community, and the unawareness of the ECP development, that, opposite, is still used by the orthodox medical community with further improvements still being sought. While there is no reason to propose mass use of UBI or ECP-based protocols against SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is certainly warranted to perform further basic studies about UBI and ECP mechanisms, and then conduct trials for specific applications including SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Compliance with Ethical Standard</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par55">The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Welch</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Far-UVC light: a new tool to control the spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases</article-title><source>Sci Rep</source><year>2018</year><volume>8</volume><fpage>2752</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">29426899</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">5807439</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Reed</surname><given-names>NG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">The history of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation for air disinfection</article-title><source>Public Health Rep</source><year>2010</year><volume>125</volume><fpage>15</fpage><lpage>27</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20402193</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmcid">2789813</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hollaender</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>du Buy</surname><given-names>HG</given-names></name><name><surname>Ingraham</surname><given-names>HS</given-names></name><name><surname>Wheeler</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Control of air-borne microorganisms by ultraviolet floor irradiation</article-title><source>Science</source><year>1944</year><volume>99</volume><fpage>130</fpage><lpage>131</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="other" assigning-authority="ChemPort ( Chemical Abstract Service )">1:STN:280:DC%2BC3cvptFWltg%3D%3D</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17814296</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Kowalski, W.
