It is a multisystemic disease affecting mostly the nervous system (intellectual deficits, delayed psychomotor development, ataxia, epilepsy, behavioral problems, etc.), followed by congenital heart defects and various dysmorphisms. This microdeletion was found in 0.57-1.27% of pediatric patients targeted for microarray analysis, mainly with developmental delay and intellectual deficits. However, not all of the deletion carriers have a clinical manifestation - it is found in 0.25% of the population of healthy controls. The penetrance of 15q11.2 microdelection syndrome is estimated at 10.4%, which is significantly higher in de novo occurrence. We report 4 cases of prenatally established 15q11.2 microdeletion, in 3 of the cases the microdeletion was inherited from clinically healthy mothers. The indications for aCGH prenatal diagnosis were: 1) ultrasound data for unilateral cleft lip and palate in combination with an increased nuchal translucency of 3.3 mm- mother was the carrier; 2) second pregnancy after the first case; 3) increased risk from the biochemical screening (1:6) and tricuspid regurgitation, brother with neuropsychiatric disability - mother was a carrier; 4) Increased NT of 7.3 mm. Our results highlight the importance of microarray analysis in the diagnostic refinement of pregnancies which are abnormal in early fetal screening. We emphasize the difficulties of genetic counseling in the inheritance and the incomplete penetrance of the aberrations.</p><p id="Par11"><bold>K. Belemezova:</bold> None. <bold>P.

This malformation is characterized by its uncertain prognosis especially when isolated which makes the prenatal counseling difficult. Among genetic etiologies, only chromosomal anomalies are investigated during the prenatal period while ACC is due to single gene mutation in most cases and neurodevelopmental prognosis depends on the underlying cause.</p><p id="Par15"><bold>Methods:</bold> In order to evaluate the feasibility and contribution of prenatal exome sequencing (pES) during the pregnancy, we included 66 fetuses with ACC for trio analysis. Only pathogenic variants in known ACC and/or ID genes were considered.</p><p id="Par16"><bold>Results:</bold> pES results were available within a median delay of 22 days. A pathogenic SNV was identified in 12 cases (18%). Moreover, a pathogenic CNV was identified in 4 cases. Thus, the genetic cause was determined in 22% of cases. In all cases with diagnoses, pES results enlightened the neurodevelopmental prognosis of the fetus and enabled the parents to choose to continue with or terminate the pregnancy knowingly.</p><p id="Par17"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the first study of pES focusing on a single malformation characterized by an uncertain prognosis. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of pES in fetuses with prenatal diagnosis of ACC. pES has an evident clinical impact. The impact of pES when negative remains to be evaluated</p><p id="Par18"><bold>S. Heide:</bold> None. <bold>M. Spentchian:</bold> None. <bold>S. Valence:</bold> None. <bold>J.

A very few AS patients have small and/or atypical deletions in AS-SRO.</p><p id="Par22"><bold>Patient and Results:</bold> Pregnant patient (13 weeks) was referred because a daughter of 4 years old with development delay and peculiar phenotype and a 62Kb copy number loss at 15q11.2, arr[GRCh37] 15q11.2(25119854_25177138)x1. In extended familial studies, mother (pregnant) and grandfather have both the same deletion. MS-MLPA was performed in the daughter and the pregnant. The 15q11.2 deletion was confirmed in both and an altered methylation pattern in the daughter was detected correlating with an AS diagnosis. ArrayCGH analysis (CytoSure™ Constitutional v3 8x60k, OGT, UK) was performed in chorionic villus sample and the same deletion of 62Kb involving U5 exon of AS-SRO (exon 4 according NM sequence of SNRPN gene) was detected. MS-MLPA (PW/AS MS-MLPA Kit, MRC Holland) was performed in amniotic fluid with alteration of the methylation pattern, compatible with hypomethylation of the probes located in the CpG islands region of SNRPN gene was detected. Considering all the results, a prenatal diagnosis of AS was performed.</p><p id="Par23"><bold>Comments:</bold> IC deletion have been described in a small fraction of AS patients with ID, with no disease-causing variants detected to date.Deletions involving AS-SRO are a molecular defect that must be determined as the recurrence risk in case of a familial IC deletion. Caution should be made in prenatal diagnosis and is appropriate recommending MS-MLPA analysis.</p><p id="Par24"><bold>C. Pérez:</bold> None. <bold>E. Pestaña:</bold> None. <bold>C.

These include increasing age at childbirth, a lower number of children born to each woman or man, greater use of assisted reproductive technology (ART), higher frequency of family disruptions and increasingly complex family structures. The Centre for Fertility and Health (CeFH; <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.cefh.no" ext-link-type="uri">www.cefh.no</ext-link>) consists of a multidisciplinary research team of epidemiologists, geneticists, demographers, sociologists and economists with research themes including <bold>fertility problems</bold> and <bold>intergenerational transmission of health</bold>. The START project aims to understand the causes and health consequences of subfertility and how genetic influences and epigenetic differences are associated with subfertility and Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART). ART may introduce epigenetic changes in the embryo since the procedures are during a period of extensive epigenetic repatterning. It is unknown which genes may be affected and the potential health consequences for the children. START uses data from the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa; <ext-link xlink:href="https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/moba/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.fhi.no/en/studies/moba/</ext-link>), which follows more than 110 000 children and their parents. We have collected genetic and epigenetic data from 1000 trios with children born after ART, and 1000 trios from naturally conceived children analyzed with the Illumina EPIC array and the Illumina HumanCoreExome chip. Investigations are focussed on the effect of ART treatment on imprinted genes and fertility genes, and how epigenetic age acceleration interacts with fertility and ART treatment. Our results show DNA methylation changes due to both parental subfertility and ART procedures.</p><p id="Par28"><bold>R. Lyle:</bold> None. <bold>C. Page:</bold> None. <bold>Y.

Some ultrasound features that include polyhydramnios, omphalocele, and visceromegaly may raise the clinical suspicion in prenatal. Most reported BWS cases are sporadic, but around 15% may be familial. Delineation of the molecular defects can predict familial recurrence risks and make invasive prenatal diagnosis possible.</p><p id="Par32"><bold>Case Report:</bold> We report a case of a 41-year-old pregnant woman in whom ultrasound revealed at 24-weeks corpus callosum hypoplasia, macroglossia, omphalocele, short long bones and enlarged kidneys. The pregnancy was terminated and autopsy confirmed the ultrasound findings and also enlarged ovaries and pancreas, cytomegaly of the adrenal cortex and a placental mesenchymal dysplasia. Family history was irrelevant.</p><p id="Par33"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Clinical and molecular characterization of a prenatal case with diagnosis of BWS. We performed array-CGH, methylation analysis at 11p15.5 BWS <italic>locus</italic> and Sanger sequencing of <italic>CDKN1C</italic> gene. The presence of the variant identified in the foetus was tested in the parents.</p><p id="Par34"><bold>Results:</bold> Array-CGH and 11p15.5 methylation analysis (<italic>MS-MLPA</italic>) were normal. <italic>CDKN1C</italic> Sanger sequencing found a heterozygous novel probable pathogenic frameshift variant: NM_000076.2:c.479del p.(Pro160Argfs*112) of maternal origin.</p><p id="Par35"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This case demonstrates that search for a clear specific molecular diagnosis is key not only to confirm the diagnosis but also to provide proper genetic counselling. Although present in only 5% of the patients with no family history the identification of a <italic>CDKN1C</italic> pathogenic variant of maternal origin increases the recurrence risk to 50%.</p><p id="Par36"><bold>P.

Neurogenic and myogenic-types have been described, resulting in complete or partial movement restriction. In prenatal diagnosis decreased fetal movement is observed, the most severe forms being lethal in utero or after birth. We report a case of a male fetus at 22 gestational weeks with evidence of AMC on ultrasound, presenting fixed extended legs and flexed arms, bilateral clubfoot and absent fetal movements. Frontal oedema was also observed. After amniocentesis, karyotype and SNParray resulted normal.</p><p id="Par47"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Trio-based Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed on fetus genomic DNA and his unaffected parents.</p><p id="Par48"><bold>Results:</bold> WES analysis disclosed a de novo heterozygous pathogenic deletion (NM_015250.3: c.1636_1638delAAT; p.

The same variant was previously described in two children with a severe postnatal phenotype but belated or milder prenatal signs. This observation expands <italic>BICD2</italic> phenotypic spectrum, with further evidence of early-onset extreme prenatal forms. To date, the localization of the disease-causing mutations does not seem to correlate with disease severity, other molecular mechanisms should be investigated to elucidate genotype-phenotype correlations.</p><p id="Par50"><bold>E.

However, using array-CGH in an invasive prenatal context is still under a significant and controversial debate especially regarding the use of CMA in advance maternal age or maternal anxiety samples. Previous studies supported the evidence on the feasibility of introducing a-CGH as a first-line diagnostic testing routine prenatal diagnosis practice (1). Indeed, others and our laboratory have reported significant diagnostic yields also in low-risk pregnancies, between 1.6-4% (2,3).</p><p id="Par61"><bold>Methods</bold>: We used customized Karyoarray®v3.0 platform (4) to study consecutive invasive prenatal samples along two-year period.

A retrospective review of our amniocentesis database for the period from January 2000 to February 2020 was carried out. The karyotyping of 8531 fetuses was carried out in Department of Medical Biology from the samples of amniotic fluids which were sent from Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics of Balcali Hospital. A standart nomenclature has been developed to describe each of types of abnormality found in human chromosomes. A total of 8531 amniocentesis specimens were processed during the study period. 620 fetuses (7.26%) had various chromosomal abnormalities. 54.51% of abnormal karyotypes (338 cases) were numerical and 43.38% (269 cases) were structural. Both numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations were observed in 13 cases (2.09%). The ratios were as: trisomy 21 (49.70%), trisomy 18 (17.75%), monosomy X (9.46%), trisomy 13 (6.80%), Triploidy (4.73%), Klinefelter Syndrome (3.25%), Trisomy X (1. 18%), XYY Syndrome (0.88%), and the others in all numerical abnormalities. The frequent structural abnormalities were as: 46,XX/XY, inv(9) (p11;q12)/(p11;q13)(28.25 %), 46,XX/XY, 1qh(+)(11.89%), 46,XY, Yqh(-)(7.43%), 46,XX/XY, 16qh(+)(7.06%), 46,XX/XY, 9qh(+)(4.46%) and 46,XY, Yqh(+)(4.08%). Balanced and unbalanced translocations, deletions and duplications were also found in less ratio. According to the literature and our results, advanced maternal age is the main cause of fetal chromosomal abnormalities. Fetal chromosomal abnormality ratio that we found was 7.26%.

Methods: The results of all CMA tests performed due to an NT of 3 to 3.4 mm were retrospectively retrieved from the Ministry of Health computerized database. The rates of clinically significant (pathogenic and likely pathogenic) microarray findings were compared to a previously published local control population, encompassing 5541 fetuses with normal ultrasound. Results: Overall, 619 CMA analyses were performed due to a sonographic indication of NT of 3 to 3.4 mm. Of these, 29 (4.7%) clinically significant copy number variants were detected, a considerably increased risk compared to control pregnancies. Fetal karyotyping would have missed 31% of the abnormal cases, while non-invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) would have overlooked 31-49% of the anomalies, depending on the method. Conclusions: The outcomes of our study, representing the largest number of CMA results in fetuses with NT of 3 to 3.4 mm, suggest that the rate of abnormal CMA findings in these pregnancies is significantly higher compared to pregnancies with normal ultrasound. Our results support the consideration to perform invasive prenatal testing for CMA in pregnancies with NT above 3 mm. In addition, as several of the CMA findings in these pregnancies are not associated with major sonographic anomalies, it seems that NIPS with later sonographic survey cannot adequately replace NT measurement.</p><p id="Par79"><bold>L.

We compared the incidences of congenital anomalies in naturally conceived children and ART conceived children born in the Czech Republic during 5 years period (2013-2017). Statistical analysis was performed by Fisher’s exact test.</p><p id="Par98"><bold>Results:</bold> During the selected period there were 547 675 children born in the Czech Republic (531 064 were naturally conceived children and 16 611 were ART conceived children). The incidence of congenital anomalies was 3.90% in naturally conceived children group and 4.35% in ART conceived children. This difference is statistically significant (p = 0.003). Analyzing different subgroups of congenital anomalies we have found a significantly increased incidence of anomalies in two subgroups: Congenital malformations of the circulatory system (Q20-Q28) and Congenital malformations of the respiratory system (Q30-Q34).</p><p id="Par99"><bold>Discussion:</bold> The increased risk of congenital anomalies in ART conceived children was highlighted in many studies however the results are often diverse. In our population-based study, we confirmed a significantly higher general incidence of congenital anomalies in ART conceived children.</p><p id="Par100"><italic>The study is supported by the RVO project: “Thomayerova nemocnice - TN, 00064190”</italic>.</p><p id="Par101"><bold>A.

CHDs are a frequent finding during routine ultrasound prenatal screening. Once detected, it is important to determine their etiology. The 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS) is the most frequent <underline>known</underline> genetic cause of CHDs (1.9% prevalence). We present a multiplex marker PCR kit to detect 22q11.2 deletions and duplications which we prospectively used in 1630 individuals and 450 fetal cases with a congenital heart defect referred by an obstetrician. Important features: 1) Low cost (there are 2 mixes of 11 pairs of primers and 2 conventional PCR reactions). 2) Fast, results can be given within hours of receiving the sample (DNA extraction -&gt; PCR 1.5 hours -&gt; automatic sequencer). 3) Safely rules out sample contamination by maternal DNA. 4) Uses small amounts of DNA (10 ng) and can be performed starting from amniotic fluid or non-cultured chorion biopsy or any other tissue. 5) In prenatal samples, it would be complementary to the QF-PCR (negative samples for trisomy 13, 18 or 21). 6) The parental origin of the deletion/duplication is determined when the fetus is analyzed with the parents. 7) Detects atypical and typical deletions, extending the analysis far beyond that given by the FISH probe that has been historically used (TUPLE1). 8) We have developed a panel of 31 additional markers, not included in the multiplex, to be used in case of lack of informativity.</p><p id="Par105"><bold>L.

It has considerably been deployed in postnatal indications with a diagnostic yield ranging from 30 to 40%. Several prenatal studies report a diagnostic yield ranging from 15% to 35%, depending on the exome strategy and the inclusion criteria. The French national network for rare diseases with AD deployed a pilot project of feasibility for rapid prenatal exome sequencing.</p><p id="Par130"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> We aimed to include 61 fetuses and both parents. The main inclusion criteria were: 2 major malformations or, 1 major and 1 minor malformation or, 1 malformation and a strong genetic suspicion. The feasibility aim was to emit a diagnostic report in 5-6 weeks. Array-CGH and ES-trio were concomitantly performed. ES-trio was captured with the TWIST-v2 kit and sequenced on a NovaSeq6000 device with a 70X average depth.</p><p id="Par131"><bold>Results</bold>: We included 23 patients. The turnaround time from receipt of samples to the diagnostic report was on average of 27 days for the negative patients and of 40 days for the positive patients. The diagnostic yield was of 44% with 7 SNV and 3 CNV, including a tetrasomy 12p. Array-CGH allowed a diagnosis in 13% and exome in 44%. Results were concordant for CNV detection between array-CGH and ES-trio.</p><p id="Par132"><bold>Discussion</bold>: Prenatal trio-ES appears feasible in a useful time and strongly helpful for decision in 65 % and genetic counseling was impactful in at least 44%.</p><p id="Par133"><bold>F.

Exome-sequencing provides the possibility of wide preconception carrier screening (PCS) in consanguineous couples who may be at risk of rare genetic disorders. The efficacy of this strategy has been poorly explored. We retrospectively analyzed exome sequencing data from 27 affected children and 3 fetuses (after termination of pregnancy) of consanguineous couples. We explored diagnostic yield and carrier status for recessive disorders. Overall diagnostic yield was 67% (20/30 patients). We detected homozygous causative variants in 19 cases and one de novo heterozygous variant. Out of 20 causal variants, 18 were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic and two as unknown significance, which were reclassified as likely pathogenic because of highly specific phenotype. Based on our results and considering diagnostic yield and variant classification, causative pathogenic recessive mutations would have been detected in at least 60% of consanguineous couples by preconception exome-sequencing. Most of these conditions (16/20) would not have been detected in PCS panels for most prevalent diseases considering a carrier frequency of 1/250. Most of the patients were carriers of one additional heterozygous recessive mutation (70%, 21/30) and a smaller number were carriers of two (17%, 5/30) or more (13%, 4/30). The average carrier burden of autosomal recessive conditions was of 1.7 pathogenic mutations per patient. PCS by exome-sequencing increases the detection rate of rare recessive conditions in consanguineous couples and could potentially increase their reproductive autonomy and facilitate informed decision making.</p><p id="Par137"><bold>A.

The average age of the cases in the study was 28.5 ± 5.5(year ± SD). The mean gestational week of the cases was 25.81 ± 9.02.

RAN-translation depending on variable CGG-repeat length is also hypothesized to cause FXPOI due to the production of a polyglycine-containing FMR1-protein, FMRpolyG. FMRpolyG expression in granulosa cells (GCs) of FXPOI-model-mice leads to perturbed ovarian function. However, the expression of FMRpolyG in leukocytes and GCs of women with different ovarian response and variable CGG repeat length has not been investigated yet. We performed Western-blot (WB) to analyze the expression of FMRP and FMRpolyG in patient´s leukocytes and GCs in parallel with <italic>FMR1</italic>-gene-expressionanalysis. Firstly, we detected FMRP, both in leukocytes and GCs of women with variable ovarian reserve and different CGG-repeat-length. <italic>FMR1</italic>/FMRP was detected in a larger amount in GCs than in leukocytes, since it is a major regulator of folliculogenesis. We therefore started a pilot project investigating if variable expression-levels of FMRP and FMRpolyG detected by WB can be related to women with different ovarian reserve parameters and variable CGG repeats including “normal” and premutated ranges. Preliminary data already showed, in a PM patient undergoing oocytes cryopreservation because of her risk of developing FXPOI, a decreased level of FMRP, even though the <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription level was within the normal range, fitting to the hypothesis of kind of a perturbed protein production in this patient. We plan to further evaluate if results made in GCs can be translated to leukocytes. This would offer prospectively a predictive tool or marker of progression.</p><p id="Par163"><bold>X.

Whilst causes such as Klinefelter’s and Y chromosome microdeletions have been well distinguished, the genetic causes behind severe spermatogenic failure are largely unknown, with around 40% of all male infertility cases remaining idiopathic. De novo mutations (DNMs) arise spontaneously in the germline or post-zygotically, and are known to be associated with early onset disorders with reduced reproductive fitness. These mutations, however, are vastly understudied in the field of male infertility due to the difficulty in obtaining parental samples. Here we report on the continuation and expansion of exome sequencing in our cohort of infertile patients in order to identify novel genes involved in male infertility. The role of DNMs was investigated in a total of 194 patients suffering from non-obstructive azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia and their fertile parents by adding 95 additional trios to the previously reported 99 cases. In these additional 95 trios, we have identified and validated 75 protein-altering DNMs, of which 19 are likely to affect normal gene function. Genes of particular interest are <italic>PPP1R7</italic>, <italic>RBM5</italic> and <italic>MSH5</italic>, all of which are involved in spermatogenesis and linked to infertility in mice. At this moment, none of these genes have been recognised as human male infertility genes. Our data further indicates that DNMs may play an important role in severe male infertility and emphasises the need for further replication studies in larger cohorts.</p><p id="Par174"><bold>H.E.

However, of all infertile men, 40% have unknown aetiology after being tested for all known causes. In this study, we explored for the first time the role of maternally inherited copy-number variations (CNVs) on a large scale, sequencing the exome of 160 patient-parents trios, a methodology primarily used to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) but also robust for CNV detection. Among all rare maternally inherited CNVs detected, 3 were considered of potential pathogenicity. One is a large duplication (~1.7 Mb) involving, among others, <italic>VCX</italic> gene, an X-linked multi-copy gene that leads to apoptosis and cell growth inhibition when duplicated in murine germ cells in vitro. A second case carried a ~80 kb duplication involving two genes, one of which was <italic>FAS</italic>, a known regulator of testicular germ cell apoptosis. The third CNV, instead, was a deletion of ~200 kb affecting, among others, <italic>PSME4</italic>, a gene required for normal fertility in male mice but dispensable in females. The results of this study, although preliminary, provide a first indication that maternally inherited CNVs may explain cases of severe spermatogenic failure. Currently, additional 35 patient-parents trios and 149 patients are being screened to detect variations affecting the same genes and additional rare variations. Genome sequencing data will soon be available for all the trios, which will improve CNV detection and clarify the contribution of these variations to the disorder.</p><p id="Par200"><bold>F.K.

A genetic diagnosis combined with a clear unambiguous description of accompanying testis histology will hugely benefit interpretation of the function of identified genes. However, a universal ontology for testis histopathology is lacking. The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is a formal ontology, which describes phenotypes encountered in human diseases. The HPO allows phenotype driven differential diagnostics in clinical routine and research. The current hierarchy of terms regarding azoospermia, is not a systematical one. Moreover, the majority of testicular phenotypes are not annotated yet. Building on what has been published previously and our own experience we propose a framework for testis histopathology that consists of five main categories. Four of these are subdivided to obtain information on the timing of a germ cell arrest or the severity of overall loss of spermatogenesis. To establish a lower threshold for complete spermatogenesis we determined the number of tubules containing elongating spermatids in a collection of samples of men with an obstructive azoospermia due to a previous vasectomy (N=117). This analysis suggested 50% to be a reasonable cut-off to distinguish hypospermatogenesis from complete spermatogenesis. The framework is easy to understand and straightforward in its application. It gathers most relevant information to study the impact of an identified mutation on spermatogenesis. We conclude that once this framework is incorporated in the HPO, the standardized vocabulary will facilitate communication and interpretation in both a clinical routine and research.</p><p id="Par204"><bold>G.W. van der Heijden:</bold> None. <bold>M.J.

Hence, we conducted whole exome sequencing of men undergoing assisted conception to identify genetic lesions. The β-defensin 126 (DEFB126) and β-defensin 128 (DEFB128), are genes preferentially expressed in the epididymis, where these proteins may help protect the maturing sperm cells and play a vital role during sperm capacitation.</p><p id="Par208"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> DNA extracted from the blood of 26 unrelated, sub-fertile men were sequenced using whole exome sequencing. Pathogenic rare variants were identified using bioinformatics analysis and validated using Sanger sequencing.</p><p id="Par209"><bold>Results:</bold> A novel and rare homozygous pathogenic 1-bp frame-shift insertion causing a premature stop codon was identified in DEFB128 gene from one patient. Six patients showed a previously reported homozygous 2bp deletion, causing a frame-shift mutation in the DEFB126 gene (p.Pro106ArgfsTer?). All patients ascertained with the DEFB126/DEFB128 mutations were unable to naturally conceive and hence were sub-fertile.</p><p id="Par210"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The DEFB128 mutation (rs11396059), is rare and has not been associated with any disease to date. As the patient with the DEFB128 mutation has no other medical condition we predict that it is the cause of infertility. The DEFB126 mutation (rs140685149), is a common variant, and this homozygous variant in sub-fertile men has previously been implicated in facilitating sperm movement in the female reproductive tract. These results suggest that, β-defensin genes play a significant role in male reproduction.</p><p id="Par211">This work was supported by the R-LINCS studentship, Abertay University.</p><p id="Par212"><bold>S.

In human placenta, the chorionic villi gradually transform from proliferative cytotrophoblasts and extravillous trophoblasts into a migratory and invasive trophoblast phenotype. Failure in altering the behavior and morphology of trophoblasts in placenta may result in insufficient trophoblast invasion, which leads to placental dysfunction and the diseased placenta. MiR-200 family, including miR-200a and -141, were highly expressed in human placenta and were upregulated in patients of preeclampsia. miR-200a and miR-141 were demonstrated to inhibit the formation of primary clila in trophoblasts and therefore have a less ability for cell invasion. In this study, miR-200a and miR-141 were shown to inhibit trophoblasts (HTR-8/SVneo) invasion and migration by a transfection assay. In western blotting and qRT-PCR, miR-200a and miR-141 stimulated epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin and ZO-1, whereas suppressed mesenchymal and transcriptional factors, such as ZEB1, MMP2, MMP9 and TGF-b1. These results suggest trophoblast migration and invasion mediated by miR-200 family may through the mechanism of EMT, and may therefore predispose to develop preeclampsia in human pregnancy.</p><p id="Par223"><bold>M.

The incidence of MRKHS is estimated to be 1:4.500 and 1:250 in other Müllerian anomalies. Most cases of Müllerian anomalies are sporadic; familial cases seem to be autosomal dominant inherited with reduced penetrance. Until now the knowledge about the etiology of anomalies of the Müllerian ducts is very limited. In approximately 1% of patients with Müllerian anomalies recurrent deletions in 16p11.2 encompassing <italic>TBX6</italic> were found as causative in these patients. Moreover, in previous studies, we and others found possibly pathogenic variants in patients with Müllerian anomalies in <italic>TBX6</italic>. Since <italic>TBX6</italic> encodes a conserved transcription factor playing an essential role in developmental processes like mesoderm formation and specification, we suggested <italic>TBX6</italic> as strong candidate gene.

A substantial proportion of these CNVs are associated with severe diseases, even with some newly identified microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. Recently it was showed that NIPT has a good performance in detecting fetal subchromosomal CNVs, especially for CNVs &gt;10 Mb, and can be incorporated into the routine NIPT chromosomal aneuploidies screening with high sensitivity and specificity. The prenatal detection of CNVs with clinical significance would benefit all the pregnant women in genetic counselling and clinical management of the pregnant outcomes. We report here a result from NIPT performed in a first trimester of a pregnant woman with third normal pregnancy. The test revealed 5Mbp-13q duplication and array CGH was indicated for confirmation of the aberration after amniocentesis. Array CGH confirmed the aberration in a fetus with the following size: 13q21.2q21.31 (60,540,987-65,431,854)x3 (4.89 Mb). Such duplications in 13q are described in the literature to be associated with the developmental delay, intellectual deficits, behavioral problems, and facial dysmorphisms. We tested all family members by array CGH for the presence of the aberrations - the parents and two siblings (9 years old girl and 12 years old boy). The same aberration was detected in clinically healthy mother and sister, thus determining the familial character of the aberration. In conclusion, careful evaluation should be done for each submiscroscopic aberration detected by NIPT in order to make proper classification and give an adequate genetic counselling.</p><p id="Par253"><bold>I.

Postpartum CA and FISH from blood and placental cells resulted in normal karyotypes. In contrast, aCGH confirmed a 1,44 Mb gain in chromosomal region 21q21.3q22.11 and the aberration was classified as variant of unclear significance (VUS). Additional qPCR analyses confirmed the gain and showed it was maternal inherited.

They are based on the isolation of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) from maternal plasma which for the majority is maternal, but a small percentage of it comes from the placenta (cell-free fetal DNA or cffDNA). cffDNA percentage or fetal fraction (FF) ranges from &lt; 4% to &gt;30% and it influences NIPT outcome. According to neoBona® NIPT method used in our laboratory, invalidation occurs with a FF &lt;4%. Recently, circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been investigated as potential biomarkers for screening in pregnancy. We aimed to investigate them as biomarkers in relation to FF level. Previously tested neoBona® samples were divided into one “control group” (FF &gt;4%) and one “test group” (FF &lt;4%). Samples were analysed in the nanostring nCounter® platform by using a pre-customised panel of 799 miRNAs. Each miRNA expression value was normalised to 1 in the “control group” and “test group” samples were analysed for expression defects. Data filtering was set using 1.5-fold of changes in signal as threshold. Ninety-three per cent of miRNAs showed no significant changes of expression whilst 4 miRNAs (named miR-579, miR-3144, miR-612 and miR-6721) were significantly over- or under-expressed. Bioinformatic analysis showed involvement of these miRNAs and their target genes in several biological pathways. Further investigations of these preliminary data could provide a new insight into the biological roles of the miRNAs in relation to FF level and in their potential use as biomarkers.</p><p id="Par264"><bold>G.

Cell free DNA (cfDNA) was isolated and library construction was prepared according to BGI’s documented protocol. WGS of cfDNA was performed with BGISEQ-500 sequencer. Data was analysed using BGI’s proprietary bioinformatic programme, HALOS.</p><p id="Par275"><bold>Results:</bold> WGS data was generated from 13,802 NIPT cases. The mean maternal age was 33 years, fetal fraction was 10.7% and gestational age at testing was 14 weeks. Over an 18-month period, there were 30 RATs identified. The overall frequency of RATs was 0.21% in our study. Trisomies 16 and 22 were the most frequently observed RATs while other chromosomes were less frequently involved.

Application of next generation sequencing (NGS) has allowed us to confirm our finding, from molecular cytogenetics, that a significant proportion of apparently meiotic aneuploidy is in fact present in the early embryo, leading to a risk of oocyte aneuploidy irrespective of age. It has also provided evidence that genetic factors influence premeiotic oocyte aneuploidy. NGS was performed on oocytes using Ion ReproSeqPGS (ThermoFisher)/VeriSeqPGS (Illumina). Immature oocytes (84) included germinal vesicles &amp; metaphase I oocytes. Mature oocytes (27) were metaphase II - 1st polar body complexes. Totally, 111 oocytes from 33 women, (average maternal age, 35.09 years) were tested. Overall 15/111 (13.5%) oocytes showed premeiotic (PM) errors. Eight of 33 patients had oocytes with PM errors. Aneuploidy analysis was based on the reproductive histories of female partners donating oocytes. Interestingly the first two groups of infertility patients showed almost identical aneuploidy rates in contrast to the social oocyte freezing group. Two young women preserving oocytes prior to breast cancer treatment showed complex aneuploidies. We conclude that the application of NGS has provided accurate information regarding the frequency of aneuploidy that is due to premeiotic errors compared with that caused by errors at MI of oogenesis and that on an individual basis this is influenced by genetic factors.

In severe forms of male infertility, patients are found to have high numbers of genetic abnormalities and de novo mutations (DNMs). Interestingly DNMs are known to play an important role in severe genetic diseases with reduced reproductive fitness. Our research investigates the role of DNMs in severe male infertility by studying a unique cohort of azoospermic and severe oligozoospermic patients, and their fertile parents. Employing the Illumina’s Novaseq6000, 100 DNMs were identified in the exomes of 99 patients. While short-read sequencing data was used to collect the location and genotypes of all informative SNPs (iSNPs) surrounding the DNMs, limitations in fragment size prevented further investigation. In-depth examination of DNMs in context with their surrounding iSNPs requires targeted capture approaches for long-read sequencing that span the entire region of interest. Using PCR amplicon sequencing on the Oxford-Nanopore MinION platform we have been able to phase ~90% of the DNMs. Phasing analysis indicated that ~71% of DNMs occurred in the paternal gamete pre-fertilization, which is in concordance with current literature. A link between paternal DNMs and likely causation for disease has been noted, though not all data was available for this association at this time. Investigation of allele frequency identified 91% of the DNMs occurred pre-zygotically, why they failed to impact father spermatogenesis is of particular interest for further study.</p><p id="Par285"><bold>G.S.

Comparing success rates to (inter)national reference data is part of good clinical practice. PGT technologies evolve at high speed, going from different biopsy timepoints to more extensive genetic methodologies, making good comparisons difficult. By detailed evaluation of our in-house data, and comparison to published data from (inter)national clinics, we obtained additional insights and can provide couples with more patient-focused information. We performed a retrospective cohort study at the Department for Reproductive Medicine and the Center for Medical Genetics (Ghent University Hospital), including patients who underwent ICSI-IVF (January 2016-April 2019) followed by PGT-SR or PGT-A after trophectoderm biopsy (68 and 90 oocyte retrieval cycles respectively). Making use of comprehensive chromosome screening (shallow whole genome sequencing or sWGS), we detected chromosomal abnormalities in 65% of PGT-SR embryos. In the PGT-A group, 40% of embryos showed a numerical or structural rearrangement. For translocation carriers, pregnancy rate per transfer was 58% and live birth rate per transfer 44%. For PGT-A patients, pregnancy rate and live birth rate were 39% and 25% respectively.</p><p id="Par318"><bold>M. Baetens:</bold> None. <bold>I. De Croo:</bold> None. <bold>A.

PGT-M for these late-onset and partial penetrant conditions implies that the procedure selects against embryos that might have been cancer-free. Moreover, preventive and therapeutic options for decreasing morbidity and mortality are available and ongoing cancer research might reveal treatments altering the natural history of cancer in the future. Most studies exploring perceptions of PGT-M among CCPM, were based on participants’ theoretical declarative intentions. Actual use has rarely been reported and analyzed. Between 2006-2019 overall 173 CCPM were counseled in our center: One couple between 2006-2008 and gradual increase until 102 CCPM between 2018-2019. Six were single women (3.4%) and 167 couples (96.5%). Among them 145(83.8%) were BRCA1/BRCA2 carriers (92/48 respectively; 5 BRCA1+BRCA2), 10(5.8%) Lynch carriers, 10(5.8%) APC carriers, 4(2.3%) TP53 carriers, 2(1.2%) MEN2 carriers, 1(0.6%) CHEK2 carrier and 1(0.6%) BMPR1A carrier. Overall, 150(86.7%) of the carriers were healthy and 23(13.2%) were diagnosed with cancer or related condition.

Five)2.8%) couples had additional reason for PGT-M/PGT-SR. Overall Live birth rate for embryo transfer was 32%. Reproductive decision-making regarding PGT-M for CCPM is a complex process. While this application for PGT-M becomes acceptable, health professionals involved in the process should be aware and address the specific issues and concerns of this group regarding medical, emotional and moral aspects.</p><p id="Par322"><bold>S.

However, interpretation of WES data is complicated due to various factors including limited knowledge on the prenatal fetal phenotype of rare monogenic disorders. We therefore aimed to describe the prenatal fetal phenotype of genetic variants found by WES.</p><p id="Par340"><bold>Methods:</bold> In this single-center study, we included fetuses in whom WES was indicated in a prenatal diagnostic setting between March 1, 2018 and January 1, 2020 during pregnancy or after termination of pregnancy. We performed trio WES using a phenotype-dependent filtering strategy. We documented prenatal and postnatal characteristics of fetuses and compared the phenotype with literature using PubMed.</p><p id="Par341"><bold>Results:</bold> WES was performed in 93 fetuses. A pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was found in 29 (31.2%) fetuses (21 different genes). For eight genes, it was the first time a causative genetic variant was found in a prenatal setting (<italic>C2CD3,CNOT1,GATA6, PLD1,POMK,SAMD9,SMC3,THOC6</italic>). In three fetuses, some detected structural anomalies have not previously been described (<italic>PEX1-,POMK-,THOC6-</italic>variants). In three fetuses, diagnosis was filtered out in the prenatal setting due to various reasons, but could be established using additional postnatal phenotypic characteristics.

We learned the following lessons: (1) We made unexpected diagnoses using our broad virtual panel, like Zellweger syndrome in a fetus suspected of a ciliopathy. (2) We missed four diagnoses that were made postnatally using additional phenotypic information and adapted our filter strategy. 3) We were confronted with incidental unsolicited findings and changed our filter strategy to minimize them. (4) There is a lack of knowledge about prenatal phenotype of known genetic conditions, which hinders diagnostics. Further, we experienced the impact of time pressure to generate a diagnosis in limited time and had to deal with changing fetal phenotypes.</p><p id="Par349"><bold>Conclusion</bold>: rES in the prenatal setting is feasible but challenging, and improves by adapting the process based on insights from previous experiences.</p><p id="Par350"><bold>N.

Here we report our laboratory’s array data of prenatal samples and describe phenotype-genotype correlations. Methods: 180 specimens (149 amniotic fluid, 23 chorionic villi and 8 cord blood samples) were analyzed by array CGH. Detection of genomic CNVs was performed using Agilent, 8x60K CGH Microarray. Interpretation was done according to the ACMG guidelines. Results: %16.1 of patients (29/180), CNVs were detected. 24 of them had segmental duplication or deletion, 5 had trisomy and 1 had monosomy X. 3.3% of patients had aneuploidy, 4.4% of patients had VUS variants and %8.8 of patients had pathogenic segmental deletions/duplications. 61.1% of the segmental pathogenic variants were deletions and most of the VUS variants were duplications (62.5%). 50% of the segmental pathogenic variants were &lt; 7 Mb and the smallest size was 0.5MB (deletion). 22.2% of pathogenic variants were well-defined CNV syndromes. The most prevalent indications were ultrasonographic anomalies, increased triple test risk and advanced maternal age. While 30% of patients with normal results have normal ultrasound, all patients with a pathogenic variant had an ultrasound anomaly. The most defined ultrasonographic findings in cases with pathogenic variants were cardiac anomalies, increased NT and brain anomalies. Conclusion: Detection of submicroscopic imbalances by CMA increases the power of prenatal diagnosis. Our data emphasize the importance of CMA in the prenatal diagnosis of the fetuses with abnormal ultrasonographic findings whereas conventional karyotyping resolution is inadequate to detect submicroscopic changes.</p><p id="Par362"><bold>L.

Quantitative fluorescence-PCR (QF-PCR) analysis of microsatellite repeats is widely used to establish chromosome copy number of uncultured CV samples; if recommended preparation methods are employed, both cytotrophoblast and mesoderm should be represented. In the case of trisomy results, the presence of three different alleles is observed in ~90% of cases, confirming meiotic non-disjunction as the origin of the abnormal cell line. Where only biallelic 2:1 ratios are observed, the trisomy may have arisen by mitotic non-disjunction following a normal conception, in which case a normal cell line may be present; European and UK best practice guidelines recommend that non-mosaic biallelic (NMB) results should be reported more cautiously, given the increased risk of mosaicism. However, the likelihood of finding a normal cell line following an NMB result is not established. We have therefore audited 10 years of cases and compared NMB results to the follow-up karyotype and/or amniocentesis results. In total, 133 CVS showed NMB results for common trisomies, of which 131 were concordant with follow-up tests. Two trisomy 18 cases showed a normal result on amniocentesis, indicating confined placental mosaicism; neither case had ultrasound abnormalities present at referral. Therefore, in this cohort, ~1.5% of NMB QF-PCR cases subsequently showed evidence of mosaicism, this is reduced to 0% for cases with USS abnormalities. These figures may inform the reporting and pregnancy management of NMB cases.</p><p id="Par373"><bold>A.R. Pendlebury-Watt:</bold> None. <bold>K. Mann:</bold> None. <bold>C.

We evaluated how this offer was experienced in an explorative mixed-methods parental experience study.</p><p id="Par377"><bold>Methods:</bold> We investigated reasons for accepting and declining rES, the impact of rES on decision making, experiences of the counseling and test process, and understanding of test information and possible test outcomes. All couples were asked to fill two surveys, one after pre-test and one after post-test counseling. Part of the couples were approached for an interview until data saturation was reached.</p><p id="Par378"><bold>Results:</bold> 44 couples participated in the survey study, 11 in the interview study. In 22% of pregnancies, a diagnosis was found, in 31% an unsolicited finding. 95% wanted to be informed about unsolicited findings. The most important reason for accepting rES was to find a diagnosis. Most parents already decided to terminate the pregnancy on the basis of the ultrasound abnormalities, although rES results impacted decision in a few cases. The impact for future pregnancies was higher than with conventional testing and the fast turnaround was valued highly. The counseling and test process was experienced positive. Parents suggested to add information of other parents’ experiences and decisional process to the test information.</p><p id="Par379"><bold>Conclusion</bold>: Parents evaluate rES positively, despite the risk of unsolicited findings.</p><p id="Par380"><bold>M.

The aim of this study was to better define the prenatal indications for RASopathy testing and the genotype-phenotype correlations.</p><p id="Par384"><bold>Methods:</bold> 353 cases sent for prenatal RASopathy testing between 2012-2019, after a normal a-CGH, were collected. For most, 11 RASopathy genes were tested. Detailed ultrasound findings were available for 313 fetuses, whereas 40 cases had only clinical indications for testing collected. Twenty-five RASopathy patients diagnosed postnatally were added to widen the phenotypic spectrum.</p><p id="Par385"><bold>Results:</bold> See tables below for detailed results. The overall diagnostic yield was 14% (51/353). The largest contributors of mutations were <italic>PTPN11</italic> (29%), <italic>RIT1</italic> (15%), <italic>RAF1</italic> (13%) and <italic>HRAS</italic> (12%). Severe postnatal phenotypes were in majority diagnosed prenatally and associated with mutations in <italic>HRAS</italic>, <italic>RIT1</italic> and <italic>RAF1</italic>.</p><p id="Par386"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> After normal a-CGH, RASopathies should be considered when any ultrasound finding of lymphatic dysplasia or suggestive congenital heart disease is found alone or in association. In the presence of persistent or associated hygroma, NT&gt;6 mm, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or any finding combined with polyhydramnios or renal anomaly, the likelihood of RASopathy diagnosis is significantly increased.</p><p id="Par387">Table 1 Prenatal ultrasound findings in 313 patients with a normal array-CGH<table-wrap id="Tabb"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p><italic>Prenatal findings</italic></p></th><th><p><italic>Total # of patients</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 313)</p></th><th><p><italic>Prenatal mutation-positive group</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 48)</p></th><th><p><italic>Mutation-negative group</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 265)</p></th><th><p><italic>p-value</italic><sup><italic>a</italic></sup></p></th><th><p><italic>Postnatal mutation-positive group</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 25)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p><bold>Increased NT</bold></p></td><td><p>231/313 (74%)</p></td><td><p>30/48 (63%)</p></td><td><p>201/265 (76%)</p></td><td><p>0,03</p></td><td><p>1/25 (4%)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NT &gt;

Although chromosomal abnormalities, CNVs and pathogenic variants in many genes have been associated to RA, the etiology is still poorly understood. Our aim was to better understand the biological pathways involved in RA and to identify interacting candidate pathways useful for further gene identification and molecular diagnosis in clinical care when applying genome-wide sequencing.</p><p id="Par394"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We used Phenolyzer to obtain all genes known as causative for syndromic and non-syndromic uni- and bilateral RA. Using ClueGO gene enrichment analysis we classified the relationship between these genes and biological processes as defined by gene ontology.</p><p id="Par395"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 289 genes described to be involved in the pathogenesis of RA when mutated. We obtained 69 groups of enriched biological processes. About 50% included pathways directly related to the development of urogenital organ tissues (e.g. metanephros, nephric duct, ureter). Furthermore, several ciliary, axis specification, hindgut development and endocrine pathways are enriched, which may relate to different clinical presentations of RA. The results also support the hypothesis that RA is part of the ciliopathy spectrum and developmentally related to dysplastic kidneys.</p><p id="Par396"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our gene ontology analysis shows that genes representing distinct biological pathways are significantly enriched. They may relate to different clinical presentations of RA, which will lead to an improved delineation of candidate genes and molecular diagnosis of this congenital anomaly in clinical practice.</p><p id="Par397"><bold>S.

Because mtDNA replication is silenced during early embryonic development, the presence of a large number of mtDNA copies in the mature oocyte is mandatory. In human, several studies on blastocysts day-5 embryos have paradoxically evidenced a positive correlation between high quantities of mtDNA molecules and severe conditions, like aneuploidy, poor embryo quality, and implantation failure. However, data from day-3 embryos are much more limited and contradictory, making this point a highly controversial one. We have quantified the mtDNA copy number (CN) in residual DNA of 1 or 2 cells, sampled from day-3 embryos, in a context of preimplantation genetic analysis for a non-metabolic, non-mitochondrial DNA disorder (<italic>n</italic> = 165, control group) and for a mtDNA mutation (<italic>n</italic> = 16, mitochondrial group). A great dispersion of the mtDNA CN was found, among the different cells of a given embryo, and the different embryos from a given patient. A maternal effect regulating the mtDNA CN was observed, but remained of unknown origin. In particular, no correlation was detected between mtDNA CN and maternal age or ovarian reserve. mtDNA CN did not correlate with embryonic quality and ability of an embryo to implant and give a viable pregnancy. Finally, the mtDNA CN was not influenced by the presence of a mtDNA mutation. Based on these findings, mtDNA CN at day 3 of development cannot be used to select the best embryo to transfer.</p><p id="Par401"><bold>J. Steffann:</bold> None. <bold>K.

This occurs when a Rhesus-D negative woman, carrying a Rhesus-D positive fetus during her first pregnancy, is alloimmunized against RhD antigen and carries another Rhesus-positive fetus during a subsequent pregnancy. Nowadays, HDFN is rare since anti-D prophylaxis is provided to all RhD negative pregnant women.

Since there is fewer than hundreds of individuals have been described, the population prevalence is unknown.

The erythema started appearing on her face at the age of three months and then spread to the entire body. Besides, she had neither eyelashes nor eyebrows, with sparse scalp hair. After analyzing the WGS data, we found a heterozygous nonsense mutation c.2752G&gt;T (p.Glu918*) and a novel frameshift-insertion c.1547_1548insC (p.Ala516fs) in the gene <italic>RECQL4</italic>, which is a known pathogenic gene of RTS.

Characteristic features of SGBS include pre/postnatal overgrowth, distinctive craniofacial features (macrocephaly, coarse face with macroglossia), visceromegaly and increased risk of neoplasia. This condition is almost always diagnosed postnatally.</p><p id="Par421"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> A 23-y/o woman with uninformative anamnesis on the 21 weeks’ gestation was referred due to abnormal fetal ultrasound findings (polyhydramnios, macrocephaly, corpus callosum agenesis, abdominal visceromegaly and abnormal genitalia). The results of fetal DNA qPCR and SNP-CGH tests from amniotic fluid revealed no chromosomal abnormalities.

During mammalian spermatogenesis, the chromatin structure undergoes substantial condensation. The key role in this process is played by protamines 1 and 2 (PRM1, PRM2). Abnormal condensation could lead to DNA breaks, which is linked to pregnancy loss after assisted fertilization, disturbances in embryo development and increased risk of abortions.

Of all infertility cases, approximately 40 - 50% are due to “male factor” infertility, mostly caused by spermatogenic failure. Despite extensive research, there is still limited knowledge of the genetic causes and underlying molecular mechanisms. We previously showed that deficiency for the epigenetic reader PHF13 in the mouse results in testis hypoplasia due to a spermatogenic defect.</p><p id="Par448">Here, we obtained single-cell RNA expression profiles from <italic>Phf13</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and <italic>Phf13</italic><sup><italic>+/-</italic></sup> testis and compared them with wild type data. The results revealed a loss of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) in pachytene spermatocytes of PHF13 deficient mice. This is remarkable, since canonical PHF13 is only expressed in spermatogonia. In combination with ChIPseq data demonstrating an enrichment of PHF13 binding sites on the X- and Y-chromosome, we hypothesize that PHF13 mediates epigenetic changes on the sex chromosomes in spermatogonia, rendering the chromosomes competent for later inactivation.</p><p id="Par449">PHF13 is evolutionarily conserved down to Bilateria including sea urchin, acorn worm and several insects like the flour beetle (<italic>Tribolium</italic>), but strikingly not in the evolutionary “young” genus <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

Its correct regulation during pregnancy is crucial for embryonic development. The possible contribution of TL to the developmental capacity of embryos with abnormal karyotype remains unknown so far. Here, we studied TL in karyotypically normal and abnormal chorion in progressing pregnancies and embryonic losses. The chorionic villus samples were obtained by chorion biopsy from 15 patients with progressing first trimester pregnancy referred to invasive prenatal diagnosis and by curettage from 15 patients with missed abortion. The karyotypically abnormal samples included trisomy 21 and trisomy 16 cases in both progressing pregnancies (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and missed abortion (<italic>n</italic> = 7). The telomeric regions were detected on direct metaphase preparations by qFISH. Relative TLs were measured by dividing telomeric by subtelomeric fluorescence intensity assessed in ImageJ1.49v. The results were compared by the Mann-Whitney U-test. In progressing pregnancies, the relative TL was higher in karyotypically abnormal samples compared to karyotypically normal ones (p &lt; 0.0001). In missed abortions, we observed the same tendency although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.4652). When comparing the relative TL between the samples with normal karyotype in progressing pregnancies and missed abortions, we revealed no difference (p=0.8890). However, the relative TL was higher in the samples with abnormal karyotype in progressing pregnancies compared to those in missed abortions (p=0.0013). Our results suggest that in the case of karyotype abnormality, longer telomeres in chorionic villi may contribute to pregnancy success. Supported by RSF №19-75-00023.</p><p id="Par454"><bold>A.V.

Telomere shortening due to cell divisions, oxidative stress or genetic effects may result in end-to-end chromosome joining, their degradation, and cell death. In contrast to short telomeres in oocytes, sperm telomeres become longer with age. Telomere length (TL) correlates with embryo developmental potential advocating the importance of TL analysis after fertilization. The study was performed on metaphase chromosomes of 23 triploid human zygotes from 20 couples (women aged 32.04 ± 0.8; men aged 34.15 ± 1.2) referred for in vitro fertilization. Paternal (sperm-derived) chromosomes were identified immunocytochemically by weak DNA methylation and strong hydroxymethylation which contrasted them with strongly methylated and poorly hydroxymethylated maternal (oocyte-derived) chromosomes. After qFISH, relative TL was measured by dividing telomeric by subtelomeric fluorescence assessed in ImageJ1.49v. The relative TL was significantly higher in the paternal compared to the maternal chromosomes (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, р &lt; 0.0001). Rare zygotes demonstrated the opposite pattern: higher TL in the maternal chromosomes. However, they seem to be the exception rather than the rule suggesting that some cases of developmental arrest may be caused by altered TL pattern. Neither in sperm- nor in oocyte-derived chromosomes the relative TL correlated with paternal (r=-0.058;р=0.736) or maternal age (r=0.155;р=0.44), respectively. Thus, after fertilization, TL in paternal chromosomes is “reprogrammed”. Being hypomethylated, paternal chromosomes are prone to recombination and, thus, to alternative lengthening of telomeres, which may be part of developmental program and explains the absence of correlation of TL in sperm-derived chromosomes with paternal age.

Although they are distinct conditions, they are often considered together as they share a common etiology of inadequate placental perfusion. The aim of the work was to search for new genetic markers of GOS on the basis of integrative analysis of transcriptomic data. Genome-wide expression profiling was performed on placental tissue from preeclamptic and normal (<italic>n</italic> = 47) pregnancies. Thirty original datasets from patients with preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia (<italic>n</italic> = 434) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus and were further integrated and analyzed with our data. Subsequently, 5023 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between GOS patients and healthy women were identified. We found that the transcriptional activity of 64 DEGs changes in at least two GOS diseases. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified distinct gene modules associated with preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction or preeclampsia. Using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis we identified the significant role of disturbance of intercellular interactions and regulation of proteins modification in placental tissue during the development of the GOS. We applied upstream analysis approach implemented in geneXplain platform and identified master regulators (<italic>MECOM, CDC34, UBE2E1, UBE2D4, STAT3</italic> and <italic>UBE2R2</italic>) that are new therapeutic targets. These key genes may be potential biomarkers of diagnosis, therapy and prognosis for GOS.

It affects many body systems and is named for its main features: wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary anomalies and range of developmental delays. Children with WAGR syndrome present with aniridia, genito-urinary defects in the new born period and are at an increased risk for developing malignancies, varying range of intellectual disability and obesity in childhood. The syndrome is a contiguous gene deletion syndrome involving chromosome 11p13 containing <italic>WT1</italic> and <italic>PAX6</italic> genes.</p><p id="Par481"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We report a case of 29-year-old Asian (Indian ethnicity) primigravida with non-consanguineous marriage.

Previously, we performed a molecular genetic study of a large cohort of Russian patients with AN and found six <italic>PAX6</italic> nucleotide variants in 5ʹ-UTR. It is known that 5′-UTR variants could influence the translation efficiency and cause some diseases, but for AN such a mechanism has not been previously shown. Thus, to investigate the pathogenicity of 5′-UTR <italic>PAX6</italic> variants the functional studies are required.</p><p id="Par494"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> To study 5ʹ-UTR variants we generated luciferase constructs with full-length <italic>PAX6</italic> 5ʹ-UTR (wt and mutants).

Three of these variants also affect splicing.

Many genes exhibiting either non-syndromic or syndromic HL have also been identified as causing both, owing to extensive phenotypic manifestations in the form of pleiotropy. The gene <italic>COL11A1</italic> has long been associated with autosomal dominant Marshall syndrome and Stickler syndrome type II, as well as autosomal recessive fibrochondrogenesis. Each of these syndromes have overlapping phenotypes including skeletal abnormalities, dysmorphic features, variable cleft palate, ocular and auditory phenotypes that can include mild-to-moderate HL, and outer ear malformations. Recently, <italic>COL11A1</italic> has been associated with autosomal dominant non-syndromic HL (DFNA37) through the genetic analysis of a large European-American family presenting a novel splice-site altering variant.</p><p id="Par508"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> A proband from a four generation family with non-syndromic HL was ascertained.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular genetic cause in Czech patients with bilateral congenital or juvenile cataracts not associated with other ocular or systemic clinical findings.</p><p id="Par523"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Whole exome sequencing was performed in 10 probands of Czech origin. Variants with minor allele frequency less than 0.005 as per GnomAD v.2 were filtered and those located in genes known to be associated with cataract development as per Cat-Map database were given a priority for further evaluation.

In retinal photoreceptors (PRs), light sensation occurs in the outer segments (OSs), which represent highly specialized ciliary compartments. Consequently, retinal disease is a common manifestation in ciliopathy patients. Our efforts to elucidate the molecular functions of ciliopathy proteins rely on zebrafish mutants in genes associated with Joubert syndrome, an iconic ciliopathy associated with retinal disease in 25% of patients. We focus on genes that encode proteins participating in distinct ciliary complexes: Cc2d2a at the transition zone, representing the gate to the cilium, or Talpid3/KIAA0586 at the basal body (BB), anchoring the cilium in the cell. While both mutants display decreased visual function, we identify distinct ultra-structural phenotypes indicating specific roles for each protein in primary cilium function. We find that Cc2d2a organizes the vesicle fusion machinery at the periciliary margin and provides a docking point for incoming vesicles through a chain of interactions linking CC2D2A to NINL-MICAL3-RAB8. In contrast, Talpid3 is involved in BB docking and ciliogenesis upstream of Rab8a activation. Retina-specific transcriptomics identifies both shared and distinct effects on gene transcription: while transcription of phototransduction genes is decreased in both mutants, likely as a secondary effect, we observe downregulation of the BBSome, a multi-protein complex associated with the ciliopathy Bardet-Biedl syndrome, only in <italic>talpid3</italic> mutants, while Nek8 is upregulated only in <italic>cc2d2a</italic> mutants. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate how mutations in genes causing the same human disorder result in similar phenotypes through distinct mechanisms.</p><p id="Par531"><bold>M.

However, only 25-60% of patients receive genetic diagnoses. Structural variants are an important source of genetic variation, and have led to the identification of numerous eye development genes, including <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>OTX2</italic>. However, few studies systematically address their contribution to AMC. Here, we investigate a large cohort of AMC families for known and novel copy number variants (CNVs).</p><p id="Par535"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> A cohort of 320 unrelated probands was screened using either diagnostic genome-wide aCGH platforms (<italic>n</italic> = 156), including the customised OGT CytoSure 4x180K eye array, or the Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array (<italic>n</italic> = 164). SNP data were analysed using the algorithms QuantiSNP and PennCNV. Variants of interest were validated using qPCR and long-range PCR.</p><p id="Par536"><bold>Results:</bold> Our analysis identified multiple variants of interest, including likely pathogenic CNVs affecting known AMC genes and rare CNVs highlighting new candidates. We describe a novel homozygous 113kb deletion 19kb upstream of <italic>MAB21L2</italic>, a developmental gene involved in eye morphogenesis. This deletion removes multiple conserved cis-regulatory elements. We also identified deletions in regions with recurrent CNVs (1q21.1, 6q16, 10q11, 16p11.2, 22q11.2).</p><p id="Par537"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study supports the importance of CNV screening in routine diagnostic testing. It also highlights how CNVs affecting noncoding elements can provide insights into the role of regulatory regions of eye development genes in AMC. Further investigation of such variants will improve the genetic diagnostic yield and our understanding of the aetiology of these conditions.</p><p id="Par538"><bold>F. Ceroni:</bold> None. <bold>D.A.

It is characterized by a wide variety of clinical features that includes a typical facial dysmorphism, hypotonia, neutropenia, microcephaly, intellectual disability and severe visual impairments. In their early childhood, CS patients already suffer from myopia and a retinal dystrophy that affects both peripheral and central vision. In addition, long-term outcome studies showed that cataract reaches a high prevalence in adults with CS in their forties. To understand how <italic>VPS13B</italic> variants lead to these visual impairments and have the possibility to assess therapeutic approaches, we generated the <italic>Vps13b</italic><sup><italic>∆Ex3/∆Ex3</italic></sup> mouse model. Cataract was almost systematic in 2-month-old animals. Eye fundi appeared normal until cataract development, but OCT, ERG and histological data suggest that rod homeostasis may be affected in the few <italic>Vps13b</italic><sup><italic>∆Ex3/∆Ex3</italic></sup> mice without cataract after 5 months of age. Immunostaining of the lens revealed that cataract formation was associated with the appearance of large vacuoles in the cortical area, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and fibrosis. In later stages, cataracts became hypermature, lens capsules ruptured, and sclerotic nuclear parts dissociated. Altogether, our results show that Vps13b has a function in lens homeostasis in mice and that the <italic>Vps13b</italic><sup><italic>∆Ex3/∆Ex3</italic></sup> mouse line is a useful model to study the pathomechanism leading to CS-related cataract.

We identified a heterozygous mutation, c.346G&gt;C (p.G116R), in the gene for cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein 1 (<italic>RLBP1</italic>), already described in a pedigree affected by autosomal-recessive FA. All other genetic variants detected in the patient’s DNA were excluded after applying commonly used filtering criteria.

Since HHL is related to more than 150 target genes, we designed a diagnosis strategy in order to identify pathogenic variants. A total of 1250 patients were analyzed for frequent mutations in <italic>GJB2</italic> and <italic>GJB6</italic> genes by Sanger Sequencing, genotyping 25% of them. From undiagnosed patients, 29 families were selected to perform Whole exome sequencing. After filtering and analysis process, 45% of patients were genotyped, identifying 23 causative mutations (11 novel, 12 reported) classified according to ACMG Standards. Some of the novel variants were further studied <italic>in silico</italic> by structural and stability studies of the mutated proteins. In addition, datasets from deafness and specific variant databases were correlated with different protein motifs in order to predict the theoretical pathogenicity effect of the aminoacid changes. Furthermore, knock-down phenotype rescue assays in zebrafish are underway to accomplish in vivo validation. In some cases, extensive analysis reinforced the pathogenicity prediction effect of variants and surprisingly, in one case, discouraged the deleterious effect of a genetic variant to the protein. Preliminary results in zebrafish confirmed the pathogenicity of one novel variant in the hair cell function and auditory system. This study shows that our algorithm is successful for the genetic diagnosis of deafness. Comprehensive analysis is crucial to strengthen prediction of variant pathogenicity.

Causative variants were identified in 33 patients and in 39% (13/33) of them they were inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

In children with no family history of HL, the possibility of identifying causative variants inherited in both autosomal recessive and dominant manner should be taken into account. In patients with an unknown genetic cause of HL, the tested area should be expanded with whole genome analysis. Supported by NCN grant: 2017/27/N/NZ5/02369</p><p id="Par607"><bold>D.

Genetic diagnosis is highly important for HL/HD patients in order to ensure the etiology of the condition and counsel the patients properly. In this study, 41 patients (22M/19F) who admitted to our clinic between February 2018 and November 2019 with HL/HD were screened for 110 genes related with syndromic/non-syndromic HL/HD. NGS is considered to be the best practice for diagnosis. Large gene panels also can evaluate non-prevelant genes and candidate variants specific to populations. All exons and exon-intron boundaries were amplifed by using Clinical Exome (Sophia Genetics) Solution (CES) kit in MiSeq NGS instrument. Variant analyis (SNV, Indel and CNV) and annotations were performed by Sophia DDM platform, classified according to ACMG criteria with in-silico tools and also investigated by HGMD Professional 2019-4 and other available online bioinformatic tools. We identified CNV in three patients, 26 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in 19 of 41 HL/HD patients (46 %) in 10 different genes. Similarly, 23 variants of uncertain significance are determined in 18 of 41 HL/HD patients (43 %) in 18 distinct genes. Besides these variations, we found 31 novel variations that are not reported before in literature or databases. Our study affirms that genetic screening of patients with HL by using CES panel not only easily diagnoses but also help counseling the patients and their family for their future risk of developing the disease.</p><p id="Par611"><bold>S.G.

The genetic landscape of non-syndromic HL includes over 100 genes. In aggregate, these genes harbor several thousand causally implicated variants. The observation of recurrent variants raises the question about whether variants arose from a single ancestral allele or were the result of independent mutational events. In our study that includes 150 Iranian probands, we identified 15 families with recurrent likely pathogenic variants in the genes <italic>SMPX</italic>, <italic>SLC26A4</italic>, <italic>TECTA</italic> and <italic>TMIE</italic>.</p><p id="Par650"><bold>Methods:</bold> DNA samples from index patients were exome sequenced following Illumina exome protocols. Libraries were sequenced with a NextSeq500 benchtop sequencer. Variant and copy number variation analysis were performed using GensearchNGS and an in-house exome analysis pipeline.

Haplotype reconstruction allowed comparison across families.</p><p id="Par651"><bold>Results:</bold> Haplotype analysis of the c.99del variant in <italic>SMPX</italic> that was identified in three Iranian families suggested a common descent.

The use of high-throughput genome technologies has made great strides in the discovery of new alleles/genes identification. Here, 714 deeply clinically characterized patients were screened with a Targeted Re-Sequencing (TRS) panel of 96 deafness genes and, in negative cases, SNP-arrays were applied. Afterwards, families negative to both approaches were analysed by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) for new candidates identification. TRS and SNP-arrays characterized ~28% of the HL cases (42% familial and 20% sporadic cases) highlighting <italic>STRC</italic> and <italic>TECTA</italic> as the second major players in the Italian population after <italic>GJB2</italic>. Then, WES allowed the identification of five new HHL genes, two of them (<italic>SLC12A2</italic> and <italic>USP48</italic>) just identified. As regards <italic>SLC12A</italic>2, a heterozygous missense variation (NM_001046.2, exon25, c.3431C&gt;A, p.(T1144N)) has been identified in a three-generation HHL family. The variant is predicted as deleterious by several bioinformatic prediction tools and is not reported in any public database.

Moreover, to better evaluate the pathogenic effect of the identified variant, an <italic>in silico</italic> protein modelling has been performed suggesting that the substitution identified might alter the correct folding of the protein. Thanks to this approach ~35% (60% familial cases and 20% sporadic ones) of cases have been characterized confirming the large mutation’s spectrum of HHL, and the importance of an accurate clinical diagnosis.</p><p id="Par657"><bold>A.

Any disruption in this regulation during the eye organogenesis can lead to ocular malformations such as Microphthalmia- Anophthalmia-Coloboma (MAC). These diseases are very clinically and genetically heterogeneous conditions with overlapping phenotypes; consequently the mutational load is not well known and the genotype-phenotype correlations can be difficult to define. Our aim was to perform a comprehensive molecular screening in a cohort of Spanish patients with ocular malformations using different approaches of next-generation sequencing (NGS). We have findings in around 52% of the patients. One-third carried likely causal mutations, 8% were partially characterized and 8% had VUS. Different casual mutations were found and the most prevalent in our cohort are transcription factors such as OTX2, SOX2, VSX2 and PAX6. In contrast, others variants have expanded the phenotypic spectrum of some genes classically associated with other phenotypes such as GJA8, KERA, or the lens crystallins family genes suggesting new roles of them in the early development of the eye. This results show that not only NGS is efficient for the genetic analysis of ocular malformations but also for achieving new candidate genes. Therefore, we have update our gene panels resulting in an increase in our diagnostic yield. In contrast, 34% of patients remain uncharacterized, mostly unilateral or non-syndromic cases. So that, our future purposes are to understand the mechanisms involved in this disease by identifying novel genetic causes and exploring their functional role.</p><p id="Par699"><bold>A.

We report 12 cases in 7 families. The phenotype is of intense itch in early childhood, which causes mutilating self-injury by scratching. The intense itch is localised only to the midface and no other body parts; is not associated with altered sweating; it spontaneously subsides by 4-6 years; cognition and pain sensing is normal; there is no excess of Staph Aureus infections (on the face or elsewhere). Inheritance appeared recessive, as parents were unaffected, males and females were equally affected, and most cases were consanguineous. Older individuals “grow out” of the condition, facial injuries heal, and have normal whole-body itch and pain sensing. In six of seven families, we found the same mutation in affected individuals - a homozygous poly-Alanine repeat expansion from the normal range (7-13) to 18. Parents were always carriers. This was also found in a non-Asian, Caucasian, non-consanguineous family. In the seventh family, we found only a heterozygous 7 base pair deletion in PRDM12, but no second mutation. What is extraordinary is that a PRDM12 homozygous 19 poly-Alanine repeat expansion causes Congenital Insensitivity to Pain; which is not associated with excess itch, leads to self-inflicted lip, tongue and corneal damage, and always cause excess S. Aureus infections. No other poly-alanine tract expansion disease has two phenotypes. We present our cellular studies to try and understand the disease mechanism whereby a single additional alanine can cause such different phenotypes.</p><p id="Par711"><bold>N.

The aim of this study was to identify presbycusis causative genes by whole exome sequencing (WES).</p><p id="Par748"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We analysed 105 families, 122 simplex cases and 120 normal-hearing controls. After an in silico bioinformatic analysis to select predicted pathogenic variants, and according to the autosomal dominant mode of inheritance in 95% of the families, we studied very rare heterozygous variants (allele frequency : AF≤0.0001).</p><p id="Par749"><bold>Results:</bold> We found a significative higher ratio of pathogenic variants in autosomal dominant deafness genes carried by 24.7% of mARHL and 21,8% of sARHL (aside from three individuals carrying GJB2 biallelic variants) than in the controls (6,7%) (p &lt; 0,001). By studing a mouse model <italic>Tmc1</italic><sup><italic>N321I</italic></sup>, we confirmed the pathogenicity of the mutation leading to congenital moderate hearing loss in homozygous mice due to a reduced mechanotransduction current amplitude, and to a progressive hearing loss beginning at 7 months and affecting the high frequencies in heterozygous carriers, validating also the mutation as responsible for a monogenic form of presbycusis.</p><p id="Par750"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> WES unraveled that a large proportion of severe presbycusis is due to new mutations in autosomal dominant deafness genes arguing for a genetic continuum between early-onset deafness and presbycusis. We demonstrated also the existence of monogenic forms of presbycusis that could be targetted by new personnalized therapies like gene therapy.

HGSNAT (heparan-α-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase) sequence variants cause mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIC (MPS-IIIC) or Sanfilippo C syndrome - a severe childhood-onset lysosomal storage disorder. Specific genotypes have, however, been associated with isolated retinal disease in a few reported individuals, thereby further extending the genes that can result in both syndromic and non-syndromic IRD. We have identified likely pathogenic variants in 13 individuals (11 families) with late onset (30s to 60s) and slowly progressing RP. None showed any other symptoms of MPS-IIIC. 7/11 families were compound heterozygotes with the allele c.1843G&gt;A, p.(Ala615Thr). We detected 6 novel sequence variants (p.(Ser296Leu); p.(Phe428Cys); p.(Gly248Ala); p.(Gly418Arg), c.1543-2A&gt;C; c.1708delA), and 5 variants that were previously described in MPS-IIIC patients. In one family, two siblings, genetically identical for the HGSNAT locus, were discordant for retinal disease. A mild but significant reduction of HGSNAT enzyme activity in leukocytes was observed in affected individuals but urinary glucosaminoglycans were not elevated. This case series expands the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of non-syndromic HGSNAT-associated retinopathy, and in one family suggests the influence of <italic>trans</italic>-acting modifying factors.

To date, more than 80 genetic forms of RP are described. Here we perform genetic analysis of the two-generation family with 5 affected members with the terminal severe stage of RP. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of one of the patients revealed two candidate variants. The first one is pathogenic variant in the exon 16 of <italic>SNRNP200</italic> gene (chr2:96958829G&gt;A), leading to the missense substitution (p.Arg681Cys, NM_014014.4) in the heterozygous state.

The second variant is a novel single nucleotide variant in exon 1 of the <italic>PRPH2</italic> gene (chr6:42689991C&gt;T) resulting in the missense substitution (p.Val28Met, NM_000322.4) in a heterozygous state.

Patients with biallelic missense variants in <italic>RCBTB1</italic> display diverse IRD phenotypes such as retinitis pigmentosa. Here, we tested the hypothesis that RCBTB1 is involved in NRF2-regulated protection against reactive oxygen species in the eye, more specifically in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE).</p><p id="Par807"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> A <italic>Xenopus tropicalis rcbtb1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> knockout (KO) was generated using CRISPR/Cas9 editing.

Most mutations take place in <italic>PKD1</italic>. Its molecular diagnosis is a challenge by the high allelic heterogeneity and overlap of pseudogenes between 1-32 exons. So far, there are few data on <italic>PKD1</italic>/<italic>PKD2</italic> variants in the Spanish population. The main objective of this study has been to establish and know the mutations in ADPKD in our cohort. Mutational analysis of both PKD1 and PKD2 was performed on 158 unrelated families, by NGS using a custom exon-target panel from inherited nephropathies, Nephroseq®. To confirm SNVs, Long-Range-PCR and Sanger sequencing were performed on <italic>PKD1</italic> or PCR, and Sanger sequencing for <italic>PKD2</italic>. In addition, MLPA was used to rule out CNVs. SNVs were identified in 122 families (77.23%): 96 families in <italic>PKD1</italic> (78.7%) and 26 families in <italic>PKD2</italic> (22.3%). Globally: 64 frameshift and nonsense; 11 splicing, 36 missense, 8 in frame ins/del, and 4 large-deletions). Overall, 15% of variants were de novo and 50% were not previously described. This study demonstrates that NGS is a cost-effective experimental approach for simultaneous analysis of the <italic>PKD1</italic> and <italic>PKD2</italic>. The analysis of mutations in the ADPKD-Spanish population expands the understanding of the genetic diversity of the different ethnic groups, enriches the databases with the new mutations, and contributes to their genetic counselling.

Renal magnesium handling plays an important role in maintaining magnesium homeostasis, however the exact biological mechanisms remain unclear. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified an association between urinary magnesium concentration (uMg) and variants in the ARL15 gene on chromosome 5. ARL15 encodes a GTP-binding protein that regulates the magnesium transporter channel TRPM6, and other proteins involved in magnesium homeostasis in physiologically relevant cell lines. We conducted meta-analyses for urinary magnesium in 11, 617 individuals from Scottish and Croatian populations to determine possible genes involved in these traits. Mass spectrometry analysis was conducted to determine interactors of Arl15 and in-vitro knockout models of Arl15 was established using CRISPR-Cas9. The top SNP associated with uMg in our meta-analyses lies within a transcription factor binding site in an enhancer region of ARL15. Individuals homozygous for the alternate allele of rs35931 has lower urinary magnesium levels compared to individuals with the homozygous reference allele. Arl15 interacts with magnesium transporters within the distal convoluted tubule segment of the kidneys. Furthermore, we find that homozygous deletion of Arl15 is lethal at the organismal level. We hypothesise that the variant found affects the expression of ARL15, which, in turn modulates magnesium transport by regulating magnesium transporters. We are performing further functional studies to elucidate the role ARL15 plays in magnesium homeostasis both in vitro and in vivo.</p><p id="Par827"><bold>C.B. Joseph:</bold> None. <bold>C.M.

Here we report the first case of blood chimerism in MCDZT detected as an additional finding at molecular genetic testing. Dizygotic twin brothers were born to a female couple after assisted reproduction (IVF, in vitro fertilization). One presented with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus. Molecular genetic analysis identified a heterozygous pathogenic variant within the insulin gene (<italic>INS</italic>, dominant inheritance). Interestingly, the donor of the oocytes for IVF had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as an infant.

In January 2020, an international collaboration reported association of functionally deficient variants in the <italic>TRPV6</italic> gene with CP, identifying a novel mechanism of pancreatitis due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> dysregulation. This discovery was made essentially by analyzing young patients with idiopathic CP. Whether <italic>TRPV6</italic> variants are responsible for autosomal dominantly inherited CP remains unknown. Herein, we analyzed the <italic>TRPV6</italic> gene in probands of 235 such families by NGS. All families had at least two affected members and had remained genetically unexplained prior to the current analysis. We identified 11 ultra-rare variants (all were absent in 570 French controls and had an allele frequency of 0-0.000008 in gnomAD) in 11 families. Of the 11 variants, 5 were previously reported to be pathogenic. All the remaining six variants were novel, comprising a clear loss-of-function variant, a single amino acid deletion variant, and four missense variants. All these four missense variants were predicted to be of pathogenic relevance by Polyphen and/or SIFT and had a CADD score comparable to known pathogenic missense variants. In summary, we identified ultra-rare <italic>TRPV6</italic> variants in ~5% of the studied families. This establishes <italic>TRPV6</italic> as a relatively frequent autosomal dominant CP gene for which genetic testing is warranted. Our results also suggest that haploinsufficiency of the <italic>TRPV6</italic> gene is sufficient to cause CP. (Work supported by INSERM).</p><p id="Par835"><bold>E. Masson:</bold> None. <bold>J.M.

Normally, increasing CO<sub>2</sub> blood levels induce the hypercapnic reflex which accelerates breathing via specialized neurons of the pre-Bötzinger complex in the ventral hindbrain. Polyalanine expansions in <italic>PHOX2B</italic> and rarely other genes have been described to cause genetic forms of CCHS by disturbing the breathing reflex. Recently, a homozygous mutation in the homeodomain transcription factor <italic>LBX1</italic> was reported in two brothers with neonatal hypoventilation and complex autonomic symptoms. The mutation affects the C-terminus of the protein and impairs cooperativity with PHOX2B, without disrupting the DNA-binding domain. We here report a female patient with severe hypoventilation who required continuous mechanical ventilation immediately after birth. During her first 11 years of life she was supplied with a tracheostomy and mask ventilation at night because of episodes of apnea. In childhood, she had severe constipation and, developed a paralytic ileus like Hirschsprung disease. Since the age of 11 she used a respiratory mask for sleeping and showed normocapnia. With consequent breathing control starting immediately after birth the now 23 years old woman developed excellently and completes a university education.

Newborn screening for CF was introduced in the Russian Federation in 2006. The incidence of CF varies among different regions, in Sverdlovsk region it is 1: 9,500. The vast majority of recurrent <italic>CFTR</italic> variants are point mutations, but several populations have larger deletions and duplications, involving one or more complete exons. Here we want to report a case of CF with simultaneously existing deletion and duplication of different regions of 11 exon <italic>CFTR</italic>.</p><p id="Par843"><bold>Case presentation:</bold> The patient (a 1-month-old girl) was born at term to non-consanguineous parents. For newborn’s diagnostics CF we use a three-step IRT/IRT1↑/DNA algorithm. Our patient had elevated levels of immunoreactive trypsinogen both times (328.6 ng/ml and 299.8 ng/ml respectively). Moreover, the girl had pathological sweat chlorides - 110 mmol/L.</p><p id="Par844"><bold>Results:</bold> The trio genetic sequencing of the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene showed heterozygous delF508 mutation in exon 11 for the child and her father. For searching another variant we were done Multiplex Ligation-mediated Probe Amplification (MLPA) of the <italic>CFTR</italic> gene. We have found heterozygous deletion of exon 9 for the girl and her mother and have proved the deletion F508 for father, but this analysis has shown also duplication of exon 11 and 2 copies F508 for proband.</p><p id="Par845"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We assume the proband has 3 copies of exon 11: two normal and one with del508F, and it is the defect copy, that is crucial for protein synthesis.</p><p id="Par846"><bold>S.

In all cases, genotyping was done by Sanger sequencing for the detection of common mutations and was followed by next-generation sequencing for the identification of uncommon mutations.</p><p id="Par851"><bold>Results:</bold> From an overall of 47 cases, the most common mutation was p.Phe508del with an allelic frequency of 46.9%, which is compatible with its northwest-to-southeast decreasing frequency gradient in Europe. Most mutations were classified as CFTR protein processing (class II, 50%) or conductance (class IV, 12.3%) defects. Multiple mutations were detected in 3 cases. Seven patients with mild clinical manifestations, mostly presenting with dehydration and/or electrolyte imbalance, carried p.Leu346Pro (7.1%), a class IV mutation detected solely in individuals of Cypriot descent. A novel case of a patient homozygous for the CFTRdup2 mutation was associated with a severe phenotype with hepatic involvement, biliary cirrhosis and eventually hepatic failure leading to death.</p><p id="Par852"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The small population of cystic fibrosis patients in Cyprus follows the regional genotypic trends, although several cases bear unique mutational profiles, which contribute to the wide genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of the disease.</p><p id="Par853"><bold>A.

Thus, the clinical diagnosis is often difficult to be made. The aim of our study was to test the ability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) to improve the diagnosis precision in a heterogeneous group of children with clinically suspected cystic kidney diseases.</p><p id="Par864"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Next-generation sequencing of genes responsible for the formation of cystic kidneys was performed in 32 unrelated patients with various clinically diagnosed cystic kidney diseases without a definitive genetic diagnosis.</p><p id="Par865"><bold>Results:</bold> The underlying pathogenic variants were detected in 69% of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 22). The result of NGS correlated with the clinical diagnosis made before the NGS in 53% of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 17), in the remaining 15 children (47%) the result of NGS revealed another type of cystic kidney disease than clinically suspected or did not find any causal mutation. The most common unexpected findings were variants in nephronophthisis (NPHP) genes in children with clinically suspected autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (<italic>n</italic> = 4). Overall, we found 25 (probably) pathogenic variants in the PKHD1 gene, 8 variants in the TMEM67 gene, 4 variants in the PKD1 gene, 2 variants in the HNF1B gene and 2 variants in BBS1 and NPHP1 genes, respectively.</p><p id="Par866"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> NGS is a valuable tool in the diagnostics of various forms of cystic kidney diseases.

The detection of current T2DM diagnostic markers is generally late and occurs when displaying metabolic imbalance thus, novel biomarkers that could be useful as a new tool for predicting the progression from prediabetes to T2DM are needed. The goal of this study was to conduct a baseline comparison of serum-circulating miRNA in prediabetic individuals with distinction between those who later progressed to T2DM and those who did not.</p><p id="Par872"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> The study group was divided – patients with newly diagnosed T2DM over 5 year observational period (<italic>n</italic> = 18) and control group (<italic>n</italic> = 12) with no known history of dysglycemia. The expression level of 798 miRNAs in serum samples using the NanoString technology was examined.</p><p id="Par873"><bold>Results:</bold> The study revealed that 18 miRNAs were deregulated in serum samples of patients who developed T2DM after 5 years versus non T2DM patients. Pathway analysis showed that miRNA target genes were mainly significantly enriched in homeostasis, neuronal signaling, protein complex oligomerization and core matrisome. ROC analysis demonstrated that miR-491-5p, miR-1307-3p, miR-298 and miR-1290 can be introduced as a diagnostic tool for the prediction of T2DM (AUC=0.940; 0.894; 0.877; 0.722, respectively).</p><p id="Par874"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results suggest that circulating miRNAs could potentially be used as predictive biomarkers of T2DM in prediabetic patients.</p><p id="Par875"><bold>I.

Tumor development follows Knudson’s two-hit model involving the gene <italic>DICER1</italic> located on chromosome 14q32.13. Predisposing germline pathogenic variants (first hit) are mainly small loss-of-function mutations. Tumor-related driver mutations are specific hot-spot missense mutations <italic>in trans</italic> (second hit) located in the RNAse IIIb domain of the DICER1 protein.</p><p id="Par879"><bold>Patients:</bold> We report on a female child with cystic nephroma of the right kidney and developmental delay at age 1 year. Facial features included frontal bossing, flat nasal bridge, hypertelorism and small mouth with thin lips. Body measurements were unremarkable.

A number of plasma proteins have been found to be associated with renal phenotypes, but prior studies have been limited by smaller sample sizes and fewer proteins. Moreover, the causal mechanisms underlying these associations have not been investigated.</p><p id="Par900"><bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted the largest observational study of plasma proteins and renal function in terms of sample size (up to N=5,285 across four studies: KORA, INTERVAL, HUNT, QMDiab) and number of proteins (k=1,100). Associations with eGFR and chronic kidney disease (CKD) were tested using regression models in a trans-ethnic discovery-replication approach. We further examined the causal nature of these associations using two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization.</p><p id="Par901"><bold>Results:</bold> 57 proteins were found to be consistently associated with eGFR in population samples of European and admixed ancestry; of these, 18 were associated with CKD. Many well-known biomarkers of renal function (e.g. cystatin-C) were identified, as were JAM-B and contactin-4 as novel biomarkers. The strongest evidence of causality was observed in the positive effect of eGFR on testican-2 (p=2.84E-04), a finding consistent with the biological role of testican-2 in glomeruli remodeling and kidney injury repair.</p><p id="Par902"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study uncovers novel plasma proteomic biomarkers for renal function and presents evidence for selected causal relationships. Plasma levels of testican-2 are reflective of mechanisms underlying progressive renal function loss, thus suggesting its applicability as a biomarker of early renal dysfunction and disease progression in the general population.</p><p id="Par903"><bold>P.R.

Approximately 18% of patients have additional anatomical malformations or associated neurodevelopmental disorders (HSCR-complex). We hypothesized that genes affected by rare Copy Number Variants contribute to disease development in “HSCR-complex” patients. Indeed, we could confirm that Copy Number (CN) losses (<italic>n</italic> = 11) are enriched in these patients (<italic>n</italic> = 23), if no other causal variant was identified (p=3.64E<sup>−7</sup>). At least five patients had a large de novo CNV (3 losses, 2 gains). The identified rare CN losses are enriched for variant intolerant genes, overexpressed in the developing mouse enteric nervous system (p=1.760E-10): <italic>SLC8A1</italic>, <italic>GNL1</italic>, <italic>GABBR1</italic>, <italic>MAPK8</italic>, <italic>UFD1L</italic>, <italic>AKT3</italic>, <italic>TBX2</italic>, <italic>USP32</italic> and <italic>TUBB</italic>. Additionally, a loss of function variant in <italic>TUBB</italic> was identified in a HSCR patient without a deleterious CNV, and <italic>AKT3</italic> as well as <italic>UFD1L</italic> are impacted by CN losses in other patients. The contribution of the known HSCR predisposing risk haplotypes was comparable between patients with a pathogenic coding variant and controls (P=0.826). All other HSCR subgroups differed significantly with controls and between each subgroup (P=0.02 or lower), patients with isolated HSCR and without a <italic>RET</italic> coding variant had the highest burden, unaffected controls the lowest. Our zebrafish model reveals that disruption of six of these 9 genes - alone or via epistasis with <italic>ret-</italic> results in a HSCR phenotype. This confirms the epistatic effect of losing a copy of a gene regulating enteric nervous system development with the predisposed downregulation of <italic>RET</italic> expression.</p><p id="Par914"><bold>L.

However, not all <italic>BMPR2</italic> mutation carriers develop the disease, highlighting the presence of reduced penetrance. In order to identify genomic regions that could be contributing to incomplete penetrance, high-throughput genotyping arrays and next generation sequencing were conducted in an hPAH family. The family comprises 65 Spanish individuals spanning five different generations. One <italic>BMPR2</italic> mutation (c.1472G&gt; A; p.Arg491Gln) was identified in 22 members, but only 9 of them developed the disease. The SNP arrays analysis was performed in 33 family members and we identified a genomic region in 2q24.3, located at 38 Mb from the <italic>BMPR2</italic> gene, which could contribute to increase the susceptibility of pulmonary hypertension in mutation carriers (Puigdevall et al., J Med Genet, 2019). Several genetic association studies have identified variants in this region associated with phenotypes involved in cardiovascular pathology, such as hypertension or ischemic cardiomyopathy, which could be related to some of the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension. In order to identify the specific variant/s that may act as genetic modifiers of hPAH within the candidate region, we have performed whole-genome sequencing in 16 <italic>BMPR2</italic> mutation carriers: 6 affected individuals and 7 asymptomatic carriers. The identification of a possible genetic modifier in this family will allow us to advance in our understanding of reduced penetrance in hPAH.</p><p id="Par927">Acknowledgments: ISCIIII (PI15/00483), ‘fondos FEDER’, Agència de Gestió d’Ajuts Universitaris i de Recerca (2017SGR1134), “CERCA Programme / Generalitat de Catalunya”</p><p id="Par928"><bold>I.

We performed targeted NGS of 15 genes and MLPA on 118 patients recruited by nephrology or diabetology units. 19 index cases showed molecular defects in HNF1B gene (10 pediatric and 9 adult). Six patients carried a likely pathogenic novel variant (p.G83D p.R295C, c.-67C&gt;T, c.1207-1G&gt;A, p.S379*, p.Q484Sfs*22) and 4 a VUS (p.G76C, p.E105K, p.A453T, p.M532V). A functional analysis for c.-67C&gt;T indicated reduced activity in Caco2 and Mcf7 cells. Nine cases showed the whole HNF1B gene deletion (de novo in five patients). The median age of diagnosis was 19 (SNVs) and 6 (deletion) years old, respectively. Clinical presentation included earlier onset in deleted patients (median 6 vs 19 years) and different spatial cysts localization (cortical for SNVs and medullary in at least 3 deleted cases). Diabetes was present in six patients only, possibly due to the young age of many cases involved. Two patients with urogenital malformation and 3 with cholestasis were identified. A 21-year-old woman had mild developmental delay: additional array-CGH was performed and a large (1.3 Mb) deletion was found. Contrary, a 29-years-old man homozygous for p.G83D did not show intellectual disability. In conclusion, the patients with SNVs developed a milder phenotype than those deleted, and the molecular defects were frequently of de novo origin. We confirm the wide phenotypic heterogeneity of HNF1B-related disorders and we point out that liver disease can be a major complication.</p><p id="Par932"><bold>C.P. Cristalli:</bold> None. <bold>A.

The contribution of common genetic variants to familial aggregation in multiple-affected IBD families, however, remains unclear. We included 54 multiple-affected families (≥ 3 first-degree relatives affected), including 189 affected (IBD), and 133 unaffected first-degree relatives; as well as 1768 sporadic cases and 868 unrelated non-IBD controls. For all individuals, Immunochip genotypes were available. Weighted polygenic risk scores (PRS) were calculated using PRSice-2.0 across different <italic>p</italic>-value thresholds (pTs), and compared between groups. The association between PRS and familial IBD was further evaluated in age- and sex-adjusted generalized mixed regression models including family id as random effect. Using pT=0.05, the affected relatives had a higher PRS than unaffected relatives (P=1.0x10<sup>−02</sup>), sporadic cases (P=4.6x10<sup>−02</sup>), and non-IBD controls (P &lt; 2.2x10<sup>−16</sup>). The risk of IBD in families increased by 1.23-fold for every incremental standard deviation in PRS. However, the proportion of the explained variance between affected and unaffected family members was smaller than that between sporadic IBD and non-IBD controls (5% versus 17%, respectively). Of note, in familial IBD, variance explained by the PRS dropped dramatically for pT&gt;0.01. A plausible hypothesis is that while familial cases differ from sporadic cases in low-risk (high <italic>p</italic>-value) variants, familial cases differ from their unaffected relatives mostly in high-risk (low <italic>p</italic>-value) variants. Higher PRS increases the risk for familial IBD as it does for sporadic IBD. The proportion of the explained variance in families however is limited, because of shared genetic background between family members. BIRD Grant</p><p id="Par936"><bold>H. Lee:</bold> None. <bold>L.

Severity is variable, from benign idiopathic neonatal hepatitis to intrahepatic cholestasis leading to liver failure and transplant. There are several genes described for different genetic diseases that lead to cholestasis. <italic>USP53</italic> has been recently suggested as a candidate gene for paediatric intrahepatic cholestasis based on one family with two affected siblings. Interestingly, <italic>USP53</italic> interacts with tight junction protein 2 (<italic>TJP2</italic>) for which pathogenic variants are known to cause progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis. To date, the <italic>USP53</italic> gene has not been linked to an OMIM phenotype. By combining exome/genome sequencing and mining our in-house variant database we identified five patients from unrelated families. All affected individuals display a similar phenotype, mainly including early onset intrahepatic cholestasis. Moreover, one family showed hearing loss as an additional phenotype. All patients were homozygotes for different loss-of-function variants in the <italic>USP53</italic> gene. <italic>USP53</italic> (ubiquitin specific peptidase 53) is a tight junction-associated protein that is known to involve in the survival of auditory hair cells and hearing. Our results confirm <italic>USP53</italic> as a novel gene for autosomal recessive intrahepatic cholestasis. Additionally, we demonstrate that combined exome/genome sequencing and variant database mining is an effective approach to discover and confirm novel genes related to human diseases.

We also assessed their functional relevance by gene reporter assays, <italic>in silico</italic> analysis and comparative expression studies. In addition, we correlated detected SNPs with expression data and IBS symptoms.</p><p id="Par945"><bold>Results:</bold> Detected SNPs were linked in different haplotypes and the tagging SNP rs2020938 associated with female IBS with constipation (IBS-C) in a discovery sample comprising 287 individuals. Subsequent validation and meta-analysis of rs2020938 in 2175 IBS patients and 6128 controls from eight countries confirmed the association with female IBS-C. Expression data obtained from different intestinal regions showed that the alternative promoter drives SERT expression primarily in the small intestine. Additionally, gene reporter assays pointed to a functional impact of the SNPs within this region. In silico analyses indicated differential expression regulation by transcription factors that have previously been implicated in GI disorders. Further follow up in tissue samples and clinical data from IBS patients and controls revealed that rs2020938 correlates with differential expression in the jejunum and stool consistency.</p><p id="Par946"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results indicate differential expression regulation driven by a functionally relevant polymorphic promoter in female IBS-C and consolidates the importance of <italic>SLC6A4</italic> in IBS pathogenesis.</p><p id="Par947"><bold>S.

Genomic copy number variations (CNVs) have been previously described as a cause of congenital anomalies of the kidneys and the urinary tract.</p><p id="Par959"><bold>Used Methods:</bold> Array-based molecular karyotyping was performed in 152 LUTO patients. Raw intensity data were collected for all persons and CNVs were called with CNVPartition, QuantiSNP and PennCNV. Using PLINK version 1.07 and Excel the CNVs, identified in the patients, were compared to CNVs of 4168 controls. Overlapping CNVs between both groups were discarded. Further filtering steps were used.</p><p id="Par960"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 30 potential disease causing CNVs: 8 deletions and 22 duplications.

Herein, we report a patient who fulfilled this criterion establishing LSR deficiency as a novel cause of human liver disease. The proband was a 5-year-old female patient. At 5 months of age, the infant developed severe and uncontrollable itching. The results of blood examination at 9 months of age showed elevated serum AST, ALT and TBA. Her verbal milestones were slightly delayed. A needle biopsy of the liver at 5 years of age showed paucity of interlobular bile duct. At 6 years of age, whole-exome analysis of the samples from the patient and her parents was performed. The de novo non-synonymous variant (c.602C&gt;T) and the maternally derived heterozygous frameshift variant (c.1396dup) were detected in the LSR gene. Immunohistochemical staining using anti-LSR antibodies showed absent expression of LSR at the tricellular tight junctions in the patient.

The sonic hedgehog (<italic>SHH</italic>) signaling pathway is one of the main regulators of lung development during embryogenesis and mutations in <italic>SHH</italic>-related genes can lead to lung malformation. Here we report on three fetuses from one family with severe malformation of the respiratory system. By ultrasound screening and autopsy after termination, a complete bilateral lung agenesis and near-complete agenesis of the tracheae was observed in all fetuses. Using a combination of array-CGH, Illumina whole-genome sequencing and Hi-C we identified a complex rearrangement at 7q36.3, ~580 kb downstream the <italic>SHH</italic> gene. The rearrangement consisted of a 449 kb triplication, a 232 kb duplication and a 61 kb deletion, involving parts of the SHH and NOM1/MNX1/UBE3C topologically associated domains (TADs). Due to incorporation of a boundary between two TADs in the triplicated CNV, the rearrangements lead to the formation of two neo-TADs each containing the known <italic>SHH</italic> enhancer MACS1 which is now placed next to <italic>MNX1</italic>, a transcription factor involved in caudal development. This situation can be expected to result in an ectopic activation of <italic>MNX1</italic> in the lung at a time and place where <italic>SHH</italic> is normally expressed; a misexpression that likely explains the lung aplasia. The rearrangement was present in mosaic state in the clinically unaffected father, explaining the recurrence of the phenotype in his offspring’s. Thus, whole-genome sequencing in combination with Hi-C is a powerful tool to resolve and functionally interpret complex rearrangements.</p><p id="Par979"><bold>U. Melo:</bold> None. <bold>J.

Nevertheless, a recessive form related to biallelic variants in <italic>LZTR1</italic> gene was described in 2018. Following publications discussed phenotype and inheritance patterns associated with this gene. Here we report seven unrelated patients with clinically suspected NS and <italic>LZTR1</italic> variants. Clinical features are provided in table1. Three novel variants and four previously reported variants were identified. Two patients, NS1564 and NS960, presented a recessive form of NS. In the first patient, c.2074T&gt;C;p.(F692L) and c.2070-2A&gt;G were identified and the second one was homozygous for c.2074T&gt;C;p.(F692L), both affect the BTB/POZ domain. In the rest of patients only one affected allele was identified: NS1414 had a stop-gain variant, c.1084C&gt;T;p.(R362*), located on kelch-5 domain; NS895 presented c.742G&gt;A;p.(G248R), which lies in kelch-4 domain; NS883 presented c.851G&gt;A;p.(R284H), located on kelch-5 domain; NS1199 presented a splicing variant, c.791+1G&gt;T; and the patient 99 was heterozygous for c.905C&gt;T;p.(Ala302Glu), located on kelch-5 domain.

PFIC is classified into five types (PFIC1-5) based on the genetic defect involved in bile transport.

Most in vivo studies have looked for correlations between biomarkers of oxidative stress and TL, and have used leucocytes. We have used a murine model to investigate the potential impact of oxidative stress on TL in a tissue-specific manner and to assess telomere oxidation directly. Our model is a C57BL/6J mouse strain with a naturally occurring nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) deficiency. The absence of Nnt results in high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells. DNA was extracted from healthy control mice, Nnt-deficient mice and Nnt-rescued mice (Nnt reinserted at the blastocyst stage) and their telomeres analysed. Two qPCR methods were used: mmQPCR to assess relative telomere length (RTL), and a formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG) enzyme-based qPCR method to directly determine the extent of telomere oxidation. Analysis of RTL from kidney revealed no significant difference (p&gt;0.05) between the three groups. This is predictable since rapidly dividing leucocytes probably best represent early life replicative responses and tissues such as kidney, a slowly dividing tissue, represents the heritable load of TL. QPCR analysis of the DNA extracts, before and after FPG digestion showed there was no significant difference in the ΔCT values between the three groups (p&gt;0.05), implying there was no discernible difference in telomere oxidation levels. Further analysis will investigate tissues with variable metabolic and cellular turnover rates such as the brain, spleen, liver, heart and adipose tissue.</p><p id="Par1008"><bold>E.

There are no reliable markers for assessment of progression of NAFLD from steatosis to steatohepatitis that leads to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Polymorphism I148M in PNPLA3 gene is associated with inhibition of lipid hydrolysis. Pathological variants of SERPINA1 gene promote accumulation of mutant alpha-1-antitrypsin in endoplasmic reticulum. Polymorphisms in HFE gene leads to intracellular iron accumulation and fatty degeneration of liver.</p><p id="Par1012"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Group of 59 patients with NAFLD was selected. The assessment of structural changes in liver was carried out by transient elastometry with controlled attenuation parameter. Polymorphisms in PNPLA3, SERPINA1 and HFE genes were determined by real-time PCR.</p><p id="Par1013"><bold>Results:</bold> Association between homozygous carriage of I148M polymorphism and increase of ALT was found (p=0.011). A connection was established between the presence of the polymorphism and more severe steatosis (p=0.045). AST activity was higher in PiZ carriers than in patients without changes in this gene (p=0.049). H63D and C282Y polymorphisms of the HFE gene are associated with higher ALT (p=0.020 and p=0.030). A correlation between changes in mentioned genes and more severe fibrosis was not demonstrated.</p><p id="Par1014"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Polymorphisms in the PNPLA3, SERPINA1, and HFE genes are associated with an increase in ALT and AST in patients with NAFLD. The homozygous variant of the I148M polymorphism in PNPLA3 gene and the heterozygous C282Y in HFE gene are associated with more severe steatosis.

Understanding its underlying causes and mechanisms is one of the keys to prevent and treat this condition. Besides obvious environmental causes, as physical inactivity or poor nutrition, genetics is one of the main component of obesity. Here, we perform a transcriptomic study by 5′Cap-mRNA sequencing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue of non-obese (NO), obese (OB) and previously obese (POB) subjects, at fasting and hyperinsulinemia states. Differential gene expression analysis showed few difference in the analysis of NO compared to POB subjects, while the comparison of OB subjects versus NO and versus POB displayed many transcriptomic changes, with most of the genes in common in both comparison. Moreover, many genes were specifically involved in expression changes between OB and POB subjects. Gene ontology analysis revealed that those genes were involved in metabolic and cellular process pathways and in cardiovascular diseases. Fasting and hyperinsulinemia metabolic states had little influence on the results. This study demonstrates that a major gene expression difference is observed between obese and lean subjects, whether they were never obese or got rid of their fat mass after a weight loss surgery, and that after this kind of surgery, many changes in gene expression appear. Further studies are needed to identify precisely which genes are involved and if they can be a target for personalized medicine in the treatment of obesity by weight loss surgery.</p><p id="Par1019"><bold>M.

Most cases are recessive, caused by biallelic changes in these genes. These account for around 70% of cases, suggesting that additional genes, and non-coding or synonymous changes in known genes, remain to be identified. Non-CF bronchiectasis is a heterogeneous group of disorders and adults may need to be investigated for PCD. Here we present an optimised pipeline for RNA analysis from nasal brushings taken from the inferior turbinate of patients with suspected PCD or non-CF bronchiectasis. We present analysis pipelines to investigate differences in gene expression, alternative splicing and the identification of deleterious splicing events. We developed gene-neutral and gene-specific analysis protocols, from both nasal brushings stored in RNA-later and cells from nasal brushings cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI). We present this RNA-seq approach as a particularly useful diagnostic tool to investigate patients in whom a single pathogenic variant has been identified in a known PCD gene and where we suspect an alteration in splicing of the same gene due to a second intronic or synonymous / non-synonymous exonic variant. This represents a step towards using RNA analysis for increasing diagnostic yield in rare recessive respiratory disease.

It usually results in death in utero or in the perinatal period. Only three genes have been identified so far as causing renal agenesis. By exome/genome sequencing within a diagnostic setting, with combined database analyses, we identified two unrelated patients presenting with congenital bilateral renal agenesis and homozygous loss of function variants (LoF) in the <italic>GFRA1</italic> gene. Both patients had parental consanguinity and similarly affected, deceased siblings, suggesting an autosomal recessive inheritance. Patient 1 was homozygote for the nonsense variant NM_001348097.1:c.676C&gt;T, p.(Arg226*). The second patient was homozygote for a frameshift variant (NM_001348097.1:c.1294delA, p.(Thr432Profs*13)). Both variants are novel, identified for first time in our database, and presumed to lead to LoF. The <italic>GFRA1</italic> gene is not reported to be associated to any human phenotype in OMIM, but <italic>GFRA1</italic> missense variants have been reported as associated to Hirschsprung disease in several patients, based on an oligogenic model. Gfra1-deficient mice demonstrate absence of enteric neurons and agenesis of the kidney, characteristics that are reminiscent of both Gdnf-and Ret-deficient mice. The phenotype described in our patients is identical to the renal phenotype reported in Gfra1 null mice, however, no abnormalities of the enteric nervous system was reported in these two cases. In conclusion, these findings strongly support the causal role of <italic>GFRA1</italic> inactivating variants for an autosomal recessive form of bilateral renal agenesis.</p><p id="Par1048"><bold>S.

However, both, the phenotype and underlying molecular alterations of SRS show a marked heterogeneity. SRS itself is an imprinting disorder, mainly associated with specific molecular changes at specific imprinted chromosomal regions. Disease causing point mutations are less common and vary widely in means of the affected gene. The suitability of panel-based NGS assays to identify monogenetic causes of SRS-like phenotypes has already been proven. The reasonableness of whole exome sequencing to identify point mutations in patients with Silver-Russel syndrome features however, is still the subject of ongoing discussions. We examined samples of 75 patients referred for molecular testing for SRS using different NGS-based approaches. The typical SRS-associated molecular alterations had been excluded before. The results of multi gene panel, whole exome sequencing, and trio-based whole exome sequencing approaches were compared. Taking together the results of all different approaches, in 19/75 patients a disease-causing variant could be identified. Most of these variants are associated with monogenetic differential diagnoses of Silver-Russell syndrome. The diagnostic yield raised from panel to whole exome sequencing to trio-based whole exome sequencing. Broadening the molecular sequencing approach increases the mutation detection rate in patients referred for molecular testing of SRS without one of the typical molecular alterations. Some of the monogenetic disorders detected in our cohort have an important impact on the clinical management and genetic counseling of affected families mainly in terms of recurrence risks, tumor development, and mental development.

The substitution X:67722905 T&gt;C (rs9332970), exon 7, missense mutation Ile843Thr was identified in PAIS-patient. In another PAIS-patient the substitution X: 67723745 C&gt;T (rs137852594) samesence variant was identified. It was predicted the creation of a new enhancer motif for SRp55 splisosome protein, and as a consequence a new donor splice site at the end of the last exon 8.

The mutations in <italic>NPR2</italic> gene were confirmed with direct sequencing.</p><p id="Par1084"><bold>Results:</bold> All nine patiens in this group were admitted to hospital with the complaint of short stature. All had short limb type dwarfism with marked shortening middle and acral segment of the limbs. All had typical dysmorphic signs, brachydactyly, significant greater toes and normal intelligence. We identified one previously reported (c.2729 C&gt;T), five novel missense (c.3029 A&gt;G, c.1738-1739 del ins TT, c.1163 G&gt;A, c.3058 C&gt;T, c.329 G&gt;A) and two novel nonsense (c.1213 delT fs*, c.14 C&gt;A fs*) mutations.

Although CTS is quite common, its pathogenesis remains largely unknown. An estimated heritability index of 0.46 and a familial occurrence in 27-39% of the cases indicate that genetic factors must play a role in the pathogenesis. We report on a peculiar family in which CTS occurred in subsequent generations at an usually young age. Additional clinical features included brachydactyly and short Achilles tendons resulting in toe walking in childhood.</p><p id="Par1109"><bold>Material and methods:</bold> We performed exome sequencing and genome-wide linkage analysis to identify the pathogenic variant in this family. Several functional assays were performed to further study the causality of the variant. In addition, we sequenced a cohort of 216 patients to assess the role of this new candidate gene in the pathogenesis of CTS in a larger population.</p><p id="Par1110"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified a heterozygous variant (c.5009T&gt;G; p.Phe1670Cys) in the fibrillin-2 (<italic>FBN2</italic>) gene that co-segregated with the phenotype in the family. Functional assays showed that the FBN2 variant impaired integrin-mediated cell adhesion and migration. Moreover, we observed an increased TGF-β signaling and fibrosis in the carpal tissues of affected individuals. A variant burden test in a large cohort of CTS patients revealed a significantly increased frequency of rare <italic>FBN2</italic> variants in patient alleles compared to controls.</p><p id="Par1111"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data strongly suggest a role of FBN2 in the pathogenesis of CTS.</p><p id="Par1112"><bold>S.

CCAL is usually seen in polygenic disorders (hypercalcemia, gout, arthritis), but in rare cases runs in families as a dominant trait (usually CCAL2, MIM #118600, <italic>ANKH</italic> gene). CCAL1 is extremely rare with only four families known to date: an Ashkenazy-Jewish kindred (PMIDs 2383078 and 29578045), a family from Maine (PMID 7887424), a family from the Netherlands and France (PMID 24743232), and a Long Island NY family (PMID 29578045). These families all demonstrated a specific heterozygous <italic>TNFRSF11B</italic> variant, c.1205A&gt;T, modifying the stop codon (AAT&gt;ATT) and predicting an elongated protein (p.Ter402Leuext*19). We report another 4-generation CCAL1 kindred from Rhineland-Palatinate (comprising 8 females and 3 males) also demonstrating the <italic>TNFRSF11B</italic> c.1205A&gt;T variant. All patients (11/11, 100%) had early-onset osteoarthritis and chondrocalcinosis with an onset of symptoms between 16 and 30 years, and all had swelling of joints, motion restriction, and intense pain. Three probands (3/10, 30%; no data in a deceased family member) also had digital polyarthritis. First, knee, elbow, ankle and wrist joints were affected, followed by spinal destruction. Remarkably, ball-and-socket joints (e.g. hip joints) were only minimally affected (only an affected 30-year-old male). The early onset and familial clustering led to the molecular diagnosis. This is the first CCAL1 family from Germany, providing further understanding of the clinical signs and treatment (including physical therapy, orthoses, antirheumatic drugs, experimental treatment with interleukin inhibitors, and multiple joint surgery).</p><p id="Par1130"><bold>A.C.

Morphological characterisation of the ectopic cartilages in the mutant specimens was done against the HET and WT by calculating the surface area, perimeter, width on the parietal cartilage in each genotype and cellular characterisation by obtaining the cellular density and shape descriptors.

Classically HCH presents in toddlers or school-age children, as limb-to-trunk disproportion is often mild and easily overlooked during infancy. We report experiences from our UK HCH cohort of ~30 patients and review recent literature to explore the antenatal detection of HCH.</p><p id="Par1181"><bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed the rate of antenatal HCH detection in our 29 patient cohort and describe relevant case-date.

This is likely due to greater HCH awareness, improved imaging and easier molecular testing. Thus one should consider HCH outside the classical presenting period. Studying the natural history of earlier cases is important with the advent of several targeted FGFR3 therapies currently in trials for Achondroplasia (Biomarin’s Vosorotide, Ascendis’ Transchon, QED’s Infagratinib and Pfizer’s TA-46) as such therapies may soon be trialled in HCH and are likely most efficacious during earliest skeletal maturation.</p><p id="Par1184"><bold>A.

After exome analysis about 60% remain without diagnosis (idiopathic short stature, ISS). Recent identification of heterozygous mutations in <italic>ACAN</italic> in 1.4% of ISS individuals confirmed that single, large-effect variants strongly affect height (appr. 15cm final adult height). We therefore hypothesized that heterozygous variants in other autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia genes also contribute to ISS. We selected exome data from 368 ISS families where previous analysis showed no mutations in a known growth-associated gene and selected 114 genes known to be involved in autosomal recessive inherited skeletal dysplasia, extracted from the “Nosology and Classification of Genetic Skeletal Disorders” (Bonafe et al. 2015). From a total of 391 heterozygous variants we selected 33 variants in 26 genes which were classified as ACMG class 4/5 and compatible with segregation in the families and were thus considered strong candidates for ISS. This accounted for 31 patients (8.4%). No class 4/5 variant in any of the 26 genes was detected in 343 controls (p&lt;1e-85). Frequently affected genes were <italic>ACAN</italic> (6 individuals) and <italic>NPR2</italic> (3 individuals) representing 2.5% of the study group.

This results in the nuclear localization of the KRT10/KRT1 protein instead of cytoplasmic. About 20 years ago, two patients were described as MAUIE patients. They showed the typical IWC-phenotype including the development of pale spots. Both patients developed aggressive and fatal cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). A genetic analysis is not yet done. Our study aimed to identify an IWC-correlated frameshift variant in both patients and to clarify whether they suffered from IWC. We performed whole exome sequencing on genomic DNA from FFPE cSCC tissue of both deceased patients and screened for variants similar to IWC-associated variants. A heterozygous <italic>KRT10</italic> variant, encoding for the aberrantly shifted C-terminus, was identified in each patient and the nuclear localization of KRT10 was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. Our study reclassified both MAUIE patients as patients with a specific form of IWC. The fatal course of the disease is not typical for the other IWC forms, but it emphasizes the importance of skin cancer screening in all IWC-patients. We recommend the regular intensive examination of their skin for cancers and a good education of the patients with reference to their disease.</p><p id="Par1196"><bold>B.

It is most frequently caused by mutations in FBN1 with high clinical penetrance, but showing a high inter and intra-familial variability, that cannot be explained by the current knowledge of genotype-phenotype correlation. In order to improve knowledge of the whole genetic background of this disease, this study aims to identify genetic modifiers of the phenotypic expression of Marfan syndrome, looking for the intra-familial variability with known causal mutation in FBN1.</p><p id="Par1215"><bold>Material and Methods:</bold> A total of 22 Marfan syndrome patients with different severity from 8 families with known FBN1 mutation, were exome sequenced. For exome wide gene-set analyses F-SKAT (familial sequence kernell association test) was performed.

The classification of variants ranges from benign (class 1) to pathogenic (class 5).

This was mainly caused by using an incorrect consensus sequence for the amino acid motif of the 47 EGF domains in fibrillin-1 (Loeys et al.) or not using specific properties of the protein. Different use of frequency data causes a large difference in interpretation of benign variants.

We identified an in-frame deletion (p.Ser605del), segregating for the first time as an autosomal dominantmutation, in a MDPL patient from whom dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) have been derived. Cells displayed in vitro abnormalities of nuclear envelope morphology, presence of micronuclei, a large number of autophagosomesand a significant accumulation of prelamin A, strongly linked to altered cellular proliferation and genomicinstability. DNA damage-induced treatment in MDPL-HDFs revealed a poor capacity of DNA repair, an arrestin G0/G1 phase transition, and a lower number of cells in the S phase. Moreover, Western Blot analysesshowed a nuclear reduction of POLD1 in MDPL-HDFs compared to WT in basal condition but a statisticallysignificant and persistent increase after cisplatin/1-Gy X-ray damage when compared to WT. Analysis of telomere length exhibited an increased rate of telomere shortening, accompanied by anaccumulation of unrepaired telomeric DNA damage. Furthermore, the evaluation of H2AX and TelomereInduced Foci after 1-Gy X-ray treatment enabled us to figure out that POLD1 repairs less efficiently DNAdamage and its activity is mainly associated with the homologous recombination phase. Finally, we also generated human induced pluripotent stem cells from patient’s fibroblasts showing thepeculiar presence of micronuclei.

Mutations in approximately 40 different genes can cause MeDOCs, that can be inherited in autosomal recessive/dominant or X-linked patterns. Identification of molecular defect is essential for prognosis, proper medical interventions and genetic counseling. Nonetheless, genetic diversity, low incidence of majority of MeDOCs and overlapping phenotypes make diagnosis challenging. The aim of the study was to characterize molecularly Polish MeDOC patients.</p><p id="Par1248"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> A group of 161 patients with clinical symptoms of MeDOC was enrolled to the study.

Common risk loci explain parts of the trait heritability, but a substantial fraction needs to be elucidated. Parts of the missing heritability could be explained by rare, penetrant mutations that might occur de novo in genes potentially involved in craniofacial development. A previous study by our group identified three nsCL/P susceptibility genes with rare recurrent de novo mutations (<italic>PAXIP1</italic>, <italic>MDN1</italic>, <italic>ANK1</italic>). The present study aims at assessing a contribution of the rare mutations found in these nsCL/P susceptibility genes to cleft development by using CRISPR/Cas9 generated mouse models.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed &gt;40 risk loci that contribute to nsCL/P risk, and it has been suggested that ~30% of phenotypic variance is explained by common genetic variation. In the absence of surgery, nsCL/P is a detrimental phenotype, which implies a considerable effect on reproductive fitness. Thus, rare variants are likely to also contribute to nsCL/P etiology. First studies have suggested nsCL/P candidate genes that harbor causative rare variants, or a burden thereof. These studies included the analysis of established “syndromic” genes (<italic>n</italic> = 6 genes), genes with established role in craniofacial development (<italic>n</italic> = 5), and the identification of mutations in genes of the epithelial cadherin-p120-catenin complex segregating within multiply affected families (<italic>n</italic> = 5). However, independent replication is lacking. Here, we aimed at providing further genetic evidence for an involvement of these genes in nsCL/P etiology, through the identification of additional evidence for rare variants from a large Central-European cohort. Using single molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs), we obtained high-confident sequencing results for 14 of the 16 genes in 711 nsCL/P cases, 761 population-based controls, and 234 case-parent trios. At individual level, we identified four novel loss-of-function (LoF) variants (3 cases / 1 control). The variants observed in cases were LoF-mutations in <italic>CDH1</italic>, <italic>CTNND1</italic> and <italic>MTRR</italic>. Further statistical analyses, including analyses of missense variants, burden and pedigree analyses, are currently ongoing and will help to further understand the etiology of nsCL/P.</p><p id="Par1259"><bold>B.

Apart small extremities, 6 had large hallux and 7 had curved radius with limited pronation. Out of 12 cases, 8 had hyperlaxity, 7 scoliosis and 8 dental misalignment and arched palate.

The etiology of nsCL/P is multifactorial, whereby genetic risk factors, environmental exposures, and potential gene-environment interactions all contribute to susceptibility. The present project is a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a medium-sized nsCL/P cohort encompassing a total of 285 nsCL/P patients and 1,212 controls from The Netherlands and Belgium. Twenty of 40 previously reported nsCL/P susceptibility loci were replicated, and at the well-established nsCL/P susceptibility locus at chromosome 8q24.21, the analyses identified 62 genome-wide significant SNVs. These findings underline the validity of this sample. SNV-based analysis of the data identified a yet unreported suggestive locus at chromosome 16p12.1 (<italic>p</italic>-value of the lead SNV: 4.17×10-07). This association was replicated in two of three patient/control replication series (Central European and Yemeni). The lead SNV rs56383345 maps to a 930 kb non-coding region at 16p12.1, and is not located in any currently known regulatory element. Gene-based analysis of the GWAS data prioritized <italic>SH3PXD2A</italic> at chromosome 10q24.33 as a candidate gene for nsCL/P. To date, support for this gene as a cleft gene has been restricted to data from zebrafish and a knockout mouse model. The present GWAS is the first to implicate <italic>SH3PXD2A</italic> in non-syndromic cleft formation in humans. In summary, although performed in a relatively small sample, the present GWAS generated novel insights into nsCL/P etiology, and demonstrates how medium-sized, clinically well characterized GWAS samples can improve knowledge of the genetic basis of nsCL/P.</p><p id="Par1270"><bold>I. van Rooij:</bold> None. <bold>K.U.

Despite the possibility of surgical correction, follow-up treatment is long-term and requires an interdisciplinary approach. Also, epidemiological data indicate that individuals with nsCL/P show an increased risk for morbidities and suffer from a considerable psycho-social burden. The molecular pathways underlying these observations are currently unknown. We here used nsCL/P-GWAS data and array-based expression data from embryonic mice (gestational days E10.5-E12.5, Hooper et. al 2017), to identify pathways in which nsCL/P candidate genes are enriched. The 45 nsCL/P risk loci comprise ~400 genes within their topologically associated domains. Using gene-based analysis, we identified 86 genes with enrichment of common variants, suggesting their involvement in nsCL/P etiology. For each of these genes, we analyzed the expression pattern in ectodermal or mesodermal tissues of mandibular, maxillary and fronto-nasal prominences, and performed hierarchical clustering. One of the three clusters we identified comprised 33 genes, including established nsCL/P-genes like <italic>IRF6</italic> and <italic>TFAP2a</italic>. A pathway analysis of genes within this cluster revealed a significant overrepresentation of cancer-related pathways and processes related to molecular signaling. Interestingly, affecteds with nsCL/P have been reported to be at increased risk of cancer. We will next extend our approach at single-cell level, using systematic data as recently provided (Cao et. al 2019) and the analytical ecosystem FASTGenomics (Scholz et. al 2018). This will generate novel insights into gene regulatory networks across development, and their contribution to nsCL/P.</p><p id="Par1274"><bold>A. Siewert:</bold> None. <bold>B. Reiz:</bold> A.

It is often clinically impossible to predict the underlying causative gene, thus necessitating broad multi-gene panel testing or exome sequencing. We report on five independent families with a progressively-deforming type of OI with the distinguishing feature of oligodontia. We identified four homozygous truncation or frameshift mutations in a novel gene for OI, namely MESD. MESD encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein for the canonical Wingless-related integration site (WNT) signaling receptors LRP5 and LRP6. Because complete absence of MESD causes embryonic lethality in mice, we hypothesized that the OI-associated mutations are hypomorphic alleles since these mutations occur downstream of the chaperone activity domain but upstream of ER-retention domain. This would be consistent with the clinical phenotypes of skeletal fragility and oligodontia in persons deficient for LRP5 and LRP6, respectively. Further functional analysis showed that OI-associated MESD mutations produce hypomorphic alleles whose failure to remain within the ER significantly reduces but does not completely eliminate LRP5 and LRP6 trafficking. Since these individuals have no eye abnormalities (which occur in individuals completely lacking LRP5) and have neither limb nor brain patterning defects (both of which occur in mice completely lacking LRP6), we infer that bone mass accrual and dental patterning are more sensitive to reduced canonical WNT signaling than are other developmental processes. Multigene panels do not yet include MESD. Therefore, if an undiagnosed patient with severe OI and oligodontia presents, it may be prudent to think first of MESD.</p><p id="Par1278"><bold>S.

We detected the c.961C&gt;T <italic>SQSTM1</italic> gene mutation in three PDB patients, that causes the p.R321C mutation. It has been reported that p.R321C mutation causes a blockade of autophagy and an activation of NF-kB pathway. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of the p.R321C mutation in human osteoclasts.</p><p id="Par1290"><bold>Methods:</bold> Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from blood samples for generating human osteoclasts. Cells were differentiated by adding M-CSF and RANKL for 3 weeks. Human osteoclasts were transiently transfected with total plasmid DNA (pCEFL-Flag-SQSTM1-321C and pCEFL-Flag-SQSTM1-321R constructs). Finally, we performed a co-immunofluorescence assay to detect Flag and p62.</p><p id="Par1291"><bold>Results and discussion:</bold> Our results showed that, while 321R-p62 protein remained scattered though the cytoplasm, 321C-p62 was concentrated in the periphery of osteoclasts. This relocation of p62 protein caused by p.R321C mutation could be a consequence of autophagy blockade, which has been reported that could have a crucial role in the etiology of PDB. The p.R321C mutation causes a blockade of autophagy and an activation of NF-kB pathway, therefore the alteration of the cell metabolism could be the cause of the relocation of p62 protein in human osteoclasts.</p><p id="Par1292"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The p.R321C mutation in p62 protein leads to a relocation of the protein in human osteoclasts.

MicroRNAs act tissue specifically but some are secreted into blood. Recent studies reported upregulation of specific miRNAs in the inflamed oral mucosa of periodontitis patients. The regulatory targets of these miRNAs may reveal genes that are conducive to oral health. If secreted into blood, these miRNAs could serve as biomarkers to diagnose periodontitis before clinical manifestation. To identify such miRNAs, we quantified 863 miRNAs in the blood of 18 periodontitis patients and 70 periodontitis-free controls (Geniom Biochip array). miRNA hsa-miR-421 and hsa-miR-374b-5p were most significantly upregulated in blood of periodontitis cases (P<sub>adjusted</sub> &lt; 5x10<sup>−6</sup>). Two previous studies that profiled microRNAs in the inflamed and healthy oral mucosa independently reported &gt;2fold upregulation of hsa-miR-374b-5p, but not hsa-miR-421. Using mirVana miRNA mimics (ThermoFisher Scientific), we overexpressed hsa-miR-374b-5p in primary gingival fibroblasts (3 biological and 3 technical replicates) and quantified the mRNA levels in 24h transfected and mock-transfected cells (Clariom D Array, ThermoFisher Scientific). The gene U2AF homology motif kinase 1 (<italic>UHMK1</italic>) was significantly downregulated in the miRNA mimic transfected cells (Fold Change= -1.8, P=0.00025). Two binding sites of hsa-miR-374b-5p were predicted at the 3’UTR of <italic>UHMK1</italic>. To validate the functional mechanism, we cloned the respective 3’UTR of <italic>UHMK1</italic> into a reporter plasmid (pGL4.24, Promega). After co-transfection of the plasmid and hsa-miR-374b-5p mimic into HeLa cells for 24 hours, the reporter gene expression was significantly reduced (Fold Change= -1.5, p=0.02, 3 independent replicates).

In the presence of inflammatory stimuli, free CARD14 molecules oligomerise, recruit a BCL10/MALT1 signalosome and activate NF-kB signalling. Gain-of-function <italic>CARD14</italic> variants have previously been associated with inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis vulgaris and generalised pustular psoriasis. However, the involvement of CARD14 in palmar plantar pustulosis (PPP), a localised form of pustular psoriasis, remains unclear. Here, we analysed <italic>CARD14</italic> changes in 160 PPP cases (125 females, 35 males; mean age of onset: 41 years) ascertained across the UK. We identified 11 rare variants predicted to have a deleterious effect on protein function. A burden test (comparing PPP cases vs controls sequenced by the ExAC consortium) demonstrated a significant association between these changes and PPP (OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.39-4.65; p = 0.0023). We also detected a low-frequency allele with deleterious potential (E422K) that occurred more frequently in affected individuals compared to controls (OR: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.07-2.69; p= 0.025). To assess the effect of disease-associated variants, CARD14 FLAG-tagged plasmids were mutagenized and transfected into HEK293 cells. The depletion of free CARD14 from the cytoplasm (which is an indirect measurement of protein oligomerization) was then analysed by western blotting. This confirmed that most variants promote the formation of insoluble CARD14 oligomers. These findings implicate CARD14 in the pathogenesis of PPP. They also suggest that the proteins encoded by disease alleles are prone to constitutive oligomerization, which will cause abnormal NF-kB activation.</p><p id="Par1317"><bold>A.

Biallelic mutations in <italic>RNU4ATAC</italic> have been reported as the molecular cause. Our series expand the phenotypic spectrum of Roifman patients. We report four patients from three unrelated families with RS. Due to the complexity of variant annotation in <italic>RNU4ATAC</italic>, molecular studies are not usually straightforward. Indeed, in families 1 and 2 exome sequencing was inconclusive. In patient 1 the diagnosis was finally uncovered by genome sequencing, in sisters 2 and 3 by Sanger sequencing upon clinical suspicion and in patient 4 by a customized gene panel. Main clinical characteristics include skeletal dysplasia (4/4), short stature (4/4), intellectual disability (4/4), antibody deficiency (3/4) and retinal dystrophy (2/4). Main dysmorphic features included markedly long philtrum and thin upper lip. Hepatomegaly was identified in 2/4 and patient 1 presented hepatic cavernoma (unreported so far in Roifamn patients). Molecular results showed variants n.8C&gt;T and n.50 G&gt;A (patient 1); variant n.13C&gt;T and n.17 G&gt;C (sisters 2 and 3) and two novel variants, n.37G&gt;A and n.53C&gt;T (patient 4). Segregation analysis indicated that each variant was inherited from a healthy parent in the three families. The inclusion of new patients with Roifman increases the knowledge of mutational spectrum and it’s essential to delineate the phenotype of this syndrome. The recognition of the syndrome is indispensable for the orientation of molecular diagnosis, prompt follow up and counseling.</p><p id="Par1321"><bold>I. Valenzuela:</bold> None. <bold>I.

Cilia consist of the axoneme and the basal body and present various ciliary membrane receptors, which receive extracellular signals. Those signals are transmitted into the cell, where they modulate different intracellular signaling pathways. Mutations in ciliary proteins are involved in formation, maintenance and function of the primary cilium and associated with developmental defects, like brain malformations, polydactyly, kidney cysts and skeletal abnormalities. This phenotypic spectrum is present among patients with short-rib polydactyly syndromes (SRPS).

TANGO1 binds collagen in the lumen, COPII-coats in the cytoplasm and recruits membranes from the ERGIC (ER-Golgi intermediate compartment) to create an export route for bulky cargos like collagen. Recently aberrant expression of truncated TANGO1 was linked to a severe collagenopathy associated with primary obesity, diabetes mellitus and intellectual disability. We show that complete loss of TANGO1 results in human embryonic lethality with near-total bone loss.</p><p id="Par1346"><bold>Material and Methods:</bold> Fetal DNA and parental blood/fibroblast samples were obtained. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed. RTqPCR, Western blot, immunocytochemical staining and collagen secretion assays were conducted.</p><p id="Par1347"><bold>Results:</bold> Ultrasound examination of a 13-weeks-old fetus of healthy Indian consanguineous parents revealed tetramicromelia, increased nuchal translucency, absent nasal bone, pingpong appearance of the skull, shortened limb segments, and extreme skeletal hypomineralization. The pregnancy was terminated and the infantogram showed an almost boneless fetus. Fetal WES detected a homozygous 4-basepair deletion in <italic>TANGO1</italic>, heterozygously present in both parents. Parental fibroblast studies demonstrated decreased TANGO1 expression and protein, and severe defects in collagen secretion.</p><p id="Par1348"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings underscore the importance of TANGO1 in cellular protein secretion. While absence of TANGO1 results in human embryonic lethality, aberrant expression of truncated TANGO1 results in a severe collagenopathy. This further supports the physiological role of TANGO1 in collagen export, which is necessary for bone mineralization, skin and tissue biogenesis. Moreover, the data clearly reveal the severity of human pathologies in association with levels of functional TANGO1 expression.</p><p id="Par1349"><bold>B. Guillemyn:</bold> None. <bold>S.

To improve early detection and reduce risk of rupture in relatives, guidelines recommend screening of first degree relatives. Current guidelines do not specify the method or extend of aorta screening in relatives. In practice, mostly male relatives are referred for abdominal echographic screening of the abdominal aorta, possibly missing thoracic aneurysms (TAA) in relatives. To determine in which part of the aorta affected relatives of AAA patients have an aneurysm or dilatation, we reviewed the results of family history taking and family screening of families of 471 AAA patients with familial aneurysms of which medical records and/or CT images relatives were available. In total 475 affected relatives (311 male, 164 female) in 237 families had an aorta dilatation or aneurysm: 258 (54,3%) had abdominal and 147 (31%) thoracic aneurysm. Male relatives were more likely to have AAA (40% vs 28%, p &lt; 0.05), females to have TAA (32% vs 17%, p &lt; 0.05). Co-occurrence of AAA and TAA was observed in 7% of relatives. In 17% an iliac and in 2% a popliteal dilation occurred. In conclusion: relatives of AAA patients have an increased risk for dilatation of the abdominal and the thoracic aorta. To prevent underdiagnosis of aortic aneurysm in relatives and improve early detection of aortic aneurysms, a CT-scan of the total aorta and the iliac arteries should be considered as the method of choice for family screening.</p><p id="Par1357">Conflicts of interest: none.

Mutations in <italic>SCN5A</italic> are identified in about 20% of patients with Brugada syndrome (BrS), an inherited cardiac arrhythmia. We have identified an <italic>SCN5A</italic> founder mutation (c.4813+3_4813+6dupGGGT), leading to a loss-of-function of Na<sub>v</sub>1.5 in 25 different families.

We used induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) to investigate the underlying pathophysiology.</p><p id="Par1412"><bold>Material &amp; Methods:</bold> Dermal fibroblasts of three patients with different severity, and one unrelated healthy control were reprogrammed using the CytoTune™-iPS 2.0 Sendai Reprogramming Kit. iPSC-CMs were differentiated following a published protocol.

We performed several differentiation rounds and investigated expression of cardiac markers using qPCR and immunocytochemistry and electrophysiological properties using patch-clamping and calcium imaging.</p><p id="Par1413"><bold>Results:</bold> All iPSC-CMs expressed tested markers. We observed reduction in sodium current density in patient iPSC-CMs, together with shortening of the action potential and calcium transient duration compared to the control.

SHOX2 has been associated with cardiac arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF) and sinus node dysfunction. Yet, our knowledge on co-regulatory networks associated with cardiac rhythm control in health and disease still remains limited. To dissect the role of Shox2-dependent networks, we utilized a murine embryonic stem cell (ESC) model that allowed us to investigate molecular pathways involving Shox2 in SAN-like cardiomyocytes. Differential RNA-seq-based expression profiling of <italic>Shox2</italic><sup><italic>+/+</italic></sup> and <italic>Shox2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> ESCs revealed 94 regulated transcripts in <italic>Shox2</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> SAN-like cells. Fifteen putative target genes were selected for further validation based on comparative expression analysis of our dataset with publicly available RNA-seq data of SAN and right atria enriched genes at different mouse embryonic stages. Network-based analyses integrating data from the Mouse Organogenesis Cell Atlas and the Ingenuity pathway analysis tool as well as validation in mouse and zebrafish confirmed a species conserved regulation for Shox2 target genes in cardiac rhythm control. Our results indicate that co-regulatory networks involving SHOX2 participate in the development of conduction traits through regulatory mechanisms, thereby affecting the expression of multiple genes.

Chromosome 22q11 microdeletion syndrome is often associated with CHDs and is the most common human microdeletion, occurs in ~1/4000 live births in the general population and in 2.8-14.9% of CHD patients. 22q11 copy number variants (CNVs) are caused by non-allelic homologous recombination events in the flanking low copy repeat regions (LCRs), labeled A-H.</p><p id="Par1444"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of 22q11 CNVs in Hungarian CHD patients. 175 blood samples were obtained from children and adults with different isolated and combined CHDs. Samples were analyzed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) to detect CNVs in the given chromosomal region. Positive MLPA results were confirmed with locus-specific FISH. Genotype-phenotype comparison and family screening was also performed.</p><p id="Par1445"><bold>Results:</bold> CNVs were detected in overall 10 cases (5.7%). Six cases with typical microdeletion (between LCRs A and D) also known as DiGeorge syndrome, 2 cases with microduplication and 2 cases with combined microdeletion and microduplication were detected. The phenotypical appearance of patients was highly variable. CNVs were familiar in 3 cases.</p><p id="Par1446"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Until present this was the largest systemic genetic screening of Hungarian CHD patients. Since the clinical diagnosis of 22q11 microdeletion/microduplication syndrome may be challenging due to its variable manifestation, systematic genetic testing may be of utmost benefit in the early diagnosis and proper management of these patients.</p><p id="Par1447"><bold>Funding grant:</bold> GINOP-2.3.2-15-2017-00039</p><p id="Par1448"><bold>G.K.

Nearly 90% of CHD cases have a suspected genetic etiology, but in 56% of cases the genetic etiology is unknown. Few gene discovery efforts have been made with consanguineous CHD cohorts. We recruited 74 CHD patients from 73 consanguineous families in Turkey and used whole exome sequencing to identify affected genes in these patients. In 13.7% of the cohort, we could identify a genetic etiology and we discovered four new genes that are putatively causative for CHD. This represents an important advance in our understanding of the genetic consequences of consanguinity in CHD.</p><p id="Par1461"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> 74 samples from 73 families were recruited from two pediatric cardiology clinics in Istanbul, Turkey.

Dysregulation of miRNAs has been linked to various congenital heart diseases including Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), which represents the most common cyanotic heart malformation in humans. Several studies have identified dysregulated miRNAs in right ventricular (RV) tissues of TOF patients. In the study presented here, we profiled genome-wide the whole transcriptome and analyzed the relationship of miRNAs and mRNAs of RV tissues of a homogeneous group of 22 non-syndromic TOF patients. Observed profiles were compared to profiles obtained from right and left ventricular tissue of normal hearts. To reduce the large list of predicted target genes of dysregulated miRNAs, we applied a stringent target prediction pipeline integrating probabilities for miRNA-mRNA interaction. The final list of disease-related miRNA-mRNA pairs comprises novel as well as known miRNAs including miR-1 and miR-133, which are essential to cardiac development and function by regulating KCNJ2, FBN2, SLC38A3 and TNNI1. Overall, our study provides additional insights into post-transcriptional gene regulation of malformed TOF hearts.</p><p id="Par1469"><bold>M. Grunert:</bold> None. <bold>S.

SCAD is defined as a spontaneous tear in the coronary arterial wall that is not traumatic or iatrogenic. Studies are still underway to investigate the role of genetics in promoting SCAD; genetic diseases frequently associated with SCAD are connective tissue diseases. Considering the role of SCAD for sudden cardiac death and the increased risk for future cardiac events, an early diagnosis is crucial. We enrolled 60 patients with nonatherosclerotic angiographic diagnosis of SCAD. All patients’ genomic DNA was analyzed by NGS with gene panel involved in collagenopathies and arteriopathies (<italic>ACTA2, CBS, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL5A2, ELN, FBN1, FBN2, LTBP2, MYLK, NOTCH1, MYH11, SMAD3, SMAD4, SLC2A10, TGFB2, TGFB3, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, PLOD1</italic>). Seven patients result to carry potential SCAD-related mutations. In particular, we observed a pathological <italic>COL3A1</italic> mutation; 3 different VUS mutations in: <italic>LTBP2</italic> (two patients), <italic>MYLK</italic> and <italic>NOTCH1</italic>. Moreover, we found a new nonsense mutation in <italic>SMAD3</italic> and a missense alteration in <italic>COL5A2;</italic> both not enlisted in public database, but that could be categorized as pathogenetic and VUS, respectively, according to the ACMG classification. These data support the use of sequencing of genes inclusive of collagenopathies and arteriopathies as an approach to evaluate genetically mediated SCAD. However,, considering that only a minority of patients have clear SCAD-causative mutations, these results remark the need of further studies to define genetic mechanisms of SCAD.</p><p id="Par1486"><bold>M.

Using a discovery phase of 2,719 cases and 4,440 controls and a replication phase of 584 independent cases and 966 controls, we identified and replicated two new DCM-associated loci one on chromosome 3p (meta-analysis p = 5.3 10<sup>−13</sup>) and the second on chromosome 22q (meta-analysis p = 5.0 10<sup>−10</sup>) while confirming the two previously identified DCM loci on chromosome 10 and 1, <italic>BAG3</italic> and <italic>HSPB7</italic> for an estimated heritability of 31% ± 8%.

The two association signals were then fine-mapped by combining <italic>in silico</italic> and functional genomics investigations. While a few genes remain candidates at the second locus and deserve further investigations, our work clearly identified one gene as responsible for the association at the first locus whose role in the pathophysiology of DCM is supported by recent observations in human and mice. As the biological pathway in which this gene is involved is a potential target for pharmacological agents, our finding opens novel therapeutic perspectives for treating or preventing heart failure. These results provide new findings that add both on the understanding of the genetic architecture of heart failure and on potential new players involved in the pathophysiology of this devastating disease.</p><p id="Par1497"><bold>S.

Genetic lipoprotein abnormalities can be explained by a limited number of genes. For optimal clinical management, risk assessment and prevention of cardiovascular disease an accurate diagnosis is an absolute requirement, but the interconnection between the metabolic pathways of different lipoprotein fractions jeopardizes this when only lipid levels are assessed.</p><p id="Par1512"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> In order to pinpoint the culprit lipoprotein fraction of clinical dyslipidemia in 4277 patients, we evaluated NGS and CNV data, including 29 dyslipidemia-associated genes that enabled to examine all separate lipoprotein components simultaneously. With this approach 10 types of dyslipidemia can be discriminated. Moreover, this panel includes a genetic risk factor for statin intolerance.</p><p id="Par1513"><bold>Results:</bold> A genetic cause for dyslipidemia was found in 32% of the patients. Of these, 4% carried a CNV. The specific initial clinical diagnoses of hypercholesterolemia or hypertriglyceridemia were confirmed in only 17 and 35% of patients, respectively.

Endocardial cushion defects are among the most prevalent heart malformations in the general population, and are extremely frequent (approximately a 100-fold higher prevalence) in children with Down syndrome. Several genes have been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of these malformations, but no common pathogenic DNA variants have been identified so far. Here, we focussed on constitutive, epigenetic alterations of function of selected genes, potentially important for endocardial cushion development. We used two types of microarrays, dedicated for assessment of gene promoter methylation and whole genome expression.</p><p id="Par1519">First, we compared the gene promoter methylation profiles between two groups of Down syndrome patients, with and without heart defects of endocardial cushion-type. Then, to determine the functional role of the detected methylation alterations, we assessed the expression of the genes of interest. We detected significant hypermethylation of the NRG1 gene promoter region in children with heart defects. NRG1 is a key factor in maturation of endocardial cushions. Supplementary gene expression assessment revealed significantly decreased activity of the ERBB3, SHC3 and SHC4 genes in children with heart defects. The above three genes are closely related to the NRG1 gene and are crucial elements of the NRG/ErbB pathway. The results of this pilot study show that hypermethylation of the NRG1 gene promoter can reflect the functional genome alteration contributing to development of congenital heart defects of endocardial cushion-type.</p><p id="Par1520"><bold>A.

Here, we present a large family from a genetically isolated population presenting with CVDs, including congenital heart defects (CHD) and familial thoracic aortic aneurysms (FTAA), caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the Notch target gene <italic>HEY2</italic>, which hasn’t been associated with hereditary CVDs in humans previously.</p><p id="Par1568"><bold>Methods:</bold> The index patient, who has severe CVD, underwent trio WES. The identified variant was subsequently screened in 30 members of this patient’s family, which has a high prevalence of CVDs. Additionally, 3011 unrelated cases and 4940 controls from two datasets (one with CHD and one with FTAA) were screened for rare risk variants in <italic>HEY2</italic>. To investigate how the various identified variants influence gene function, the regulatory activity of mutated and wildtype HEY2 on a target gene was measured with luciferase assays and qPCR.</p><p id="Par1569"><bold>Results:</bold> A homozygous frameshift variant (p.G108*) in <italic>HEY2</italic> was identified in three individuals with life-threatening CVDs. Twenty family members were found to be heterozygous for this variant, of whom 80% had CVD. Two additional CVD datasets show enrichment for rare, likely deleterious variants in <italic>HEY2</italic> after meta-analysis. Lastly, we demonstrate that these variants induce failure of repression of <italic>HEY2</italic> target genes.</p><p id="Par1570"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We find that rare <italic>HEY2</italic> variants predispose to a broad spectrum of CVDs and advise clinicians to consider <italic>HEY2</italic> as a causative gene in unsolved CVD patients. Identifying a potentially deleterious variant in <italic>HEY2</italic> warrants clinical follow-up.</p><p id="Par1571"><bold>E.S. van Walree:</bold> None. <bold>G. Dombrowsky:</bold> None. <bold>I.E.

Hyperuricaemia has also been linked to cardiovascular and metabolic diseases but, unlike gout, causality has not been ascertained. Here we utilised biomarker data from the UK Biobank (UKB, <italic>n</italic> = ~500,000) and health outcome data from a Finnish biobank, FinnGen (<italic>n</italic> = ~135,000) to explore the causal relationship between biomarkers and disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 48 available biomarkers were conducted in UKB and FINEMAP was applied to ascertain putative causal variants. We assessed the genetic correlation of these biomarkers with 1,485 disease endpoints in FinnGen using LD score regression. Those with a significant correlation following FDR correction were assessed for causal associations using Mendelian randomisation (MR). GWAS of UA corrected for allopurinol treatment (a UA-lowering medication) was completed on 389,114 individuals and FINEMAP identified 320 putative causal signals. Significant genetic correlations were found with multiple diseases (<italic>n</italic> = 183) including hypertensive diseases (rg=0.25, P<sub>FDR</sub>=6.2x10<sup>−38</sup>), type 2 diabetes (rg=0.29, P<sub>FDR</sub>=6.2x10<sup>−38</sup>), cardiovascular disease (rg=0.23, P<sub>FDR</sub>=9.6x10<sup>−29</sup>) and gout (rg=0.70, P<sub>FDR</sub>=8.3x10<sup>−21</sup>). Results from MR analyses confirmed the known causal association of UA with gout (IVW estimate=1.6, P<sub>FDR</sub>=7.8x10<sup>−62</sup>) as well as with polyarthropathies (IVW estimate=0.37, P<sub>FDR</sub>=1.9x10<sup>−12</sup>) but not with other diseases. A significant causal association was found with hypertension (IVW estimate=0.20, P<sub>FDR</sub>=0.0015) but horizontal pleiotropy was also detected (MR-Egger intercept P= 0.0069).

Therefore, there is an urgent need for the detection of sensitive and specific early biomarkers to predict the risk of the IHD development. We postulate that non-coding miRNAs may have higher diagnostic value for early detection of IHD than inflammatory mediators like chemokine CXCL12 and macrophage migration-inhibitory factor (MIF).</p><p id="Par1592"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We obtained serum samples from 43 T2DM patients (24 with IHD and 19 without IHD). The levels of 798 miRNAs were analysed using NanoString nCounter Technology. Additionally, we predicted the key miRNA regulatory network and miRNAs targets and pathways that may be critical in IHD development using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. The concentration of MIF and CXCL12 was estimated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to assess the diagnostic value of each miRNA.</p><p id="Par1593"><bold>Results:</bold> Our data showed 9 miRNAs (miRNA-1224-5p, miRNA-1303, miRNA-3147, miRNA-4455, miRNA-498, miRNA-548b-3p, miRNA-548d-3p, miRNA-615-3p, miRNA-651-5p) significantly upregulated in T2DM IHD group compared to T2DM noIHD (FC&gt;1.4 and FDR &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, all miRNAs showed high diagnostic value (AUC&gt;0.85). Targeted genes were identified in canonical pathways involved in the pathology of the cardiovascular system. No statistical differences were observed in the concentration of MIF and CXCL12 between tested groups.</p><p id="Par1594"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings suggest that circulating miRNAs might have a pivotal role in the development of IHD in T2DM patients and may be used as non-invasively biomarkers for early diagnosis.</p><p id="Par1595"><bold>A.

Among the identified metabolites, nominally significant associations were found between androsterone sulfate, cysteine sulfinic acid, and N-palmitoylglycine with stroke, and 3-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid with coronary artery disease. Taken together, we were able to identify metabolites that might link miR-1273h-5p, miR-3937, and miR-4753-5p with stroke, and miR-181a-2-3p with coronary artery disease.</p><p id="Par1619"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study has added insight into understanding the role of metabolites in the link between miRNAs and cardiovascular disorders.

However, if the mutations were transmitted from asymptomatic carriers to their children, it will cause unexpected occurrence of diseases. So genetic tests are often required.</p><p id="Par1624"><bold>Methods:</bold> We choosed 563 patients with suspected marfan syndrome (MFS) or thoracic aortic aneurysm/dissection, who had been detected by Panel. Among them, we selected 56 patients who carried likely pathogenic (pathogenic) mutations and were not de novo, their parents who harbored the same mutation were clinically normal. For these Trio families, we used the Life PGM <sup>TM</sup> DX platform to perform deep sequencing of single amplicon (approximately 5000×) on DNA samples extracted from whole blood.</p><p id="Par1625"><bold>Results:</bold> We detected two mosaic mutations in these Trio families. The first patient AD700-1 who had typical MFS features carried the mutation <italic>FBN1</italic>, C1305F. After deep sequencing,23% mutated alleles were detected in healthy father who harbored the same mutation. The second mutation <italic>FBN1</italic>, c.2167+1G&gt;A was identified in patient AD1833, who was suspected to be MFS. The mutation was also carried by healthy father, who was found to carry 17% of the mutant allele through deep sequencing.</p><p id="Par1626"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Mosaic mutations could be a more common phenomenon in aortic diseases than has been realized so far. Therefore, whenever children are identified with harmful mutations, the parents who lack obvious phenotypic characteristics should be detected by genetic testing, which will provide more accurate guidance for genetic counseling.</p><p id="Par1627"><bold>Z.G.

We report a family with two siblings who presented with type A aortic dissections. The sister made an aortic dissection at 45 years-old. The brother made an aortic dissection at 22 years-old treated with an aortic graft procedure, at 46 years-old he had revision surgery because of pseudoaneurysms complications. His daughter was diagnosed with a patent <italic>ductus arteriosus</italic>. Their father suddenly died at 28 years-old. Molecular analysis of a panel of 15 aortic aneurysm genes in the brother revealed only the variant c.4599+3A&gt;C at the 5’ donor splice site (5’ss) of the exon 33 of <italic>MYH11</italic> (NM_00104114.1) with a potential splicing impact. This variant was also present in the affected sister. It was absent from GnomAD and internal variant database (&gt;1000 patients) and never reported in the literature. Interestingly, a single-nucleotide polymorphism is described at this position: c.4599+3A&gt;G (rs143288748). Interpretation of variations at the position +3 of the 5’ss is difficult because data of the literature are conflicting with variations reported to induce aberrant splicing in some cases but not in others. We performed transcript analysis with RNA extracted from an aortic biopsy during the brother’s second intervention. RT PCR revealed a skipping of the exon 33 of <italic>MYH11</italic> predicting a truncated myosin tail and a dominant negative effect.

This variant has been previously described as a VUS in a HCM patient which harbored another pathogenic variant in <italic>MYH7</italic> and in ClinVar, and is absent in GnomAD. In all our six patients p.(Gln892Lys) was the only probably pathogenic variant found. Patients (4 males/2 females) were of Catalan origin and had been diagnosed of HCM around 30 years-old. Familial sudden death before the fifth decade of life were reported. We extended the genetic and cardiologic study to 20 relatives of the probands. Twelve were carriers, 9 of them symptomatic and p.(Gln892Lys) co-segregated with the HCM in all the families.

PAH can occur in the context of family history or genetic mutations causing heritable PAH, or is considered as idiopathic in the absence of an identified predisposing factor. Beyond the major gene BMPR2, a gene encoding a type 2 receptor of the BMP signaling pathway several new genes predisposing to PAH have been identified during the last decade. Recently, preliminary evidence of the involvement of the KDR gene was found in a large genetic association study.</p><p id="Par1650"><bold>Methods:</bold> We prospectively analysed the KDR gene by targeted panel NGS sequencing in a series of 311 PAH patients referred to a clinical molecular laboratory for genetic diagnosis of PAH.</p><p id="Par1651"><bold>Results:</bold> Two index cases with severe PAH were found to carry a loss-of-function mutation in the KDR gene.

Blood pressure (BP) is also a complex genetic trait with heritability estimates of 30-50%. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a high number of genetic loci associated with HTN and BP traits, indicating underlying polygenic architectures. This study proposes to compute polygenic risk scores (PRS) for HTN and BP for potential genetic risk stratification.</p><p id="Par1664"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We investigated the additive effect of common genetic variants on HTN and BP by means of regression models based on PRS. We used genotyping data of 561 cases and 731 controls from Hypergenes cohort. We computed PRS based on clumping and thresholding method using GWAS summary statistics of systolic/diastolic BP measurements from GERA cohort (99,785 health records) and the HTN case-control cohort of the UK Biobank (144,793 cases and 313,761 controls).</p><p id="Par1665"><bold>Results:</bold> PRS for HTN and diastolic/systolic BP are strongly associated with hypertensive status and BP measurements. The highest significance is achieved for the case-control status by considering UK Biobank effect sizes (p=6.4e-28, R2=0.09). The area under the curve is 0.68. The model remains significant after adjusting for sex and body mass index (p=4.1e-27).</p><p id="Par1666"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> PRS modeling shows a strong polygenic component both for HTN status and for BP levels. Despite the limited predictive accuracy expected for BP, which is largely influenced by environmental factors, the strength of associations suggests that PRS could be potentially used for genetic risk stratification.</p><p id="Par1667"><bold>O.

Knowledge of the underlying genetic cause can aid prognostication and clinical management and enables accurate recurrence risk counselling. Here our aim was to identify the causative genetic variant(s) in families with children affected by severe DCM.</p><p id="Par1671"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Exome/genome sequencing was performed on leukocyte DNA from seven children affected with severe DCM and their unaffected parents from five independent families, followed by inheritance-based gene-agnostic variant filtering. Families were brought together by an international collaborative effort facilitated by GeneMatcher.</p><p id="Par1672"><bold>Results:</bold> DCM presented early (range: 3 months – 9 years) and was progressive, resulting in death (<italic>n</italic> = 3) or transplant (<italic>n</italic> = 3), with one child currently awaiting transplant. Biallelic variants in <italic>PPP1R13L</italic> were identified in the affected children in each family. <italic>PPP1R13L</italic> encodes inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 protein (iASPP). iASPP has roles in apoptosis, acts as a regulator of desmosomes and has been implicated in inflammatory pathways. Spontaneous biallelic loss-of-function variants in <italic>PPP1R13L</italic> orthologues have been shown to underlie bovine and murine models of DCM and biallelic variants were previously reported in a single consanguineous family with paediatric DCM.</p><p id="Par1673"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Gene-agnostic exome/genome sequencing is valuable for the identification of novel and emerging candidate genes. The identification of these five families now provides sufficient evidence to support a robust gene-disease association between <italic>PPP1R13L</italic> and severe paediatric DCM. <italic>PPP1R13L</italic> is therefore recommended for inclusion in panel-based genetic testing for paediatric DCM.</p><p id="Par1674"><bold>H.K.

All are extremely rare or absent in controls and databases, and predicted to be pathogenic by several algorithms. Functional analyses of the substitution-mutants unraveled that 3/4 showed decreased ANGPT2 secretion and even inhibited secretion of the wild-type ANGPT2, suggesting that they have a dominant-negative effect.

While the majority of mutations have no functional significance, some can contribute to disease and aging. The nature of the arterial wall, with its media being composed of clonal smooth muscle cells, makes this tissue particularly sensitive to somatic mutagenesis. Here we analyzed progerin, the protein responsible for the premature aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS), for its possible involvement in the accelerated vascular aging process observed in chronic kidney disease (CKD), due to similarities in vascular phenotypes. We provide evidence for expression of progerin, and the occurrence of the HGPS-causing <italic>LMNA</italic> c.1824C&gt;T mutation as a somatic mutation in CKD patient arteries. Clonal populations of vascular cells with the 1824C&gt;T mutation was supported by clusters of progerin positive cells in the media and a high frequency of the mutant allele in several CKD arteries. Further analysis of proliferation and DNA damage in the CKD arteries indicated regeneration and progerin-induced genomic damage. Our results implicate somatic mutations in the functional decline of the vascular wall and support that somatic mutations may become a risk factor during extensive tissue damage.</p><p id="Par1697"><bold>G.

It is the prime cause of acute myocardial infarction in women below the age of 50. Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) presents with condensed areas of arterial stenosis, aneurysm, tortuosity and dissection. It has become clear that FMD is prevalent in SCAD cohorts and vice versa. However, the genetic etiology of both conditions remains largely elusive. We aimed to investigate the contribution of rare genetic variants in vascular Ehlers-Danlos and the Marfan, Loeys-Dietz (LDS), Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome genes to the etiology of SCAD and FMD in a large multi-center patient cohort. Haloplex-based gene panel sequencing of <italic>COL3A1</italic>, <italic>FBN1</italic>, <italic>TGFB2/3, SMAD2/3, TGFBR1/2</italic> and <italic>SKI</italic> was performed in 191 SCAD patients with or without FMD and 111 isolated FMD patients.

Rare variants in <italic>SMAD2</italic> are significantly enriched in SCAD patients compared to controls (p=0.001). A combined LDS-gene burden analysis was performed, revealing a highly significant association (4.5% vs 1.5%; p=0.000003). When performed for FMD, none of the analyses yielded a significant <italic>p</italic>-value or showed a trend. We here provide evidence for an important contribution of rare genetic variants in LDS genes to the etiology of SCAD.

Our aim is to identify genetic factors that influence steroid hormone metabolism, to detect genetic sexual dimorphisms and to investigate possible causal implications for atherosclerotic vascular disease phenotypes.</p><p id="Par1705"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> In two independent cohorts, we performed genome-wide sex-specific meta-association studies of eight steroid hormones: progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), androstenedione, testosterone, estradiol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), cortisol, and aldosterone (LIFE-Adult, LIFE-Heart, max. <italic>n</italic> = 7667). Genome-wide significant loci (p &lt; 5x10<sup>−8</sup>) were tested for sex differences in effect size. The causal relationships between hormone levels and atherosclerotic vascular diseases were investigated using sex-specific eQTL analyses and Mendelian Randomization (MR) approaches.</p><p id="Par1706"><bold>Results:</bold> We detected 22 genome-wide significant loci for seven steroid hormones of our panel, of which nine displayed significant sexual dimorphisms. Eight loci relate to genes coding for enzymes involved in steroid biosynthesis, almost completing the list of genes of this pathway with genetic associations. Other loci correspond, e.g., to the WNT4/β-catenin pathway. MR revealed that cortisol, androstenedione, 17-OHP and DHEA-S had sex-specific causal effects on coronary artery disease.</p><p id="Par1707"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study greatly improves insight into genetic regulation of steroid hormones and their dependence on sex. The significant MR estimates support the hypothesis that steroid hormones influence the development of atherosclerosis, which partly explains the higher risk for men. These results could serve as a basis for analyzing sex-dimorphisms in other complex diseases.</p><p id="Par1708">This project was supported by the HI-MAG Project Funding for Young Scientists of the Medical Faculty of the University Leipzig.</p><p id="Par1709"><bold>J.

The most common reason for genetic testing was enlarged heart at post mortem; however the genetic pick up in this group was 0. Patients with structurally normal hearts had the most variants detected. This would coincide with the majority of variants being found in arrhythmogenic genes. Family history did not influence genetic pick up.

We used whole exome sequencing to assess the prevalence of unique, deleterious variants in the largest cohort of nonsyndromic TOF patients reported to date. The presence of such variants was defined by their absence in the Genome Aggregation Database and bioinformatic prediction of their deleterious effect on function.

Echocardigram showed non-obstructive asymmetrical septal hypertrophy of 17mm maximum at the septum and restrictive physiology. Sarcoid cardiomyopathy was ruled out with negative scintigraphy and unspecific biopsy in the absence of other extracardiac features. Atrio-ventricular ablation and permanent pacing were required in 2002. Clinical deterioration led to frequent heart failure admissions and one episode of syncope.

This very rare neurometabolic disorder is clinically characterized by vegetative symptoms, oculogyric crises, dystonia, and severe neurologic dysfunction, usually beginning in infancy or childhood. Treatment has become available recently. We quantified 3-OMD (3-O-Methyldopa), a suggested AADC-specific biomarker, in dried blood spots by tandem mass spectrometry. Upon suggestive findings, we subsequently analyzed the <italic>DDC</italic> gene by amplicon-based next generation sequencing (NGS) and copy number variant (CNV) screening. This two-step approach identified several patients. The ones with at least one hitherto undescribed variant are described here in detail. All three patients had pathological levels of 3-OMD. In patient 1, we identified a novel whole <italic>DDC</italic> gene duplication in homozygosity. In patient 2, we identified the two missense variants p.(Ser147Ile) and p.(Val60Ala) in compound heterozygosity; interestingly, variant p.(Ser147Ile) was not only novel, but shown to have occurred de novo. In patient 3, p.(Trp121Arg) and p.(Arg347Gln) were identified in compound heterozygosity. The former is novel, while the latter has frequently been described in AADC patients previously. Using a combined biochemical, NGS and CNV approach, a positive identification and diagnosis of AADC deficiency patients is reliably reached. This allows for an early treatment of the patients, leading to an improvement of their quality of life. Moreover, the identification of novel DDC variants and the establishment of correlations with 3-OMD levels can be expected to increase our understanding of the disease.</p><p id="Par1767"><bold>C.

However, its deregulation and accumulation can cause a multitude of pathologies such as histamine intolerance. There are two enzymes involved in the metabolism of histamine: histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT) is responsible for degrading histamine inside cells. Diamine-oxidase (DAO) is the other enzyme involved in the degradation of histamine, mainly exogenous histamine, ingested with the diet. The deficiency of DAO activity could be one of the main causes of histamine intolerance, an alteration in homeostasis that is caused by a reduced intestinal degradation of histamine, with the consequent increase in its plasma levels. Variants in AOC1/ABP1 gene, coding DAO enzyme, have been associated with a reduction in DAO activity and accumulation of histamine.</p><p id="Par1779"><bold>Objective:</bold> The present study aims to demonstrate the negative effect that the variants rs10156191, rs1049742 and rs1049793 have on DAO plasma activity in Caucasian male patients with clinical manifestations associated with histamine intolerance.</p><p id="Par1780"><bold>Methods:</bold> We analyzed 78 white male patients with a clinical manifestation associated with histamine intolerance. Variants analyzed were genotyped by multiplex SNPE (Single Nucleotide Primer Extension).</p><p id="Par1781"><bold>Results:</bold> The variants rs10156191 and rs1049742 reduce significantly DAO plasma activity. Factors such as worsening symptoms after eating a diet rich in histamine or NSAID-type drugs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) are associated with a greater number of alternative alleles in the SNVs analyzed, and reduced DAO plasma activity.</p><p id="Par1782"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results show the predictive value of this genetic study in patients who have a clinical manifestation associated with histamine intolerance.</p><p id="Par1783"><bold>J.

Initially, the level of total galactose and galactose-1-phosphate was determined in a dry blood spot, then an activity of the enzyme galactose phosphate-uridyl transferase (GALT) has been selected as a biochemical marker of galactosemia. The diagnosis of galactosemia should then be confirmed by genetic analysis.</p><p id="Par1789"><bold>Results:</bold> During the 13-year study period 657 newborns were included in the risk group and assigned for molecular genetic testing. Eight children were identified as having classical galactosemia on the basis of the enzymatic and molecular genetic analysis. Moreover,142 babies had a galactosemia Duarte, another 134 had decreasing activity of the GALT enzyme due to non-genetic reasons. The spectrum of revealed mutations in the <italic>GALT</italic> gene: K285N (31.3%), Q188R (25.0%), M142K (12.5%), E352Q (12.5%), W316X (6.2%), R262W (6.2%) and one new variant P140L (6.2%), not described earlier.

However, the lack of integrated phenotypic data, the scarce number of datasets of global metabolomics and the necessary expertise to analyze the functional effects of variants of unknown significance, are limiting the transfer of genetic data into clinical practice. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the powerful of an adequate clinical-biochemical and genetic analysis to drive a clinical response in a timely manner preventing the use of major invasive techniques. With a pipeline that combined specific datasets from metabolomics sub-sections and phenotypic information, with DNA and/or RNA analysis, we identified likely pathogenic variants in strong-candidate genes in 64% of a cohort of 39 patients with clinical suspicion of congenital lactic acidosis. These variants, 14 of which were new, were found in 19 different nuclear and two mitochondrial genes. Specific biochemical test and/or bioenergetics analysis in fibroblasts including measures of oxygen consumption rate, steady-state levels of OxPhos proteins using Blue-native geles, and changes in mitochondrial morphology, sustained the diagnosis for patients carrying novel genotypes. RNA analysis contributed to solve miss or undiagnosed patients, providing a direct insight into transcriptional perturbations caused by specific genetic changes. Finally, by rescuing normal splicing in a GFM1-patient cells carrying in heterozygous fashion the c.689+908G&gt;A change with antisense oligonucleotide treatment, we corroborated the importance of molecular analysis to investigate personalized therapeutic options.

It is therefore vital to know that competitively funded research meets the needs of patients and their clinicians. The Priority Setting Partnerships (PSPs) are an established, collaborative methodology that brings patients, charity representatives and clinicians together to try to establish the most pressing and unanswered research priorities for a particular disease group.</p><p id="Par1836"><bold>Methods:</bold> After a scoping exercise to identify relevant partners, we chose to include questions relevant to both children and adults with primary mitochondrial disorders. A web-based questionnaire was developed and widely disseminated; asking for patients, carers and clinicians to pose their important research questions. This yielded 709 questions from 50 patients, 47 carers and 50 clinicians. These were grouped in to themes and filtered to exclude statements that were personal stories. Extensive literature searching was performed to determine which questions are unanswered based on current evidence. This process resulted in a list of 42 discrete questions. In a second web-based questionnaire, patients, carers and clinicians were invited to rank these 42 questions. This identified 24 questions that were taken forward to a workshop attended by a diverse range of patients, carers, charity representatives and clinicians. The relative merits and strengths of each question were debated to create a definitive ‘top 10 of unanswered research questions’.</p><p id="Par1837"><bold>Results/Conclusion:</bold> Here we present the ‘top 10 of unanswered research questions for primary mitochondrial disorders’, as defined by the patients, their carers and clinicians.</p><p id="Par1838"><bold>J.

A pathogenic variant, which is present in an affected offspring, is often not detectable in various tissues of the mother, and therefore classified as “de novo”. Here we present a case, where an apparent “de novo” variant is actually not de novo, as it is detectable by high coverage NGS in the mother and other maternal relatives.</p><p id="Par1842"><bold>Case:</bold> The male index patient is affected by Leigh syndrome, a classical mitochondrial disease. Symptoms are psychomotor delay and generalized dystonia and MRI brain scans show bilateral symmetrical lesions in the basal ganglia and brainstem. Muscle biopsy showed ragged red fibers. Mother and grandfather are affected by Parkinson´s disease.</p><p id="Par1843"><bold>Results:</bold> Whole exome sequencing identified pathogenic variant m.10158T&gt;C in mtDNA isolated from blood. High coverage NGS revealed that the variant is present in this sample with heteroplasmy of 62% (2710 of 4371 reads). Testing of mother and healthy siblings showed that the variant is present in all investigated tissues with low heteroplasmy (~1%). Therefore the variant is inherited.</p><p id="Par1844"><bold>Discussion:</bold> Apparent de novo mtDNA-variants may be inherited and maternal relatives may be carriers of such variants. High coverage NGS of mtDNA can detect such cases. Increase of heteroplasmy in cases like this must be due to a strong bottleneck effect. If the bottleneck works by unequal partitioning (segregation), at least 6 cell divisions without mtDNA replication must have happened in the reported affected case.</p><p id="Par1845"><bold>U.

Comprehensive analysis of mtDNA was performed using following molecular genetic methods: Sanger sequencing of whole-length mtDNA for detection of point variants, long PCR and MLPA for detection of mtDNA deletions/duplications and RT-PCR for mtDNA copy number analysis.</p><p id="Par1850"><bold>Results:</bold> Six (8.70%) patients were identified with pathogenic mtDNA variants in the cohort of 69 unrelated patients. Common mtDNA pathogenic variant NC_012920.1:m.3243A&gt;G with variable heteroplasmy levels was identified in three unrelated female patients with heterogeneous phenotype of MELAS. Homoplasmic mtDNA pathogenic variants NC_012920.1:m.8993T&gt;C and NC_012920.1:m.9185T&gt;C were identified in patients presenting with Leigh syndrome. Novel heteroplasmic 5888 bp mtDNA deletion NC_012920.1:m.6069_11956del causing Kearns-Sayre syndrome was identified using long PCR and Sanger sequencing while MLPA profile was normal.

A combined genomic and transcriptomic approach was adopted to diagnose mitochondrial disorders in a cohort of 14 Maltese patients. Phenotypic data was recorded in the RD-Connect PhenoTips instance. The nuclear and mitochondrial genome were evaluated by whole exome sequencing. Variant filtration and prioritisation was undertaken using the RD-Connect Genome Phenome Analysis Platform (GPAP). The full transcriptome was analysed by RNA sequencing. Differential expression of candidate variants was confirmed by q-PCR. A HEK-293 cell model was used to functionally characterise the effect of a rare homozygous missense variant on mitochondrial complex 1 activity in one of the patients. Pathogenic variants were characterised according to their functional roles in OXPHOS biogenesis (see Table). The most variants were identified in Complex 1 OXPHOS subunits (N=8) and Complex 1 assembly factor variants were also identified in 4 of these patients. Two patients were diagnosed with MELAS.

Over the last three decades, our ability to recognize mitochondrial patients and diagnose these mutations, linking genotype to phenotype, has greatly improved. However, it has become increasingly clear that these strides in diagnostics have not benefited all population groups. It has been suggested that haplogroup (or lineage) context might influence the presentation and penetrance of mtDNA disease; thus, the spectrum of mutations that are associated with disease in different populations.</p><p id="Par1869"><bold>Methods and Materials:</bold> This paper conducted the most extensive investigation to date into the importance of haplogroup context on the pathogenicity of mtDNA mutations. We searched for proven human point mutations across 726 multiple sequence alignments derived from 33 non-human species absent of disease.</p><p id="Par1870"><bold>Results:</bold> 58 pathogenic point mutations arise in the sequences of these species. We assessed the sequence context and found evidence of population variants that could modulate the phenotypic expression of these point mutations masking the pathogenic effects seen in humans.</p><p id="Par1871"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This supports the theory that sequence context is influential in the presentation of mtDNA disease and has implications for diagnostic practices. Our current understanding of the pathogenicity of mtDNA point mutations, primarily built on studies of individuals with haplogroups HVUKTJ, will not present a complete picture. This will impair our understanding of disease mechanisms and create a diagnostic inequality, whereby individuals who do not belonging to more commonly studied lineages will be less likely to receive a genetic diagnosis.</p><p id="Par1872"><bold>H.

The classical phenotype is late infantile presenting with language developmental delay, with its clinical signs usually appearing between the ages of 2 to 4 years with seizures and a rapid decline of psychomotor functions. Most children are bedridden at 5 years and die around the age of 10 years. Nevertheless, atypical phenotypes have been reported in the literature, creating a clinical challenge to avoid diagnosis without significant delay.</p><p id="Par1876"><bold>Methods:</bold> Clinical, biochemical and neuroradiological data retrospective analysis of five CLN2 patients showing atypical/protracted phenotypes</p><p id="Par1877"><bold>Results:</bold> All four patients (3 males; 2 females) showed an atypical late onset phenotype. First symptons started around 5 - 10 years of age being cerebellar ataxia the most prominent feature. Abnormal findings in brain MRI were found in all patients (cerebellar atrophy and periventricular white matter changes). Seizures were present in three patients, cognitive decline was seen in 4 patients and mild learning disabilities in one. TPP1 enzyme was decreased in all patients, although not in the typical range found in “classical” CLN2 patients.</p><p id="Par1878"><bold>Discussion:</bold> The protracted CLN2 phenotype was previously considered globally rare. In South America, the frequency is approximately 50% of affected individuals.

Information was compiled on: affected gene, age, gender, and country of origin, along with available clinical and metabolic data. A genetic diagnosis of NPD was issued for 733 patients.

They had been referred from 52 distinct countries, with the top 4 countries (Iran, Germany, Brazil and Egypt) collectively accounting for more than 50% of referrals. Translation of the available clinical information into human phenotype ontology (HPO) terms revealed that hepato- and/or splenomegaly was present in 76.5% of patients, intellectual disability in 27.9%, and jaundice in 19.0%. Further frequent HPO terms (i.e. present in &gt;10%) included, abnormality of movement, ataxia, failure to thrive, and seizures. The NPD-specific biomarker LysoSM-509 was pathologically increased in 97.9% of the patients. Our cohort is amongst the largest described to date.

Brain MRI showed subdural hematoma among cerebellar lobes.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is characterized by hyper-inflammation driven by excessive activation and expansion of macrophages and defective Natural Killer (NK) cytotoxicity; it can be fatal if untreated. Here, we identify a previously unrecognized hematological and autoinflammatory condition in four unrelated patients with superimposable features, including neonatal-onset trilinear cytopenia with dyshematopoiesis, autoinflammation, rash, and HLH.</p><p id="Par1933"><bold>Methods:</bold> To delineate this new syndrome, we performed phenotype and whole-genome/exome analyses. In silico, in vitro and in vivo (<italic>C. elegans</italic>) assays allowed to characterize the impact of mutation on localization and function.</p><p id="Par1934"><bold>Results:</bold> All patients shared the same de novo CDC42 mutation (Chr1:22417990C&gt;T, p.R186C) and altered hematopoietic compartment, immune dysregulation, and inflammation. We documented unique effects of the p.R186C on CDC42 localization and function. Indeed, CDC42^R186C showed impaired interaction with known CDC42 regulators and effectors, including RHOGDI, IQGAP1 and WASP, leading to aberrant Golgi accumulation, cytoskeleton rearrangement and reduced growth and migration, which likely underlie the distinctiveness of the trait of this syndrome. Aberrant CDC42 function caused defective NK cytotoxicity, which likely contributes to the HLH phenotype. Timely therapeutic neutralization of IL-1β and IFNγ was critical to the survival of one patient, who underwent successful bone marrow transplantation.</p><p id="Par1935"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The presented data emphasize the crucial role played by CDC42 in hematopoiesis and inflammation.

Some patients develop multiple recurrences, but the clonal relationship between the initial diagnosis and subsequent lymphomas is not routinely assessed. The molecular mechanisms underlying therapy response or failure are still poorly understood. To support diagnostics, guide therapy choices and eventually improve outcome of patients with DLBCL, we aim to define the clonal relationship and mutational landscape of DLBCL recurrences.</p><p id="Par1947"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> In a cohort of 37 matched DLBCL diagnosis and one to three relapse biopsies, clonality analyses were performed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) of immunoglobulin (IG) gene rearrangements. The clonotypes for the different IG gene rearrangements were identified by ARReST/Interrogate bioinformatics. Mutation analysis by whole exome sequencing is currently being performed on a subset of the paired diagnosis-relapse samples.</p><p id="Par1948"><bold>Results:</bold> IG-NGS clonality analyses on matched diagnosis-relapse(s) samples revealed identical dominant clonotype(s) in 33/37 of the recurrences, even in cases with an interval period of 14 years. However, in 4/37 DLBCL patients, at least one of the recurrences was clonally unrelated.</p><p id="Par1949"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> DLBCL recurrences are clonally unrelated lymphomas in ~10% of the cases, suggesting the occurrence of second primary lymphoma, possibly linked to a genetic predisposition or immunodeficiency. Our cohort of clonally related cases will be subjected to mutational analyses to define the patterns of clonal evolution and identify genes related to therapy resistance. These studies will help to define the genetic landscape of relapsed DLBCL.</p><p id="Par1950"><bold>M.R. Berendsen:</bold> None. <bold>M. van den Brand:</bold> None. <bold>J.

Therefore, this study describes the FA cases in the NRC 10 year registry, focusing on family history, clinical, hematological and cytogenetic findings.</p><p id="Par1954"><bold>Methods:</bold> This study included 225 patients. Their age ranged from 4 months to 26 years. All patients were subjected to thorough clinical examination, pedigree construction, hematological and radiological investigations. Cytogenetic assessment using diepoxybutane(DEB)-induced chromosomal breakage was done to differentiate Fanconi anemia from acquired aplastic anemia.</p><p id="Par1955"><bold>Results:</bold> 131 patients (58%) showed positive chromosomal breakage and were diagnosed with FA. 93% of them were of consanguineous parents and 21% showed positive family history as an affected sibling.

While 19-41% of patients carry bi-allelic mutations in <italic>IL36RN</italic>, the majority of patients do not carry mutations in known genes. In order to identify and characterize new pathways involved in the pathogenesis of GPP we performed whole exome sequencing in 31 GPP patients and demonstrated effects of mutations in <italic>MPO</italic> encoding the neutrophilic enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) in myeloid cells. We discovered eight <italic>MPO</italic> mutations resulting in MPO-deficiency in neutrophils and monocytes. Mutations were associated with GPP, primarily those resulting in complete MPO-deficiency (p=3.49E-10; OR=8.63). Dosage of mutant <italic>MPO</italic> alleles showed significant differences between 82 patients and &gt;3,600 controls (p=2.67E-10); this effect was stronger when including <italic>IL36RN</italic> mutations (p &lt; 2.20E-16) and correlated with a younger age of onset (p=0.0018). Activity of four proteases, previously implicated as activating enzymes of IL-36 precursors, correlated with MPO-deficiency. Formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) was reduced following phorbol myristate acetate induction (p=0.015). Phagocytosis assays in MPO-deficient mice and human suggested that altered neutrophil function together with impaired clearance of neutrophils by monocytes (efferocytosis) allowed prolonged neutrophil persistence in patients’ skin.<italic>MPO</italic> mutations contribute significantly to GPP’s pathogenesis. Our study implicates MPO as an inflammatory modulator in humans by regulating protease activity and NET formation, and modifying efferocytosis. Our findings confine using MPO inhibitors in cardiovascular diseases. MPO and affected pathways represent attractive targets for inducing resolution of inflammation in neutrophil-mediated skin diseases.</p><p id="Par1961"><bold>S.

Fanconi Syndrome(FS) is a rare syndrome belonging to this family characterized by neurodevelopmental delay, radial-ray defects, microcephaly and progressive deficiency of bone marrow production. Material and Methods: We present a 33-year-old female who was monitored for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Clinical findings of the patient included short stature, microcephaly, neurodevelopmental delay, patchy hypopigmented dark-colored skin, signs of premature aging and chronic liver disease.</p><p id="Par1965"><bold>Results:</bold> Chromosomal breakage rate was detected high after mitomycin-C(MMC) treatment of cells suggesting chromosomal instability syndrome.

But does the cfDNA have a physiological role? Here we show that cfDNA presence in plasma of healthy individuals plays an indispensable role in immune system regulation. We exposed THP1 cells to healthy individuals’ plasma with (NP) and without (TP) cfDNA. In cells treated with NP, we found elevated expression of genes whose products maintain immune system homeostasis. Exposure of cells to TP triggered an innate immune response (IIR), documented particularly by elevated expression of pro-inflammatory interleukin 8. The results of mass spectrometry showed a higher abundance of proteins associated with IIR activation due to the regulation of complement cascade in cells cultivated with TP. Our results provide evidence that the presence of cfDNA in plasma of healthy individuals blocks fundamental mechanisms of the inflammation process. The expression profiles show that this process could play an important role in the regulation of tissue homeostasis. This finding epitomizes one of many intriguing properties and features of the human immune system. Its detailed understanding is of crucial interest for future medical applications.

Common genetic variants in underlying genes have been linked to various inflammation-mediated diseases and pathogen induced cytokine responses, but the role of rare variants remains to be elucidated. In this study, we characterize the role of rare and common genetic variation in 48 genes related to the IL-1 pathway, on in vitro stimulation-specific human cytokine responses from 463 healthy individuals. We identified strong <italic>NCF4</italic> and <italic>CASP1</italic> rare variant associations with IL-6 cytokine production induced by phytohaemagglutinin (P=7.2E<sup>−05</sup>) and lipopolysacharide (LPS) (P=3.0E<sup>−05</sup>). Additionally, common variants in <italic>IL36A</italic> and <italic>IL38</italic> were associated to both <italic>C.albicans</italic> induced IL-1β and IL-6 (<italic>IL36A</italic> P=0.0442 and 0.0037; <italic>IL38</italic> P=0.0092 and 0.0082), an effect that was magnified on the respective IL-30 subpathway level (IL-1β P=0.0017; IL-6 P=1.8E<sup>−04</sup>). The common variant signature for the immunological response to <italic>C.albicans</italic> was confirmed by an association with the anti-inflammatory phenotype group (IL-1β P=1.87E<sup>−03</sup>; IL-6 P=5.75E<sup>−04</sup>), and we validated this for non-coding common variants. Lastly, we detected an association between rare variants in pro-inflammatory genes and LPS-induced IL-6 cytokine (P=2.42E<sup>−04</sup>), and discovered a role for rare variants in anti-inflammatory genes on <italic>S.aureus</italic> induced IL-6 production (P=6.71E<sup>−03</sup>). In conclusion, we show that both common and rare genetic variation in genes of the IL-1 pathway differentially influence in vitro cytokine responses to various stimuli in healthy individuals. This study therefore provides insight into potential mechanisms relevant for the characterization of genetic variant involvement in variability of immune responses and possibly inflammatory-mediated diseases.</p><p id="Par1975"><bold>R.C. van Deuren:</bold> None. <bold>P.

These immunodeficiencies can be either primary such as Bruton’s disease or secondary as the one caused by HIV infectionIn our case, a 35 years old healthy female patient was referred to our lab, who lost two of her brothers with severe immunodeficiency. She is about to have her first child and wanted to be tested before the pregnancy. The suspected familiar diagnosis, based only clinical symptoms, was X-linked agammaglobulinemia which is a X-linked monogenic disorder. After sequencing of the BTK gene, MLPA were carried out, both returned with negative results. After second genetic counselling it was revealed by the counsellor that the suspected phenotype is not fit entirely and targeted gene panel test was ordered, included 200 genes which are linked to immunodeficiencies. A pathogenic heterozygous deletion in the CD40LG gene (c.67dupA) was identified, which is a known cause of X-linked immunodeficiency, with hyper-IgM. HIGM is a rare immunodeficiency characterized by normal or elevated serum IgM levels associated with markedly decreased IgG, IgA, and IgE, resulting in a profound susceptibility to bacterial infections and an increased susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Patients also tend to have neutropenia, as well as a high rate of gastrointestinal and central nervous system infections. Based on estimation only 20% of patients will reach the third decade of life.

Increased levels of circulating IL-6 in blood is associated with the pathophysiology of complex disorders like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases. Albeit, IL-6 levels are heritable with estimates up to 61%, only a few common genetic loci associated with circulating IL-6 levels have been identified. We therefore conducted a two stage (discovery and replication) meta genome-wide association study (GWAS) of circulating serum IL-6 concentrations comprising up to 67,428 individuals of european ancestry. About 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were available for testing after imputation to Hap Map 2 reference panel. We conducted an inverse variance based fixed effects meta-analysis. We identified three IL-6 associated, independent signals on chromosomes (chr) 2q14, 6p21 and 1q21, reaching genome-wide significance (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 5.0 × 10<sup>−8</sup>) in the combined meta-analyses. Among the identified loci <italic>IL1F10/IL1RN</italic> (chr 2q14, <italic>p</italic> = 1.8 × 10<sup>−11</sup>), and <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic>/<italic>DRB5</italic> (chr 6p21, <italic>p</italic> =1.5 × 10<sup>−10</sup>) were novel while <italic>IL6R</italic> (chr 1q21, <italic>p</italic> = 1.2 × 10<sup>−122</sup>) was a known locus. Our study identifies 2 novel loci for circulating IL-6 levels uncovering new immunological and inflammatory pathways that may influence IL-6 pathobiology.</p><p id="Par1990"><bold>T.S.

Clinical features in individual patients can be highly variable, ranging from mild arthritis, skin manifestations and antinuclear antibody production to life-threatening organ disease. SLE exhibits a striking female predominance, with ratios exceeding 9:1. The disease often displays a more aggressive clinical course in men, resulting in poorer prognosis. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain this gender bias, including X-chromosome inactivation, sex hormones and TLR/miRNAs altered expression.</p><p id="Par1998"><bold>Methods:</bold> By employing data from mRNA sequencing in whole blood samples from 142 SLE patients and 58 healthy volunteers we explore gender/disease specific patterns of gene expression and their putative functional gene networks as suggested by DAVID analysis.</p><p id="Par1999"><bold>Results:</bold> Genes displaying a stepwise up-/down-regulation upon comparison of their expression in the order of healthy males (HM), healthy females (HF), affected females (AF) and affected males (AM) groups, were the most over-represented among all possible combinations. These genes appeared to belong to pathways highly relevant to SLE pathogenesis, including NOD-/Toll-like receptor signaling, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, nucleotide excision repair and spliceosome (<italic>p</italic>-values &lt; 0.05).</p><p id="Par2000"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although preliminary, our results suggest that gender bias may - at least partially - be reflected by patterns of altered expression of genes/pathways relevant to SLE.

Therefore, in this study we investigated the relationship between expressionpattern of hsa-miR-378a-3p, hsa-miR-668-3p and hsa-miR 942-5p and lymphocytesconcentration in DS.</p><p id="Par2005"><bold>Material and Methods:</bold> Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 52healthy individuals with full trisomy 21 (DS) (age 1 to 20) and 53 healthy control (HC)(age 1 to 12). MicroRNAs expression was investigated by real time polymerase chainreaction using Taqman assays. Statistical analysis was performed using One-SampleWilcoxon Signed Rank Test, in the GraphPad Prism 6 software. Bioinformatic analysiswas carried out to identify genes regulated by expressed differentially microRNAs andthe interaction between proteins using MiRTarbase v9 and STRING t-v11.0 tool.</p><p id="Par2006"><bold>Results:</bold> DS individuals presented over-expression of hsa-miR-378a-3p (RQ 1.22, P=0.036) and down-expression of hsa-miR-668-3p (RQ 0.42, P=0.018). Moreover, thisindividuals presented lower lymphocytes concentration than HC (mean 36.70, 48.68; respectively, P=0.007). Network analysis showed that genes regulated by hsa-miR-378a-3p and hsa-miR-668-3p are significantly involved in cell differentiation, celldivision, cell cycle (P=&lt;0.001) and regulation of cell growth (P=0.02).</p><p id="Par2007"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The lower lymphocytes concentration in DS may in part explain the highfrequency of immune alterations.

Family history showed a sister who died due to cerebral tumors at the age of 3. The personal medical history was insignificant. The clinical examination revealed more than 6, cafe au lait” spots larger than 0,5cm and multiple axillary freckling, signs which support the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis. The clinical exam of the parents was normal. Laboratory explorations showed a normochromic, normocytic anemia, normal ferritin level, liver and kidney function, folate deficiency, but also immunological abnormalities: IgA, IgG2 and IgG4 deficiency, poor response to vaccination, low memory B cells and a normal number of T cell subpopulations. Ophthalmologic examination was normal. The cerebral MRI-scan highlighted multiple 0,5 and 4 cm in diameter tumors. The cerebral biopsy revealed a diffuse astrocytoma IDH mutant and she started chemotherapy.

We leveraged the rich phenotypic data in the UK Biobank to identify genetic loci that influence response to multiple infections.</p><p id="Par2026"><bold>Methods:</bold> We undertook 45 genome-wide association studies of antibody responses against common pathogens, in 9,611 participants from UK Biobank, identifying <italic>NFKB1</italic> as a common locus. Using incidence of disease in 487,409 UK Biobank participants, we investigated the association between <italic>NFKB1</italic> variation and 91 infection and inflammation phenotypes. To better understand the impact of variation on underlying immune mechanisms, we also explored the effect of these variants on eight blood cell traits and cellular expression data.</p><p id="Par2027"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified an insertion-deletion variant (rs28362491), known to affect <italic>NFKB1</italic> promoter binding, as a likely causal variant. The insertion allele has a protective effect against infection, but increases the risk of allergic disease. The same variant was associated with shifts in haematopoietic pathways, and likely impacts cell survival, antibody production and inflammation. Interestingly, this variant is relatively common in all human populations, suggesting that variation within this locus is largely maintained through balancing selection.</p><p id="Par2028"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We find that disruptions to the tightly regulated immune responses and inflammatory processes can tip the balance between exacerbated immune responses and allergy, or increased risks of infection and impaired resolution of inflammation.

However, the reasons for clonal expansion in an acquired loss of function of GPI biosynthesis, is still a matter of debate.

A somatic CN-LOH in the HSC comprised almost the entire p-arm of chromosome 1. Hence, the <italic>MPL</italic> mutation p.W5151L gained dominance and deteriorated ET and while homozygosity of p.R469X in <italic>PIGV</italic> resulted in a GPI-anchor deficiency and manifestation of PNH. In addition to ET and PNH, the patient presented with nephrotic syndrome that ceased after treatment with eculizumab and hydroxycarbamide. We determined the origin of kidney injury as a result of podocyte instability due to an increase of non-GPI linked soluble uPAR. In this report we identified PIGV as a novel gene causing PNH and provide insights into the pathomechanism of acquired GPI anchor deficiency and expansion of PNH cells. Furthermore, we discuss the contribution of PNH to kidney injury.</p><p id="Par2034"><bold>A. Maurel-Ribes:</bold> None. <bold>A. Knaus:</bold> None. <bold>C. Garcia:</bold> None. <bold>H.

PsA is considered a T-cell mediated disease with a complex genetic basis. To date, GWAS identified &gt;60 largely overlapping susceptibility loci for PsA/ PsV including <italic>RUNX3</italic>, while the respective disease-contributing mechanism remained mostly uncertain. <italic>RUNX3</italic> encodes a transcription factor expressed e.g. in immune cells, including T-cells, and skin. As genotyping arrays had insufficient coverage at this locus, we selected 32 tagging SNPs for further fine-mapping. Association analysis in 3,049 PsA patients and 6,178 controls of the Psoriatic Arthritis Genetics in Europe consortium showed significant association to an LD-wise isolated intronic SNP (p=1.50E-11) and to 5 SNPs (5.43E-12≤p≤2.78E-07) within one intragenic LD block. Genomic annotations for 38 SNPs in high LD (r<sup>2</sup>≥0.9) with the SNPs were inconclusive, including histone modifications and DNAse-sensitive sites in immune cells. Haplotype and conditional analyses, though, pointed to disease-contribution of the common, evolutionary conserved variant c.53T&gt;A/p.Ile18Asn in alternative exon 1. Targeted deep-sequencing of cDNA from CD8+ T-cells unveiled alternative splicing in homozygous wildtype carriers, but a reduced number of splicing products and lack of alternative splicing in homozygous risk-allele carriers. Comparative transcriptome analysis in CD8+ T-cells of homozygous carriers provided evidence for differentially expressed genes involved in T-cell exhaustion signaling, Th1/ Th2 activation and T-helper-cell differentiation. Our study indicates that the <italic>RUNX3</italic> risk-allele in PsA reduces splicing variability thereby contributing to altered signaling, activation and differentiation of T-cells.</p><p id="Par2052"><bold>U.D.

PADI genes can provide peptidyl citrulline which is a target antigen of anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs) that is highly sensitive and specific antibodies in RA. After that, PADI2 was also identified as susceptibility gene with RA. But, it is not clear how these PADI genes are involved in the development of rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between PADI4 gene and PADI2 gene in the progression of RA.</p><p id="Par2056">To clarify the physiological function of PADI4 and PADI2, we used collagen-induced arthritis (CIA), known as a RA model mouse. We examined that localization of PADI4 and PADI2 protein was indicated by immunohistochemistry in CIA mice. We also measured expression of PADI genes and various inflammatory cytokines in immune cells by real-time TaqMan assay and ELISA, respectively. We generated PADI4−/− and PADI2−/− mice, and performed experimental arthritis. We demonstrated that the clinical disease score was significantly decreased in PADI4−/− mice and PADI2−/− mice.</p><p id="Par2057">PADI4 expression was induced by CII immunization.

A 10 day old girl, born to consanguineous Lebanese parents was referred to our Medical Genetics Unit for genetic evaluation, because of a family history of SCID. Lymphocytic immunophenotyping and serum immunoglobulin testing revealed a low absolute lymphocyte count, T cell lymphopenia with a significant decrease in naïve T cells and normal circulating B cells count including mainly immature B cells. SCID/atypical SCID was suspected in the patient. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was conducted and did not reveal any mutation in the SCID genes.

Prior investigations were inconclusive. Family history suggested AR mode of inheritance. We performed whole-exome sequencing of siblings and parents. Whole-exome libraries were prepared according to the Nimblegen SeqCap EZ Exome v3 protocol and sequencing was performed on NextSeq 500 for all of them. Furthermore, we performed in silico analysis of a virtual gene panel, focused on congenital neutropenias. Whole-exome sequencing identified a compound heterozygous genotype in SBDS gene in both siblings. We identified a likely pathogenic missense variant c.355T&gt;C; p.(Cys119Arg) in exon 3 of SBDS gene, leading to substitution of strongly conserved cysteine for arginine. This variant has been previously reported in a French family with SDS (Donadieu et al., 2012). Furthermore, we identified a rare, previously undescribed missense variant, c.536C&gt;T; p.(Pro179Leu), leading to prolin - leucine substitution. In-silico analysis (Align GVGD, SIFT, MutationTaster) predicts pathogenic or likely pathogenic effect. Molecular-genetic analysis of parents confirmed heterozygous carrier status. Compound heterozygous mutations in SBDS leads to disruption of SBDS gene and clinical manifestation of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome in the siblings.

For each variable HBV amino acid, a genome-wide association study was conducted using generalized linear mixed models and controlling for human and viral population structures.</p><p id="Par2076"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified strong associations (p=1.9E-12) between an Asian-specific missense SNP in the <italic>SLC10A1</italic> gene encoding the HBV receptor NTCP (rs2296651) and amino acids in HBV large surface (preS1 domain) and polymerase proteins. The minor allele is present in 7% of East Asians (1KG Project) and was previously reported to associate with decreased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic HBV. We also identified significant associations (p=8.7E-13) between variants of HLA-A protein and amino acids in HBV polymerase and core proteins.</p><p id="Par2077"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our joint analysis of human and viral genomes shows that variation in NTCP exerts selective pressure on HBV during chronic infection, and confirms the impact of HLA class I variation on HBV epitopes. These results demonstrate the power of the G2G approach to identify host restriction factors and identify specific HBV amino acids likely to be involved in the interaction between HBV and its cellular receptor.</p><p id="Par2078"><bold>Z.

Despite their estimated lineage, B-cell leukemias manifest a remarkably high incidence of TCR gene rearrangements. According to indirect estimation, TCR alpha (TRA) incidence in B-cell precursor ALL could reach 46%. Currently, rearrangements of all BCR and 3/4 TCR loci are used for this purpose with the exception of TRA due to the large number of multiplex primers needed to amplify all TRA segments.</p><p id="Par2097"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We developed the first targeted sequencing-based method for identification of TRA clonal rearrangements. gDNA was extracted from a bone marrow of children with B-ALL.

However, this association is confounded by shared heritability, and genetic studies have focused exclusively on severe infection.

To determine whether there are genetic variants involved with susceptibility or resistance to infection, we performed the first GWAS on non-severe RSV infection.</p><p id="Par2112"><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed GWAS analyses of healthy term infants in a population-based birth cohort (INSPIRE) specifically designed to determine the effect of infant RSV infection on later child health.

A peculiar feature of this infection is the extreme variability in clinical presentation, ranging from very mild sub-clinical flu-like symptoms to acute respiratory distress syndrome with high mortality. This heterogenous presentation poses the question whether individual variability of immune response to the virus can be influenced by genetic factors. Specifically, it is unknown whether HLA and AB0 can explain the different prevalence in population of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its clinical evolution. To address this point, a retrospective analysis was performed on an Italian cohort composed by subjects who received organ transplantation and candidates in a waiting list in a 2002-March 2020 time frame. A total of 56,304 cases were studied with the aim of comparing HLA and AB0 frequencies according to the presence (COVID<sup>+</sup>) or absence (COVID<sup>−</sup>) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prevalence of COVID was 0.112% in the Italian population and 0.462% in waitlisted and transplanted patients. HLA-B*51 and HLA-DRB1*08 were more frequent in COVID<sup>+</sup> compared to COVID<sup>−</sup>, while HLA-DRB1*07 showed a protective effect. In transplant recipients, HLA-DRB1*08 was an indicator of mortality (1.9% in living <italic>vs</italic> 15.2% in the deceased, OR=9.4 95%CI[1.9-47.3]; P=.006). Moreover, blood group A was more frequent in COVID<sup>+</sup> (45.5%) than in COVID<sup>−</sup> (39.0%). Overall, this study shows for the first time that some HLA antigens influence SARS-CoV-2 infection and its clinical evolution and confirms that blood group A subjects are at greater risk of infection.</p><p id="Par2120"><bold>T.

The function of this protein, and its role in human health is unclear. However, is highly expressed in the cerebellum and cerebellar hemisphere regions of brain (gtexportal.org). It is hypothesized that <italic>ANKRD12</italic> plays a role in inhibiting the ligand dependent transactivation by recruiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) to the p160 coactivators/nuclear receptor complex. HDACs are involved in the regulation of gene expression. Pathogenic variants in another member of the Ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein, ANKRD11, cause the KBG syndrome whose phenotypes include intellectual disability, developmental delay and seizures in some patients. Here, we report six affected individuals from three unrelated families that carry homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in <italic>ANKRD12</italic>. Four of these individuals are from a consanguineous Pakistani family, and have a homozygous non-synonymous variant c.3425A&gt;C,p.(Lys1142Thr) in <italic>ANKRD12</italic> (NM_015208.4). The other two are from the USA and carry compound heterozygous variants in <italic>ANKRD12</italic>; c.4511C&gt;T,p.(Ser1504Leu)/c.3375_3377del in one, and c.5251C&gt;G, p.(Leu1751Val)/deletion of exon 1 of the transcript NM_001204056.1 in the other. Phenotypes noted in these individuals include intellectual disability, aphasia, delayed motor milestones, hypotonia, mild hearing loss, and seizures (in one patient). Functional experiments in drosophila are in progress and will be presented in the meeting. Further investigations need to be done to understand the disease mechanism. However, the phenotypic similarity of the patients and the expression data from GTEx indicate that pathogenic <italic>ANKRD12</italic> variants may cause a recessive disease characterized by intellectual disability, developmental delay, hypotonia and mild hearing loss.</p><p id="Par2139"><bold>M.

Interestingly, Caprin-1<sup>+/-</sup> animal models show defects in the development of dendrites and dendritic spines and are characterized by a reduction in social interactions and lower response to novelty.

Here we report the description of seven affected individuals with de novo and three cases with inherited loss-of-function (LoF) variants in <italic>CAPRIN1</italic>. Our cases show a broad spectrum of phenotypes, that ranges from ASD to language delay, intellectual disability, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and epileptic seizures. Other traits, such as abnormal facial features and skeletal anomalies are observed in subgroup of cases. <italic>CAPRIN1</italic> is predicted to be an haploinsufficient gene by computational pLI score (GnomAD). Taking advantage of the availability of patients-derived cells, we demonstrated a half-dose of <italic>CAPRIN1</italic> mRNA levels, caused by nonsense mediated decay of the transcripts with LoF variants, that is followed by a parallel protein level half-dose. Our data lay the bases for further characterization of the involvement of <italic>CAPRIN1</italic> in neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting the haploinsufficiency of this gene as causative of a form of ASD with a possible incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity.</p><p id="Par2143"><bold>L.

By whole-exome sequencing, we identified a novel patient with a de novo likely pathogenic variant (c.1586A&gt;G; p.(Asp529Gly)) and a familial case with three siblings who inherited a nonsense change from an affected mother (c.1357G&gt;T; p.(Glu453*)). Moreover, we report a de novo 39-kb deletion encompassing <italic>TLK2</italic> gene. Clinical phenotype included intellectual disability, facial dysmorphisms, microcephaly and anomalies of the hands as prevalent features, in accordance with previously reported cases.TLK2 is involved in many fundamental processes, including DNA replication, cell cycle checkpoint recovery and chromatin remodelling, through its regulation of the ASF1 histone chaperone. TLK2 is essential in mice for placental development but how TLK2 mutated protein affects central nervous system development remains largely unclear. Using spatial proteomics (BioID), we have investigated the proximity interaction landscape of TLK2 and analysed the effects of missense mutations on TLK2 interactions, localization and activity. These results demonstrated that TLK2 activity is strongly impaired by the p.(Asp529Gly) mutation and identified new links between TLK2 and other proteins implicated in neurological disorders. Moreover, single cell gel electrophoresis demonstrated a more relaxed state of chromatin in lymphoblastoid cells harbouring the p.(Asp529Gly) variant compared to control cells. In conclusion, our study has identified novel <italic>TLK2</italic>-patient pathogenic variants and provided new insights into the role of <italic>TLK2</italic> in intellectual disability.</p><p id="Par2147"><bold>L.

Due to atypical information processing within the brain, individuals with Autism highly rely on predictable procedures, e.g. daily routines. Changes of these procedures increases stress in the individuals. To investigate stress effects on autistic phenotype development, we used a Tsc2 heterozygous KO mouse model. Heterozygous mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which both negatively regulated the mTOR kinase cause tuberous sclerosis, which is frequently associated with mental retardation, autism and epilepsy. We assessed sociability, anxiety, cognition and sensorimotor gating, and found significant deficits in Tsc2 heterozygous KO animals. In a second step we asked, how chronic social defeat stress affects the behavior of these mice. The chronic social defeat stress (CSD) procedure used had been shown to effectively induce a depression-like phenotype in wildtype animals. Interestingly, in Tsc2 heterozygous KO mice exposure to CSD stress lead to an improvement in some behavioural domains including repetitive behavior, sensomotoric gating and working memory suggesting an inverse stress reaction in these animals. Proteomic analysis of synaptosomal fractions of the prefrontal cortex in stressed and non-stressed animals revealed a significant overlap of pathways affected in Tsc2 animals and stressed wildtype and Tsc2 KO animals. This data suggests that the mTOR kinase is involved in the response following chronic social defeat stress and surprisingly point towards a potentially beneficial effect of manageable stress in autistic children.</p><p id="Par2151"><bold>A.

Biallelic loss-of-function (LOF) variants in <italic>CENPF</italic> gene are responsible for Stromme disease, a condition presenting with intestinal atresia, anterior ocular chamber anomalies, and microcephaly.</p><p id="Par2180"><bold>Cases:</bold> Through an international collaboration, 5 individuals (2 females and 3 males) carrying novel <italic>CENPF</italic> biallelic variants (1 missense and 4 LOF) were identified by ES. Four individuals were lacking the distinctive clinical abnormalities of Stromme disease, such as intestinal atresia or anterior chamber malformation of the eye. All individuals had microcephaly (average -3.2 SDS, ranging from -2 SDS to -5.1 SDS) and developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID). Genitourinary malformations (3/5), short stature (2/5), and epilepsy (2/5) were also observed. The five individuals shared a recognizable pattern of dysmorphic facial features with sloping forehead, flat philtrum, and anteverted nares.</p><p id="Par2181"><bold>Discussion:</bold> ES is rapidly changing the diagnostic process and the ‘genotype-first’ approach is rapidly becoming the method of choice. In the context of ES, reverse-phenotyping (i.e., refinement of clinical presentations in light of the identified genetic variants) is important for gene variant interpretation. The small case series of individuals with biallelic <italic>CENPF</italic> variants herein presented offers evidence of clinical variability of Stromme disease. Microcephaly, DD/ID and dysmorphic features are consistent even in the absence of intestinal atresia or malformation of the anterior chamber of the eye.</p><p id="Par2182"><bold>M.

Since 2016, 32 patients with mild to severe ID have been reported in the literature[AS1], all carrying de novo variations. We report here new patients carrying a pathogenic <italic>CLTC</italic> variant, including inherited mutations, suggesting the existence of familial forms. By a collaboration throught the French AnDDi-Rares reference centers network, we collected 10 patients (4 girls and 6 boys), from 8 families, with <italic>CLTC</italic> pathogenic variants (diagnosed by solo exome sequencing or array-CGH). They presented with mild to moderate ID, variably associated with epilepsy, stereotypies, developmental delay and autism spectrum disorders. For five patients, from three families, the variation was inherited from a parent initially considered asymptomatic, including one with a somatic mosaicism (52%). After being questioned again about their personal history, it turned out that these parents had initially presented with learning difficulties or behavioural disorder and a favorable evolution. The identification of pathogenic <italic>CLTC</italic> variations inherited from paucisymptomatic parents allows us to envisage that this gene’s phenotype is not limited to the initially described forms, exclusively caused by de novo variations. Familial forms appear to be less severe and permit to expand the phenotypic spectrum associated with <italic>CLTC</italic> mutations. This work also illustrates how difficult it is to interpret inherited variations, and that it is sometimes necessary to reconsider the initial clinical hypothesis with a more precise familial history.</p><p id="Par2193"><bold>C.

Three of those were reported as de novo, in two cases the deletion was inherited and in one case parental testing was not performed. One of the two inherited cases was from an affected parent. Two more de novo deletions were reported by others in the literature. In an additional patient we diagnosed a de novo stop mutation in <italic>CMIP</italic>.

Atypical CdLS shows locus heterogeneity and can be caused by monoallelic DNM in genes encoding components of the cohesin system and other chromatin associated proteins. The MRC HGU cohort of CdLS individuals (HGU<sup>CdLS</sup>) has been extensively screened by arrayCGH, Sanger-, targeted gene panel-, and exome sequencing, identifying pathogenic variants in the known cohesin-related genes (NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, RAD21, HDAC8) and in core SFARI genes (SETD5, ANKRD11, KMT2A). We have now performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) of DNA from 107 “mutation-negative” CdLS individuals from 105 families, analysed as 42 nuclear trios, 2 quads (affected sibs and parents), and 63 singletons (197 individuals WGS in total). We have identified intragenic likely causative variants in EP300 (2), MED13L (1), EHMT1 (2), and ARID1B (1), together with previously unidentified mutations in NIPBL (9), ANKRD11 (6), KMT2A, and SETD5. We have also identified plausibly causative DNM in the 5’UTR (2) and deep intronic regions of NIPBL together with both balanced and unbalanced structural variants (SV) at this and other loci. In total WGS has identified a likely pathogenic variant in 30% of affected individuals providing a higher than expected diagnostic uplift from known loci.

It is involved in transcription-coupled histone modification, by promoting H3K4 and H3K36 methylation. Moreover, CTR9 also modulates the cellular trafficking of the dopamine transporter. Through GeneMatcher, molecular and clinical data of 11 probands were collected. In all probands, whole exome sequencing identified <italic>CTR9</italic> missense variants, encompassing 10 de novo and 1 inherited from an affected father. Recurrent patient findings were intellectual disability, ranging from borderline to severe (10/11), speech delay (8/11), autism spectrum disorder (5/11) associated with regression and aggressive behavior during late childhood (3/11), hypotonia (6/11), joint hyperlaxity (5/11), fatigability (4/11), coordination problems (3/11) and mild dysmorphism. EM and crystal structure modelling of the activated human transcription complex Pol II-DSIF-PAF-SPT6 and the PAF1/CTR9 complex predict a likely disruptive effect on local CTR9 structure and/or protein interaction of the different missense variants. In yeast, the role of the PAF1C in H3K4 and H3K36 methylation is exerted by regulating the activity of Set1 and Set2. Interestingly, pathogenic variants on the human orthologues <italic>SETD1A</italic>, <italic>SETD1B</italic> and <italic>SETD2</italic> are known causes of neurodevelopmental deficits. In skin fibroblasts from four of the CTR9 mutant patients, an effect on H3K4 and H3K36 methylation is currently under investigation. In conclusion, we describe a novel dominant neurodevelopmental disorder caused by (mainly) de novo variants in <italic>CTR9</italic>, likely affecting PAF1C function.</p><p id="Par2205"><bold>M.E.C.

CYFIP2 plays an important role in the regulation of actin polymerization as a member of the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) and in transcription regulation via the interaction with the fragile X mental retardation protein. We evidenced that the pathogenic <italic>CYFIP2</italic> variants spatially cluster and are predicted to weaken the interaction of CYFIP2 with WASF1 or NCKAP1 of the WRC-complex. We now have identified further 18 patients harboring two previously described, one novel recurrent and 10 novel unique pathogenic missense variants, as well as the first three loss-of-function variants.</p><p id="Par2209">Genotype-phenotype correlation indicates a profound phenotype for substitutions at the mutational hotspot p.Arg87 and a more variable phenotype in other recurrent missense alterations, while there is currently no evidence that haploinsufficiency leads to a similarly severe phenotype. Consistent with the role of CYFIP2 in WRC-mediated actin polymerization our functional studies demonstrate aberrant regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in all six available patient fibroblasts. Our study further delineates the clinical and molecular spectrum of this novel disease and provides evidence for WRC-mediated actin dynamics as a cellular pathomechanism.</p><p id="Par2210">AR was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) grant 320030_179547.

PSD-95 protein, encoded by <italic>DLG4</italic>, is located in the post-synaptic density and regulates excitatory synaptic maturation and function. Only a few patients heterozygous for pathogenic variants in <italic>DLG4</italic> have been reported to date. The characteristic features include intellectual disability (ID) (some with marfanoid habitus (MH)), developmental disorders including autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and schizophrenia.</p><p id="Par2215"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> A total of 44 patients (33 unpublished) were included. The unpublished cases were identified through GeneMatcher or Decipher and clinical investigations were carried out by the local clinicians. Pathogenic variants in <italic>DLG4</italic> were identified through next-generation sequencing (NGS) based technologies.</p><p id="Par2216"><bold>Results:</bold> Mean age of clinical onset was 1.4 years and mean age at last evaluation was 14 years (1.5-47). The most frequent manifestations were developmental delay (25 patients) (developmental regression; 12), ID (37)(severe 9, moderate 15, mild 9), ASD (20), epilepsy (19), ADHD (16), ophthalmological manifestations (16). MH was present in 5 cases. MRI abnormalities were reported in 11 cases. Most of the <italic>DLG4</italic> variants were truncating whereas 6 were missense, located in the functional domains of the protein. There were no differences in clinical severity between patients with the two groups of variants.</p><p id="Par2217"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Clinical manifestations associated with <italic>DLG4</italic> variants are similar to those of other synaptopathies, mainly ID, ASD and epilepsy. MH is not a characteristic feature of the condition. NGS is fundamental to establish a molecular diagnosis, given the non-specific clinical spectrum here reported.</p><p id="Par2218"><bold>A.

In addition, DS is associated with substantial cognitive and neuropsychological decline as a result of seizures during brain development. It is therefore important to timely control seizure activity. Although numerous antiepileptic drugs are available, it remains a challenge for clinicians to select effective drugs with minimal side effects for each specific patient, and a predictive tool to investigate treatment options is lacking. Moreover, Dravet syndrome is associated with both genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, which increases the complications of finding an appropriate treatment. ln 70%-80% of the cases, DS results from de novo mutations in the <italic>SCN1A</italic> gene, encoding the voltage gated sodium channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.1. Conversely, not every patient with a mutation in <italic>SCN1A</italic> develops DS, and also milder clinical phenotypes can arise. In addition to <italic>SCN1A</italic>, other genes have been associated with a DS phenotype. Animal models can neither recapitulate mutation-specific effects nor genetic background factors, and are unsuitable for devising personalized medicine interventions. This research proposes the development of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC), differentiated into induced neurons as a patient-specific disease model. The neurons are cultured into a neuronal network on micro-electrode arrays (MEAs), able to record network activity by embedded micro-electrodes. Here, we report a patient specific neuronal network (PNN) fingerprint of DS on both the single cell and the network level. With this PNN, we aim to provide a predictive tool to model DS and to explore treatment options in vitro.</p><p id="Par2222"><bold>E.J.H. van Hugte:</bold> None. <bold>E.

The DISSEQ study aims to assess the efficiency of different NGS strategies in the diagnosis of patients with intellectual disability from a cohort of 330 patients (205 males/127 females) without previous genetic investigation, using double-blind strategy 1 (array-CGH+FRAXA+large gene panel sequencing (459 genes)) and strategy 2 (FRAXA+exome (ES)). Preliminary results in 235/330 patients display a positive diagnosis in 85/235 (36 %) (62 SNV, 21 CNV, 1 FRAXA, 4 double-hits): 29.7% with strategy 1 and 30% with strategy 2. The results were concordant in 88%. Gene panel and ES identified a positive diagnosis in 58/235 (25%) and 66/235 (28%), respectively. No SNV interpretation was missed in gene panel sequencing. Different reasons explain the defects in ES interpretation (28/235; 12%): atypical phenotype, double-hits, bioinformatics misalignments and difficulties to interpret missense variants within a solo strategy. But ES identified variants in new disease-causing genes, recently described and new candidate genes. For CNV diagnosis, gene panel sequencing appeared limited and required to be coupled with array-CGH, whereas ES appeared efficient. Overall, solo ES obtain slightly higher results than gene panel but a trio-based analysis should be preferred for a greater efficiency. Moreover, the possibility to reanalyze ES data confers a significant benefit due to the continuous development of knowledge.</p><p id="Par2234"><bold>A. Bruel:</bold> None. <bold>B.

Lip assessment is by visual comparison with a photographic 5-point Likert scale (Astley score), and PFL by measurement. Astley scores of philtrum and vermilion <underline>&gt;</underline>4, and PFL<underline>&lt;</underline>10<sup>th</sup> centile define the facial features. We assessed gender differences in these features.</p><p id="Par2238"><bold>Methods:</bold> The Safe Passage Study is an international cohort study of prenatal alcohol exposure effects on infant outcomes. Data from 7060 pregnancies were assessed at the Cape Town site. Case report forms prospectively collected exposure information. Dysmorphologists examined one-year-olds. Multivariate statistical analysis included gender, alcohol and smoking levels per trimester, maternal measurements, socio-economic status, and excluded drug users.</p><p id="Par2239"><bold>Results:</bold> After exclusions, 4399 one-year-olds were compared: 2224 (50.6%) females and 2175 (49.4%) males. Astley score <underline>&gt;</underline>4 was commoner in males than females for philtrum (21.0% versus 13.3%, p &lt; 0.001) and vermilion (20.6% versus 17.3%, p=0.005). On multivariate analysis males had relative risk of Astley score <underline>&gt;</underline>4 for philtrum of 1.53 (95%CI=1.33-1.76; p &lt; 0.001) and vermilion of 1.14 (95%CI=1.01-1.35; p=0.03). Males had wider PFLs (correlation coefficient 0.53; p &lt; 0.001).</p><p id="Par2240"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Gender differences in facial features for FAS diagnosis are independent of alcohol use and may confound dysmorphic assessment. Males are more likely to score positive on lip features but less likely on PFL.

It is caused by mutations in the SRCAP gene, which encodes a core component of the chromatin-remodeling complex and also acts as a transcriptional activator. We identified a de novo truncating mutation in the SRCAP gene of a patient diagnosed with FLHS and aimed to establish an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) line that can serve as a model for FLHS.</p><p id="Par2246"><bold>Material and methods:</bold> Gingival fibroblasts from the patient and skin fibroblasts from the unaffected father were reprogrammed into iPSCs using a virus-free episomal vector system. iPSCs were tested for pluripotency marker expression (immunofluorescence and qPCR) and differentiation capability (embryoid bodies). Two and three iPSC clones were generated for the patient and the control, respectively.</p><p id="Par2247"><bold>Results:</bold> We were able to create iPSCs from primary fibroblasts of a FLHS patient and his father. However, the patient iPSCs displayed an atypical colony morphology with fuzzy borders and loose cell grouping. Despite the atypical appearance, the patient iPSCs were pluripotent and able to differentiate into the 3 germ-layers.</p><p id="Par2248"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The patient derived iPSCs we describe can be instrumental in furthering our knowledge about the molecular mechanisms involving SRCAP and contribute to a better understanding of the aetiology of FLHS.</p><p id="Par2249"><bold>L.

We used functional assays to assess pathogenicity of the variants, and collected clinical data to delineate the associated phenotypic spectrum.</p><p id="Par2262"><bold>Results:</bold> Four missense variants clustered in the DNA-binding forkhead-box (FOX) domain of the encoded transcription factor. Luciferase assays showed loss-of-function effects for these four missense variants, and aberrant subcellular localization was seen for three out of four. The two missense variants located outside the functional domains of FOXP4 showed transcriptional repressor capacities similar to wild-type FOXP4, as well as normal subcellular localization patterns. Clinical data were collected for the six individuals with variants likely affecting FOXP4 functions. Recurrent features included growth abnormalities, language deficits, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, cervical spine abnormalities and ptosis.</p><p id="Par2263"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although a dominant-negative effect cannot be excluded for the missense variants, it seems that loss-of-function of FOXP4 can already be sufficient to cause a phenotype.

As the CGG sequence expands from premutation (PM, 56-200 CGGs) to full mutation (&gt;200 CGGs), FMRP synthesis decreases until it is practically abolished in fragile X syndrome (FXS) patients, mainly due to <italic>FMR1</italic> methylation. Cells from rare individuals with no intellectual disability and carriers of an unmethylated full mutation (UFM) produce slightly elevated levels of <italic>FMR1</italic>-mRNA and relatively low levels of FMRP, like in PM carriers. With the aim of clarifying how UFM cells differ from CTRL and FXS cells, a comparative proteomic approach was undertaken, from which emerged an overexpression of SOD2 in UFM cells, also confirmed in PM but not in FXS. The <italic>SOD2</italic>-mRNA bound to FMRP in UFM more than in the other cell types. The high SOD2 levels in UFM and PM cells correlated with lower levels of superoxide and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), and with morphological anomalies and depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane detected through confocal microscopy. The same effect was observed in CTRL and FXS after treatment with MC2791, causing SOD2 overexpression. These mitochondrial phenotypes reverted after knock-down with siRNA against <italic>SOD2</italic>-mRNA and <italic>FMR1</italic>-mRNA in UFM and PM. Overall, these data suggest that in PM and UFM carriers, which have high levels of <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription and may develop FXTAS, SOD2 overexpression helps to maintain low levels of both superoxide and ROS with signs of mitochondrial degradation.</p><p id="Par2268"><bold>V.

Mutations in most known intellectual disability genes often only account for a comparatively small number of cases, as exemplified by mutations in the X-linked gene <italic>FTSJ1</italic>, which are a rare cause for non-syndromic intellectual disability in affected males. <italic>FTSJ1</italic> encodes a tRNA methyl-transferase that methylates tRNA phenylalanine at position 32 and 34 (wobble position) in yeast and man. We have recently established a mouse model for <italic>Ftsj1</italic> deficiency and found that in male Ftsj1-deficient mice the phenotype is not restricted to cognitive functions. In order to investigate the effects of Ftsj1 deficiency in different mammalian tissues, we generated protein extracts from brain, liver, kidney and heart from five wild type and Ftsj1<sup>−/y</sup> littermate pairs, generated protein abundance profiles and compared the normalized label-free quantitation values (LFQ). The fold changes between control and Ftsj1<sup>−/y</sup> tissues were generally at or below factor 3, but still between 54 and 131 proteins from each tissue showed a significantly different abundance (p &lt; 0.01). Among these we found enrichment of proteins involved in protein synthesis, energy metabolism and actin dynamics. Our results suggest that a common pathway is affected in all four different tissues but that the evolutionarily comparatively young cognitive aspects of brain function are more sensitive to changes in this functional context. It also raises the question whether additional characteristic features might not also be detectable in patients with FTSJ1 deficiency at cellular or tissue levels.</p><p id="Par2286"><bold>L.R.

All six probands have phenotypes that are consistent with disruptions in <italic>MEF2C</italic>, including global developmental delay (6/6) and seizures (4/6), and no other likely diagnostic variants.</p><p id="Par2290">These variants are predicted to cause loss-of-function through three distinct mechanisms.

(2) Two further 5’UTR SNVs create upstream start codons that extend the coding sequence by three and nine amino acids, respectively. These variants are also observed de novo in four additional patients (two with each variant) sequenced by Genomics England and GeneDx. Protein structure modelling suggests that these variants disrupt DNA binding of MEF2C protein, impairing its function as a transcription factor. (3) The final two variants are large deletions (294Kb and 97Kb) that remove the N-terminal exon of the 5’UTR and the entire promoter sequence, completely ablating transcription of one allele.

We present a pipeline which aims to discriminate likely diagnostic CRE variants from those of neutral/low-penetrant effect. Six rare testable CRE variants were identified using targeted and whole genome sequencing in 48 unrelated males with apparent X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) but without detectable coding region variants. These variant segregated appropriately in families and altered conserved bases in CREs targeting known XLID genes. Three were unique and three were rare but too common to be plausibly causative for XLID. Cis-regulatory activity was initially tested by comparing wild-type and mutant alleles in zebrafish embryos using dual-color fluorescent enhancer reporters. Two variants showed striking changes: one plausibly causative <italic>(FMR1</italic><sup>CRE</sup>) and the other likely neutral/low-penetrant (<italic>TENM1</italic><sup>CRE</sup>). These regulatory variants were then “knocked-in” to mice and both caused abnormal embryonic neural expression of their target gene. Only mice carrying the plausible <italic>FMR1</italic><sup>CRE</sup> showed disease-relevant behavioral defects. We consider <italic>FMR1</italic><sup>CRE</sup> to be plausibly disease-associated and resulting in complex misregulation of <italic>FMR1</italic>/FMRP rather than loss-of-function. This is consistent with absence of typical physical features of Fragile X in affected individuals and electrophysiological anomalies in the brains of post-natal <italic>FMR1</italic><sup>CRE</sup> mice. Thus, extreme rarity and the presence of relevant phenotypic features in knock-in mice were the only discriminative factors for causative CRE variants. Importantly, disruption of the normal in vivo pattern of target gene expression in disease-relevant tissues cannot be used as strong evidence for Mendelian disease association.</p><p id="Par2308"><bold>H.

Given the constantly growing number of NDD associated genes, improvements in analysis tools and information on variants, regular re-analysis of negative or unclear cases is recommended. In a long-term study aiming at identifying the genetic basis of NDDs we performed exome sequencing (SureSelect_v.6; HiSeq2500) in 205 individuals from 197 families presenting with NDDs who had negative test results including CMA. Filtering against known NDD genes (SysID database) followed by identification of de novo variants in all genes resulted in a diagnostic rate of 45% (89/197). Interestingly, the diagnostic yield in singletons was higher than in trios (52% vs. 42%). We now re-analysed 105 unsolved sporadic cases regarding homozygous, compound-heterozygous, X-linked, de novo and autosomal dominant variants in all genes, considering also an updated list of 1,164 NDD genes and 1,127 candidate genes. One additional case could be diagnosed: an affected boy inherited a stop mutation in <italic>SETD5</italic> from his healthy mother, which previously was missed due to filtering for de novo variants in a trio setting, highlighting the relevance of reduced penetrance. Furthermore, we identified 20 candidate variants in 17 genes compatible with the clinical presentation but a firm diagnosis could not be made due to lack of functional validation, including a de novo missense variant in the candidate gene <italic>NEUROD2</italic>.

Since 2017 the Center for Medical Genetics Ghent (UZ Ghent) offers a WES-based gene panel analysis for genes related to ID and epilepsy. Here we present an overview our findings. WES was performed in ~1000 probands and both parents (if available) using the SureSelect All Exon kit (Agilent technologies) enrichment followed by 2x150bp sequencing on a HiSeq3000 or NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina). Data analysis was done with a community developed pipeline based on the Broad Institute Best Practices (bcbio-nextgen). Virtual panel analysis was performed for 1175 genes and variant classification was based on ACMG-AMG guidelines. In 21% of cases a definitive genetic causal defect (class 4 or 5 variant) could be identified: in 60% of these patients a de novo variant was found while in 40% the causal variant was inherited. From the latter 12,5% are variants in genes related to an X-linked disorder, 41,5% to an autosomal dominant and 46% to an autosomal recessive disorder. In addition, in 25% of the patients an interesting variant of unknown significance (class 3) was reported. Currently, follow-up studies are ongoing to evaluate these class 3 variants, e.g. collecting additional phenotypic data, performing segregation and transcriptome analysis. With a diagnostic yield between 21% and 46%, we can conclude that WES is a game-changer in the diagnostic workup of patients with ID/epilepsy.</p><p id="Par2316"><bold>E.

The reported clinical features include: intellectual disability, seizures, dysmorphia and brain anomalies among others. Haploinsufficiency of different genes has been proposed as the causal mechanism. Since most of the reported 1q41-q42 microdeletions encompass both FBXO28 and WDR26 genes, their causal role has been debated in recent years.</p><p id="Par2320"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Sequencing was carried out on an Illumina platform (MiSeq) considering a panel of 460 genes related to neurodevelopmental disorders. Raw reads were mapped to the human genome using BWA. PCR duplicates were removed using Picard Tools; GATK was used for base quality score recalibration and variant discovery. Variants were annotated using Annovar and filtered according to their frequency in gnomAD database.</p><p id="Par2321"><bold>Results:</bold> We identify a de novo c.1043 G&gt;T substitution not reported in gnomAD and causing a p.Arg348Leu change in FBXO28.

These individuals belong to the same family from Northeastern Brazil, which has 28 consanguineous marriages and 59 genotyped family members. IMPA1 is responsible for the generation of free inositol from de novo biosynthesis and recycling from inositol polyphosphates and participates in the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway. To understand the role of IMPA1 deficiency in ID, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients and neurotypical controls and differentiated these into hippocampal dentate gyrus-like neurons and astrocytes. IMPA1-deficient neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs) revealed substantial deficits in proliferation and neurogenic potential. At low passage NPCs (P1 to P3), we observed cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, progressive change to a glial morphology and reduction in neuronal differentiation. These observations were validated by transcriptome profiling. Transcriptome analysis showed that NPCs and neurons derived from ID patients have extensive deregulation of gene expression affecting pathways necessary for neurogenesis and upregulation of gliogenic genes. IMPA1 deficiency did not affect cell cycle progression or survival in iPSCs and glial progenitor cells or astrocyte differentiation.

However, ARID is extremely heterogeneous, and the vast majority of ARID genes are still unknown. The main research hypothesis of the study was the assumption that patients with ID belonging to the isolated Kashubian population have, because of parental consanguinity, homozygous regions in the genome where pathogenic, recessive mutations are present.</p><p id="Par2353"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> The project included 45 families of Kashubian origin. There were 64 patients diagnosed with ID in this group. To identify regions where pathogenic, homozygous mutations may be present, an innovative, computational method combining homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing was used. In this method homozygous regions were indicated by coverage analysis involving biallele frequency calculation, transformation and segmentation.</p><p id="Par2354"><bold>Results:</bold> No evident homozygous regions were identified in patients of Kashubian origin. Mutations responsible for ARID were rare. It has been shown that the molecular basis of ID in this group is not ARID, but autosomal dominant ID and X-linked ID. Overall, clearly pathogenic variants have been identified in 29% of examined families.</p><p id="Par2355"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This project was the first in Poland, and one of the first in Europe aiming to identify recessive risk factors involved in the pathogenesis of ID based on genomic data obtained by testing an isolated European population. The molecular basis of ID in the group of Kashubian patients proved to be not autosomal recessive, but autosomal dominant and X-linked ID.</p><p id="Par2356"><bold>Grant Number:</bold> NCN 014/15/D/NZ5/03426</p><p id="Par2357"><bold>A.

Despite the accelerating rate of gene discovery for ID, the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease remain elusive. In a previous study, whole exome sequencing in a consanguineous family with five affected individuals representing ID led to the identification of a splice site variant (NM_003320:c.1281+1G&gt;A) in TUB, a novel ID candidate gene, whose mutations have already been associated with Retinal dystrophy and obesity. TUB acts both as a membrane bound transcription regulator and an adaptor molecule in insulin signaling and GPCR trafficking in neuronal cilia. In order to investigate TUB role in the etiology of ID and identify dysregulated molecular pathways in patients, we conducted whole blood transcriptome profiling of patients and their age and sex matched healthy individuals, using RNA-seq technique. The transcription profile demonstrates deregulation of 1045 genes (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.01, fold change &gt; 1.5), of these 155 genes were upregulated and 890 genes were downregulated. Upregulated genes show enrichment in Insulin synthesis and processing, diabetes and metabolism pathways and the molecular function of downregulated genes mainly include constituent of ribosome, transcription regulator and DNA binding. Signaling pathways involved in the regulation of translation and insulin synthesis and processing were amongst the most significant dysregulated pathways in patients. Here, we put an emphasis on the role of insulin and translation pathways in the molecular pathophysiology of ID.

In 2011, heterozygous mutations in the ANKRD11 gene were identified in patients with KBG syndrome. Since then, 200 cases have been described expanding the clinical phenotype. Here we present 26 unrelated patients with pathogenic mutations in ANKRD11. We compare these patients with previously reported cases to further expand and update the phenotypic and mutational spectrum of this condition. The mutation occurred de novo in the 22 families where parental DNA was available and was inherited from a parent in two patients. Age at diagnosis ranged from 7 to 58 years. Developmental delay was reported in 94% of the patients. Intellectual disability was not a constant finding. Three patients attended regular school. 68% of patients have behavioral disorders, and 30% of patients have methylphenidate therapy for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Gastrointestinal findings were common. 56% of patients had deafness. This study allowed us to confirm clinical features already reported in the literature (deafness, feeding difficulties, cerebellar atrophy). In addition, agenesis of the olfactory bulbs, a sign not described in the literature to our knowledge, was identified in 3 patients.</p><p id="Par2380"><bold>M. Rio:</bold> None. <bold>S.

We report herein 6 patients with isolated intellectual disability (ID), carriers of a likely pathogenic variant in <italic>KCNQ2</italic>, a gene usually implicated in benign familial neonatal seizures (BFNS) or early-onset epileptic encephalopathy (EOEE). Patients were diagnosed either by targeted HTS (panel of 450-556 epilepsy- and/or ID-related genes) or exome sequencing. Pathogenicity of the variants and predictions of proteic structural changes were assessed by multiple <italic>in silico</italic> tools. All patients were children at diagnosis. Patients’ ID ranged from mild to severe with predominance of speech disturbance and autistic features. All patients carried a heterozygous likely pathogenic missense variant in <italic>KCNQ2</italic>, 4 of them disrupted the same amino-acid (Arg144, previously reported in EOEE). We compiled all the pathogenic variants previously reported (&gt;130). We observed that missense variants in the voltage-sensing domain and the pore are significantly more associated to EOEE than BFNS (p &lt; 0.01, Fisher test). However, there was a strong overlap between variants causing EOEE, isolated ID and BFNS and an important intra-familial phenotypic variability.

A remaining challenge, however, is to connect the genetic causes of ID to processes that establish and/or modify neuronal circuit function. The recent developments in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have provided us with the ability to model patient-specific neuronal networks. We studied the development of neuronal networks of iNeurons derived from patients with Kleefstra Syndrome, Koolen-de Vries Syndrome, and Kabuki Syndrome. These are three well-described intellectual disability syndromes caused by mutations in different histone modifiers, respectively in <italic>EHMT1</italic>, <italic>KANSL1</italic>and <italic>KMT2D</italic>. Little is known as to how disruption in these genes lead to altered neuronal network development. Here, we monitored the electrophysiological activity of neuronal networks coupled to multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) over time and compared their activity to healthy controls and between syndromes. Interestingly, independent clustering analysis revealed that all tested patient lines deviated from healthy control lines, which functionally clustered together. Whereas Koolen-de Vries patient lines showed a general reduced level of activity, Kleefstra syndrome and Kabuki syndrome patient lines were mainly characterized by changes in neuronal network burst activity and organisation. Interestingly, patient lines from the same syndrome phenotypically clustered together, but separately between syndromes. These data indicate that neuronal network measurement of iNeurons on MEAs is a robust and sensitive method to perform genotype-phenotype analyses for NDDs and can be a powerful platform for drug screening assays</p><p id="Par2388"><bold>N.

It has previously not been annotated in GnomAD or Ensembl and is classified as “probably damaging” by several prediction data bases like PolyPhen-2.

This previous study included 38 patients with heterozygous, mostly truncating de novo variants in <italic>KMT2E</italic> or microdeletions disrupting the gene. We present the second case series of patients with ODLURO, refining the mutational and phenotypic spectrum of this not-so-rare syndrome.</p><p id="Par2399"><bold>Results:</bold> We report 13 additional patients with ODLURO from clinical centers in Europe and the US. We detected ten heterozygous nonsense or frameshifting variants, two with predicted deleterious effects on splicing, and one microdeletion encompassing &gt;90% of <italic>KMT2E</italic>’s coding sequence (eleven changes confirmed de novo). Eleven variants and the microdeletion are novel, one has been previously observed<sup>1</sup>. We confirm and refine the phenotypic spectrum of the <italic>KMT2E</italic>-related neurodevelopmental disorder, especially concerning developmental delay with rather mild intellectual disability and macrocephaly with subtle facial features in most patients. In contrast to the study of O’Donnell-Luria et al.<sup>21</sup>, the rate of autism in our cohort was higher with ~40%, whereas seizures were reported in only a single patient with recurring febrile seizures. Furthermore, we describe additional anomalies and symptoms reported only in one or two patients, for which a potential causal relation to the disruption of <italic>KMT2E</italic> remains to be investigated. Our study, bringing the total of known patients to more than 50 within a year of the first publication, also illustrates a surprisingly high relative frequency of ODLURO worldwide.</p><p id="Par2400">Footnotes<sup>1</sup> O‘Donnell-Luria et al., <underline>Am J Hum Genet</underline>. 2019 Jun 6; 104(6): 1210–1222</p><p id="Par2401"><bold>C.

For all cell lines, iPSCs were differentiated into neurons (iNeurons) by forced expression of neurogenin-2 (Ngn2) resulting in a homogeneous population of mature excitatory neurons within 30 days. MEA-seq was performed to measure neuronal activity of iNeurons using micro-electrode arrays (MEAs), followed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The RNA-seq method used allows us to screen many samples at low cost by barcoding and pooling samples during the library preparation. MEA measurements revealed a decreased network burst rate and more irregular firing pattern in KdVS iNeurons. RNA-seq was performed on these iNeurons as well as on iPSCs from the same individuals. Differential expression (DE) analysis was performed to identify changes in gene expression in KdVS patients compared to controls. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed cell type-specific enrichment of up- and down-regulated genes in gene sets involved in processes such as cell cycle regulation, cellular respiration and early development. These results show that MEA-seq allows for characterization of iPSC-derived neurons both on a functional and transcriptional level, and therefore is a powerful tool to study mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><p id="Par2413"><bold>A.H.A.

There is a range of phenotypic severity: some patients have early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE), whereas others have more well-controlled seizures and a protracted course. Infantile hypophosphatasia (MIM #241500) is caused by a pathogenic mutation in the ALPL gene characterized by defective bone mineralization, a combination of typical radiological signs, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and low alkaline phosphatase activity. We describe a family with three affected children born of allegedly nonconsanguineous parents: a twelve-year-old boy with microcephaly, craniosynostosis, EIEE, patchy/polymicrogyria, polyneuropathy and global developmental delay (MCSZ), his eleven-year-old sister with infantile hypophosphatasia and nine-year-old sister with infantile hypophosphatasia, microcephaly, global developmental delay and paroxysmal seizures with vomiting.</p><p id="Par2424"><bold>Method:</bold> Clinical exome sequencing was performed in all family members using Illumina TruSight One Kit.</p><p id="Par2425"><bold>Results:</bold> A boy with MCSZ has a homozygous c.1253_1269dup17 pathogenic variant in the PNKP gene, the older sister has homozygous c.542C&gt;T pathogenic variant in ALPL gene and the younger sister has homozygous pathogenic variants in both genes.</p><p id="Par2426"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The simultaneous presence of infantile hypophosphatasia and MCSZ has never been reported before.

To further delineate its spectrum, we have studied 28 clinically well-characterized new patients (age 7 months to 31 years) harbouring pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) <italic>MED13L</italic> sequence or copy number variants. We found 21 likely gene-disrupting (LGD) de novo variants distributed throughout the gene and 7 deleterious missense variants (5 de novo, 2 unknown inheritance). We observed clustering of our new and previously reported P/LP missense variants between the two LxxLL motifs, between Leu-Zipper and Ser-rich motifs, and within the C-terminus of the MED13L protein, which are deprived of missense variants in gnomAD. Clinically, we have been able to ascertain details of developmental milestones and growth parameters, and to find multiple novel features. Remarkably, we noticed previously unreported mild global developmental delay in 3/28 (~11%) and verbal dyspraxia in 6/28 (~21%) patients harbouring LGD variants. Moreover, we observed a higher frequency of epilepsy (~86% vs. ~29%) and severe congenital heart defects requiring surgery (~29% vs. 0%) in our patients with missense compared to LGD variants. We also report the first <italic>MED13L</italic> patient with no obvious congenital heart defect who passed away at the age of ~10 years possibly due to respiratory insufficiency and right-heart failure. Altogether, our findings highlight new aspects of the syndrome and suggest a critical role for the MED13L C-terminus, missense defects of which may even cause a more severe phenotype than MED13L haploinsufficiency.</p><p id="Par2432"><bold>R.

At 31 months old, our patient was referred with significant global developmental delay, dysmorphic features and large head circumference (HC). Antenatally, moderate bi-ventricular dilatation and macrocephaly were observed. Ventricular dilatation was rapidly progressed in the first 6 months and stabilised by one year old. There was no history of seizures. Clinical examination revealed HC &gt;4SD above the mean, curly hair, dysmorphic facial features, fleshy hands and feet with prominent fetal finger pads. She had peripheral and, more marked, core hypotonia, and was not independently mobile. Neurometabolic investigations were unremarkable. Serial MRI imaging demonstrated moderate, stable ventriculomegaly, thin corpus callosum, subtle bilateral anterior/opercular polymicrogyria and subepemdymal nodular heterotopia. Array CGH was normal. Whole exome sequencing revealed a de novo, likely pathogenic <italic>MTOR</italic> c.7217T&gt;G p.(Val2406Gly) variant located in a highly conserved nucleotide and amino acid position in the Kinase domain. The gene encodes serine/threonine-protein kinase mTOR, member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) family. The mTOR engages in two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, and is a potent regulator of cell growth, energy metabolism, autophagy and cytoskeletal organisation. Deregulation of the mTOR pathway has been implicated in cancer, cardiovascular, autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, often referred to as mTORopathies.

Re-interpretation and reporting research in light of novel data is not well investigated. Of 152 consanguineous families with NDDs we previously found a diagnosis in 56 and identified VUS or candidate genes in 53. In total 116 variants were reported in 109 families. We re-evaluated all reported variants according to updated classification guidelines or our internal candidate gene scoring system. Variants in candidate genes were uploaded to GeneMatcher and collaborations were joined/initiated. We re-processed all data using up-to-date tools, references and databases for case-level re-analysis. In 26/116 (22%) variants the clinical relevance changed through variant classification or increased significance of candidate genes. In 4 (9%) of the 43 undiagnosed cases a possible diagnosis was found. Of the 53 originally identified candidate genes 8 were in the meantime associated with NDDs, 2 are in submission and 3 collaborations were entered in the course of this project. Two reported variants were missed by the updated computational pipeline due to alignment (old data) or reference (ambiguous region in hg38) issues. We submitted all relevant variants to public databases and revised their previous classification. Our results support the need to re-evaluate research screening studies. We highlight potential benefits and pitfalls of computational re-analysis. Its complexity for old data should be weighed against the decreasing re-testing costs. Published variants in established and candidate disease genes are not assessable unless reported in databanks. Future studies should incorporate post-publication variant management and bio-banking of patient cells for upcoming methods.</p><p id="Par2454"><bold>T. Bartolomaeus:</bold> None. <bold>R.

Differentially expressed genes were then analyzed with regard to function, interaction and disease association. In at least two individuals, we identified disruptive splicing events in genes with a known disease association. In one individual we found a significant enrichment in differentially expressed genes involved in synaptic signaling and neuronal processes.

The etiology of NDDs include both environmental and genetic causes. In this study we evaluated the genotype-phenotype correlation of 201 patients with NDDs consecutively admitted to our Unit for a clinical genetic evaluation from 2006 to 2019. Based on the clinical evaluation, the appropriate genetic testing was performed for each patient: array-CGH and <italic>FMR1</italic> analysis were used as first-tier tests and specific genetic testing/WES as second-tier analysis. Array-CGH was performed in 158 cases and positive in 13 (DR 8.2%). Two patients were carriers of a complex chromosomal rearrangements (one due to chromothripsis), a family had a recurrent 4p15.31p15.2 deletion. Specific genetic tests revealed a pathogenic variant in 7.5%. WES was performed in 52 patients and revealed a mutation in <italic>HNRNPH2, DLG4, IQSEC2, ATP1A3</italic> genes (DR 16%). Overall, 16 different genetic conditions were diagnosed and Fragile-X syndrome was the most frequent (3 cases). Detection rate of array-CGH in our cohort was roughly in line with the 10% estimated by in literature. In our cohort, the results of WES are encouraging but certainly underestimated: DR of this test would be higher if WES was employed also instead of other second-tier specific gene analysis (DR estimated: 23%). The new knowledge and technologies would probably change the multi-step genetic testing approach, indicating WES or WGS as first step analysis after <italic>FMR1</italic> test as routine diagnostic test in all patients with NDDs.</p><p id="Par2472"><bold>A.

A recurrent <italic>de novo TBL1XR1</italic> variant [c.1337A&gt;G; p.(Tyr446Cys)] is known to be disease-causing for the syndrome (Heinen et al, 2016). Additionally, other <italic>TBL1XR1</italic> variants [c.974G &gt; A;p.(Cys325Tyr) and c.1336 T &gt; C;p.(Tyr446His)] have been reported in patients with a typical PS (Lemattre et al, 2018). The authors suggest comparability between the functional consequences of all these variants. <italic>TBL1XR1</italic> haploinsufficiency, though, is reported to cause a different entity, MRD41 (OMIM# 616944). Here we report on a four-year-old girl with a typical PS phenotype and a novel de novo heterozygous <italic>TBL1XR1</italic> variant, c.1184A&gt;G;p.(Tyr395Cys). We studied the three-dimensional structure of TBLR1 protein and noted that the amino acid affected by this variant is located in the WD6 repeat of the WD40 domain and lies in the close vicinity of the amino acids affected by the other PS causing variants (Tyr446 and Cys325). The WD40 domain has a β-propeller-like-structure where hotspot residues at the domain’s top as identified by WDSPdb (Wang et al, 2015) are likely to interact with β-catenin. Tyr395 and Tyr446 are hotspot residues and therefore predicted to be of importance for the function. In summary, a review of the clinical and molecular data of all the reported patients so far, inclusive the present patient, suggests that the <italic>TBL1XR1</italic> variants causing PS affect most likely protein structures with comparable gene function.</p><p id="Par2491"><bold>M.

To date, only 23 individuals with <italic>de novo PPP2R5D</italic> mutations have been described. Here we report five <italic>PPP2R5D</italic> variants in five unrelated individuals with NDD: two novel missense, one rare intronic variants and two recurrent missense pathogenic mutations, Glu198Lys and Glu200Lys. The Glu198Lys mutations, located in the PP2A catalytic subunit interaction interface, is associated with a more severe phenotype due to its severe effects on the binding properties of the B regulatory subunit PP2A. All but one the mutations were detected by targeted NGS analysis of a ID/ASD multigenic panel in 600 NDDs subjects. Among these cases we report for the first time a dual diagnosis. A girl carrying a de novo Glu198Lys mutation, identified by whole-exome sequencing, exhibiting a very severe NDD with ID, ASD, absent speech, marked hypotonia, and typical dysmorphisms, also carry a full FMR1 gene mutation. The fragile X phenotype seemed to be overshadowed by the severe <italic>PPP2R5D</italic> clinical features. The other individuals carrying <italic>PPP2R5D</italic> mutations (segregation analysis is currently underway) showed a rather mild ID phenotype, very variable dysmorphic features, no hypotonia and, only in case of the Glu200Lys mutation, absence of ASD features.

Consanguinity due to extensive homozygosity unravels many recessive phenotypes and facilitates the detection of novel gene-disease links. Here, we report two siblings with phenotypic signs including intellectual disability, developmental delay, and microcephaly from a Pakistani consanguineous family in which we have identified homozygosity for p(Tyr103His) in the <italic>PSMB1</italic> gene (Genbank NM_002793) that segregated with the disease phenotype. PSMB1 encodes a β-type proteasome subunit (i.e. β6). Modeling of the p(Tyr103His) variant indicates that this variant presumably weakens the interactions between PSMB1/β6 and PSMA5/α5 proteasome subunits and thus destabilizes the 20S proteasome complex. Biochemical experiments in human SHSY5Y cells revealed that the p(Tyr103His) variant affects both the processing of PSMB1/β6 and its incorporation into proteasome, thus impairing proteasome activity. CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis or morpholino knock-down of the single <italic>psmb1</italic> zebrafish orthologue resulted in microcephaly, microphthalmia and reduced brain size. Genetic evidence in the family and functional experiments in human cells and zebrafish indicate that PSMB1/β6 pathogenic variants are the cause of a recessive disease with intellectual disability, microcephaly and developmental delay due to abnormal proteasome assembly.</p><p id="Par2506"><bold>S.A.

However, the expansion mechanism has yet to be defined. A failure of the DNA repair system at sites with alternative DNA structures formed by repeats can lead to expansion. This work aimed to design a cellular system for studying the instability of CGG repeats involved in FRAXopathy development during transcription and TCR-NER.</p><p id="Par2524"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> CGG repeats were amplified by PCR from GC-rich templates. We transfected HEK293A cells with plasmids containing CGG repeats of different lengths. Transfected cells were selected using flow cytofluorometry or puromycin. Changes in CGG repeats were evaluated by fragment analysis. Reporter gene expression was measured by qPCR.</p><p id="Par2525"><bold>Results:</bold> To control transcription levels, DNA fragments of CGG repeats and the EGFP ORF were inserted into plasmids under the inducible promoter TRE. Additionally, vectors encoded DsRedExpress or puromycin-N-acetyltransferase driven by a constitutive promoter. Several types of plasmids carrying CGG repeats of various lengths were generated. HEK293A cells were transfected, and transformants were selected. In the obtained cell lines, plasmid integration sites, expression levels of fluorescent proteins and changes in (CGG)n repeat length upon induction of TRE were determined.</p><p id="Par2526"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Cell lines with controlled transcription across repeats were produced. This system allows tracking changes in the repeat region. The obtained cell lines can be used as a model to study the effect of transcription and TCR-NER on repeat instability.

However, the etiology of the condition in a subset of RTT and RTT-like patients still remains unknown. Using the Ion Torrent platform, we developed a low-cost NGS gene panel and sequenced ca. 630 samples for early ID/ASD diagnosis. The gene panel contains 74 ID and ASD related genes, including 18 known and candidate genes associated with RTT-like disorders. We identified de novo causative mutations or likely pathogenic variants in 18 of the 90 (20%) sequenced individuals with RTT-like disorders. Among negative cases with clinical features in the spectrum of Rett-like disorders, we performed whole exome sequencing in 31 family trios, 1 singleton, and 2 multiplex families. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations were identified in 24 cases (70%).

The phenotype of SHFYNG in childhood partially overlaps with that of the well-established Prader-Willi-Syndrome/PWS. While several studies of younger individuals with SHFYNG have been recently published, the phenotype in adulthood is not well established. We recruited 7 adults (aged 18-36) with molecularly confirmed SHFYNG and collected data regarding eating habits, sleep, behavior, autonomy, psychiatric, and medical conditions, as well as information about the respective phenotypes in childhood.</p><p id="Par2535"><bold>Methods:</bold> Participating individuals with SHFYNG and their families received a questionnaire covering the aforementioned areas.

Typical symptoms of SHFYNG in childhood were reported for most individuals.</p><p id="Par2537"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings indicate a high variability of functional abilities and social participation of adults with SHFYNG. The prevalence of obesity was high, and lack of satiety was of concern for some caregivers. The phenotypes of PWS and SHFYNG might be more difficult to distinguish in adults than in children.

Sleep anomalies are a heterogeneous set of problems, including difficulties with initiating or maintaining sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness, and parasomnias. The relationship between abnormal sleep patterns and NDDs is complex and potentially synergistic. Indeed, sleep anomalies exacerbate an already compromised neurobehavioral phenotype. Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS) [MIM:182290], caused by haploinsufficiency of <italic>RAI1</italic> gene, is a NDD characterized by sleep disturbances, which in 95% of the patients results from disruption of circadian rhythm with an inverted melatonin secretion. Based on the assessed role of RAI1 in the regulation of circadian rhythm, we evaluated through RT-qPCR the expression of circadian genes in peripheral blood of 18 clinically suspected SMS/SMS-like patients, three with confirmed <italic>RAI1</italic> mutation, manifesting sleep disturbance except three.

Two missense variants have been reported in <italic>SLITRK2</italic>, located on the X chromosome, in patients with schizophrenia (Piton <italic>et al</italic>., 2011). Through a collaborative study, we report on seven individuals (1 female and 6 males, including two siblings) carrying rare variants in <italic>SLITRK2</italic> identified by WES. These variants include one nonsense (p.Glu461*), and five missenses changes (p.Thr312Ala, p.Arg426Cys, p.Val511Met, p.Pro691Ser and p.Val201Ile), that were never reported at the hemizygous state in gnomAD populations. Three variants were de novo and three were maternally inherited. All patients had moderate to severe intellectual disability and speech delay, mostly severe. Neurological regression was observed in one patient after six years-old. Patients present behavioral issues (anxiety, aggressiveness or autism spectrum disorder) (5/6), spasticity and/or dystonia (4/7), unsteady gait (4/7), seizures (3/6), short stature (4/7), cyphoscoliosis (3/5), and variable nonspecific facial features. Nonspecific brain MRI anomalies (3/6) included white matter reduction, ventricles dilation and thin corpus callosum. Based on these observations and the role of <italic>SLITRK2</italic> in synapse development and organization, we believe that these variants contribute to the neurodevelopmental phenotype of our patients. We aim to gather more patients with pathogenic <italic>SLITRK2</italic> variants and to continue with functional studies, to confirm the implication of this gene in neurodevelopmental disorder and to better delineate the clinical manifestations associated to mutations in this gene, especially at the behavioral level.</p><p id="Par2550"><bold>S.

De novo variants in SMARCC2, one of core subunits of the BAF complex, have been described as a cause of intellectual disability (ID) in 2019. Missense and splice variants affecting the highly conserved SMARCC2 DNA-interacting domains (SANT and SWIRM) present with a more severe phenotype overlapping with the phenotype of other BAfopathies, like Coffin-Siris and Baraitser-Winter syndrome. Truncating and splice variants affecting other regions show a much milder phenotype. According to data from the gnomAD database the SMARCC2 gene is highly intolerant to loss-of-function variants (pLI-score=1), supporting pathogenicity of this type of variants. However, we have now identified four unrelated patients harbouring predicted loss of function variants in SMARCC2 that are inherited from healthy (grand)parents. Whole exome sequencing was performed on these patients because of developmental delay (DD)/ID. Two unrelated patients have the same frameshift variant (c.3129del, p.Gly1044fs), inherited from their healthy father. The brother of one of these patients, who had a similar DD, did not have this variant. A third patient (c.574C&gt;T (p.(Arg192*)) inherited a nonsense variant from his unaffected father and grandfather. The fourth patient has a predicted splice donor variant (c.317+2T&gt;A (r.spl.?)) inherited from her healthy mother. The presence of these truncating variants in healthy individuals in four different families seems to contradict the suspected pathogenicity of this type of SMARCC2 variants. We’ll discuss the possible relation between truncating SMARCC2 variants and ID.</p><p id="Par2554"><bold>Ö. Baysal:</bold> None. <bold>R. Pfundt:</bold> None. <bold>C.L.M.

SPOP (MIM: 602650) is recurrently somatically mutated in endometrial cancer and prostate cancer, resulting in gain-of-function and dominant-negative effects, respectively, towards ubiquitin ligase substrates, such as BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 proteins (BETs). Using clinical exome sequencing, we identified eleven patients with nine different germline de novo missense SPOP variants, including two recurrent variants. These patients presented with developmental delay/intellectual disability, facial dysmorphisms and congenital anomalies. Interestingly, three individuals shared craniofacial dysmorphisms, including microcephaly, which were strikingly different from those observed in the other individuals, which included (relative) macrocephaly and hypertelorism. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that two distinct molecular pathophysiological mechanisms underlie the phenotypic differences, similarly to the observed effect of somatic SPOP variants in cancer. Indeed, measurement of BETs levels in human Ishikawa endometrial cancer cells and patient-derived cell lines showed that de novo variants identified in the microcephalic individuals result in a gain-of-function, while the other variants lead to a dominant-negative effect. These results suggest that divergent functional effects on BETs are related to distinct and clinically recognizable syndromic forms of intellectual disability with contrasting craniofacial dysmorphisms.</p><p id="Par2558"><bold>M.J.

CDG Iy is associated with developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID), hypotonia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, failure to thrive and epilepsy.

Our patient confirms that males with CDG due to <italic>SSR4</italic> variants show consistent phenotype with DD/ID, hypotonia, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, feeding problems, failure to thrive and gastrointestinal and eye abnormalities. Seizures have been reported in 6/10 previous patients, and our patient supports their involvement in the syndrome. On the contrary, skeletal, coagulation, cardiac and renal abnormalities mentioned among minor features were absent in our patient. A similar clinical picture is seen in many CDG types, and changes in serum transferrin levels in CDG Iy patients are easily overlooked.

However, with the increasing use of WES-based diagnostics, in particular for indications with large numbers of causal genes such as intellectual disability (ID), very mild or atypical phenotypic presentations of known syndromic causes can be observed.</p><p id="Par2573"><bold>Methods:</bold> We present several patients with thorough clinical description, presenting with ID in whom no syndromic diagnosis was made prior to testing. A confirmed molecular diagnosis via whole exome sequencing of a targeted panel of ID genes was made with (likely) pathogenic variants in genes such as <italic>WAC</italic>, <italic>CHD8</italic>, <italic>TBR1</italic>, and <italic>SOX5</italic>. We compare their phenotype to what has been traditionally reported in the syndromes associated with these genes and delineate mild key features useful for evaluating causality of the sequencing results.</p><p id="Par2574"><bold>Results:</bold> A first patient with a <italic>WAC</italic> mutation presents with a duplicated ureter and aggressive behavior. In patients with <italic>CHD8</italic>-related ID, early bone maturation is seen. Furthermore, pathogenic variants in <italic>TBR1</italic> can lead to exclusively developmental delay and absent speech. Finally, lower limbs abnormalities such as seen in Lamb-Shaffer syndrome (<italic>SOX5</italic>) contribute to determining the diagnosis.</p><p id="Par2575"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We define several mild but characteristic features in patients having a variant in syndromic genes, even if an overt syndromic diagnosis in them was not clear. Taking into account these mild symptoms in patients with apparent non-syndromic ID is an important help in interpreting sequencing results, particularly in case of variants of unknown significance.</p><p id="Par2576"><bold>H.

Macro-autophagy is vital for long-lived, non-regenerating and metabolically active neurons. In 2012 a truncating founder variant in the autophagy-related gene <italic>TECPR2</italic> was identified in three Bukharian Jewish families. The five affected individuals were homozygous and showed spastic paraplegia complicated by syndromic intellectual disability. Subsequent reports of five unrelated individuals with this or novel truncating/missense variants confirmed autonomic involvement as a leading feature of spastic paraplegia 49 (SPG49).By trio-based exome sequencing we now identified the homozygous frameshifting <italic>TECPR2</italic>-variant c.2829del, p.(Asn944Thr<italic>fs</italic>*7) in male individual of Turkish descent with neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) and epilepsy. RT-PCR on PAXgene stabilized blood showed normal expression of the c.2829del allele in the heterozygous parents and gel electrophoresis indicated no expression reduction in the index. Together these results suggest escape from nonsense-mediated decay. Through matchmaking we identified one additional unrelated individual with NDDs due to homozygosity for the known Ashkenazi <italic>TECPR2</italic>-variant (c.1319del, p.(Leu440Arg<italic>fs</italic>*19)). Based on these cases and comparison with the 10 literature cases, we now provide a Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) standardized clinical synopsis. The neurologic spectrum comprises muscular hypotonia with progression to spastic paraplegia in the first decade, abnormal reflexes and autonomic involvement. The variable neurodevelopmental disorder present in 11/12 cases can be complicated by structural brain abnormalities (7/8 cases with brain MRI) and seizures (3/12).

It is not known whether our patient’s history of recurrent pulmonary infections is a component of TROFAS because of the limited number of patient reports. Primary immunodeficiencies and polymorphisms in TLRs are associated with susceptibility to infections in humans and animal models and also TLR5 has protective effects against bacterial infections. Owing to the limited number of reported patients with TROFAS, new patient reports and further studies are needed to clarify the clinical properties of the disease.</p><p id="Par2595"><bold>A.

Using targeted deep sequencing, we screened a cohort of 600 individuals with variable degrees of intellectual disability and identified five WAC rare variants: two variants were inherited from healthy parents; two previously reported de novo mutations, c.1661_1664del (p.Ser554*) and c.374C&gt;A (p.Ser125*);and a novel c.381+2T&gt;C variant causing the skipping of exon 4 of the gene, inherited from a reportedly asymptomatic father with somatic mosaicism. A phenotypic evaluation of this individual evidenced areas of cognitive and behavioural deficits. The two individuals with previously reported WAC mutations presented phenotypic differences in comparison with reported cases. The patient carrying the novel splicing mutation had a clinical history of encephalopathy related to Status Epilepticus during slow Sleep (ESES), only recently reported in WAC individuals. This first report of a WAC somatic mosaic remarks the contribution of mosaicism in the etiology of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.

CP is caused by a cerebral anomaly/dysfunction that develops during pregnancy, birth or infancy. CP is still the most common cause of physical disability in childhood with an important impact on the quality of life of patients and, by its high prevalence of 1.5-2.5 per 1000 live births, even on society. Recent studies demonstrate an important contribution of genetic factors.</p><p id="Par2638"><bold>Methods:</bold> At the Antwerp University Hospital, we therefore perform genetic testing for CP using SNP-array and a targeted whole exome sequencing-based gene panel consisting of approximately 200 genes associated with CP and CP-mimics.</p><p id="Par2639"><bold>Results:</bold> We report the findings on two siblings from a consanguineous family presenting with spastic CP, and mild to moderate ID.

Atypical brain asymmetries have been implicated in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions. Handedness is often used as a proxy for brain asymmetries and recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest a genetic association with schizophrenia, while other laterality measures are less explored. Here, we investigate shared genetic components between behavioural laterality phenotypes and their relevance to these conditions.</p><p id="Par2645"><bold>Methods and Results:</bold> We performed GWAS on hand, foot, eye and ear preference in a longitudinal British cohort (ALSPAC, n &gt;= 5770). Our results suggest an involvement of genes associated with immune response (footedness) and axonogenesis (eye, ear preference). In line with previous research, genes involved in body asymmetries were associated with handedness. The relevance of neurodevelopmental conditions was tested using gene set enrichment analyses and polygenic risk scores (PRS) for schizophrenia, ADHD, autism spectrum disorders and bipolar disorder.

Aprataxin gene mutations are associated with decreased Coenzyme Q10 levels in muscle and plasma. Disease duration and disability are negatively correlated with albuminemia. We included 19 patients in a multicenter (six centers) controlled randomized double blind trial with Coenzyme Q10 with 2 phases, a controlled randomized phase Coenzyme Q10 versus placebo during 1 year, and an open-labelled phase with all patients treated with Coenzyme Q10 during 1 year, to estimate longer term potential side effects and tolerance. Inclusion criteria were AOA1 confirmed by genetic molecular analysis; age older than 18, hypoalbuminemia, informed consent signed. Primary endpoint was hypoalbuminemia rate evolution. Secondary endpoints were cerebellar ataxia severity (SARA and quantitative evaluations), ocular movements evaluation, quality of life (EQ5-D), depression and anxiety (PHQ-9), biological measurements (prealbuminemia, cholesterolemia, alphafoetoprotein), safety (blood counts and hepatic check) and compliance (CoEnzyme Q10 dosage). Evaluations were performed each 6 months with a phone call between each visit. Results: Albuminemia evolution was not significantly different between the 2 groups (Phase1: coQ10: -1.2 [-3.0; 1.1], Placebo: +1.0 [+0.8; +2.0], p = 0.0511) and no significant difference on all other evaluation criteria. Treatment was well tolerated with minor side effects: 6 during phase 1 (3 in each group) and 2 during phase 2. Conclusion: despite good tolerance, we failed to demonstrate an increase of albuminemia under Coenzyme Q10 treatment in AOA1 patients.</p><p id="Par2659"><bold>P. Charles:</bold> None. <bold>V.

It has been reasonable that the younger age at onset is, the higher the risk of genetic condition gets. To identify the causative nucleotide variant for the disease, we studied a Japanese pedigree consisting of a trio of a patient with sporadic young-onset PD and unaffected parents. The patient was a 35-year-old male. He had noted involuntary movement of slow torsion in his right shoulder and forearm at the age of 31. He also noticed slow torsion in his left toe and dragged his left foot in every evening at the age of 34. On neurological examination, he showed dystonic posture in his right wrist, mild hypertonus and bradykinesia in his right upper limb, hyperreflexia and mild spasticity in the lower extremities. Brain MRI showed no abnormality. Meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy showed no decrease of the heart/mediastinum ratio. Dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT imaging showed moderately reduced dopamine uptake in the bilateral striatum. L-dopa was effective for his bradykinesia. Whole-exome sequencing of the trio combined with strict criteria revealed an X-linked nonsense variant (NM_001669: c.1556C&gt;T [p.Arg498X]) in the <italic>ARSD</italic> gene encoding arylsulfatase D. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis verified that the mRNA expression level of <italic>ARSD</italic> was significantly reduced in the patient’s peripheral blood cells probably due to the nonsense mediated decay.

Brain volume is highly heritable and is partly regulated by variation in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Rare mTOR-related variants associate with macrocephaly in syndromic intellectual disability (ID), and common mTOR-related variants are associated with intracranial volume (ICV) in the general population. We hypothesized that variations in mTOR-related genes could mediate the occurrence of enlarged brains in ASD.</p><p id="Par2667"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> Looking at rare <italic>de-novo</italic> mTOR-related variants, we estimated enrichment of macrocephaly and ASD using a local ID cohort (N=2,257) and publicly available resources (<italic>n</italic> = 32,991). Looking at common variants in a unique set of mTOR-related genes, we estimated association with ASD (N=46,350) and ICV (N=25,974) using publicly available data. Using the same data, we estimated 1) genome-wide genetic correlation between ASD and ICV and 2) mTOR-restricted ASD-ICV genetic correlation.</p><p id="Par2668"><bold>Results:</bold> We found a significant enrichment of syndromic macrocephaly and ASD in <italic>de-novo</italic> mTOR-related variants carriers. Gene-set analyses for common mTOR-related variants revealed significant independent associations with ASD (p=0.002) and ICV (p=0.021).

HCAs share clinical features and disease mechanisms with hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs), with several ataxia-related genes found to cause HSPs and vice-versa. In this study, we used homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing to unravel the disease-causing variant in a Portuguese family with early-onset, autosomal recessive, cerebellar ataxia with neuropathy and oculomotor apraxia. We identified a novel homozygous missense variant in <italic>MAG</italic> (c.124T&gt;C; p.Cys42Arg), the gene encoding the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). Cellular studies confirmed its detrimental effect. Our results showed that this variant reduces protein stability, impairs post-translational processing (N-linked glycosylation) and subcellular localization of MAG. Homozygous variants in <italic>MAG</italic> have been previously associated with complicated forms of HSP. Our findings newly associate <italic>MAG</italic> variants with ataxia with oculomotor apraxia. The low expression and premature degradation of the mutant protein showed the variant to cause protein loss-of-function. This work has also expanded the clinical phenotype associated with disease-causing variants in <italic>MAG</italic>.

Both mutations affect conserved amino-acid residues in the NP1 protein and are extremely rare or missing from public databases. We show that both mutations alter the endoplasmic reticulum morphology and induce ATF6-mediated stress, ultimately leading to increased cell cytotoxicity in COS7 cells. The E327G change also abolishes the protein secretion, as well as the formation of NP1 complexes.

This study aimed to compare the level of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and transcriptional activity of mitochondrial genes in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of ASD patients (ASDP) and healthy controls (HC).</p><p id="Par2700"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> The study included 20 ASDP and 15 HC aged 4 to 10 years. PBL DNA was isolated from plasma using phenol extraction. mtDNA content in PBL DNA samples was determined by non-radioactive quantitative dot-hybridization. PBL RNA was isolated with RNeasyPlusMiniKit(‘Qiagen’). Expression of 85 mitochondrial genes including those involved in regulating redox metabolism, mitochondrial response to stress, mitophagy, mitochondrial fusion, mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial transports, and those that encode for proteins of I-V respiratory complexes, was evaluated using real-time PCR.</p><p id="Par2701"><bold>Results:</bold> There were no significant differences in mtDNA levels between patient and control groups.

However, the biological mechanisms underlying its onset are still unclear. Environmental factors may modulate ASD risk, with heritability estimates of 50-80% supporting a role for gene-environment interactions in idiopathic cases. We hypothesize that ASD candidate genes interact with reported ubiquitous environmental risk factors. Thus, we interrogated the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) for interactions between 1144 ASD candidate genes and 59 ASD-risk chemicals. A proportion analysis was performed to identify genes that selectively interact with ASD risk chemicals (and vice-versa). Genetic data from ASD-individuals was inspected to identify SNVs (<italic>n</italic> = 2674) and CNVs (<italic>n</italic> = 3570). Eleven genes, including genes encoding for sex hormone receptors (<italic>AR</italic>, <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>ESR2</italic>), signaling kinases (<italic>MAPK1</italic> and <italic>MAPK3</italic>) and xenobiotics-responding molecules (<italic>GSTM1</italic> and <italic>SLC7A5</italic>) were found to selectively interact with ASD-chemicals. Meanwhile, heavy metals, endocrine disruptors (pesticides, benzo(a)pyrene and a phthalate) and valproic acid were found to selectively target ASD-candidate genes. In ASD-cases, we found 22 loss-of-function or deleterious missense SNVs in 8/11 genes, of which 3 (<italic>ESR1</italic>, <italic>ESR2</italic>, and <italic>MAPK3</italic>) were also targeted by CNVs. External cues may dysregulate the MAPK signaling cascade, leading to neurodevelopmental problems. Hormone-mimicking toxins act as agonist/antagonist ligands to hormone receptors, while <italic>SLC7A5</italic> is a blood-brain barrier (BBB) transporter. Sex hormones and BBB are fundamental during early development. We highlight the need of considering genetics and environment as interacting entities. Efforts to collect early-life exposure data from genetically susceptible patients may accelerate the implementation of health management strategies for ASD.</p><p id="Par2707"><bold>J.X.

ASD has a complex multifactorial etiology with high genetic involvement. Previous unpublished data suggested that inversions 17q21.31 and 8p23.1 could act as susceptibility variants. The purpose of this project is to elucidate the transcriptional consequences of these rearrangements.</p><p id="Par2711"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We performed RNAseq analysis of peripheral blood in 13 idiopathic ASD patients and 11 controls grouped by homozygous inversion genotypes: non-inverted; inv8p23.1; inv17q21.31. We used HTSeq/DESeq2 to discover the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with p.adj.value &lt; 0.05.</p><p id="Par2712"><bold>Results:</bold> We found that inversions affect the expression of genes encompassed in each inverted region and genes elsewhere in the genome. Regarding inv17q21.31, we discovered 38 DEGs, 8 from the region and some of them associated to neuronal diseases (<italic>LRRC37A,LRRC37A2,KANSL1-AS1,IL1B</italic>) or brain-related functions (<italic>ROBO1</italic>,<italic>RIN1</italic>). When exploring the interaction of phenotype-genotype, no regional genes were found deregulated. We discovered 27 DEGs for inv17q21.31 including some related to neuronal function (<italic>ATOH8</italic>,<italic>MAP1B,VSNL1</italic>), whereas for inv8p23.1 we found 73 DEGs of which 4 have been previously related to ASD (<italic>ABCA13,SLC7A8,STX1A,SLC24A2</italic>).</p><p id="Par2713"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data indicate that inversions have a direct effect on gene expression patterns both in inverted regions and elsewhere in the genome. Moreover, we note that ASD carriers of the susceptibility alleles (inv17q21.31/inv8p23.1) have differential expression of brain function-related genes. Further studies are needed to determine the involvement of these deregulated genes to the ASD phenotype.

ASD has a strong genetic component and there is evidence supporting many putative risk genes. However, the genetics underlying the disease is unclear. Our objective was to identify neurotransmission and synaptic (NS) genes that play a role in ASD. For this purpose, we defined 1216 NS candidate genes filtering for the terms ‘neurotransmitter’ and ‘synapse’ in Gene Ontology, Reactome and KEGG, and overlapping the gene list obtained with the synaptic databases SynaptomeDB and SynSysNet, and with literature review. We then searched the Whole Exome Sequencing dataset from the Autism Sequencing Consortium (3938 cases) for ultra-rare loss of function (LoF) Single Nucleotide Variants (MAF &lt; 0,1%; gnomAD 60146 controls) in these genes. We selected 434 LoF variants in 244 genes and identified the biological pathways enriched in these genes using Reactome. Applying the Louvain community detection algorithm to the network spanned by the selected genes and edges from the STRING database of protein-protein interactions, we identified several biological communities within the network: MAP Kinase, Calcium and G alpha signaling, Interleukins and Toll-like receptors, Energy/Insulin metabolism, Phospholipids, Nicotinic acetylcholine and NMDA/AMPA receptors. Finally, we constructed a network-based gene rank through the computation of topological parameters and centrality measures in Cytoscape. The genes PRKCA, GNG13 and ANK2 involved in phosphorylation, transmembrane signaling and membrane stabilization of ion transporters and channels, which are important processes for the brain function, are the top-ranked genes.</p><p id="Par2718">Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia: (<italic>PD/BD/131390/2017)</italic></p><p id="Par2719"><bold>J.

ASDs have a complex multifactorial etiology, with genetic causes being recognized in 25-35% of cases. Array comparative genomic hybridization studies showed that copy numer variants (CNVs), in particular rare and those encompassing brain-related genes, are associated with idiopathic ASDs. We applied oligonucleotide microarrays (OGT) with average resolution of 30 kpz to evaluate its usefulness for identification and characterization of CNVs in a cohort of 528 patients with ASDs. The analyses of the patients’ genomes were performed using genome-wide, high-resolution (180K) array to accurate detection of copy number variation at the exon level. Probes have been designed to target 4645 genes including 227 genes relevant for etiopathogenesis of ASDs. Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed 116 nonpolymorphic CNVs, ranging in size from 9.3 kb to 8.16 Mb, in 100 (19%) patients. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were identified in 42 (8%) patients, whereas CNVs with uncertain clinical significance were identified in 68 (12.8%) of cases. Due to high resolution of the selected microarray, it was possible to identify 37 CNVs that could not have been detected using the clinical microarrays (OGT, 60k). Our study confirmed the potential of aCGH in elucidating the etiology of ASDs, demonstrated by the identification of one novel gene <italic>LRRTM4</italic> as candidate for ASDs.

It has a life-time prevalence of about 1%. The disease manifests itself by reoccurring episodes of depression and mania. BD is a complex disorder caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Formal genetic studies have estimated a relatively high heritability of approximately 75-80%. Our actual project focuses on the identification of rare risk variants for BD that segregate in 12 multiply affected families from Andalusia/Spain with a total of 71 individuals, using whole exome data.</p><p id="Par2734"><bold>Methods:</bold> To identify risk variants that segregate within the pedigree we set up an analysis pipeline using a commercial software. The workflow includes trimming of reads, mapping to the reference genome, removal of duplicates, local realignment and variant detection. Variants that matched the segregation pattern were further analyzed using different prediction tools and for known candidate genes.</p><p id="Par2735"><bold>Results:</bold> We have identified 138’000 missense variants, which were familywise present in all affected and none of the healthy members. These variants were annotated using dbNSFP, including several different prediction scores. As a first approach to identify causative variants, we looked at the overlap with the 30 loci described in the BP2 GWAS from the PGC (Stahl, E.A. et al. 2019). We found 18 mutations in BD associated genes, 3 of them being rare. SYNE1 is outstanding, as 9 mutations pertain to this gene. Next steps will comprise following up of these mutations using biological pathway analysis tools and starting analysis of identified frame-shift mutations.</p><p id="Par2736"><bold>A.

Loss of C9orf72 protein function, a toxic RNA gain-of-function and a gain of function by RAN translation have been proposed as triggering pathological mechanisms. In addition, mitochondrial defects have been described to be a major driver of disease initiation. MtDNA copy number has been proposed as a useful biomarker of mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, we investigated the role of mtDNA copy number in the pathogenesis C9ALS/FTD.</p><p id="Par2740"><bold>Material and Methods:</bold> Total mitochondrial and genomic DNA was extracted from postmortem human prefrontal cortex brains from 18 C9orf72 samples and 11 controls.

The aim of the present study is to identify the <italic>C9ORF72</italic> expansion in a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders in Greece (ALS, HD-like syndromes, dementia, Parkinson’s disease-PD, Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia—HSP) and healthy controls. Using molecular biological techniques including Repeat-Primed PCR (RP-PCR) 860 patients (399 with ALS, 44 with HD-like syndromes, 224 with dementia, 178 with PD and 15 with hereditary spastic paraplegia, HSP) and 321 controls were tested for the <italic>C9ORF72</italic> repeat expansion. Thirty-eight patients with ALS (9.5%), 2 with HD-like syndromes (4.5%), 8 with FTD (8.5%), 1 with AD (1.7%), and 2 with PD (1.1 %) were expansion-positive. The expansion was not detected in the HSP or control group.

Its development is a highly regulated process. The dynein protein is a unique molecular motor and is crucial for intra-cellular trafficking. Our team identified mutations in the gene coding for the dynein in patients with microcephaly. Interestingly, distinct mutations within this same gene lead to a different phenotype, the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Why some mutations affect the cortex development and some doesn’t remain unclear. The project is focus on the cortex, and aim to investigate which specific neuronal dynein functions are altered, and how it can lead to microcephaly. In order to study dynein-dependant functions during cortex development, I generate cerebral organoids, 3D structures that fully recapitulate the human features of the developing cortex. I reprogrammed two cell lines from patients caring mutations leading either to microcephaly or to SMA into pluripotent stem cells (IPSC) and differentiate them into cerebral organoids. Neuronal defects have been observed only in the organoids mutated for the microcephaly. The first observation was a strong reduction in the size of the organoids, which correlates with the patient’s phenotypes. In those same organoids, an alteration of the neural stem cells proliferation have been observed as well as an increase in the number of apoptotic cells. I am using the live imaging technique, a new outcome in the field. This technique allows me to investigate in real time the division of the neural stem cells as well as the newborn neurons migration to their final location.</p><p id="Par2766"><bold>S.

Accumulating evidence suggests a significant genetic contribution.</p><p id="Par2770"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Exome sequencing (ES) was performed on 1,777 patients with CP. Positive cases harbored one or two pathogenic or likely pathogenic alleles, depending on mode of inheritance, in a single gene.</p><p id="Par2771"><bold>Results:</bold> ES yielded a positive result in 27.5% of patients (488/1777). Causative variants were identified in genes associated with autosomal dominant (66.0%), autosomal recessive (19.9%), and X-linked disorders (14.1%), encompassing 238 different genes. Trio testing revealed a high de novo rate (71.5%). Linear modeling indicated that the likelihood of harboring a pathogenic variant was higher in patients with multiple co-morbid neurodevelopmental disorders (OR=1.34; 95% CI=1.18-1.53; p=7.28x10<sup>−6</sup>). Subset analysis from one study center (<italic>n</italic> = 208) showed that individuals lacking CP risk factors were 8-fold more likely to have a genetic etiology when controlling for GMFCS score (95% CI=2.33-52.59; p=0.0052).</p><p id="Par2772"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> ES identified a genetic etiology in more than a quarter of CP patients, supporting genetic testing in this group. Although recurrent CP-associated genes were elucidated, the results revealed vast genetic heterogeneity, underscoring the need for a broad genetic testing approach for CP. The high rate of de novo findings supports utilizing trio-testing. Individuals with multiple co-morbidities were more likely to have a positive finding, as were those lacking traditional CP risk factors. Genetic testing of patients with CP can inform an accurate recurrence risk, and provide information for prognosis, adjusted therapies, and management options.</p><p id="Par2773"><bold>F.

Here we describe a new association with a truncating homozygous mutation in CHDH gene, not associated with any disease until now.</p><p id="Par2784"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> A 70 years old man, son of second-cousins, presented with progressive spastic ataxia since his fifties, associated with ptosis, autonomic features, diffuse leukoencephalopathy and cortical atrophy. Routing screening for acquired forms was performed, along with common causes of ataxia caused by dynamic expansions. Exome was sequenced with xGen Exome Panel v1.0, IDT, on a NextSeq 500 by Illumina. Validated OMIM genes were analyzed and broad search in all candidate genes was performed in search of homozygous potentially pathologic mutations.</p><p id="Par2785"><bold>Results:</bold> No common SCAs nor Friedreich Ataxia expansions were detected. Exome analysis failed to find any variation amongst 33 validated genes causing autosomal recessive SA. Broad analysis extended to all OMIM and no OMIM genes led to identify a ultrarare frameshift mutation, c.386del (p.G129Vfs*89) in CHDH gene in homozygous state. No other potentially pathological variations were found.</p><p id="Par2786"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> CDHD is a mitochondrial enzyme involved in mitophagy and interacts with other genes like SQSTM1, PARK2 and TMEM70, which cause different neurodegenerative diseases through mitochondrial dysfunction when mutated.

NDDs include autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disability/developmental delay, communication disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, epilepsy, specific learning problems and motor disorders.

This term describes a syndrome characterized by typical parkinsonian features, such as bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability and resting tremor, and other clinical signs atypical for Parkinson’s disease (PD). The signs are different for each disease, but they share the pathological mechanisms: they presented intracellular protein aggregation in the brain of tau or α-synuclein, which is thought to be the cause of the development of the disease. Mutations in genes encoding tau and α-synuclein have been identified as risk factors for these diseases. <italic>DCTN1</italic> encodes the largest subunit of dynactin complex essential in the retrograde axonal transport and cytoplasmic transport of vesicles; mutations in <italic>DCTN1</italic> have been reported predominantly in individuals with Perry syndrome and, recently, in patients with PSP.

To date, we performed whole-exome sequencing in 100 patients. For genetic variant selection, two filters were used: i) read depth (RD≥10), allele frequency in control population (≤1%) and exonic consequence; ii) 129 known genes related to DEEs. For variants of interest selection, three criteria were used: considered deleterious by variant effect predictors, impact in the protein, presence on dbSNP and CLINVAR.</p><p id="Par2814"><bold>Results:</bold> The mean RD was 30X, and the mean percentage of targets with at least 10x RD was 89%.

By Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) great advances have been made in gene discovery for EIEE and several studies emphasized de novo variants as major underlying cause. Current diagnostic pathways allow molecular diagnosis to be made in about 20% of cases with EIEE and recent studies have also highlighted extreme genetic heterogeneity. Therefore, the current scenario indicates that most of the genes responsible for EIEE are probably still unknown. To this regard, our group recruited 21 patients (and their parents) with EIEE or epilepsy of unknown origin, negative for the presence of micro-arrangements, and investigated by WES, in the frame of the multicentric project EPI-IDEA, which is part of the RETE-IDEA network constituted by eight Italian pediatric IRCCS. In our study, we identified a pathogenic or very likely pathogenic variant/genotype in about 48% of the patients. Only in 2 patients a de novo mutation was identified, whereas 64% of diagnosed cases were caused by recessive genes previously associated with a seizure-related phenotype/s, including five compound heterozygosity for causative sequence and 2 homozygous. 27% of the mutations were novel variants not described before. 10 patients are currently still under investigation. Our results confirm a relevant role of mostly compound heterozygous recessive inheritance for EIEE with important implication for genetic counselling.</p><p id="Par2844"><bold>L.

According to recent studies, the copy number variants (CNVs) are important factors in this disorder (2-11%). We used array CGH method in a cohort of 90 patients with epilepsy, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities with or without dysmorphic features. Array CGH analysis was performed using genome-wide microarray with average resolution of 30 kb (180K, OGT) with specifically designed coverage for over 212 selected genes, known or candidate to play an important role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Chromosomal microarray analysis revealed 33 CNVs (17 duplications, 15 deletions, 1 triplication) in 29 out of 90 (32.2%) patients with epilepsy. 2 pathogenic CNVs were detected in 2 patients from our cohort. 9 potentially pathogenic CNVs, and 22 CNVs with unknown clinical significance were detected in 27 individuals. All of the identified CNVs were submicroscopic in size, ranging from 1.7 kb to 8.85 Mb, and therefore could not have been detected by standard karyotype analysis. Additionally, 17 CNVs (51%) could not have been detected by our clinical microarray (60K). Our study highlights the role of CNVs in the etiopathogenesis of epilepsy and demonstrates that the array CGH is an effective tool in the genetic diagnosis of this neurodevelopmental disorder.

EFHC2 is expressed in the mammalian brain regions: cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and cerebellum. In cultured mammalian cells, it localizes to the spindle poles and midbody. We have identified seven potentially pathogenic <italic>EFHC2</italic> variants present almost exclusively among 500 JME patients examined.

Cellular defects caused by EFHC2 variants in cultured mammalian cells are partially rescued by EFHC1, and vice versa.

FAME is genetically heterogeneous with 6 distinct disease-causative genes identified over the last two years. Notably, all share an emerging common pathomolecular mechanism consisting in the expansion of non-coding (intronic) pentanucleotide repeats at distinct loci. We report a novel three generation FAME pedigree with 3 affected subjects and a healthy carrier. Two sibs had full-blown FAME phenotype, while a 32-year-old girl manifested only myoclonus starting at age 25. Molecular genetics investigation by means of repeat primed PCR (RP-PCR) detected the pathogenic ATTTC pentanucleotide expansion in <italic>STARD7</italic>, diagnostic of FAME2. The ATTTT repeat reference sequence was not identified in the expansion. Sanger sequencing confirmed an apparent loss of heterozygosity in affected members and, more interestingly, depicted a complex structure of wild-type (not expanded) alleles. Of note, ATTTC-STARD7 expansion was confirmed in the unaffected 89-year-old mother of affected sibs. To our knowledge this is the first report of reduced penetrance in a molecularly confirmed STARD7 expansion carrier individual. In addition, the identification of atypical wild-type alleles broadens the repeat structure repertoire suggesting further complexity at the STARD7/FAME2 locus.</p><p id="Par2882"><bold>L.

The reason why patients with the same mutation may or may not develop neurodegeneration and PD is still unclear.

Among these, <italic>GDAP1</italic> encodes for a mitochondrial protein important for mitochondrial dynamic and protection from ROS. However, motor neurons (MNs), the mainly involved cells in this neuropathy, cannot be obtained from patients. Our goal was to generate MNs derived from iPSc (induced-pluripotent-stem-cells) in order to investigate the effects of <italic>GDAP1</italic>-mutations.</p><p id="Par2908"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We created iPSc from fibroblasts of two unaffected subjects and a CMT-patient carrying a <italic>GDAP1</italic> homozygous codon-stop mutation. iPSc were differentiated in neural progenitors (NP), then in motor neurons (MN). To study GDAP1 expression, we realized RNA-extraction, qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. Electronic microscopy and functional tests were also achieved.</p><p id="Par2909"><bold>Results:</bold> By studying <italic>GDAP1</italic> mRNA expression in Fibroblasts, iPSc, NPs and MNs, on controls’ cells, we observed that <italic>GDAP1</italic> is mostly expressed in neural cells (NPs and MNs), showing the importance of generating MNs to study <italic>GDAP1</italic> mutations effects. Interestingly, in all patient’s cell types, <italic>GDAP1</italic> expression was low, suggesting that <italic>GDAP1</italic> mRNA, containing a premature termination codon (PTC), is probably degraded by the nonsense-mediated-decay (NMD) system. These results have been confirmed by immunocytochemistry. Then, we analyzed morphological and functional properties of our cellular models.</p><p id="Par2910"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Cellular models are useful tools to investigate the impact of genomic mutations on functional level. Our study highlighted the importance of employing the good cellular model (MNs), to study the altered molecular mechanisms associated to <italic>GDAP1</italic>-mutations in CMT disease.</p><p id="Par2911"><bold>F.

Till date, 316 monogenic and 2 chromosomal disorders are designated as LD/gLE. Though neuroimaging was the key to diagnosis over last two decades, broad-spectrum genetic testing has now taken a central role in diagnosis. <bold>Methods:</bold> We reviewed literature to retract a list of genetic disorders with white matter abnormalities. We also evaluated 109 individuals from 101 families with white matter abnormalities. Exome sequencing (ES) was performed for genomic evaluation. <bold>Results:</bold> Literature review rendered 445 conditions with white matter abnormalities. One-hundred-and-two conditions present with hypomyelination and 343 conditions have de/dysmyelination. Of the total, 129 disorders have not yet been designated as LD/gLE but have predominant white matter abnormalities. Diagnostic yield of ES in heterogenous cohorts of individuals with white matter abnormalities has been noted to be in the range of 40-50%. ES has led to discovery of 63 novel conditions with white matter abnormalities in the past decade. In our cohort of 109 families, 14 had hypomyelination and 95 had de/dysmyelination. Molecular diagnosis was established in 67 families (66.33%). Thirty-eight (59.37%) of 64 disease-causing variants were novel. Four novel conditions with pathogenic variants in <italic>ISCA1</italic>, <italic>AIMP2, EXOSC1 and ANKRD17</italic> were identified. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> The spectrum of genetic disorders with white matter abnormalities is ever-increasing and ES has emerged as a highly efficient modality for diagnosis of known conditions as well as elucidation of novel conditions.</p><p id="Par2922"><bold>P.

DLD presents extensive comorbidity with other disorders like dyslexia and ADHD. DLD is highly heritable but few genes have been identified so far. Through an exome sequencing analysis we identified a rare missense mutation (chr16:84405221 G&gt;A (GRCh38.p12)) in the <italic>ATP2C2</italic> gene. Exactly the same variant was reported previously in a different exome sequencing study for DLD, and ATP2C2 was previously proposed as susceptibility gene for language disorders by linkage and association studies. We followed this finding up by genotyping the mutation in cohorts selected for DLD and comorbid disorders. We found that the variant had a higher frequency in DLD cases (1.8%, N=360) compared to cohorts selected for dyslexia (0.8%, N = 520) and ADHD (0.7%, N = 150), which presented frequencies comparable to reference databases (0.9%, N = 24,046 gnomAD controls). Analysis of quantitative phenotypes in the ALSPAC birth cohort showed that carriers (N=42) of the variant had, as a group, lower mean scores on a range of reading and language-related measures compared to controls (N=1825), e.g. carriers had a mean score 0.4 SD lower than non-carriers on a phoneme awareness task. We are currently investigating the potential effects of this variant on protein function with a range of biochemical and electrophysiology assays.

Yet, the etiology still remains to be elucidated in a large group of MCD patients. The proband of this study, a 17-year old boy presented with a complex brain malformation including severe cortical dysplasia, agenesis of the corpus callosum, interhemispheric cysts and pontocerebellar hypoplasia. Parents are non-consanguineous. The father of the proband has a simple arachnoid cyst. Whole exome sequencing showed a novel homozygous variant (c.607G&gt;A, p.(Gly203Arg)) in the <italic>MAN2C1</italic> (NM_006715.3) gene. This variant was not reported earlier and classified as variant of uncertain significance (VUS 3). The <italic>MAN2C1</italic> gene encodes a cytosolic mannosidase and is involved in the degradation of misfolded glycoproteins. Possibly, as a consequence of the accumulation of proteins, the organization and maturation of neurons is altered during fetogenesis. Preliminary RT-PCR results showed that the expression level of <italic>MAN2C1</italic> is downregulated in fibroblasts compared to controls, although this downregulation was not significant. The variant in <italic>MAN2C1</italic> causes a ± 50% decrease in cytosolic alpha-mannosidase enzymatic activity in the patient compared to controls.

The functional consequences of the detected variant and the exact role of the MAN2C gene in the development of MCD need further investigation.</p><p id="Par2956"><bold>L.

Main examples of MCD are lissencephaly, heterotopia, and polymicrogyria. MCD place a significant burden on affected individuals, their families and society, as patients often suffer from lifelong symptoms including drug-resistant epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and intellectual disability. Although next-generation sequencing has become broadly available worldwide, marked differences in diagnostic yield remain due to broad genetic and clinical heterogeneity and lack of guidelines in the recognition and classification of these rare disorders.</p><p id="Par2967"><bold>Methods:</bold> The international network on brain malformations Neuro-MIG formed a multidisciplinary task force. Through expert meetings, literature search, and the Delphi consensus method a diagnostic strategy for individuals with MCD was developed.</p><p id="Par2968"><bold>Results:</bold> We present consensus recommendations on the optimal work flow applicable to any individual with MCD. This includes a flow chart for the clinical work-up, laboratory standards, and a curated MCD gene panel list. In addition, we discuss the differential diagnosis, possible diagnostic pitfalls and special recommendations for specific MCD subtypes.</p><p id="Par2969"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These recommendations will aid clinicians in providing the optimal diagnostic strategy, which will improve genetic and prognostic counseling and patient care.

Biallelic mutations in 25 genes have been demonstrated to cause MCPH, and the numbers are growing with more inclusive and cross disciplinary collaborative approaches.</p><p id="Par2974"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> This study analyzed two consanguineous MCPH families (Pakistani and Syrian) through homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing (WES). The functional consequences of the candidate variants were studied by immunofluorescence, confocal microscopy and Clariom™ S microarray analysis.</p><p id="Par2975"><bold>Results:</bold> In the Pakistani family, WES identified a homozygous missense mutation, c.1449C&gt;G;p.Asp483Glu, of <italic>PCDHGC4</italic> (NM_018928.2), residing within a linkage interval afore identified on chromosome 5 (LOD score of 3.1). In the Syrian patient (identified through GeneMatcher), clinical WES revealed another missense mutation in the same gene, NM_018928.2:c.1463C&gt;T:p.Ala488Val. Together with its isoforms, PCDHGC4 is expressed on the surface of neuronal cells in different combinations, thereby providing cells with a unique “barcode” for self/non self-discrimination. PCDHGC4 is a highly conserved Ca<sup>+2</sup> binding protein and <italic>in silico</italic> analyses predicted both variants to decrease its Ca<sup>+2</sup> affinity, which most likely impairs its function. We also observed endogenous and transiently overexpressed PCDHGC4 to localize within the nucleus and cytoplasm. In patient-derived fibroblasts, blebbing of the nuclear envelope, micronuclei, misshapen nuclei and higher apoptotic rates were observed. Array transcriptome analysis revealed altered expression of genes involved in cadherin signaling.</p><p id="Par2976"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings indicate that <italic>PCDHGC4</italic> is a novel MCPH gene, and its optimal function seems to be an indispensable requirement for the development of a proper brain structure.</p><p id="Par2977"><bold>M.

All boys startled easily and showed progressive hypotonia by 3-6 months-old. Key unifying features included severe motor and intellectual disability, axial hypotonia, progressive spasticity, microcephaly, failure to thrive. Limb dystonia was a dominant feature, and 3 demonstrated paroxysmal movements. Two had seizures/abnormal EEG, one had sleep myoclonus. MRI brain showed delayed myelination with progression in 4 boys. TFT revealed high serum T3, low T4 and normal TSH in all. Four novel hemizygous pathogenic variants in SLC16A2 (3 frameshift,1 missense) were identified in 4unrelated families.

Although MJD is the most frequent dominant ataxia worldwide, our previous studies suggest that de novo expansions would not explain its worldwide prevalence. To date, only two major MJD mutational origins have been identified: the Machado lineage, more recent, most frequent in parts of Portugal; and the ancient Joseph lineage, of Asian origin, spread worldwide. We extended our previous studies and tested the potential of additional markers for higher-resolution MJD haplotypes. We analysed a total of 370 families, from 30 world populations (5 continents); assessed a set of 30 SNPs in <italic>cis</italic> with the (CAG)<sub>n</sub> expansion, to establish lineages; and genotyped 7 STRs flanking <italic>ATXN3</italic>, to construct phylogenetic networks. In addition to the Joseph (<italic>n</italic> = 210) and Machado (<italic>n</italic> = 90 families) pure lineages, we observed 7 sublineages, differing from those two main haplotype backgrounds at 1-3 variants. Based on extended STR-haplotypes, the highest gene diversity was observed in Joseph-lineage families from the USA (0.91 ± 0.05) and Asia (0.88 ± 0.03), followed by central European populations (around 0.50), with Portuguese families showing the lowest diversity (0.18 ± 0.08). Besides its epidemiological and historical interest, these variants could be of great value to study phenotypic variation and genetic modifiers linked to these haplotypes; to study genetic instability of the (CAG)<sub>n</sub>; and for therapeutical interventions, including gene-based targeting, namely in the best design for allele-specific <italic>ATXN3</italic> silencing, that might be applicable to most MJD patients.

Whole exome sequencing was performed in 4 early AO and 5 late AO (±10 years deviation) patients of a large Dutch MJD/SCA3 family (n<sub>affected_total</sub>=32) via Illumina HiSeq. Sequencing data were analyzed via an in-house bioinformatics pipeline and Alissa (Agilent). ATXN3 protein aggregates were quantified using a filter-trap assay.

Its functional impact is being investigated in HEK293T cells and iPSCs.</p><p id="Par3013"><bold>Results:</bold> We describe two individuals from two unrelated non-consanguineous families with an identical de novo mutation in <italic>CAPRIN1</italic> (Cell Cycle Associated Protein 1): an 8 year-old girl with progressive muscular atrophy, who developed ataxia and cognitive decline at 11 years, and a 7 year-old boy with spinocerebellar ataxia and learning difficulties. Both carry an identical de novo c.1535C&gt;T variant (p.Pro512Leu) which is not reported in gnomAD and affects a highly conserved residue. CAPRIN1 is abundant in the brain, where it regulates the transport and translation of mRNAs of genes involved in synaptic plasticity. As other ND-related proteins, it is a component of stress granules and harbours a prion-like domain (PRD). In accordance with the <italic>in silico</italic> predictions suggesting that the p.P512L mutation increases its aggregation propensity, CAPRIN1<sup>P512L</sup> overexpression causes the formation of insoluble aggregates in transfected HEK293T cells.

In families without likely pathogenic variants in known disease causing genes; novel candidate genes were prioritized according to functional impact, rarity in multiple databases especially in Southeast Asia population, presence in multiple families with overlapping phenotypes, mutational tolerance of the gene, animal studies, predicted deleteriousness by several <italic>in silico</italic> tools and expression of the protein in affected tissues.</p><p id="Par3031"><bold>Results:</bold> We found known pathogenic or novel variants in known disease genes with phenotypic expansion in 18 families and 12 novel candidates in 10 families including <italic>RTN4R</italic>, <italic>ITGB8</italic> and <italic>ACBD6</italic>. Overall, molecular diagnosis was provided by variants in known genes in 36 families (72%) and by novel candidate genes in additional 10 families, resulting in a potential molecular diagnostic rate of 92%. Homozygous variants were causative in only 34.7%, despite high rate of consanguinity in our cohort.</p><p id="Par3032"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study shows the benefits of WES analysis in neurodevelopmental disorders in non-European populations and highlights ongoing difficulties in variant interpretation. In our cohort, only six of identified variants were previously reported, the remaining were novel variants and hence interpretation of pathogenicity was challenging especially in cases with atypical phenotypes.</p><p id="Par3033"><bold>H.

It is upregulated during human embryonic brain development and has low expression after birth. Homozygous KO mice are lethal. A recurrent missense variant was reported in patients with Schuurs-Hoeijmakers syndrome (OMIM 615009), an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by intellectual disability, distinct craniofacial features, and variable additional congenital abnormalities. Seizures of various types are frequent and usually respond well to antiepileptic drugs. This variant was suggested to act via a dominant-negative or a gain-of-function mechanism. No other pathogenic variant has been reported to date. We report on four patients from three unrelated families, with homozygous variants of <italic>PACS1</italic>. They presented with severe developmental delay, poor eye contact, absent language. Seizures started in infancy. They were of various types (focal seizures in one patient, spams in another one and generalized seizures in three patients) and drug resistant. EEG showed multifocal spikes or generalized sharp waves. Brain MRI showed variable patterns in patients, including delayed myelination or cerebral atrophy. Patients did not show the dysmorphic features reminiscent of Schuurs-Hoeijmakers syndrome. One family carried a homozygous stop variant and the two others different unreported homozygous missense variants, affecting highly conserved amino acids. These variants were absent or with a very low occurrence in the gnomAD v2.1 database.

The underlying mechanism of mitochondrial processes in the sporadic form of PD is still largely unknown. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) gather the total risk for disease in an individual based on common variants, where the risk alleles and their effects are defined by previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here we evaluate whether an additive genetic risk of variants from gene-sets is associated with increased PD risk.</p><p id="Par3076"><bold>Material and Methods:</bold> A Luxembourgish cohort of 656 controls and 633 PD patients were genotyped on the Neurochip array. PRS for each individual were calculated with PRSice-2, using the GWAS data from Nalls et al., 2018. The PRS was tested for association with PD status with mitochondrial and other pathway-related gene-sets. The Parkinson’s Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset included 363 PD cases and 165 controls genotyped with NeuroX chip.</p><p id="Par3077"><bold>Results:</bold> The results show a significantly higher common variant burden in PD cases compared to controls in mitochondrial gene-sets (odds ratio: 1.31 [1.18, 1.48] per one standard deviation; empirical-P = 8.9 e-04). The PRS was also associated with PD status within the known PD genes, lysosomal and autophagy gene-sets. The same result was observed with the (PPMI) data.</p><p id="Par3078"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study suggests that cumulative effect of common variants in mitochondrial genes significantly contribute to PD.

It is characterized by childhood-onset cerebellar ataxia, sensorimotor axonal neuropathy, oculomotor apraxia and dystonia; with a variable degree of cognitive impairment. Diallelic variants in the polynucleotide kinase 3’-phosphatase (<italic>PNKP</italic>) gene were shown to be the cause of AOA4, by our group, in 2015. We now reviewed genetic and clinical data from a sequential series with pathogenic variants in <italic>PNKP</italic>, 2015 through 2019, to update mutational spectrum and reassess phenotypes; we report 10 additional AOA4 patients. We used Sanger sequencing of <italic>PNKP</italic> or a NGS multigene (whole-exome based) panel for recessive ataxias, according to clinical request; 10 Portuguese AOA patients (7 families), were found to be homozygotes (2 families) or compound heterozygotes (5 families), bearing 4 known <italic>PNKP</italic> pathogenic variants: c.1221_1223del (p.Thr408del) and c.1123G&gt;T (p.Gly375Trp) (each present in 4 families), c.1315_1330delinsGGGGACG (p.Arg439_Pro444delinsGlyAspAla) and c.1029+2T&gt;C (r.spl) (each present in 1 family); and 2 novel variants: c.1510del (p.Arg504Glyfs*) and c.1282_1283insACAAACCCAGAC (p.Ala428delinsAspLysProArgPro), for which pathogenicity is being confirmed. Incidentally, through multigene panels, six other patients with ataxia (or other differential diagnoses) carried a single pathogenic or likely- pathogenic variant in <italic>PNKP</italic>. This study expands considerably the number of AOA4 patients genetically characterized by our group, from 11 reported in 2015 to a total of 21. Further, confirms AOA4 as among the most frequent subtypes of recessive ataxia in Portugal. Considering the limited number of patients reported in the literature so far (<italic>n</italic> = 8), studies in other populations are much needed.</p><p id="Par3083"><bold>S.

Various studies suggest genetic risk factors for POCD. This prospective cohort study aimed to detect genome-wide associations with POCD in older patients.</p><p id="Par3087"><bold>Methods:</bold> Study participants aged ≥65 years completed a battery of neuropsychological tests consisting of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease-Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (CERAD-NAB), Trail Making Tests A and B, and the Phonemic Fluency Test (S-words) before, and at 1 week and 3 months after major noncardiac surgery. Test variables were converted into standard scores (z-scores) based on demographic variables. POCD was diagnosed if the decline was &gt;1 standard deviation in 2 or more of the 15 variables in the test battery. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed to determine potential alleles that are linked to the phenotype POCD.</p><p id="Par3088"><bold>Results:</bold> Sixty-three patients with blood samples were included in the study. POCD was diagnosed in 47.6% of patients at 1 week and in 34.2% of patients at 3 months after surgery. Insufficient sample quality led to exclusion of 26 patients. In the remaining 37 patients, a GWAS was performed, but no association with POCD was found. A subsequent gene set analysis on 36 genes using VEGAS2 did not reveal any significant associations.</p><p id="Par3089"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this patient cohort, a GWAS did not reveal an association between specific genetic alleles and POCD at 1 week and 3 months after surgery. Future genetic analysis should focus on specific candidate genes for POCD.</p><p id="Par3090"><bold>N. Göttel:</bold> None. <bold>M. Rickenbacher:</bold> None. <bold>C.S.

Her brother and mother had onset of ataxia at ages of 40 and 50 years.

Initially, this was a variant of uncertain significance (VUS). We found a higher number of mtDNA sequence changes in blood cells from the mutation carriers compared to matched healthy controls.

To date only 16 patients with <italic>POLR2A</italic> mutations have been described in a single publication, three of them carrying a truncating mutation. Many features in the published patients are overlapping with those of our patient. However, none of the patients reported presented a polydactyly (in our girl preaxial with a double thumb on the left), a thumb hypoplasia (in our girl just a „soft tissue thumb“, which had been removed, on the right), anal anteposition and stenosis, and a heart defect (ASDII). There was significant neonatal hypotonia. Unsupported walking was possible only at the age of 4 years. Developmental delay now at the age of 14 years is severe. The girl does not speak at all. After the first decade the tendon-reflexes of the legs decreased and bilateral pes cavus developed, possibly manifesting a peripheral neuropathy. There are craniofacial dysmorphic features, but no microcephaly. Whole exome sequencing (incl. CNV) identified a 2 bp deletion in <italic>POLR2A</italic> which is supposed to cause a frameshift and a premature stop of protein synthesis.

Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are used for identifying the genetic architecture of complex diseases in order to predict disease genetic risk, as well as testing their shared genetic architecture. In this study, we investigated the association between PRS related to neurodegenerative and complex diseases and brain morphometry. A total of 479 cognitively unimpaired middle-age participants at increased risk of AD (ALFA cohort) with available genotyping and neuroimaging data were included. PRS were calculated from the most recent genome-wide association meta-analyses for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson disease, stroke, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, depression, cerebrovascular disease, and CSF core AD biomarkers. Association analyses included brain regional volumes as outcomes. Associations were estimated using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, <italic>APOE</italic>-ϵ4 status, and total intracranial volume. We found increased PRS average of AD, p-tau and Aβ42 levels among ALFA participants. Furthermore, results suggested evidence of an association between increased risk of cholesterolemia and reduced volumes of left accumbens area, increased risk of cardiovascular disease and reduced volumes of thalamus proper, as well as increased risk of having higher p-tau levels and reduced volumes of right thalamus proper and right cerebellum cortex. We provide strong evidence that genetic liability of cardiovascular diseases and core AD biomarkers influences brain morphology in ALFA participants. In addition, across all diseases, ALFA participants showed increased genetic risk of AD and altered CSF biomarker.</p><p id="Par3105"><bold>N. Vilor-Tejedor:</bold> None. <bold>R.

Patients typically present with an urge to move the legs at rest at night which severely impairs sleep and quality of life. Based on previous GWAS results, we performed mutational load analysis of putatively causal candidate genes.</p><p id="Par3128"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We sequenced exons and promotors of 84 genes in 4,649 RLS patients and 4,982 population-based controls from Germany in a targeted NGS approach with 11,214 molecular inversion probes (MIPs). We compared the variant load (MAF &lt; = 0.05) by gene between cases and controls using standard burden testing. As variants in a MIP’s binding regions affect its sequencing yield, we also analyzed target sequencing depths as an integrative and independent assessment of the differential variant burden.</p><p id="Par3129"><bold>Results:</bold> Differential variant burden results of both types of analysis overlapped significantly. Therefore, 14 genes were significantly associated and validated. Both types of analysis also converged significantly in fine-mapping potentially causative domains within these genes.</p><p id="Par3130"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> By assessing differential burden with intragenic low-frequency variants we identified at least 14 putatively causative genes in RLS. In keeping with other polygenic diseases, the variant burden was higher in patients.

Among those, heterozygous missense gain-of-function variants in <italic>RNF13</italic> leading to altered signaling of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, have been recently reported in three children with congenital microcephaly, encephalopathy with epilepsy, blindness, and failure to thrive (PMID 30595371). None of these patients presented with movement disorders. We here report a child with early-onset global developmental delay, acquired microcephaly, failure-to-thrive, infantile spasms, focal seizures and gastrointestinal dysfunction, who also presented at 3 years with a choreo-dystonic movement disorder. An extended metabolic work-up was normal. Brain MRI did not reveal significant abnormalities. A trio whole-exome sequencing revealed a heterozygous de novo c.932delT:(p.Leu311TyrfsTer2) variant in the <italic>RNF13</italic> gene. The variant results in a frameshift near the carboxyl terminus of the predicted protein sequence (codon 311 of 380), producing an abnormal protein with a postulated gain of function effect. Interestingly the previously described pathogenic variants were in the same location of the primary protein sequence p.(Leu311Ser) and p.(Leu312Pro).To our knowledge, our patient is the fourth described so far. In addition to previously reported symptoms, the phenotype of this child also included a choreo-dystonic movement disorder; thus the phenotypes related to <italic>RNF13</italic> pathogenic variants are extended to include a movement disorder.

Most children with this disorder do not present any other cognitive or neurological deficits and have normal non-verbal IQ. This condition is highly heritable and affects between 5% and 8% of pre-school children. Lately investigations have begun to uncover genetic factors that may contribute to susceptibility to language impairment. In our previous study we conducted a pool expression analysis and GINS2 was the most up regulated gene.</p><p id="Par3153"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> The study aimed to examine the individual expression profile of GINS2 gene by ddPCR in the peripheral blood of 48 individuals divided into two groups: children with SLI and healthy controls.</p><p id="Par3154"><bold>Results:</bold> Mean values of 15,4copies/20mcl was found in the SLI group and 8,8 - in the control one. The difference was statistically significant - P=0.03, proving that the GINS2 gene is up regulated in the SLI group. GINS2, located in 16q21 is part of the GINS complex which plays an essential role in the initiation of DNA replication, and progression of DNA replication forks. There are a couple of case reports that report speech delay in patients with 16q21 duplications. A recent study found a connection with GINS2 expression and neuroinflamation.</p><p id="Par3155"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Comparative gene expression analysis is useful in discovering novel genetic markers associated with SLI.

The <italic>ATP2B3</italic> gene encodes for a member of the calmodulin-activated plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> ATPase family (PMCA3) which extrudes excess calcium from the cell to maintain neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-homeostasis, especially in the cerebellum.

He showed a delayed motor development as an infant, impaired gross and fine motor skills, dysarthria, and hypoplasia of the cerebellum. Intellectual development was normal. Kennedy’s disease was excluded and a NGS panel for ataxia related genes showed no pathogenic variants. Array-CGH revealed a duplication of 357 kb in Xq28. This duplication spans eight genes, including <italic>ATP2B3</italic> and two more OMIM genes (BGN, FAM38A). Further analysis of female family members confirmed this duplication in the patient’s mother, her sister and the sister’s daughter.

We also investigated theorical models composed of 4 segments P11-K35 with a methionine or glycine at position 50.

V50M 4 β-arches were stacked in a parallel β-sheet structure stabilized by inter-strand interactions whereas 4 β-arches of V50G associated in a β-barrel structure with intra and inter strand interactions.

The disorder is characterised by multiple hamartomas in the brain, heart, skin, and kidney. Another common feature of TSC is epilepsy, which is frequently drug-resistant and constitutes the main cause of morbidity and disability in affected individuals. The project EPIMARKER is aimed to identify new biomarkers of epilepsy in a group of patients affected with TSC. We believe, the results of this research will become a starting point for further work on new therapeutics and clinical solutions.</p><p id="Par3194"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> The first step of the project was intended to describe an exact molecular cause of TSC in a group of 65 affected individuals. We screened <italic>TSC1</italic> and <italic>TSC2</italic> genes with the use of targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) for all exons of both genes.</p><p id="Par3195"><bold>Results:</bold> Testing with targeted next-generation sequencing gene panel revealed pathogenic variants in 50 out of 65 patients, whereas qPCR performed in 15 remaining individuals showed intragenic deletions in 5 additional cases.

VASH1 and VASH2, in complex with SVBP, have recently been identified as responsible for intracellular tubulin detyrosination activity. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations in <italic>SVBP</italic> have much recently been described in patients showing intellectual disability, microcephaly, ataxia and hypotonia.</p><p id="Par3201"><bold>Methods:</bold> All patients underwent accurate clinical evaluation and provided informed consent. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed using patients’ DNA samples, and segregation in relatives was confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Primary fibroblasts were generated from patients’ skin biopsies, and cultured cells were incubated with paclitaxel to analyze detyrosinated tubulin levels by immunofluorescence and western blot. cDNA of <italic>VASH1</italic> and wild-type/mutated forms of <italic>SVBP</italic> were cloned into a pCMV-Tag4A vector, and then cotransfected into HeLa cells for Western Blot analysis.</p><p id="Par3202"><bold>Results:</bold> We report two families with multiple patients harboring an homozygous missense variant in <italic>SVBP</italic> (p.Leu49Pro).

In these patients, regression of skills occurred at 2.5-7 years. Initially motor regression followed by language regression was found. Brain MRI revealed diffuse cortical atrophy of the subcortical white matter. <italic>UBFT</italic> encodes a transcription factor, which facilitate the assembly of the transcription initiation complex of the RNA polymerase I (PolI), which is crucial for rRNA synthesis. Functional studies showed that the <italic>UBTF</italic> variant leads to a stronger binding affinity to the rDNA promotor and increased 18s rRNA expression. As a result the chromatin structure at the rDNA locus was decondensed. In rats enhanced PolI activity promotes neurite outgrowth, which can lead to neurodegenerative processes (Edvardson et al., 2017). Here we report on another patient carrying the de novo p.Glu210Val <italic>UBTF</italic> variant identified by WES. The psychomotoric development of the boy was slightly delayed at first. He started walking on his own with 1 ½ year, and ataxic gait was noted. At the age of 5 years, he was unable to walk without assistance, and was wheelchair-bound at the age of 7. Subsequently, the boy developed tetraparesis, global retardation, and severe scolio-kyphosis. Around the age of 1 ½ the boy started to use identifiable words but his speech deteriorated and by the age of 7 he presented with slurred speech, and subsequently stopped using words.

To date, more 100 patients with pathogenic homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in <italic>WDR62</italic> were reported. They have developmental delay with constant speech impairment, moderate to severe intellectual disability (ID) and multiple brain malformations including hypoplasia of corpus callosum and migration disorders (polymicrogyria, pachygyria, lissencephaly and schizencephaly). Nevertheless, no patient have been properly assessed by appropriated neuropsychological tests. Using multi-gene panel or exome sequencing, we identified 18 cases with <italic>WDR62</italic> variants and report clinical, neuropsychological assessment and neuroradiological phenotype. Phenotypic spectrum of our patients is very large ranging from severe antenatal presentation leading to profound motor handicap, to mild-moderate ID, learning abilities and autonomy in daily life. We were surprised to discover that some patients had a VCI at 50 and able to read and write, similar to what is described with <italic>ASPM</italic>. Some patients had normal brain structure on MRI except microcephaly. Interestingly, some patients develop ataxia with age, which was never reported.

We analysed and prioritized mutations in the coding sequence, repeats expansions, and structural variants by standard bioinformatic tools and we implemented a novel pipeline to prioritize non coding-variants with a possible pathogenetic effect. We identified 11 pathogenic variants. Four of them map in genes causative of rare forms of ALS (<italic>KIF5A, NEK1, TBK1 OPTN)</italic>.

Common genetic risk factors identified by GWAS explain 25-38% of the phenotypic variance. It is assumed that rare variants may also play a substantial role and explain part of the hidden heritability. One strategy to identify such variants is Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of large multiply affected families with BD. In the present study we conducted WGS of 108 individuals in 8 multigenerational affected families of Spanish origin.</p><p id="Par3220"><bold>Methods:</bold> Sequencing was performed with 30x mean coverage on an Illumina HiSeq2500 and variant calling was performed using the GATK best practice workflow. For downstream analysis we developed a variant based scoring model. We combined information on family structure and the proportion of allele sharing amongst the affected individuals plus the biological impact for each variant based on different prediction classifiers such as CADD or SNPeff.</p><p id="Par3221"><bold>Results:</bold> We focused on the identification of rare variants following two analyses pathways for the WGS data: an “extended exome” analysis, focusing on the high impact and protein-coding variants only. Secondly we applied the model to the full WGS dataset, including also the non-coding part of the genome. On average we identified 4.4 million variants per individual. In two families, we identified stop mutations as the top scored variants in the genes <italic>TAS2R19</italic> and <italic>PPEF2</italic>.

Fetal autopsy documented arthrogryposis multiplex as well as facial dysmorphism, bilateral talipes equinovarus and extreme atrophy of muscle fibres.

Consanguinity was noted in parents of both patients.</p><p id="Par3233"><bold>Results:</bold> Whole exome sequencing of the patient revealed a novel homozygous variant c.2077-2A&gt;C in intron 23 of ADAM22 gene. The variant was not found in large exome databases, and several in-silico prediction programs classified the mutation as "pathogenic" vs no benign predictions. Family segregation analysis demonstrated heterozygous carrier state in both parents, their healthy daughter, as well as in parents of additional familial case with similar symptoms. Literature search yielded one description of compound heterozygous mutations in ADAM22 gene, causing rapidly progressing cerebral atrophy, intractable seizures, and intellectual disability. Previous research showed that knockout mice for ADAM22 manifest with lethal seizures during the first postnatal weeks.</p><p id="Par3234"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our case provides valuable information to the scarce literature evidence describing the association between mutations in ADAM22 gene to severe neurologic morbidity.</p><p id="Par3235"><bold>L.

SOD1 may have a toxic role in the pathogenesis when the protein aggregates in the cytoplasm; increased accumulation of nuclear SOD1 (nSOD1) represents a protective cellular reaction (Cereda et al., 2013; Bordoni et al., 2019). We investigated pathways activated by nSOD1 in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of ALS patients by dividing them depending on the “high” or “low” concentration of nSOD1.</p><p id="Par3246"><bold>Methods:</bold> Subcellular fractionation from PBMCs of ALS patients (18) and healthy controls (12) was performed and proteins were quantified by Western blotting. RNA libraries were prepared by Illumina TruSeq Stranded RNA Library and run on NextSeq (Illumina). Differential expression analysis was performed using R package EBSeq.</p><p id="Par3247"><bold>Results:</bold> We obtained two gene expression patterns for high and low nSOD patients. Differentially expressed genes in patients with high nSOD1 form a cluster similar to controls compared to low nSOD1 group. Pathways activated in high nSOD1 patients are related to the up-regulation of SEMA6B, a semaphorin involved in axon guidance, and HSP70, molecular chaperones ensuring the correct protein folding. In low nSOD1 group the up-regulation of KDM4C and S100B may be responsible for hyper-demethylation of histone H3 impaired in ALS.</p><p id="Par3248"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings highlight the importance of subcellular localization of soluble nSOD1 in ALS patients. We observed a different behavior of RNA regulation in the two groups of patients, leading to pathways conferring “protection” where nSOD1 was high, and a general “perturbations” where nSOD1 was low.</p><p id="Par3249"><bold>S.

Molecular alterations in this gene are large deletions/duplications in 80% of cases and small mutations in the remaining. Several authors reported the occurrence of non-contiguous rearrangements within the same <italic>DMD</italic> allele, with frequencies up to 4%. The present work aims to characterize the incidence of complex rearrangements in an Argentinian dystrophinopathy cohort and unravel the causing molecular mechanisms.</p><p id="Par3304"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We analyzed 437 boys with clinical diagnosis of Dystrophinopathy. The following techniques were implemented: MLPA, WES, WGS, PCR-Sanger Sequencing, CGH Array and HUMARA assay. In 2 cases, breakpoints were precisely determined, so we performed a bioinformatic screening of microhomologies, interspersed repeats, secondary structures and recombinogenic motifs 50pb surrounding each breakpoint.</p><p id="Par3305"><bold>Results:</bold> We detected 6 patients carrying complex rearrangements in <italic>DMD:</italic> 2 deletions-duplications, 3 non-contiguous duplications and 1 large deletion plus a 20pb insertion. These accounted for 1.4% of our cohort. In a deletion-duplication case, familial segregation and bioinformatics analysis suggested that the duplication was the first mutagenic event caused by Fork Stalling and Template Switching (FoSTeS), while the deletion occurred secondly by Non-homologous end joining. Furthermore, bioinformatic screening of the deletion plus insertion propose that the deletion was due to Microhomology-mediated end joining, while the insertion arose by FoSTeS.</p><p id="Par3306"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings widen the understanding of the molecular events that may take place in <italic>DMD</italic> and characterize the occurrence of complex rearrangements in our dystrophinopathy cohort.

To date, more than 70 genes have been identified that contribute to the cause of HSP. Despite the use of next-generation sequencing-based methods, genetic-analysis has failed in the finding of causative-genes in ~50% of HSP patients, indicating a significant genetic heterogeneity in the disease and emphasizing that the majority of HSP-genes have remained unknown.</p><p id="Par3340"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> To identification of HSP-causing genes, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in 50 unrelated-Iranian probands. Candidate variants were confirmed and co-segregated in the family members.

Also, a novel candidate-gene that is exclusively expressed in the brain and directly involved in axonogenesis was identified. Given that the HSP is a length-dependent, “dying-back” axonopathy, the candidate-gene can be an important HSP-causative gene. The research presented the powers of WES for facilitating gene-discovery and identification of causative genes for diseases with genetic heterogeneity. The precise mechanisms underlying the HSP are unknown. Identification of novel genes and molecular-pathways will enhance our knowledge of the cellular pathways that are involved in the disease pathogenesis.</p><p id="Par3343"><bold>Grant-Reference:</bold>no.963846(NIMAD)</p><p id="Par3344"><bold>R.

Genetic studies in adult cohorts (e.g. UK Biobank) found multiple genes associated with HGS and showed a modest heritability (h<sup>2</sup>~24%). However, the genetics of HGS remains largely elusive and has never been explored in a cohort of young individuals.</p><p id="Par3348"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We performed GWAS analyses on three measures of HGS in the ALSPAC dataset (N~5,400, mean age = 11.8 years), namely HGS for the right and left hand and grip strength maximal, i.e. best result regardless of the hand used.

The CAPN3 c.1746-20C&gt;G variant has a population frequency of above &gt;1% and there is conflicting information regarding its pathogenicity in the literature. In approximately 2.000 exome sequenced patients included in the MYO-SEQ project we identified c.1746-20C&gt;G 26 times in heterozygosity and 1 time in homozygosity. We recruited further centres from Poland, Estonia, Latvia and UK. We identified the c.1746-20C&gt;G together with CAPN3 c.598_612del, c.550delA, p.Arg39Cys, p.Gly234Arg and other pathogenic heterozygous CAPN3 variants. One individual affected with LGMD was homozygous for c.1746-20C&gt;G. Most of the patients were of Polish or Eastern European origins. In all these cases there was reduced calpain3 expression on Western Blots and muscle MRI in available cases was suggestive for LGMD R1 calpain3-related. The phenotype of these patients was keeping up with mild calpainopathy with characteristic hypertrophies. Population studies suggest allele frequency of 0.017 in Poland and 0.015 in Estonia. No homozygous healthy individuals were identified so far in our populational studies and according to gnomAD there are 3 homozygous individuals (out of 282.874). In some populations the variant was rare or nearly absent. Functional studies are ongoing. Population frequency data suggest that c.1746-20C&gt;G may be a hypomorphic variant. Preliminary haplotype analysis of a patient homozygous for c.1746-20C&gt;G revealed a haplotype block, indicating this might be a founder allele in Polish population. CAPN3 c.1746-20C&gt;G variant may be often missed as many tests include only 10bp of flanking intronic region.</p><p id="Par3377"><bold>M. Mroczek:</bold> None. <bold>J. Hudson:</bold> None. <bold>A.

The aim of this study is to improve the genotypic features of muscular dystrophies other than Duchenne-Becker Muscular Dystrophy with novel mutations. Thirty-three patients who were suffering from muscular dystrophy were referred to our clinic. Sixteen patients were male and seventeen patients were female. Mean age was 22,06 years and mean age of disease onset was 11,48 years. Creatinine kinase levels were between 27.000 and 90 U/L(mean 2.964). Next-Generation Sequencing(NGS) panel which has 33 muscular dystrophy related genes were sequenced for all patients. Reported pathogenic mutations in fourteen patients and novel mutations in twelve patients were identified. One patient’s biopsy had shown megaconial changes, NGS panel revealed homozygous c.1031G&gt;A(p.Arg344Gln) known mutation in CHKB gene. Another mutation in CHKB gene which was novel homozygous c.1130G&gt;T(p.Arg377Leu) mutation was detected in eleven-year-old patient. Novel homozygous c.195+3A&gt;T mutation in SGCG gene was identified in patient whose biopsy showed pathogenic staining with gamma-sarcoglycan. In thirty-four-year-old patient and her sibling who had same clinic novel homozygous c.3666delA(p.Asp1223Thefs*24) mutation in DYSF gene were identified. In CAPN3 gene two novel homozygous mutations were detected, which were c.691T&gt;C(p.Phe231Leu) and c.632+2T&gt;G. In one patient, CNV analyses revealed SYNE2 gene exon 65-66 deletion. Homozygous SGCA c.850C&gt;T(p.Arg284Cys) mutation in two unrelated patients were detected, which indicates this mutation may have founder effect.

Here, next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to investigate genomic variants including copy number variants (CNV) to determine causative variants behind clinical presentations in patients. DNA samples were extracted from 309 patients with presentation of muscular dystrophy and congenital myopathy who were referred to our laboratory. NGS was performed to investigate genes associated with muscular disorders. NGS findings were validated using other molecular methods such as MLPA, QPCR, long PCR, and PCR-Sanger sequencing. In 275 out of 309 patients, variants with pathogenic or likely pathogenic classifications (88.9%) were detected. Based on genetic finding and other clinical and para-clinical data, diagnosis was confirmed in these 275 patients. Total number of known or novel detected pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants is 303 variants in 51 genes. The most frequent genes causing the disease in this study were DMD (68/309, 22%), LAMA2 (36/309, 11%), and SGCB (31/309, 10%). Moreover, the most common mutations detected in our patients were gross deletion/duplication variants in DMD gene, SGCB deletions and deletion of exon 7 in SMN1 gene. Detailed analysis of data will be presented in the meeting. In addition to obtaining valuable data regarding genetic epidemiology of hereditary muscular diseases in Iran, this study showed great value of NGS for defining causative variants in patients with muscular diseases. High frequency of CNVs detected as the causative variants in patients shows the necessity of developing efficient tools for CNV analysis on NGS data.</p><p id="Par3394"><bold>M.

The set included 271 clinical exomes, 176 WES, 16 WGS, and 374 custom panels of several types comprising in most cases &gt;2000 genes. After processing via an automated pipeline, the variants were uploaded into a custom database-driven software and assessed by clinical bioinformaticians, with subsequent review of the reports by medical geneticists, when possible. As a result, 336 patients (40%) had definitive molecular diagnostic findings explaining the phenotype (mostly mutations in <italic>LAMA2, CAPN3, DMD, RYR1, NEB, SEPN1, DYSF, CHRNE, TTN</italic>) and 123 patients (15%) had a possible diagnosis based on variants of unknown significance with a need for additional evidence.

Following the initial finding, we screened the respective genomic position in the remaining family members using Sanger sequencing.</p><p id="Par3417"><bold>Results:</bold> In the affected family members we identified a rare homozygous pathogenic variant c.92G&gt;C in the <italic>EXOSC3</italic> gene, causing an autosomal recessive PCH type 1B. Unaffected parents and four siblings are heterozygous carriers, one healthy sibling has a wild type genotype and three affected siblings were homozygous and died soon after birth (2-6 months of age). Two other siblings were not analyzed, however, one of them also died soon after birth and suffered most probably from the same disorder.</p><p id="Par3418"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We report detailed clinical findings of the largest PCH type 1B family published up to date, with four affected children. The causative variant was reported to be more frequent in the Roma population of the Czech Republic (considered a founder mutation). Based on the close connection of the populations of Slovakia and the Czech Republic, we hypothesize, these two alleles may have a common origin. Therefore, we are still investigating their haplotype background. Funding: APVV-18-0319; MZSR_2018/46-SAV-5; VEGA_2/0167/20.</p><p id="Par3419"><bold>Z. Kubiritova:</bold> None. <bold>E.

The assembly of myelinated fibres and nodes of Ranvier is mediated by a number of cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily including neurofascin, encoded by the NFASC gene, and its alternative isoforms Nfasc186, Nfasc140 and Nfasc155. We identified 10 individuals from six unrelated families, exhibiting a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized with a spectrum of central and peripheral neurological involvement, who were found by NGS to carry frameshift and non-synonymous variants. Expression studies using immunostaining-based techniques identified absent expression of the Nfasc155 isoform as a consequence of the frameshift variant and a significant reduction of expression was also observed in association with two non-synonymous variants affecting the fibronectin type III domain. Cell aggregation studies revealed a severely impaired Nfasc155-CNTN1/CASPR1 complex interaction as a result of the identified variants. Immunofluorescence staining of myelinated fibres from two affected individuals showed a severe loss of myelinated fibres and abnormalities in the paranodal junction morphology. Our results establish that recessive variants affecting the Nfasc155 isoform can affect the formation of paranodal axoglial junctions at the nodes of Ranvier. The genetic disease caused by biallelic NFASC variants includes neurodevelopmental impairment and a spectrum of central and peripheral demyelination as part of its core clinical phenotype. Our findings support possible overlapping molecular mechanisms of paranodal damage at peripheral nerves in both the immune-mediated and the genetic disease.

To date, 18 disease-causing genes have been identified, all encoding for proteins involved in the glycosylation of α-dystroglycan and thus affecting its binding to the extracellular matrix.</p><p id="Par3427"><bold>Methods:</bold> As part of the MYO-SEQ project, detailed clinical and histological information was collected for 1,803 patients with unexplained LGMW. Whole-exome sequencing was carried out and genes known to be associated with dystroglycanopathies were analysed to identify likely pathogenic variants.</p><p id="Par3428"><bold>Results:</bold> Suspected disease-causing variants in 8 genes were detected in 47 patients: <italic>DPM3</italic> and <italic>ISPD</italic> in one patient each, <italic>FKTN</italic>, <italic>POMK</italic> and POMT1 in two patients, <italic>GMPPB</italic> in four patients, <italic>POMT2</italic> in 14 patients and <italic>FKRP</italic> in 21 patients. The overall frequency for the disease group was 2.6%. The phenotypes were highly variable, generally presenting with progressive proximal muscle weakness and high CK, yet cognitive impairment was not always observed. Muscle biopsies were available for 21 cases; reported results of α-dystroglycan labelling were inconsistent, indicating that standardised immunohistochemical protocol and training in its interpretation are crucial. In addition, we looked at undiagnosed patients carrying two or more heterozygous pathogenic variants in two different dystroglycanopathy genes, however we did not find evidence of digenic inheritance in this pathway.</p><p id="Par3429"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Given their genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, here we highlight the advantage of using next-generation sequencing in combination with traditional histopathological analysis to improve the diagnosis of dystroglycanopathies as a rare disease group.</p><p id="Par3430"><bold>A.

Recently, biallelic pathogenic variants in PDXK were shown to cause axonal Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease with optic atrophy that responds to PLP supplementation.</p><p id="Par3434"><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed whole exome sequencing and segregation analysis using Sanger sequencing in order to uncover the pathogenic variant(s) in a family affected by an undiagnosed autosomal recessive peripheral neuropathy.

Of the 36 patients carrying a single heterozygous <italic>GAA</italic> variant, only one patient harboring a pathogenic heterozygous variant had low enzyme activity overlapping with levels seen in Pompe cases suggesting that a second variant could have been missed. RNA studies are pending. Finally, nine patients had low or borderline enzyme activity, but no variant was detected. These patients have a low risk of having Pompe disease since enzymatic activity is close to the threshold and does not overlap with confirmed Pompe cases. With gene panels being increasingly performed as a first-tier test for patients with suspected muscle disorders, our study emphasizes the need to perform reflex enzymatic activity in patients with a single <italic>GAA</italic> variant. RNA sequencing should be considered if it the enzymatic result is compatible with Pompe. <italic>*Supported by Sanofi-Genzyme</italic>.</p><p id="Par3470"><bold>F. Thuriot:</bold> None. <bold>K.

With massive parallel sequencing and a laboratory developed Mendeliome gene panel, we identified a truncation mutation in the <italic>PTRH2</italic> gene in two affected siblings. This multifunctional and evolutionary well conserved enzyme encodes the mitochondrial peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase 2 protein (Ptrh2), and prevents the accumulation of peptidyl-tRNA. It is also a key determinant in cell survival, growth and apoptosis processes. The precise role of the protein in muscle disease has still to be delineated. Our index patients are the 15- and 13-year-old son and daughter of non-consanguineous healthy Nepalese parents. Both patients had multiple neurological symptoms including sensorineural deafness, psychomotor and language delay, epilepsy and behavioral disturbances, subsequently motor regression with ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and later, in one of them, diabetes mellitus. In both patients, pancreatic echography disclosed hyper-echogenicity. A homozygous pathogenic 1 base pair insertion c.127dupA was revealed in the <italic>PTRH2</italic> gene of both siblings, and confirmed with Sanger sequencing. This frameshift causes a premature translation stop p.(Ser43Lysfs*11), and is present in heterozygosity in both parents. Originally, a homozygous deletion variant in the <italic>PTRH2</italic> gene was identified as the molecular cause of global developmental delay, hearing loss and ataxia. Since 2014, the identification of additional patients has documented a clinical heterogeneity, and expanded the clinical spectrum of pathogenic <italic>PTRH2</italic> variants.

Mutations in <italic>LPIN1</italic> lead to recurrent rhabdomyolysis with myoglobinuria, myalgia and generalized weakness in childhood. We investigated two independent cases with rhabdomyolysis. Patient 1 is a six-year-old Turkish boy with healthy consanguineous parents. His sister died of a respiratory infection at the age of 3. He showed massively increased creatinine kinase (CK) levels (up to 400.000 U/l) and myoglobinuria. Patient 2 is a German 36-year-old women with myalgia, increased CK values and a history of kidney failure after gastrointestinal infection in early childhood. The DNA was processed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) after enrichment of a custom-made myopathy panel (65 genes). Data analysis was done by GensearchNGS. Three different variants in <italic>LPIN1</italic> could be identified, a large recurrent deletion including exon 18, a nonsense variant and a single base pair duplication. Patient 1 carries the deletion and the duplication, each in homozygous state. The duplication has not been described before, is not present in gnomAD and leads to a frameshift with a premature stop codon at position 769. Patient 2 carries the same deletion of exon 18 and a known nonsense variant leading to a stop codon at position 19. The breaking points of the deletion could be identified exactly by NGS. Our findings revealed a novel and already known mutations in <italic>LPIN1</italic> and verified the breakpoints of the recurrent deletion.

Mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) 1 gene are responsible for the disease while the copy number of SMN2 modifies the patient’s phenotype. Both genes are located in a highly homologous, duplicated and inverted region on chromosome 5q. The majority of patients carry a homozygous deletion of SMN1 but 3-4% of patients are compound heterozygous for the deletion on one and single nucleotide variants (SNV) on the other allele. There are not more than five unique sequence differences between SMN1 and SMN2, only one of those, c.840C/T, in the coding sequence and the others in intronic or non-coding regions. When a patient suspected of having SMA carries a heterozygous deletion of SMN1, direct sequencing of the SMN1 gene to detect a second pathogenic SNV is necessary. Due to the nearly 100 % sequence identity it is almost impossible to distinguish SMN1 and SMN2 sequences with standard sequencing approaches and a SNV cannot be assigned unequivocally to one of the genes. Several sequencing strategies to overcome this problem have been introduced, all of them being rather laborious. We have established a long-range Nanopore sequencing protocol that allows unequivocal assignment of variants to SMN1 or SMN2, and thereby improves the diagnostics for the patient and genetic counselling for the family. In times of promising therapeutic approaches for SMA-5q, it is crucial to make a fast and unambiguous diagnosis of the disease.</p><p id="Par3498"><bold>K. Eggermann:</bold> None. <bold>T.

All types of SMA are caused by homozygous loss of the SMN1 gene, resulting in low levels of the survival motor neuron protein, insufficient to protect motor neurons. Homozygous deletions of exon 7 in SMN1 gene in clinically asymptomatic individuals are extremely rare, involving less than 30 described cases. These patients usually have several copies of the SMN2 gene, which compensates for the loss of SMN1 product.</p><p id="Par3515"><bold>Case presentation:</bold> An asymptomatic 31-years old woman was referred for pregestational genetic testing within the Israeli national genetic carrier-screening program for reproductive purposes.

Despite SMA is a classic monogenic disease, the clinical phenotype of patients varies from the most acute infantile type to a relatively mild chronic juvenile type. Some genetic modifiers of SMA are already known, such as a type of SMN1 mutation and SMN2 copy number variation. It was shown that the female SMA phenotype was significantly differing from the phenotype of the male patients. The aim of our investigation is to study an association of SMA phenotype with X-linked genetic and epigenetic factors.</p><p id="Par3550"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> The study groups consisted of female (<italic>n</italic> = 103) and male (<italic>n</italic> = 75) patients with determined SMN1 and SMN2 genotypes. The analysis of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) was done by methyl-specific CAG-genotyping of AR gene. The rs2070169 and rs4339766 of UBA1 were analyzed by RFLP-method. Spearman’s correlation, regression analysis and Mann-Whitney test were used for the statistical analysis.</p><p id="Par3551"><bold>Results:</bold> The correlation between the patients’ SMN1 and SMN2 genotypes and SMA phenotypes was stronger in the male group.

The disease presented as a slowly progressive neurogenic myopathy with an average age-of-onset of 32 years (range: 18-40) and a disease duration of &gt;45 years. No family members showed classical ALS or FTD pathology. Unlike previously described classical ALS-causing mutations in <italic>TARDBP</italic>, this mutation causes a frameshift that leads to an entirely novel C-terminus.

Several mechanisms were proposed as explanation of gender bias in autoimmune diseases, including skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI) and X chromosome dosage, sex hormones, and variants of genes involved in autoimmunity development. Normally, XCI is a biological event that occurs randomly, and females are thus functional mosaics for the X-linked genes. A skewed XCI pattern can lead to an unbalanced expression of certain X-linked alleles, for this reason it has been hypothesized that females may be more prone to certain diseases. Indeed, a high frequency of skewed XCI pattern has been observed in several autoimmune disorders characterized by female predominance. No data are yet available concerning myasthenia gravis, so that we investigated the XCI pattern in MG females with this autoimmune disease.</p><p id="Par3577"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> XCI analysis was performed on blood samples of 84 myasthenic women and 111 healthy age-matched female controls. XCI was analysed by human androgen receptor (HUMARA) assay.</p><p id="Par3578"><bold>Results:</bold> In 72 MG informative patients the frequency of skewed XCI pattern (≥75%) was 35,0 %, which was higher than in healthy controls (14,4%; <italic>p</italic> =0.002).

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is one of the most relevant phenotypes and previous studies have shown that copy number variants (CNVs) outside the 22q11.2 region could play a role in its variable expressivity. However, those described loci account for a small proportion of the variability. Therefore, CNV analysis in new cohorts from different ancestry-based population are a valuable resource to identify a wider range of modifiers.</p><p id="Par3598"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We performed SNP-array (CytoScanHD) in 77 Brazilian patients with 22q11.2DS (55 with CHD and 22 with normal cardiac phenotype). Genome-wide CNV analysis was performed by two algorithms (PennCNV and Rawcopy) and the overlapping CNVs were considered for downstream analysis. The CNVs content was annotated using AnnotSV and compared between patients with and without CHD using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA).</p><p id="Par3599"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 407 CNVs (308 deletions and 99 duplications).

AOS is considered to be a disorder of vasculogenesis; however, this remains to be determined. We have previously identified pathogenic mutations of the Rho GTPase regulators ARHGAP31 and DOCK6, implicating Rho dysregulation in AOS aetiology. Gain-of-function ARHGAP31 mutations and DOCK6 loss-of-function impact cytoskeletal dynamics through abnormal inactivation of Cdc42 and Rac1. Nonetheless, their role in human blood vessel formation requires further exploration.

The phenotypic spectrum of 15 previously reported cases range from mild-to-moderate intellectual deficit with microcephaly to a phenotype characterized by severe ventriculomegaly and/or brainstem dysgenesis with intrauterine or neonatal death. Only three children survived till childhood. We here report two new ALKKUCS cases from two unrelated consanguineous families. The first patient was presented with antenatal ultrasound findings of severe hydrocephaly, interhemispheric cyst, hydropic changes with cystic hygroma and joint contractures. Pedigree analysis showed two similarly affected siblings and four affected cousins. Postmortem examination was compatible with a lethal contracture phenotype. Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed a ‘likely pathogenic’ homozygous variant in the <italic>KIAA1109</italic> gene. The second patient was consulted at 9 years of age. She had a history of NICU care due to poor sucking/weak swallowing reflex and cardiac arrest in early neonatal period. Clinical findings included mild myopathy of the neck muscles, pes equinovarus, scapula alata and camptodactyly. Identification of a homozygous variant in the <italic>KIAA1109</italic> gene, segregating with the phenotype, made the diagnosis of ALKKUCS possible, placing the case to the mildest end of the phenotypic spectrum.

It typically presents in early childhood with global developmental delay, seizures and autistic-like behavior. Following an initial static phase, these symptoms progress to dystonia, parkinsonism and dementia in early adulthood. We report a case with a novel pathogenic variant in the WDR45 gene that exhibited an early progression of symptoms and severe scoliosis which, to our knowledge, has not been previously reported in BPAN.</p><p id="Par3616"><bold>Case report:</bold> A 10-year-old girl is the second child of healthy unrelated parents. At 14 months, developmental delay was noted. She had autistic-like behavior, didn’t walk until the age of 3-year and was mute. Seizures were never noticed but EEG was abnormal. Her condition was stable until the age of 7-year when her cognitive skills further declined. In that time, scoliosis was noted together with bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability. Scoliosis was severely progressive and needed surgical treatment. At the age of 9-year she lost the ability to walk. Whole exome sequencing revealed a novel heterozygous frameshift pathogenic variant in the WDR45 gene p.Pro237ArgfsTer7, verified by Sanger sequencing, that wasn’t present in either parent.

They can be either motile or immotile-sensory and play many distinct roles in human development. Defective cilia lead to a group of inherited, monogenic disorders referred as ciliopathies, including disorders such as Bardet-Biedl syndrome, polycystic kidney disease, Joubert syndrome, and nephronophthisis. Here, we present homozygous <italic>CC2D1A</italic> c.1186C&gt;T (p.Arg396*) variant identified in our proband with left renal cysts, autistic features and Mental Motor Retardation (MMR), his sibling has also austictic features, obesity and MMR, as a candidate ciliopathy gene. To analyze the effect of CC2D1A in ciliogenesis, we utilized the frog Xenopus and C.Elegans model systems. Xenopus tadpole epidermis harbor numerous multiciliated cells that generate head-to-tail polarized fluid flow. When we knocked down CC2D1A in frog Xenopus tropicalis using CRISPR/CAS9 system, and analyzed epidermal flow using Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging, we observed loss of epidermal flow in F0 mutant tadpoles. When we further examined the epidermal surface in these tadpoles using immunofluorescence, we detected the loss of multiciliated cells. In parallel, we also showed the loss of cilia in C. Elegans <italic>CC2D1A</italic> knock-out model utilizing the CRISPR/Cas9 system. Together, this work demonstrates that CC2D1A is required for proper ciliogenesis in multiciliated cells, providing a plausible mechanism for its role in our patient phenotype. &lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;</p><p id="Par3622"><bold>I.

Moreover, in patients presenting classical and non-classical features of cohesinopathies were identified pathogenic variations in key chromatin-associated factors, genetically different from cohesin, but with overlapping functions, such as transcriptional regulation, chromatin remodeling and epigenetic modifications; these conditions could be considered part of a larger disease family categorized as “chromatinopathies”.</p><p id="Par3642"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Between 2017 and 2018, 40 cohesinopathies/chromatinopathies patients carrying heterozygous pathogenic variants have been diagnosed at the Bambino Gesù Children Hospital, with initial clinical hypothesis of KBG syndrome, CHARGE association, Kabuki syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome and Coffin-Siris syndrome.

Ciliary dysfunction leads to rare recessive multiorgan disorders, collectively termed ciliopathies, which have overlapping genotype-phenotype correlations, making accurate diagnosis challenging. Our aim is to develop a novel cell-based functional assay to improve accurate diagnosis of ciliopathies on the basis of the underlying mechanism of disease.</p><p id="Par3660"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Skin-fibroblasts from 10 ciliopathy patients (from 3 different subgroups) and 8 controls were cultured in vitro and immunofluorescence was applied to determine cilium phenotype parameters; 1) ciliogenesis, based on presence or absence of cilium markers, 2) cilium length, measured by the combined signal of an axonemal and a cilium membrane marker, and 3) intraflagellar transport (IFT), quantified by the area of the ciliary tip using the IFT88 signal.</p><p id="Par3661"><bold>Results:</bold> Cilium phenotypic data from skin-fibroblasts of eight controls yielded comparable and reproducible results: 88% cells were ciliated, the cilium length was 3.30 ± 0.251µm, and the IFT88 ciliary tip area was 0.13 ± 0.02µm<sup>2</sup>. Analysis of the cilium phenotype in the 10 patients for three clinical subgroups not only showed significant differences in cilium length and IFT results, but also allowed to distinguish the three ciliopathy subgroups from one another.</p><p id="Par3662"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In summary, standardized analysis of the cilium phenotype can lead to identifiable clusters for different ciliopathies. Therefore, we believe that standardized tests based on cilium phenotypic data can provide additional proof for conclusive diagnosis of ciliopathies, which is essential in routine diagnostic care.</p><p id="Par3663"><bold>M.M.

Three cases (3/26, 11.5%) had two diseases, and 3 further could potentially be double diagnoses. A mosaic chr 9 trisomy (not previously identified by array-CGH) and a mat-UPD1 were also identified. In 21/26 (81%) the disease was associated with a de novo, highlighting the importance of trio analysis; in 1 patient the disease was inherited from the affected mother (<italic>ANKRD11</italic>, KBG syndrome). One or more VUSs were found in 5/43 (11.5%) patients. SNVs were in the coding region/nearby intron suggesting our high diagnostic rate may be related to a more complete coverage of WGS versus exome, and/or our intertwined bioinformatics and clinical prioritization of variants. The diagnosis changed the management of all positive cases, including referral to palliative cures (<italic>RRM2B</italic>; mtDNA depletion syndrome), referral for a specific follow-up, or cancer surveillance program (<italic>ASXL1</italic>). We provided a correct recurrence risk for future pregnancies for parents, including a consanguineous couple with a de novo causative variant in their child.

Clinical heterogeneity is illustrated by variable severity and atypical cases overlapping with some other syndromes. Mutations in 6 genes from the cohesin complex can cause CdLS: <italic>NIPBL</italic>, <italic>SMC1A</italic>, <italic>HDAC8</italic>, <italic>SMC3</italic>, <italic>RAD21</italic> and <italic>BRD4</italic>. We present results from a retrospective study of 202 cases referred between 2011 and 2019.</p><p id="Par3679"><bold>Methods:</bold> Clinical data were reviewed by an expert clinician before molecular testing. Phenotypes were classified as typical/mild/atypical CdLS or another diagnosis. We applied a clinical score for all suspected CdLS cases, and compared values per molecular outcome and phenotype. A gene panel sequencing assessed 5/6 CdLS and 17 differential diagnoses genes (~700x depth of coverage on average).</p><p id="Par3680"><bold>Results:</bold> Differential diagnoses were suspected for 23 individuals. CdLS was suspected for 179 individuals: 66 typical, 40 mild and 73 atypical. Molecular testing identified a (likely) pathogenic variant for 47/66 typical (71%), 18/40 mild (45%), and 14/73 atypical (19%) individuals confirming CdLS for 73 of them. A differential diagnosis was identified for 6 atypical individuals. We identified 11 mosaic mutations with variable phenotypes; 9 were detected in saliva and were undetectable in blood. Clinical scores were significantly higher for typical individuals and for pathogenic variants carriers.</p><p id="Par3681"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Applying deep gene panel sequencing from other tissues than blood is an effective strategy for typical CdLS given the number of mosaics, while atypical phenotypes could be resolved by first-tier exome/genome sequencing.</p><p id="Par3682"><bold>G.

By whole exome sequencing we identified a novel homozygous variant in exon 8 of <italic>TUBGCP2</italic>(NM_001256617.1:c.1015G&gt;A, p.Glu339Lys), which encodes γ-TuRC component GCP2 protein, in two siblings (10 yo female and 8 yo male) from a consanguineous Turkish family. Although <italic>TUBGCP2</italic> mutations were recently reported in families with developmental delay, dysmorphic features, hypotonia, epilepsy, microcephaly and lissencephaly spectrum changes, we for the first time investigated the cellular defects caused by GCP2 mutations in patient fibroblasts by immunocytochemical, proteomic and <italic>in silico</italic> analyses. We studied the localization of some γ-TuRC components and associated proteins in control and patient fibroblasts in interphase and in mitosis by immunofluorescence, and the levels of the GCP2 protein along the cell cycle. Our data suggested that the localization of γ-TuRC complex was perturbed in mitosis but not in interphase. Label-free LC-MS/MS analysis of patient-derived fibroblasts identified 26 upregulated and 24 down-regulated proteins, which were enriched for tubulin and cytoskeletal proteins that play role in neurodevelopment. In summary, we describe two siblings carrying a novel homozygous TUBGCP2 variant with dysmorphic signs, severe developmental delay and epilepsy, and show that, in addition to a neuronal migration defect, brainstem atrophy and disturbed myelination are also associated with TUBGCP2 mutations, explaining the variable clinical and imaging findings. *TUBITAK research grant 216S771, Newton Fund (UK/Turkey, MR/N027302/1), AFM #21644.</p><p id="Par3699"><bold>Y.

Our aim was to investigate the clinical and genetic aspects for the patients recorded with craniosynostosis in the files of the Iasi Regional Medical Genetics Center for the last 15 years. For each case we have studied clinical features to highlight the evocative signs for diagnosis and to establish the correlation with the laboratory results. In all patients we applied imagistic investigations (RX or CT) that was concordant with craniosynostosis types. We identified 99 patients suspected for craniosynostosis. From these, 84 presented an isolated form of craniosynostosis, while 15 patients had a syndromic form (Apert, Saethre-Chotzen, Crouzon, Carpenter syndromes). We investigated 15 patients with syndromic forms of craniosynostosis by MLPA analysis using kit P064 and P080 (MRC Holland®). We identified the mutation in <italic>TWIST1</italic> gene associated with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome in 4 patients. Another mutation was detected in <italic>FGFR2</italic> gene, being discovered in a case of Apert syndrome. In familial cases we accorded genetic counselling in concordance with results of molecular analyses and we discussed the possibility of surgical therapy. Our cases illustrate the genetic heterogeneity among cranyosinostosis syndromes. Molecular diagnosis is very important for an adequate genetic counseling and guidance for patients with syndromic craniosynostosis.</p><p id="Par3703"><bold>M. Danila:</bold> None. <bold>M.

The clinical features included facial characteristics of individuals of MKHK1 are developmental delay or intellectual disability, short stature, microcephaly, short palpebral fissures, telecanthus, depressed nasal bridge, short nose, anteverted nares, short columella, and long philtrum. Although both syndromes have variants in the same gene, <italic>CREBBP</italic>, the phenotype of individuals with MKHK1 are differed substantially from phenotype of RSTS1[Menke et al., 2016; Menke et al., 2018].

MFDM is characterised by first and second pharyngeal arch anomalies, hearing loss, microcephaly, developmental delay, intellectual impairment, dysmorphism and systemic malformations.

These episignatures can be used to diagnose patients with such syndromes. We have recently implemented genome wide methylation profiling as a diagnostic test in our laboratory. This test, named EpiSign(v1), is able to recognize 22 syndromes, 14 of which are syndromes with specific episignatures, (for example for Kabuki syndrome, BAFopathies and Cornelia de Lange syndrome), 6 are imprinting disorders and 2 are repeat expansion disorders. Validation of the test was based on 38 positive samples (with known pathogenic variant) and 24 negative controls. All samples were called correctly provided that the DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and there was no low mosaicism for the pathogenic variant. Reasons for requesting an EpiSign clinical test were: the presence of a variant of unknown clinical significance, clinical diagnosis without molecular confirmation, or as a test complementary to WES/WGS, without a prior (suspected) diagnosis. In approximately 40% of cases with a suspected (VUS present) or clinical diagnosis, EpiSign was able to confirm this diagnosis. This shows that EpiSign is a powerful new diagnostic tool, in particular for patients for whom conventional genetic testing was inconclusive. In March 2020 an updated version of EpiSign will be available (EpiSignv2), allowing diagnosis of an additional 23 syndromes (45 in total).

A 4-months-old male was referred to our genetic laboratory because of respiratory distress, hypotonia and small hands, camptodactyly of the third and fourth fingers. And the other sibling of the family died after 90 days of aggravated apnea. Whole exome sequencing (WES) performed on DNBSEQ-G400 sequencer and Sanger sequencing were used to validate the findings. WES was revealed a novel truncating pathogenic variant in MAGEL2 gene inherited from the unaffected father and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. We report 2 newborns affected with SYS in one family with severe respiratory distress one of them died.

JS is related to dysfunction of the primary cilium and, up to now, about 40 causative genes are known, overall responsible for about 60% cases. Over 15 years, we recruited 595 JS families (mostly Italian), of whom 507 underwent genetic screening either by Sanger sequencing of selected JS genes, targeted sequencing or WES. With these strategies, we identified biallelic pathogenic variants in 284 probands (56%). Six major genes accounted for two-thirds of mutated cases (CEP290 14.8%; CPLANE1 14.4%; CC2D2A 12.3%; TMEM67 10.9%; AHI1 9.5%; KIAA0586 5.3%). Additional 86 probands (17%) carried a single pathogenetic variant in a JS gene: to date, 42 of them underwent high-resolution custom array, which disclosed large heterozygous deletions in 5 probands (1 AHI1, 2 CPLANE1, 2 KIAA0586). Array-negative single heterozygous carriers are currently undergoing RNA analysis to investigate the presence of cryptic variants affecting splicing. In 137 probands, no pathogenic variants were identified. Yet, most of them have been tested only for a subset of known genes, and WES is in progress. Clinical evaluation of JS-mutated cases confirmed strong gene-phenotype correlates for some major genes (CEP290 with JS+retina+kidney; CPLANE1 with pure JS or OFDVI syndrome; TMEM67 with JS+liver; AHI1 with JS+retina), while no obvious correlates emerge for CC2D2A and KIAA0586. These findings have major implications for prognosis and counselling of JS families.</p><p id="Par3770"><bold>V. Serpieri:</bold> None. <bold>S. Nuovo:</bold> None. <bold>A.

LP can be associated with several systemic disorders such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, etc. We here present a 2-generation family with six affected members with LP, nail dystrophy and in two of them, carcinoma of the tongue and other localizations, with several members of the families developing cancer. Clinical features segregates along the family, suggesting an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Thus, whole exome sequencing was performed in all available members of the family (including healthy and affected members), allowing to identify a heterozygous missense variant in <italic>KLHL11</italic> that segregates with the phenotype. This variant is not present in the control population databases. In addition, there is no disease associated with <italic>KLHL11</italic> yet.KLHL11 belongs to the KELCH superfamily -42 genes described -, and encoded for a protein that have a BTB/POZ, BACK five KELCH domains.

This was assisted by Face2Gene phenotype matching and confirmed by elevated ALP. Whole exome sequencing detected a homozygous candidate variant (<italic>PGAP3:</italic>c.557G&gt;C, p.Arg186Thr). A case series was assembled by retrospective and prospective case finding at three South African sites using database searches, Face2Gene phenotype matching, and/or ALP levels and Sanger sequencing for the candidate variant.</p><p id="Par3797"><bold>Results:</bold> Nine clinical cases were identified and Sanger sequencing could be performed on 7, all proved homozygous for the candidate variant. The likely pathogenic variant is absent from population databases, affects a highly conserved amino acid and is predicted damaging/deleterious. Observed clinical features in all included severe intellectual disability, absent speech, hypotonia and cleft palate in (5/9) (56%). ALP levels were significantly raised. Most discriminating facial features include hypertelorism, long palpebral fissures, broad nasal tip and tented upper lip.</p><p id="Par3798"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A previously undiagnosed syndrome was identified in an indigenous South African population, with computer-assisted syndromology being instrumental.

Rho-GEFs accelerate the exchange activity of Rho GTPases and thereby regulate several growth related processes. MCF2L interacts with RAC1 via its plekstrin homology domain, and thereby in turn activates RHOA. RAC1 activating mutations have been associated with megalencephaly and RHOA mosaic postzygotic inactivating variants have been recently associated with a neuroectodermal syndrome with asymptomatic leukoencephalopathy, microphthalmia or other ocular, dental and skeletal anomalies.

Following our recent pilot of 30 families (PMID:31625567), we have now sequenced the whole genomes of a further 336 individuals (including 115 patients) from 87 families with various conditions, including: Autism (<italic>n</italic> = 23), neurodevelopmental and neuromuscular (<italic>n</italic> = 16), metabolic and endocrine (<italic>n</italic> = 14), craniofacial (<italic>n</italic> = 10), sensory (<italic>n</italic> = 7), immune (<italic>n</italic> = 7) and other (<italic>n</italic> = 10) disorders. We identified novel causative mutations in known disease genes in 34 families (40.2%), including 29 SNVs/indels and 5 structural variants. Notably, we discovered a complex rearrangement (tandem duplication and deletion) affecting exons 1-6 of <italic>IRF6</italic> in three siblings with Popliteal pterygium syndrome, confirmed by de novo local re-assembly of WGS reads and PCR. For another 15 families, we identified putatively damaging variants in novel candidate genes, e.g. a missense variant in the <italic>CPSG4</italic> shared by two siblings with severe hypotonia, dysmorphic features and myoclonic encephalopathy with seizures. Homozygous zebrafish we generated by CRISPR displayed highly similar phenotypes, prompting deeper functional studies to elucidate gene mechanism.

The charts for males and females aged from 0 to 16 years were constructed using a total of 2,865 measurements of 99 MWS patients, of different ancestries. The data were collected through collaboration with the Italian MWS association (AIMW) and the MWS Foundation. To model the growth charts, the GAMLSS package for the R statistical program was used. Height, weight, body mass index (BMI) and occipito-frontal circumference (OFC) were compared to healthy children using CDC growth charts. In newborns, weight and length were distributed as in the general population, while head circumference was slighlty smaller. Weight and height distribution was slightly shifted to lower values than the general population until the age of 7, when the difference increased. BMI distribution was almost similar to that of the non- affected children until the age of 7, then values in the general population increase rapidly and in MWS children increase with a less steep slope. Microcephaly develops gradually in infancy, not all children were microcephalic and the head circumference was often between the 3<sup>rd</sup> and the 10<sup>th</sup> centile. These charts contribute to the understanding of the natural history of MWS and should assist pediatricians and other caregivers in providing optimal care to MWS individuals with problems related to physical growth.

A heterozygous de novo c.770C&gt;T p.Ser257Leu variant in <italic>RAF1</italic> (NM_002880), typically associated with severe HCM and pulmonary hypertension, confirmed the clinical diagnosis. She developed severe congestive heart failure (CHF) requiring amine administration and mechanical ventilation. Given the near-terminal CHF, Trametinib - a selective inhibitor of MEK1/2 approved for the treatment of cancers with RAS/MAPK hypersignaling - was introduced (0.022 mg/kg/day). There was prompt improvement in clinical condition, allowing inotropes and mechanical ventilation withdrawal; consistent with HCM stabilization, nt-pro-BNP decreased from 30,805 to 2,355 pg/ml. During the next month, treatment was continued without side effects, allowing a progressive reduction of respiratory support. Cardiac ultrasound showed a tendency to HCM improvement but revealed the sudden appearance of pulmonary artery dilation. At 3 months of age, she underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt device placement for post haemorrhagic hydrocephalus: after surgery she showed a rapidly worsening of CHF and died at 3½ months of age from untreatable CHF. Autopsy showed an obstructive HCM, severe dilation of pulmonary artery trunk and branches with complete disarray of both gross and fine pulmonary vascular anatomy. Whole RNA sequencing from white blood cells before and during treatment was performed to define transcriptional effects of MEK inhibition.</p><p id="Par3851"><bold>A. Mussa:</bold> None. <bold>D.

Patients with NS might have cognitive problems in language skills, memory, attention, executive functioning and decreased overall intelligence level. The resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analysis could be particularly useful for characterizing functional brain network differences in populations with intellectual disabilities.</p><p id="Par3855"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> According to our knowledge this is first study on functional connectivity in Noonan syndrome. 28 subjects with Noonan syndrome and 23 healthy took part in rs-fMRI data acquisition using a 3 T Siemens PRISMA scanner. All subsequent analysis of rs-fMRI findings was performed in CONN-fMRI Functional Connectivity (FC) toolbox ver. 18b. We tested for group differences in between- and within-network rsFC connectivity for key seeds of salience and default mode network. In addition,, subjects underwent a complex assessment of cognitive abilities with the use of Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales.</p><p id="Par3856"><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, both hypo- and hyper- connectivity within salience and DMN networks were revealed in subjects with Noonan syndrome. For example, patients exhibit increased connectivity between DMN network MPFC seed and superior frontal gyrus bilaterally and PCC and cerebellum.

Noonan syndrome is the most common entity among this group of disorders and is characterized by heart defects, short stature, variable developmental delay and typical facial features. Pathogenic variants in <italic>SOS2</italic>, encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RAS, have recently been identified in patients with Noonan syndrome. The number of published cases with pathogenic <italic>SOS2</italic> variants is still limited and little is known about genotype-phenotype correlation.</p><p id="Par3863"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We collected clinical and genotype data from 17 previously unpublished individuals carrying a disease-causing <italic>SOS2</italic> variant. Results: Most individuals had one of the previously reported pathogenic variants; only three had novel changes at the established mutation hotspots, which were classified as likely pathogenic. The phenotype of the 17 patients fits well into the spectrum of Noonan syndrome and is most similar to the phenotype observed in patients with <italic>SOS1</italic>-related Noonan syndrome, with ectodermal anomalies as common and short stature and learning disabilities as infrequent findings. The spectrum of heart defects in <italic>SOS2</italic>-related Noonan syndrome was consistent with the known spectrum of cardiac anomalies in RASopathies, but no specific heart defect was particularly predominating. Notably, lymphatic anomalies were extraordinarily frequent in our cohort, affecting more than half of the patients.</p><p id="Par3864"><bold>Conclusions:</bold><italic>SOS2</italic>-related Noonan syndrome is phenotypically similar to <italic>SOS1</italic>-related Noonan syndrome and associated with a particularly high risk of lymphatic complications that may have a significant impact on morbidity and quality of life.</p><p id="Par3865"><bold>C.

Previous research has demonstrated that unaffected relatives of patients with non-syndromic cleft lip with/without cleft palate (NSCL/P) show distinctive facial features, which can be considered an endophenotype. The presence of this facial endophenotype is potentially an expression of underlying genetic susceptibility to NSCL/P. To investigate this, we applied partial least squares regression (PLSR) to define a set of endophenotypic traits in a dataset of 3D facial images from 264 unaffected parents of patients with NSCL/P and 3,171 controls. The PLSR provides a <italic>p</italic>-value and direction of effect (or trait) for each endophenotype. We observed nominally significant (p &lt; 0.05) differences between parents and controls involving 59 endophenotypic traits. Next, we quantified these discovered endophenotypic traits in another dataset of 8,246 unaffected European individuals and then subjected these traits to GWAS. We identified 29 independent lead SNPs that were associated with at least one of the tested endophenotypic risk phenotypes at the genome-wide level (p &lt; 5e-8). Of the 29 lead SNPs, 22 are in the proximity of SNPs previously associated with normal facial variation and 15 are near genes that show evidence of roles in orofacial clefting. This study supports the existence of an overlap between the genetic pathways involved in normal facial development and orofacial clefting.</p><p id="Par3869"><bold>Grants: National Institutes of Health (1-RO1-DE027023), the Research Fund KU Leuven (BOF-C1, C14/15/081) and the Research Program of the The Research Foundation-Flanders (Belgium) (FWO, G078518N)</bold></p><p id="Par3870"><bold>K.

Mutations in several components and regulators of this pathway have been identified as pathogenetic cause. In 2015, missense variants in <italic>A2ML1</italic> were reported in three unrelated families with clinically suspected Noonan syndrome (NS). Two subsequent publications reported three additional <italic>A2ML1</italic> variants in NS patients. However, an association of <italic>A2ML1</italic> variants with NS has not been replicated since.

We report on a four-month-old girl with facial dysmorphism. Physical and motoric development was normal. Karyotype analysis presented mosaicism, showing one partially deleted chromosome 4 in all analysed cells and an additional ring chromosome of unknown origin in only part of the cells. Array CGH detected different gains 4p15.33p15.31, 4p15.1p12 and 4p12q12 and one deletion in 4q13.3q22.1. Two gains showed mosaicism of 76%. The deletion was detected in a mosaic level of 35%. Therefore, we suggested that the additional ring chromosome consisted of the detected aberrations showing mosaicism. To prove this presumption, we performed FISH. The results confirmed our hypothesis concerning the ring chromosome and surprisingly identified an insertion of material of chromosome 4 in the short arm of one chromosome 3 in all of the analysed metaphase spreads. In relation to the array result, this insertion might represent the gain of 4p15.33p15.31, detected without mosaicism. As well as for the gains as for the deletion, different severe clinical effects were described including developmental delay, behavioural problems, epileptic seizures and facial dysmorphisms. The clinical features could differ due to size of the copy number changes as well as to mosaic level and distribution in different tissues. Our results suggest that the mosaicism of the 4q deletion could explain the mild clinical features of the little girl.

RSTS is often diagnosed at birth or during early childhood but generally not suspected during antenatal period. We report nine cases of well-documented fetal RSTS. Two cases were examined after death in utero at 18 and 35 weeks of gestation and seven cases after identification of ultrasound abnormalities and termination of pregnancy. On prenatal sonography, a large gallbladder was detected in two cases, and brain malformations were noted in four cases, especially cerebellar hypoplasia. However, the diagnosis of RSTS has not been suggested during pregnancy. Fetal autopsy showed that all fetuses had large thumbs and/or suggestive facial dysmorphism. A <italic>CREBBP</italic> gene anomaly was identified in all cases. Alterations were similar to those found in typical RSTS children.

Nonsense variants and whole gene deletions cause intellectual disability with marked speech delay, seizures and facial dysmorphisms.

The molecular mechanisms underlying SRS are highly heterogeneous, including (epi)genetic deregulation at multiple loci. Over 50% of SRS show loss of methylation (LOM) at the paternal H19/IGF2:IG-DMR (chr11p15.5), about 10% maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (UPD(7)mat), while pathogenic CNVs, 14q32 abnormalities, rare CDKN1C and IGF2 mutations, UPD(16)mat and UPD(20)mat have been reported in a minority of cases. Our study was aimed to evaluate the frequency of the rarest known molecular defects in a cohort of SRS patients with a NH-CSS≥3. Within a selected cohort of 176 SRS, 55 patients had LoM at <italic>H19/IGF2:IG-DMR</italic> (31.3%) and 17 cases showed UPD(7)mat (9.7%). Further investigations on the 104 remaining patients identified 3 cases sharing UPD20mat (1,7%), the most frequent out of the rare alterations. The patients, with a clinical score &gt;3, shared prominent forehead, feeding difficulties and postnatal growth delay, while one case had relative macrocephaly, and another body asymmetry. Interestingly maternal age in these three UPD(20)mat cases is &gt;40 years and literature survey pointed out on a total of 16 cases a mean of 38 years, likely due to its origin by trisomy rescue. Our study identifies UPD(20)mat as a subclass among patients with NH-CSS≥3 and elevated maternal age suggesting to introduce this pathomechanism in the SRS diagnostic flow-chart.</p><p id="Par3914"><bold>S.

The so far known Double Strand Break Repair (DSBR) associated inherited genetic disorders share cancer predisposition, immunodeficiency, neurological disease and aplastic anemia as main clinical phenotypes. Here we present two patients with the shared clinical symptoms of severe intrauterine growth restriction, short stature, hypotonia, respiratory insufficiency and dysmorphic features. Chromosomal analysis for both patients revealed increased amount of numerical and structural chromosome aberrations, indicative for a genetic instability syndrome. Whole exome sequencing analysis revealed novel homozygous loss of function variants in <italic>SLF2</italic> [p.(Arg190*) and p.(Asp783Serfs*53)]. SLF2 (SMC5-SMC6 complex localization factor 2) plays a role in the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway by regulating post-replication repair of UV-damaged DNA and genomic stability maintenance. The SLF1-SLF2 complex acts to link RAD18 with the SMC5-SMC6 complex at replication-coupled interstrand cross-links (ICL) and DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) sites on chromatin during DNA repair. To the best of our knowledge we are presenting here the first human phenotype of a chromosome instability syndrome in association with <italic>SLF2</italic>.

This feature allows to specifically distinguish SNF from Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), and Multiple Neurofibromas Few Spinal Root (MNFSR), presenting single/few isolated spinal neurofibromas. While the clinical phenotype of SNF, MNSFR and classical NF1 can be revealed by spinal MRI, little is known on the molecular basis underlying these conditions. We investigated 12 NF1 families with at least one SNF patient, 15 sporadic SNF/MNSFR patients, diagnosed by Spinal MRI. We applied Targeted NGS using a panel consisting of 139 genes encoding RAS pathway effectors, neurofibromin interactors and genes mapping at 17q11.2 region. On identified 26 NF1 variants, 36,6% were missense mutations, indicating an increased prevalence in our cohort versus 27,7% missense/nonsense mutations reported in Italian (PMID: 26740943) and in a British (PMID:28637487) NF1 population. Furthermore, we evaluated rare variants with damaging predictors in genes of RAS pathway and neurofibromin interactors. In more than one sporadic case possible pathogenic variants were found in LIMK2, RASAL1, RASAL3, SOS1, A2ML1, MAP3K1, while in more than one SNF family were detected RASAL1, RASAL3, MAP3K1 genes variations. Our results confirm the high frequency of missense mutations in SNF as reported (PMID: 26740943, PMID:25211147), indicating neurofibromin gain-of-function variants as associated to SNF. In some patients, the co-occurrence of potential pathogenic variants in NF1 related genes are detected with severe phenotypes, suggesting that they might be modifier genes and promising pharmacological targets.

His critical events were poorly controlled by antiepileptic multi-drug therapy. His phenotype with some facial features (thick eyebrows, epicanthus, long filtering, thin upper lip), growth and psychomotor development delay, renal ectopia, complete hip dislocation, thin corpus callosum with scarcity of white matter, did not suggest any specific condition. Karyotype and CGH-array analysis were normal. Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed a heterozygous frameshift variant in <italic>KMT2A</italic>, resulting in a premature stop codon. Variants in <italic>KMT2A</italic> have been already described in patients with Wiedeman-Steiner Syndrome (WSS). This gene encodes a histone methyltransferase involved in the regulation of chromatin-mediated transcription and it is widely expressed in most human tissues. The majority of WSS-associated variants reported so far are de novo loss-of-function, predicted to result in premature termination of translation and nonsense-mediated decay of the corresponding transcripts. WSS is a rare autosomal dominant disorder, characterized by short stature, developmental delay and intellectual disability, hypertrichosis (cubiti-hairy elbow-or generalized) and facial dysmorphism. Concerning the incidence of bone anomalies, to date trigonocephaly (a feature at our first evaluation) has been reported only in one case, while craniovertebral junction anomalies have been described in two other patients; both of these signs were not included in the features associated with WSS. Further data will be needed to evaluate the exact incidence of these features in subjects with WSS associated with haploinsufficiency of a gene involved in histone-mediated chromatin remodeling.</p><p id="Par3941"><bold>E.

Copy number variants (CNV) involving the X chromosome has been previously described, mainly deletions (e.g. Leri-Weill dyschondrostsosis). However, little is known about phenotypes arising from duplications. In this study, we reviewed CNVs involving the short arm of the X chromosome, specifically duplications involving band P22.

Our recent integrative analysis of GWAS and GTEx eQTL data showed that the risk allele of the sentinel SNP (rs147462972) at the genome-wide significant locus 5p15 is associated with increased <italic>SLC9A3</italic> expression in esophageal mucosa tissue. Interestingly, upregulation of this gene has been linked to gastro-esophageal reflux disorder, a major risk factor for BE development. Therefore, we hypothesize that rs147462972 maps to a regulatory element influencing <italic>SLC9A3</italic> expression. To study the regulatory mechanisms at 5p15, chromatin interactions are analyzed using circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) technology from two distinct viewpoints, the promoter of <italic>SLC9A3</italic> and the region around rs147462972. The method was first established in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), where numerous interactions at the locus and beyond were observed.

New RE insertion can lead to exon deletion, exon disruption and alternative splicing, including formation of RE-containing exon. Most tumor-related insertions are individual-specific owing to germline or somatic retroposition events. Here we investigate exonic polymorphic RE insertions (PREI) distributed in population.</p><p id="Par3964"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> Two cohorts of 200 healthy donors and 120 pediatric lymphoblastic leukemia patients were used for this study. Whole genome identification of RE insertions was conducted using target high-throughput sequencing of genome fragments adjusted to insertions of active RE. Novel detected PREIs were validated using capillary sequencing. PREI allele status in donors was identified using locus-specific PCR.</p><p id="Par3965"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified five exonic PREIs among all detected polymorphic insertions. Frequency of bi-allelic PREI (AluYa5) in PRAMEF4 gene exon was significantly higher in healthy female cohort compared to healthy males (<italic>p</italic>-value=0.05, two-tailed Fisher’s exact test) and in T-lineage leukemia male cohort compared to healthy male donors (<italic>p</italic>-value=0.01).

Internal tandem duplication mutations in the FLT3 tyrosine kinase receptor (FLT3-ITD) account for up to 30% of cases and are associated with a poor outcome. To understand the role of FLT3-ITD in the development of drug resistance. An ara-C resistant cell line (MV-4-11-CR) was established from parent MV-4-11 cells which harbors FLT3-ITD. Here, we compared MV-4-11-CR with MV-4-11 cells, and explored the underling mechanisms for developing resistance in FLT3-ITD AML cells.</p><p id="Par3978"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> MV-4-11-CR and MV-4-11 cells were performed tests including MTT assay, RTqPCR, Western blot, G-banding and SKY.</p><p id="Par3979"><bold>Results:</bold> MV-4-11-CR cells were highly resistant to ara-C by their high IC50 value, and enhanced cell growth rate. This cell line was confirmed to retain the homologous FLT3-ITD mutations. However, a significant increase of FLT3-ITD mRNA and protein was observed. To test whether FLT3-ITD activation is crucial for resistance, we measured the effects of combined treatment of cells with ara-C and FLT3 inhibitors. Inhibition of FLT3 was notably effective in cell viability, but not effective in drug sensitivity. We further compared genomic alterations and found multiple chromosomal changes and complex karyotypes. Moreover, down-regulation of deoxycytidine kinase (DCK), a cytarabine metabolic enzyme, was observed in MV-4-11-CR.</p><p id="Par3980"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We suggest that gain the resistance to ara-C may be associated with chromosomal aberrations and DCK deficiency in FLT3-ITD+ AML cells.</p><p id="Par3981"><bold>P.

The turnaround time for karyotype analysis is up to two weeks, due to the indispensable cultivation of hematopoietic cells. Although initial PCR or FISH-based testing for recurrent structural variations (SV) can be carried out within few hours, the AML classification is demanding and requires accurate karyotyping.</p><p id="Par3985"><bold>Methods:</bold> We utilized nanopore-sequencing to overcome the time-consuming karyotyping and further increase resolution and accelerate SV analysis for AML classification. In detail, low-coverage whole genome sequencing (LC-WGS) was carried out in combination with a modified SMURFseq protocol on AML bone marrow or blood samples (≥20% blasts). LC-WGS data was used to identify classification-relevant SV in AML. Genome-wide CNV analysis was done from SMURFSeq data.</p><p id="Par3986"><bold>Results:</bold> For all 16 samples the results from nanopore-sequencing confirmed the SV identified by conventional cytogenetic and FISH analyses. Translocations, inversions, tandem duplications and CNVs were identified at single base resolution. We could detect additional small CNVs in growth regulating genes which may modify the aggressiveness of the leukemia. Moreover, the procedure from DNA isolation to obtaining results requires less than 48h and is not operator dependent. The method can also generate karyotype data from samples for which the cell cultivation failed.</p><p id="Par3987"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We show that nanopore-sequencing can speed-up and potentially improve the comprehensive analysis of SV in AML. Rapid classification according to ELN risk stratification will immediately impact on targeted and risk adapted treatment of AML patients.</p><p id="Par3988"><bold>F. Kraft:</bold> None. <bold>P.

With the aim of improving and standardizing variant classification, we’ll create a national registry of genetic variants in cancer predisposing-genes. To that end, seven Spanish molecular laboratory groups currently using NGS panels for hereditary cancer diagnostics created a variant database. Our current database gathers all variants with less than 1% allele frequency in all GnomAD outbred populations, starting with the <italic>ATM</italic> gene, study because of its moderate increase in breast cancer risk and its remarkable number of VUSes. The methodology consisted of: 1) selection and curation of 50 representative variants from our cohort; 2) evaluation of each by three members; and 3) discussion of evidences for classification in monthly teleconferences. As <italic>ATM</italic>-specific guidelines have not been published, we have previously carried out our own ACMG/AMP criterion adjustment. So far, 842 variants belonging to 730 tested patients with different hereditary cancer conditions. Among the 265 unique variants, 97 appeared more than once, and 35 had differences in classification among groups. Our new <italic>ATM</italic>-specific criteria have allowed us to improve and standardize the classification of the 50 pilot variants. We’ll next submit our classifications to international databases and extend our database to other Spanish participants and hereditary cancer genes.

AmpliSeq<sup>TM</sup> panels for Illumina® have been introduced to study the growing number of interesting variants in an increasing number of relevant genes. In theory, library preparation with such panels promise the ability query many interesting loci in DNA or RNA isolated from a broad range of specimen, including blood, cell culture, and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue at low efforts. However, especially working with the latter materials can represent practical challenges that require robust and established workflows for analytical studies. Here we sought to establish a workflow for this purpose using automated liquid handling for library preparation on the ep<italic>Motion</italic> system that can accommodate both RNA and DNA samples. We show exemplary NGS sequencing data achieved with the AmpliSeq for Illumina Focus panel assembled from individual DNA and RNA reference sample sets with known mutations and quality generated in a single automated setup. We found high run-to-run reproducibility and repeatability (R²&gt;0.98) with 100% success rate for library preparation (DNA <italic>n</italic> = ; RNA <italic>n</italic> = preparations). Call rates of known variants (R²&gt;0.99) and fusion transcripts were consistent over several independent experimental replicates. Furthermore variant calling and index representation were comparable to manual preparations performed on the same samples. The flexibility and scalability of this approach may aid in the routine study of different samples and throughputs, while reducing the hands-on time.</p><p id="Par3996"><bold>M. Hahn:</bold> A.

It is associated with increased risks for uveal melanoma, mesothelioma, cutaneous melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and cutaneous BAP1-inactivated nevi. A 50 year old female patient presented with pneumothorax, caused by bilateral mesothelioma, with no history of asbestos exposure. Molecular analysis of the tumor showed a pathogenic variant and a variant of unknown significance (the c.535C&gt;T, p.(Arg179Trp) variant) in the right tumor. The left tumor showed the same variant of unknown significance (VUS) as found in the other tumor, but no second mutation. Both tumors showed no staining for BAP1 by immunohistochemistry. DNA analysis of a blood sample confirmed that the VUS is present in the germline. RNA analysis showed expression of both the wild type and the variant allele in the same amount. Clinical work up of the patient showed no signs of uveal melanoma. Testing of healthy parents showed the VUS is present in the 80 year old mother of the proband. In the meantime the mother also developed mesothelioma, with no history of asbestos exposure. Molecular analysis of the tumor of the mother showed the VUS that is present in germline and another somatic VUS in the other BAP1 allele. The tumor was positive for staining of the BAP1 protein.

With the introduction of targeted therapy for BRCA-deficient recurrrent ovarian cancer and breast cancer, testing for somatic/germline mutations in <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> genes in tumor tissue became essential for treatment decisions. Identification of pathogenic <italic>BRCA1/2</italic> variants, especially large rearrangements in DNA isolated form FFPE, is challenging due to the high fragmentation grade of formalin-treated DNA and chemical modifications that lower the DNA quality. Therefore, the aim of the study was to verify the usefulness of NGS analysis of BRCA1/2 large rearrangements detection in DNA isolated from blood and FFPE samples.</p><p id="Par4039"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> 920 blood samples from patients with ovarian/breast cancer and 233 FFPE tissue samples from ovarian cancer patients were enrolled. FFPE tumor cell content was determined by a pathologist and tumor tissue was micro-dissected prior to DNA isolation.

In the general population, HRT slightly raises breast cancer (BC) risk (HR=1.34). However, it is unclear whether this applies to mutation carriers. Our hypothesis was that short-term use of HRT from RRSO till age 50 would not elevate BC risk significantly more than baseline risk of healthy carriers.</p><p id="Par4053"><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective cohort of 306 healthy BRCA1/2 mutation carriers who had undergone RRSO was followed-up for a mean duration of 7.26 years. We compared BC incidence over time in carriers who received HRT vs. those who didn’t.</p><p id="Par4054"><bold>Results:</bold> During follow-up, BC incidence was 22/150 (14.7%) in HRT group vs. 16/156 women (10.2%) in non-HRT group (OR= 1.371, NS), when controlled for age, the association appeared stronger (OR=1.996, NS). However, survival analysis didn’t demonstrate a significant difference in BC incidence (HR=1.777, NS), possibly due to shorter follow-up in HRT group (6.2 vs. 8.3 years, p &lt; 0.001). Median age at BC diagnosis appeared earlier (43.5 vs. 49 years, respectively), and latency period to BC diagnosis seemed shorter in HRT group vs. non-HRT group (invasive BC 1.58 vs. 3.45 years, respectively, DCIS 1.92 vs. 6.52 years, respectively), however, neither of these differences was significant.</p><p id="Par4055"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In our BRCA carrier cohort, followed for ~7.5 years post-RRSO, there is no evidence that HRT elevates breast cancer incidence, or significantly shortens the latency period between RRSO and cancer diagnosis.

Hereditary breast cancer is a polygenic disease, and next-generation sequencing allows the most comprehensive genetic examination of patients.</p><p id="Par4091"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We performed the analysis of the genomic DNA of 62 patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer, who were treated in Moscow Clinical Scientific Center n.a. Loginov. The average age at diagnosis were 43 ± 6.5 years. Three patients were diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer, and another 4 had a combination of breast cancer and other malignancy. A family history of 31 patients was burdened with malignant tumors. All patients had negative test results for 8 frequent mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes. DNA was isolated from leukocytes of peripheral blood. For sample preparation, enrichment by hybridization with NimbleGen probes (Roche) was used.</p><p id="Par4092"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 140 variants in 49 genes in 48 patients with a minor allele frequency &lt;1%. 57 variants were annotated as variants with uncertain clinical significance.

TAM resistance is the major challenge faced during endocrine therapy in ER+ breast cancer. Several TAM resistance mechanisms have been proposed. Recently lipid reprogramming was reported to be involved in TAM resistance. It has emerged that certain miRNAs are involved in cholesterol metabolism and cancer drug resistance pathways. We hypothesise that miRNAs controlling cholesterol metabolism and homeostasis are potential targets to be investigated in cholesterol-mediated drug resistance in breast cancer.</p><p id="Par4105"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> To investigate the role of miRNAs in cholesterol-mediated drug resistance, bioinformatic tools and in vitro cell based assays were utilised. Estrogen positive (ER+) breast cancer was of interest as drug resistance is a major problem in patients with ER+ breast cancer.</p><p id="Par4106"><bold>Results:</bold> We find that inhibition of hsa-miR-128-3p with AP + TAM treatment induced cell death and decreased cholesterol levels in MCF7 cells. Through focused pathway study using the RT2 profiler microarray, we find that genes that were differentially expressed promoted cholesterol efflux and drug metabolism while genes that mediate drug resistance were reduced. The work also highlights another potential mechanism of AP in ER+ breast cancer, where it acts as a negative regulator of hsa-miR-128.</p><p id="Par4107"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The findings demonstrate that targeting these miRNAs presents an opportunity for developing new strategies to combat anticancer drug resistance.</p><p id="Par4108"><bold>Acknowledgements:</bold> This research has been funded by grant #113442 from the NRF.

MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification) is widely used to detect CNVs. Recent advancements in bioinformatics made deletion/duplication analysis possible within the NGS data without any further experimentation. Here, with this study, we compared the results of MLPA with CNV detection algorithm (CNV by NGS) in colorectal and breast cancer patients.</p><p id="Par4113">Our study included 755 (683 breast-ovarian and 72 colorectal cancer) patients. MLPA test was performed using exon specific primers for <italic>BRCA1/2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2</italic> and <italic>EPCAM</italic>. NGS libraries were prepared by using targeted multi-gene capture panel (coding regions and splice junctions of aforementioned genes) and sequenced by NextSeq using paired-end reads. CNV by NGS analysis was performed with Sophia DDM bioinformatics software.</p><p id="Par4114">In 724 patients (96%) no deletion/duplication was detected in CNV by NGS, consistent with the results of MLPA. In 21 patients (2.8%), the same germline pathogenic variation was detected in both CNV by NGS and MLPA analyses.

Structural modeling of the most common recurrent mutation of the three (p.R44C) predicted that it destabilizes the protein due to the loss of an H-bond and salt bridge network between the mutated position and the serine and aspartic acid residues at positions 58 as 61, respectively. We experimentally confirmed this prediction showing that the p.R44C mutant protein is indeed destabilized. We further show RGS7 p.R44C has weaker catalytic activity for its substrate Gα<sub>o</sub>, thus providing a dual mechanism for its loss of function. Both of these effects are expected to contribute to loss of function of RGS7 resulting in increased anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion of melanoma cells. By mutating position 56 in the R44C mutant from valine to cysteine, thereby enabling the formation of a disulfide bridge between the two mutated positions, we slightly increased the catalytic activity and reinstated protein stability, leading to the rescue of RGS7′s function as a tumor suppressor. Our findings identify RGS7 as a novel melanoma driver and point to the clinical relevance of using strategies to stabilize the protein and, thereby, restore its function.</p><p id="Par4120"><bold>N. qutob:</bold> None. <bold>I.

Genes were grouped if they are associated with a heterogenous CPS and if they share the same cellular pathway or mechanism. At least two genes in the group must fulfill the criteria for individual genes for the group to be included in the panel.

Chloroquine is known to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Some HDACi have been reported to inhibit DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). This study aims to investigate the effect of Chloroquine, Panobinostat and their combination in the survival of different OC cell lines.</p><p id="Par4160"><bold>Material and methods:</bold> OC cell lines OVCAR-8, SK-OV-3, IGROV-1 and A2780 were used. MTT, cell cycle and apoptosis assays were performed to test chloroquine and Panobinostat anticancer activity. Synergistic interaction between these two drugs was assessed using the median dose effect analysis of Chou and Talalay, and combination indexes were calculated. DCFH-DA staining was used to determine ROS generation. γ-H2AX and Rad51 foci were detected by immunofluorescence. To analyze HR, a reporter GFP cassette was integrated into the genome of SK-OV-3 and a unique DSB was introduced by transfection with an endonuclease encoding plasmid. HR-efficiency in the presence or absence of Panobinostat was calculated by quantifying the number of GFP+ cells by flow cytometry.</p><p id="Par4161"><bold>Results:</bold> Chloroquine and Panobinostat decreased cell viability and induced G0/G1 and G2/M cell cycle arrest, respectively. The combination of both drugs caused a synergistic effect in all cell lines that was reverted by the addition of an antioxidant. Treatment with Panobinostat decreased the efficiency of HR due to the inhibition of Rad51 recruitment to DSBs.</p><p id="Par4162"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our study suggests that the Chloroquine-Panobinostat combination could be a therapeutic strategy against OC.</p><p id="Par4163"><bold>M.

The protocol is based on cultivating cancer cells on a non-attachment surface with specific growth factors and absence of serum for enrichment of cancer cells with higher stem-like properties. Studies suggest that invasion and metastasis capabilities of cancer cells are driven by increased epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) status and associated with CSC phenotype. However, EMT characteristics of tumorsphere- derived CSCs are poorly defined. In this study, migration/invasion capabilities of tumorsphere-derived chordoma CSCs, and their EMT related gene expression levels are investigated.</p><p id="Par4167"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> U-CH1 and MUG-Chor 1 Chordoma cell line derived tumorspheres were cultured on ultra-low attachment plate in serum free culture medium with specific supplements. Pluripotency and EMT related gene expression profiles were evaluated using qPCR. Migration capacity and invasiveness were assessed via Boyden chamber assay.</p><p id="Par4168"><bold>Results:</bold> Elevated SOX2, KLF4 and NANOG expressions in chordoma tumorspheres comparing parental cell lines indicates an enriched population with high pluripotency. Additionally, downregulation of CK19 and upregulation of Twist, Snail and ZEB1 in tumorspheres offers an epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype. In contrast migration/invasion capacities of tumorsphere derived cells are decreased, a signature EMT marker, CDH1 expression is increased.</p><p id="Par4169"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results demonstrates that tumorsphere formation assay may enrich cancer stem-like cell populations with high stemness potential, but these tumorsphere-derived cells are losing their capacity to migrate, probably due to the high CDH1 expression. Suggesting, CDH1 has a therapeutic potential for chordomas with high migrative capacity.(TUBITAK project number: 118S691)</p><p id="Par4170"><bold>N. Ekimci gurcan:</bold> None. <bold>U.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a newly discovered type of endogenous non-coding RNAs, characterized by a closed continuous loop, which can regulate gene expression by acting as microRNA or RNA-binding protein sponges. In this work we wanted to test whether circRNAs derived from the AR gene (circ-AR) could also be detected in blood samples and used as PCa biomarker.</p><p id="Par4188"><bold>Methods:</bold> Peripheral blood was drawn from 35 patients with diagnostic of metastasic PCa.

We report a 24-year-old man referred to our outpatient genetic clinic because of rectal cancer. His sister had died of an astrocytoma at age 14. Their father was diagnosed with prostate, bladder and renal cancer at age 47 and 58. A paternal uncle died of esophageal cancer at age 50, a paternal aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 70 and the paternal grandfather died of liver cancer at age 70. The maternal grandfather died of bladder cancer at age 77. The family history did not include additional cancer cases amongst first or second degree relatives. Immunohistochemistry of the rectal cancer showed mismatch repair deficiency with loss of MSH2, atypical diminished staining of MSH6 and presence of MLH1 and PMS2. Genetic analyses revealed two pathogenic heterozygous germline variants in <italic>MSH2</italic>, c.1759+3A&gt;G (p.(Ser554fs)) and a deletion of the first exon, c.(?_-1)_(211+1_212-1)del. RNA analyses showed that the splice site variant results in a loss of exon 11 from the transcript. Parental testing showed that both variants were inherited from a different parent. The latter finding confirmed CMMRD due to bi-allelic pathogenic <italic>MSH2</italic> variants in our patient. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue analysis revealed that his deceased sister also carried both <italic>MSH2</italic> variants.

Here we analyzed the clinicopathological and molecular features of CRC at AYA age to improve genetic counselling, surveillance and, ultimately, treatment and disease outcome. We retrospectively collected clinical information and tumor tissues from AYAs with CRC between 2000 and 2017 in the Netherlands. Tumor DNAs were analyzed for microsatellite instability, mutations in 56 hotspot regions and/or driver genes, and genome-wide somatic copy number aberrations. A total of 139 patients (58% male) were diagnosed with CRC ≤25 years of age (mean age 22) between 2000 and 2017. Mucinous and/or signet-ring-cell components were observed in 33% of cancers. A genetic tumor risk syndrome was confirmed in 39% of cases. Negative predictors of outcome were a younger age at diagnosis, signet-ring-cell carcinoma, the absence of a genetic tumor risk syndrome, and a diagnosis at advanced stage of disease. Compared to CRCs ≥60 years of age from The Cancer Genome Atlas, microsatellite stable (MSS) CRCs at AYA age more frequently harbor somatic mutations in <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>POLE</italic>, less frequently have <italic>APC</italic> mutations and are enriched for nearly-diploid MSS tumor genomes. Our data suggest that CRCs at AYA age have a biology and etiology different from sporadic CRCs at older age. Therefore, treatment of AYAs with CRC should be optimized based on their molecular genetic phenotypes. Performing comprehensive sequencing of germline and tumor DNA in every individual diagnosed with CRC ≤25 years of age would aid in this optimization.</p><p id="Par4206"><bold>R.M. de Voer:</bold> None. <bold>I.

The failure to identify the real causative genes could be due to the genetic heterogeneity underlying CRC. Our aim is to molecular characterize early-onset MMR-proficient CRC at somatic level to further identify novel candidate genes by integrating germline and tumor omic data.</p><p id="Par4217"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> WES and RNA-seq were performed on paired normal-tumor tissues from a phenotypically homogeneous cohort of 20 early-onset (&lt;50y) MMR-proficient CRC patients. Differential expression analysis (DESeq2), functional enrichment analysis (G:Profiler), consensus molecular subtyping (CMSCaller) and signature profile (MuSiCa) were carried out.</p><p id="Par4218"><bold>Results:</bold> According to consensus molecular subtyping, colorectal tumors were classified as: CMS1 (3), CMS2 (2), CMS3 (4), CMS4 (6), the remaining were still not classified.</p><p id="Par4219"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data show the molecular heterogeneity underlying this phenotypically homogeneous cohort of early onset MMR-proficient CRC. Thus, a more comprehensive prioritization of germline variants according to the molecular subtype of each tumor will be followed increasing the probabilities to identify the causative germline CRC risk variants. As a result a more personalized genetic diagnostic could be achieved.</p><p id="Par4220"><bold>Grant support:</bold> ISCIII and FEDER funds PI17/00509; Predoctoral Fellowship (GAIN, Xunta de Galicia)</p><p id="Par4221"><bold>A.

Patients with CRC have an increased risk for developing metachronous CRC (MCRC) during follow-up evaluation. It is still unknown which patients are prone to this condition, despite genomics studies have enhanced our ability to identify molecular changes associated with CRC. The clinician´s challenge is to propose a tight follow-up and control the possible return of cancer. This study is focusing on the characterization of mutational profile of MCRC that could inform in regards to prognosis and therapy decision.</p><p id="Par4245"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> A total of 90 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor DNA from 45 patients diagnosed with MCRC were selected to perform next generation sequencing (NGS) using Ion Torrent platform and Ampliseq cancer hotspot panel v2 (Thermofisher).

The extent of the del(5q) varies in individual cases. Two different commonly deleted regions (CDRs) have been published: the proximal 5q31.2 region associated with a high-risk MDS, and the distal CDR 5q32-5q33 involved in the pathogenesis of MDS with isolated del(5q). However, rare cases of atypical deletions not including defined CDRs have also been reported.</p><p id="Par4267"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> During 1993-2019 we examined bone marrow cells of 3714 MDS patients by conventional G-banding and I-FISH (Abbott). Extent of del(5q) was analyzed using multicolor banding (mBAND; MetaSystems) and/or aCGH (Illumina, Agilent).</p><p id="Par4268"><bold>Results:</bold> del(5q) was detected in 920/3714 patients (24,8%). Most of them had large deletion spanning both defined CDRs. Atypical deletions with retained CDRs were identified in 9/920 cases (1%; 4M/5F; median age, 73 years). In five of them del(5q) was a sole aberration, in four cases it was detected together with other chromosomal rearrangements. In all cases, deletion was localized proximally to the 5q31 region. The size of the deleted segment ranged from 25.46 to 53.19 Mb (median 38.51 Mb).</p><p id="Par4269"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results suggest that del(5q) may occur outside of defined CDRs. Although these findings are extremely rare, they show that also genes located outside known CDRs may contribute to the malignant progression of MDS. The identification of these genes will lead to better understanding of the MDS pathogenesis and may contribute to identify new therapeutic targets. <italic>Supported by RVO-VFN64165, IHBT-00023736</italic>.</p><p id="Par4270"><bold>Z.

During disease progression gliomas undergo cellular and genomic evolution. However, the mechanism of this complicated process associated with treatment failure is poorly understood.</p><p id="Par4274"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We compared genomic profiles of 28 primary and recurrent gliomas. To assess copy number variations, <italic>IDH1/IDH2</italic> mutation status and hypermethylation of <italic>MGMT</italic> and <italic>MLH3</italic> promoters we used array CGH/SNP (Illumina, Agilent), I-FISH (Abbott Molecular, MetaSystems) and MLPA/MS-MLPA (MRC Holland).</p><p id="Par4275"><bold>Results:</bold> In 27/28 cases, the genomic profiles of recurrent tumors were different from their primaries and shared the genetic/epigenetic alterations depending on the evolutionary pattern, i.e. linear or divergent.

Repeatedly affected regions were detected in bands 2q36.3, 3p11.1, 8q24.13, 13q14, and 22q11.1. Besides copy number variations, cnLOH were proved in 25/28 cases, predominantly located at 7p, 9p, 12p, and 17p.

Using GWAS summary statistics for each of these diseases (n cases: 14,949 endometriosis; 4,890 PCOS; 20,101 uterine fibroid; 12,906 endometrial cancer), we performed genetic correlation, genetic causal inference (latent causal variable and Mendelian randomization analysis) and gene-based analyses (fastBAT analysis) to understand the relationship between these three non-cancerous gynaecological diseases and risk of endometrial cancer. We found positive genetic correlation between endometrial cancer and PCOS (r<sub>g</sub>=0.37, P=2×10<sup>−3</sup>) and endometrial cancer and uterine fibroids (r<sub>g</sub>=0.24, P=7×10<sup>−3</sup>). There was no evidence of genetic correlation between endometrial cancer and endometriosis. As body mass index (BMI) is a shared risk factor for PCOS, uterine fibroids and endometrial cancer we adjusted genetic correlation results for BMI. Upon this adjustment, the significant correlation between uterine fibroids and endometrial cancer remained; however, the genetic correlation between PCOS and endometrial cancer was attenuated. Despite the significant genetic correlation observed, we did not find evidence supporting a causal relationship between any of the three non-cancerous gynaecological diseases and endometrial cancer development. Gene-based analyses prioritized seven endometriosis and five uterine fibroids-associated genes that overlapped with endometrial cancer-associated genes, highlighting potential shared pathways affecting risk of these diseases. No PCOS-associated genes overlapped with endometrial cancer-associated genes. Our study provides insights into the shared relationship between PCOS, uterine fibroids and endometrial cancer, and avenues for future research.

Data analysis was performed with an in house developed pipeline, allowing to limit the analysis to subpanels specified by the clinician. In total, 1522 patients referred to our hospital for clinical testing were investigated. We analyzed the following subpanels: melanoma (<italic>n</italic> = 113), colon cancer (<italic>n</italic> = 437), HBOC (<italic>n</italic> = 1026). Combinations of panels were analyzed for some patients, depending on personal and/or family history. In 270 patients (18%) a variant (Class V, Class IV) was detected in the requested panel. Our diagnostic yield increased with 3% (<italic>n</italic> = 47) compared to what we would have obtained if we had applied our previous panels for these indications. This increase is mainly attributable to the expansion of the panels with moderate risk genes, like ATM (19 pathogenic variants detected), BRIP1 (7 pathogenic variants) and CHEK2 (6 mutations other than c. 1100delC) in our HBOC panel. Interestingly, we also identified several variants in genes associated with rare syndromes - like NTHL1 (homozygous), BAP1, POT1, MITF, RAD51D, CDH1, HOXB13, STK11 and BMPR1A. The technique also allowed to detect several mosaic patients (TP53) or patients displaying clonal hematopoiesis in their lymphocytes (TP53, ATM).

A web-based tool known as Family Health<italic>Link</italic> which assesses familial cancer and CHD risk was made available for the general public (2010-2018) and as part of patient registration (2014-2018) with over 200,000 users. A one-page anonymous user survey was made available on the website during a one-month period (Jan-Feb 2018). Of 502 survey participants, 460 (91.6%) found FHL easy to use; 476 (94.8%) felt the assessment was easy to understand; and 365 (72.7%) found the assessment accurate and complete. 337 (67.1%) felt the program helped the user to learn more about cancer and CHD disease risk; 421 (83.8%) would encourage a family member to use the program, and 377 (75.1%) planned to talk to their healthcare provider about their risk. Qualitative research on patient users showed that certain aspects of FHL could be executed more effectively, to include increased opportunity for personalization of the web interface and risk messaging. FHL version 3.0 is under development and will allow for 1) automatic integration and updating of professional guidelines (e.g. NCCN guidelines for hereditary cancer); 2) expansion as a mobile application and for EPIC electronic health record integration; and 3) capacity to deliver tailored, evidence-based risk messages.</p><p id="Par4307"><bold>K.M.

Although truncating mutations in the APC gene are the most common defects in FAP patients, recent papers indicate that in a significant number of cases the disease develops due to large deletions that cannot be detected with routine testing. Here we describe two novel germline large deletions of the APC gene detected in 4 unrelated families presenting a severe FAP phenotype. The deletions were characterized using MLPA, high-resolution array-CGH and bridging-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing methodologies. Both deletions (123.466bp and 139.889bp) had a 5’ breakpoint in intron 4 of the APC gene and a 3’ breakpoint in intron 4 of the SRP19 gene, indicating that these regions are prone to recombination errors and might also be frequently affected by somatic rearrangements in sporadic CRC. RT-PCR analysis showed that the deletions resulted in the production of a hybrid APC-SRP19 transcript with an ORF of 550 AA, with ~92% sequence homology with the ZRSR2 gene. The ZRSR2 gene codes for the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein auxiliary factor 35kD subunit-related protein-2, which plays an important role in RNA splicing. Mutations in this gene have been found in various hematological malignancies associated with poor overall survival.

Standard of care for advanced disease is conventional chemotherapy. CD44v6-containing isoforms are de novo expressed in GC, are often correlated with cancer aggressiveness, and may predict chemotherapy response in vitro. Whether expression of CD44v6-containing variants, or presence of exon-v6 per se in these isoforms, determine tumor behavior and therapy response is unknown. This is relevant for therapeutic design and constitutes our main aim.</p><p id="Par4315"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Using CRISPR/Cas9, we specifically deleted exon-v6, whilst maintaining the reading frame, from two GC cell lines endogenously expressing CD44v6.

Drug treatments’ results demonstrate that removing specifically exon-v6 does not affects GC cells chemotherapy response, however, skipping exon-v6 is sufficient to impair GC cells self-renewing and decrease proliferation levels.

These exon skipping models are extremely important to disclose exon-v6 specific role in GC chemotherapy response.

NGS cancer assays are used to determine cancer predisposition, identify tumor mutations, monitor treatment response and develop personalized therapies. Here, GenapSys presents a scalable, low cost, and high accuracy sequencing platform based on electrical impedance detection. We demonstrate that Chips with 1M, 16M and 144M sensors can be run on the same GenapSys instrument, with greater than 99% raw accuracy and an average read length of about 150bp. We highlight its applications for oncology research, using diverse cancer panels on reference and clinical samples.</p><p id="Par4338">We tested hybrid-capture and multiplex PCR-based cancer panels on a range of DNA sources, including oncology reference standards derived from cell line DNA, cfDNA standards, clinical samples: FFPE, fresh frozen tumor tissue, and blood. For hybrid-capture libraries, we used the IDT xGen Pan Cancer and Exome Research panels. We detected low frequency mutations in the range of 1%-24.5% across multiple reference standards with the cancer panel, and observed high correlation in allele frequency with expected values (R2 &gt; 0.99). Similar results were obtained with the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2. Whole exome sequencing and pan cancer sequencing of clinical FFPE, fresh frozen and blood samples showed high concordance (F1-score 95% - 99%) of SNV mutation calling with industry standard technology. Thus, we demonstrate that the GenapSys Sequencing Platform is an accurate, scalable, and low cost solution for oncology research on a wide range of sample types and NGS assays.</p><p id="Par4339"><bold>M.

We called germline variants by using an in-house developed and GATK pipeline. Variants were filtered based on population allele frequency and functional annotation. Variants, which were shared by all genotyped affected members in at least one family, were validated by targeted sequencing in 15 additional glioma families. A total of 115 known glioma-related variants were also covered with targeted sequencing. We are currently analysing targeted sequencing data.</p><p id="Par4357"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 470 variants were identified in four glioma families after exome sequencing.

In contrast to traditional single-gene methods, next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a molecular diagnostic methodology that can study multiple regions of genomic tumor DNA in a single assay. Since 2019, over 500 analyses were routinely performed with a commercial panel allowing the analysis of 30 genes (Myeloid solution™ by SOPHiA GENETICS). Our experience is presented here. Some clinical cases were selected, for which the results of the NGS analysis have contributed either to an improvement in patient management, or to call into question the diagnostic or prognostic value of the molecular anomalies observed. In particular, the diagnostic value of CHIPs (Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential) and the impact of double mutations JAK2/CALR and JAK2/MPL in the progression of myeloproliferative neoplasia are reviewed. In addition, the CNV information provided by NGS is useful for the characterization of these diseases and complements the cytogenetic result. In chronic myeloid malignancies, the latest WHO classification includes only mutations of the JAK2, CALR, MPL, CSF3R and SF3B1 genes in strict diagnostic criteria. However, the current OMS classification of these haematological malignancies will certainly be redefined by a more exhaustive molecular approach based on recent NGS contributions.</p><p id="Par4370"><bold>V.

This results in chromatin compaction and silencing of microRNAs (miRNAs). To identify epigenetically regulated miRNAs we analyzed global miRNA expression after HDAC inhibition in HCC cell lines. Amongst others, we identified miR-129-5p to be re-expressed after histone acetylation. MiR-129-5p has been shown to act tumor suppressive in several tumor entities and we aimed to investigate its role in HCC tumorigenesis.</p><p id="Par4374"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> After transfection of HCC cell lines (HLE, HLF, Huh7, HepG2) with miR-129-5p, tumor-relevant functional effects were analyzed using in vitro assays and a xenograft mouse model. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to validate <italic>hepatoma-derived growth factor</italic> (<italic>HDGF</italic>) as a direct target of miR-129-5p. <italic>HDGF</italic> expression and survival data of public HCC datasets were analyzed. Cancer-related functions of HDGF were examined after siRNA-mediated knockdown.</p><p id="Par4375"><bold>Results:</bold> MiR-129-5p increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation and migration in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Direct binding of miR-129-5p to the <italic>HDGF</italic>-3’UTR via a noncanonical binding site was validated. <italic>HDGF</italic> knockdown increased apoptosis and attenuated cell viability, migration, and Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity of HCC cells. Overexpression of <italic>HDGF</italic> correlated with poor overall survival, especially in Wnt-inactive HCCs.</p><p id="Par4376"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> HDAC inhibition induces expression of the tumor suppressor miR-129-5p which plays an important role in hepatocarcinogenesis by regulating <italic>HDGF</italic>. In the future, direct transfer of miR-129-5p or inhibition of its target genes may be considered for HCC therapy. In this context, inhibition of HDGF may be particularly beneficial in Wnt-inactive HCCs.</p><p id="Par4377"><bold>N. Huge:</bold> None. <bold>M. Sandbothe:</bold> None. <bold>T.

The aim of this study was to identify recurrent somatic alterations in HNSCC that could be relevant in cancer initiation, progression or stratification.</p><p id="Par4381"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Tumour samples from 98 patients included in clinical trial TTCC-2007-01 were used. All patients presented locally advanced epidermoid carcinomas (non-metastatic stages III and IV) at different locations; oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx. Tumours were analysed by OncoScan® assay and bioinformatic tools (Bioconductor package, GISTIC and WebGestalt software), to detect genome-wide copy number variations and loss of heterozygosity.</p><p id="Par4382"><bold>Results and discussion:</bold> We identified genomic regions recurrently amplified (1q, 3q, 5p, 8q and 12p) and deleted (3p, 9p and 11q) in HNSCC. We considered the amplification in 1q21.3, identified in 58% of the samples to be particularly interesting. Gene enrichment analysis in this region revealed a significant association with processes related to epithelial development. Region 1q21.3 contains FLG, IVL and LOR genes, that codify proteins highly expressed in the epithelium. Germinal mutations in these genes have been associated with genodermatosis suggesting that their somatic alteration could also be involved in the pathogenesis of HNSCC.</p><p id="Par4383"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The chromosomic region 1q21.3, that contains FLG, IVL and LOR genes, is recurrently amplified in HNSCC.

The regulatory potential of tumor suppressor miRNAs represents an interesting option for cancer therapeutics. It has been shown that overexpression of miR-449a reduces tumor growth of hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo and in vitro. However, only few direct target genes of miR-449a have been validated to date.

Here we aim to investigate whether part of the genetically unexplained familial/early-onset CRC cases may be attributed to the accumulation of low risk alleles for CRC.</p><p id="Par4420"><bold>Material and methods:</bold> A weighted polygenic risk score (wPRS) based on 95 CRC risk alleles identified and validated through genome-wide association studies (Huyghe et al. Nature genetics 2018), was determined in 421 familial/early-onset unrelated CRC patients (fCRC), 1,077 sporadic CRC patients, and 1,642 cancer-free controls. Logistic regression was used to model the risk. Two-sided t-test was applied to compare means among cohorts. Additionally, we grouped individuals (fCRC and controls) into 20 quantiles.

Familial CRC patients in the highest (20<sup>th</sup>) wPRS quantile were at a four-fold increased CRC risk than those in the middle (10th) quantile. The frequency of high-wPRS fCRC patients who had developed multiple (synchronous or metachronous) colorectal tumors and that had familial CRC history was higher than in low-wPRS patients. The heritability explained by the studied alleles was of 37.48% for fCRC.</p><p id="Par4422"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The accumulation of low risk CRC alleles may explain a relevant proportion of familial/early-onset CRC cases without germline pathogenic variants in known hereditary cancer genes.</p><p id="Par4423"><bold>L.

Genetic testing can be offered not only to identify the individuals’ cancer risk, but also to enable the possibility of molecular targeted therapies. Here, we report the retrospective analysis of a single institution’s 3-year experience of oncopanel sequencing, which targets 94 genes and 284 SNPs, carried out by using peripheral blood samples. 125 unrelated patients with a male:female ratio of 1:4 (mean age 40(sd 6,51)) were screened. Our studies showed that 72% of the cases have at least one variant classified as pathogenic, possibly pathogenic or of unknown significance in targeted regions. Pathogenic variants were detected in 12%, and possible pathogenic variants were detected in 18% of the cases. <italic>CHEK2</italic> and <italic>ATM</italic> were detected as most common genes in patients with pathogenic mutations. Although pathogenic variant detection rate is relatively high, variants of unknown significance (VUS), which were found in 42% of the cases, are also needed to be evaluated carefully, especially in hereditary forms of cancer. It is obvious that more research on VUS and assessment of their effect on cancer development is essential to shed light to underlying pathogenicity and medical management.</p><p id="Par4441"><bold>E.

Due to the implementation of multi-gene panel testing, <italic>TP53</italic> variants have been detected in individuals without LFS suspicion, e.g. colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. We aim to decipher whether these findings are the result of detecting background population prevalence or the etiologic basis of CRC.</p><p id="Par4445"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> TP53 mutational screening was performed in 473 familial/early-onset CRC cases. Our findings were analyzed together with results from five additional studies that evaluated the prevalence of <italic>TP53</italic> germline variants in CRC patients (total n=6,200). Data from control population and LFS cases were obtained from gnomAD and the IARC TP53 database, respectively.

The intention is to support therapists in detecting patients that should undergo a genetic counselling regarding hereditary tumour predisposition syndrome. The monocentric study aimed to analyse and evaluate the value of this score compared with a standard three-generation pedigree analysis.</p><p id="Par4461"><bold>Material and Methods:</bold> Starting in June 2018, 100 colorectal cancer patients treated at the University Tübingen were randomly picked over a 14 months period. After patients completed the questionnaire, a pedigree and a survey on the comprehensibility of the questionnaire were conducted. Pedigrees and available histopathological data were then evaluated according to the Bethesda and Amsterdam guidelines and analysed for other familial tumour syndromes. The results were compared to the self-assessment risk-score.</p><p id="Par4462"><bold>Results:</bold> In 41/100 patients the questionary screening approach indicated a familial colorectal cancer risk compared to 22 patients by pedigree analysis.

Regardless of age, GB is incurable and associated with poor prognosis. Because of its highly invasive nature, it is impossible to remove all tumour cells during surgical resection, making relapse inevitable, thus, GB treatment presents one of the greatest challenges. Molecular data reveal significant differences between the paediatric and adult GBs, e.g. recurrent somatic mutations in some histone variants. The aim of the study was to determine differences in gene expression among paediatric and adult GB, suggesting the possible reason for failures of immunotherapy in GB.</p><p id="Par4468"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> GB cell lines: paediatric (KNS42, SF188, SF8628), adult (U87, U251, T98G), and normal human astrocytes were used as a reference. RNA was harvested and the gene expression level was determined using RT-PCR. Selected genes with proven involvement for immunotherapy response have been analysed.</p><p id="Par4469"><bold>Results:</bold> Of all 27 analysed genes, only a small fraction seems to be expressed in GB, some of which were not analysed in GB literature so far. Expression of those seem to be higher in paediatric GB, e.g. BACH2 and IL-6R.</p><p id="Par4470"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Most of the genes involved in the formation of immunological synapse are significantly down-regulated or not expressed at all in GB, providing the potential explanation for many failures of checkpoint inhibitors immunotherapy in GB. However, differences in gene expression might favour paediatric GB over adult GB as a candidate for future research leading to the successful immunotherapy.</p><p id="Par4471"><bold>R.

A comparison of the molecular alterations between Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Lung Carcinoid (LC) subtypes however is missing and might further improve patient stratification.</p><p id="Par4503"><bold>Methods:</bold> We sequenced 216 paired tumour-normal samples using a combination of whole-exome and targeted capture sequencing. Additionally, all samples underwent Illumina OmniExpressExome (v1.6) SNP genotyping.</p><p id="Par4504"><bold>Results:</bold> Out of 108 lung cancer patients, 22 had LC and 86 NSCLC. Those with NSCLCs showed lower survival time compared to LCs (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0148). Recurrent mutations were found in <italic>TP53</italic> (81%), <italic>KRAS</italic> (34%), <italic>STK11</italic> (23%) and <italic>KEAP1</italic> (21%) in NSCLC but none of these genes were mutated in the LC subtype. Similarly, Copy Number (CN) burden was also higher in NSCLC than in LCs, with 10% and 5% of genome respectively harbouring CN alterations. Recurrent amplifications in <italic>MYC</italic> (35%), <italic>SOX2</italic> (20%) and <italic>MDM2</italic> (11%) were found in NSCLC but only 18% of LC patients showed <italic>MYC</italic> amplifications and none were detected in <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>MDM2</italic>. Furthermore, <italic>MTAP</italic> and <italic>CDKN2A</italic> were co-deleted at frequencies of ~30% in NSCLC but at 4.5% only in LCs.</p><p id="Par4505"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Molecular profiles in NSCLC and LC are substantially different and this may have direct consequences in the therapy decision process. For example, preferential loss of the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> locus in NSCLC could impact the response to immunotherapy drugs. In contrast, as <italic>MDM2</italic> is a negative regulator of <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>MDM2</italic> amplification in NSCLC could indicate therapeutic efficacy of MDM2 inhibitors in p53 mutant tumours.</p><p id="Par4506"><bold>C.

Testing for these mutations and tailoring therapy accordingly are widely accepted as standard practice. Recently a novel technology that enables high multiplex amplification reactions was developed by Atila Biosystems. With the droplet digital (ddPCR<sup>TM</sup>) technology, the Atila iCARE (RUO) Lung cancer mutation screening kit identifies and quantifies 99 possible mutation sites in two reaction wells in a rapid and cost-effective manner.</p><p id="Par4510"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Artificially prepared DNA samples were used to evaluate analytical sensitivity and specificity. We used enzymatically digested normal human genomic DNA as negative DNA samples and mutation bearing plasmid DNA as spike in positive DNA. A serial dilution of mutations at 0%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 1%, and 10% were used to evaluate assay sensitivity.</p><p id="Par4511"><bold>Results:</bold> The iCARE Lung cancer screening assay targets 42 mutations in EGFR, 41 mutations in KRAS, 1 mutation in BRAF, 13 mutations in HER2, and 1 mutation in MET. The assay differentiates mutations from wildtype targets based on cluster locations in the ddPCR<sup>TM</sup> two-dimensional graphs.

Patients could choose to see the gastroenterology, colorectal, gynaecology, medical oncology, research, and clinical psychology teams. Clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction were evaluated over 12 months.</p><p id="Par4518"><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty-eight LS patients were seen (8 <italic>MLH1</italic>, 18 <italic>MSH2</italic>, 8 <italic>MSH6</italic>, 4 <italic>PMS2</italic>); mean age was 46y (range: 20-69y); 15 patients had colorectal cancer (39.5%).

Sun exposure is one of the major risk factors. Recent studies indicate that 6-7 % of all melanoma patients carry a pathogenic germline variant in a cancer predisposition gene (CPG) while the association with melanoma is often unknown. We screened a large cohort of stage II melanoma patients for pathogenic germline variants in CPGs.</p><p id="Par4567"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> DNA from paired tumor and normal FFPE tissue of 196 patients with stage II melanoma was sequenced with a NGS custom enrichment panel covering 693 genes, selected promotor and intronic regions. We used megSAP (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/imgag/megSAP" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/imgag/megSAP</ext-link>) for NGS data analysis and germline variants in 152 CPGs were filtered for population allele frequency (AF &lt; 1 %) and classified according to ACMG guidelines.</p><p id="Par4568"><bold>Results:</bold> We detected pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in recessive and dominant CPGs in 18 out of 196 patients (9.2 %, including ATM, BRCA1, CHEK2, MSH2, PALB2, SDHA). A second hit in tumor tissue was detected in one patient carrying an ATM mutation. Tumors with germline pathogenic variants in MSH2 did not reveal microsatellite instability. Besides relevance for surveillance and families, five pathogenic variants affected DNA repair genes with potential relevance for therapy.</p><p id="Par4569"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Pathogenic germline variants in CPGs in stage II melanoma patients are frequent and of relevance for surveillance, families and potentially therapy. Further studies are needed to investigate whether pathogenic variants in CPGs that are not known to be related to melanoma contribute to melanoma development.</p><p id="Par4570"><bold>S.

Many studies have shown that development of malignancies is mainly driven by alterations of cellular signaling pathways. MicroRNAs are small noncoding molecules playing an essential role in various biological processes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the functional role of miR-20b and miR-451a and their target genes in GC.</p><p id="Par4596"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> To determine the expression level of miR-20b and miR-451a in vivo and in vitro, biopsy samples of GC patients, healthy controls, INS-GAS mice, AGS and MKN28 cell lines samples were analysed using qRT-PCR. To confirm putative microRNA target-genes and determine miR-20b and miR-451a impact on cell function, luciferase reporter, protein expression, MTT, clonogenic, apoptosis, wound healing assays were performed in GC cell cultures.</p><p id="Par4597"><bold>Results:</bold> Deregulated expression of miR-20b and miR-451a was determined in GC cell lines and the INS-GAS mouse model.

One of the reasons for this is the lack of adequate markers which could help determine the biological potential of the tumor to develop into its invasive stage. Some microRNAs (miRNAs) correlate with disease progression. The purpose of this study was to identify which miRNAs can accurately predict the presence of BC and can differentiate low grade (LG) tumors from high grade (HG) tumors.</p><p id="Par4603"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold>The study included 55 patients with diagnosed bladder cancer and 30 persons belonging to the control group. The expression of seven selected miRNAs was estimated with the real-time PCR technique according to miR-103-5p (for the normalization of the results). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the feasibility of using selected markers as biomarkers for detecting BC and discriminating non-muscle invasive BC (NMIBC) from muscle invasive BC (MIBC).</p><p id="Par4604"><bold>Results:</bold> For HG tumors, the relevant classifiers are miR-205-5p and miR-20a-5p, whereas miR-205-5p and miR-182-5p are for LG (AUC = 0.964 and AUC = 0.992, respectively). NMIBC patients with LG disease are characterized by significantly higher miR-130b-3p expression values compared to patients in HG tumors.</p><p id="Par4605"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings could be of clinical importance.

Mosaic individuals are at increased risk of neoplasms and are not readily detected clinically. Multiple primary tumours in the same individual (MPT) represent an opportunity to detect mosaicism as variants may be present in both tumours but not blood. We sequenced separate primaries from three MPT individuals with a panel assay incorporating 350 cancer genes on DNA from FFPE tissue, and corresponding blood samples with whole-genome sequencing. Variants in tumour samples were filtered to include non-synonymous or splice variants present in both tumours from each individual and exclude likely false positives. 2/3 individuals had truncating CPG variants in both of their tumours that were undetected in their blood sample or in other tumours in the same sequencing run (<italic>n</italic> = 23). One had a <italic>VHL</italic> frameshift variant detected in bilateral clear cell renal cell carcinomas diagnosed at age 40 and 47 years. Variant allele fractions (VAF) were 41% and 49% respectively and 0/37 germline reads showed evidence of the variant. Another case had a <italic>TP53</italic> nonsense variant in bilateral breast carcinomas diagnosed at age 48 and 52 years. VAFs were 22% and 15% and 0/34 germline reads showed variant base calls.

We analyzed sequencing data for germline variants in 211 known cancer predisposition genes (CPGs) and classified each variant based on the AMCG/AMP guidelines. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in CPGs were identified in 10/44 individuals (23%). Two individuals carried one pathogenic variant that explains their tumor phenotype (<italic>PTEN</italic>; <italic>NF1</italic>). In five individuals pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in <italic>CHEK2</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 3), <italic>HOXB13</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 1) and <italic>FANCM</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 1) that may have contributed to their malignancies were identified. In three individuals, the analysis revealed heterozygous pathogenic variants in genes associated with recessive disorders (<italic>POLH</italic>, <italic>n</italic> = 2; <italic>RAD50</italic>, <italic>n</italic> = 1). In our highly selected cohort of adults with multiple primary tumors we identified pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in CPGs in 23% of patients. This analysis resulted in a molecular diagnosis for two individuals and for eight individuals we identified alterations that may have cooperated in cancer development, giving cues for further genome-wide analysis on the germline and tumor tissues that are now ongoing.</p><p id="Par4622"><bold>F.

The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of SVs in hereditary cancer genes the clinical utility of RNA analysis.</p><p id="Par4648"><bold>Material and Methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective analysis of 887 individuals referred to our laboratory for genetic testing using a NGS panel of 36 hereditary cancer genes. Functional RNA analysis for SVs was performed with RNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes following RT-PCR and Sanger Sequencing.</p><p id="Par4649"><bold>Results:</bold> A SV was identified in 22/ 887 individuals (2.5%) and 7/22 (31.8%) were classified as pathogenic and 5/22 (22.7%) as likely pathogenic. The remaining 10 variants were initially classified as VUS (45.5%) and RNA analysis could be performed for 2 variants. RNA analysis of a variant in <italic>ATM</italic> (c.2125-1G&gt;T) revealed the deletion of 11 bases (r.2125del), thus resulting in a frameshift (p.(Ile709Phefs*22)). Moreover, for a <italic>MSH2</italic> variant (c.1510+1_1510+2dupGT), it was shown that the insertion of 2 bases (r.1510dup) causes a frameshift, p.(Gly5040Glyfs*39). The two novel variants were reclassified from VUS to Pathogenic.</p><p id="Par4650"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In our cohort, SVs accounted for 8.6% of pathogenic and 2.5% of VUS results. RNA analysis assisted in the reclassification of 20.0% of splicing VUS.

Mutation carriers may develop meningiomas, ependymomas and retinal hamartomas. Mosaicism is a known phenomenon which is difficult to detect by conventional sequencing and is therefore impeding cascade screening and adequate surveillance for offspring-carriers. We describe a 27-year-old woman reaching out for preconception advice while presenting with singular VS, a facial nerve schwannoma, multiple cerebral bilateral meningiomas and medullar schwannomas, first diagnosed at the age of 26 years. Her parents or other family members were not affected, suggesting a de novo mutation in the <italic>NF2</italic>-gene. Previously external performed Sanger sequencing did not detect any pathogenic mutation in <italic>NF2</italic> in the patient´s blood. We analyzed two different tumors of the patient (facial nerve schwannoma and medullar schwannoma) by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and found the same pathogenic clonal <italic>NF2</italic> variant (c. 362dup:p.Val122Glyfs*8) together with a second hit (LOH) in both tumors. The same pathogenic frameshift <italic>NF2</italic>-Variant was subsequently confirmed by NGS in blood and in skin (with an allele frequency of 0.5 % and 1 %, respectively), while no mutation was detected in genes associated with schwannomatosis (<italic>LZTR1, SMARCB1</italic> and <italic>PRKAR1A</italic>), ruling out the main differential diagnosis of NF2. Deep sequencing of blood through modern sequencing techniques such as NGS can improve the sensitivity of detection of mosaicism compared to traditional sequencing allowing therefore adequate genetic counseling concerning the risk for offsprings to inherit NF2 and specific surveillance for children carrying the mutation.</p><p id="Par4662"><bold>C.

The risk of the latter is defined by the complex of clinicopathologic features which, however, provide low accuracy in predicting clinical outcomes. The aim of our study was to determine the prognostic value of <italic>FGFR3</italic>, <italic>HRAS</italic>, <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>ТР53</italic> gene mutations, <italic>RUNX3</italic>, <italic>p16</italic> abnormal methylation, as well as <italic>CDKN2A</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic> loss of heterozygosity (LOH) with regard to progression in a prospective cohort of 249 NMIBC patients.

Simultaneous presence of at least 3 established predictors resulted in significantly decreased 5-year progression-free survival (14.3 ± 13.2%) as compared with a lesser number of indicated molecular alterations (91.9 ± 2.8%) (p &lt; 0.001, log-rank test). Using logistic regression, we built a prediction model, comprising all five prognostic factors. The 5-marker panel was able to discriminate between patients with and without progression with 84.6% sensitivity, 91.7% specificity, and 0.88 AUC (р &lt; 0.001). The data obtained demonstrate that the use of molecular markers in addition to clinicopathologic ones may help in stratifying NMIBC patients into groups with different prognosis for the selection of optimal treatment regimens.</p><p id="Par4676"><bold>M.

For digestive cancers, average age at diagnosis was 59 and we reported colorectal, duodenal, caecal and pancreatic cancer. None of these tumors showed microsatellite instability. Extra-digestive malignancies included sarcoma, basal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, urothelial carcinoma, and scalp melanoma. We reported the second largest NTHL1 collection. NTHL1 is not yet considered for diagnostic purposes in France. Despite tumor risks to be precisely defined, these novel data may favor NTHL1 inclusion in diagnostic panel testing.

BRCA1/2 sequence, copy number, and promoter methylation were analyzed in fresh-frozen OC tissue. Twelve patients (40%) showed clear evidence of BRCA deficit (BD): 6 (20%) carried germline pathogenic variants (3 in BRCA1, 3 in BRCA2) and one (3.3%) a somatic BRCA2 mutation, all displaying Loss-Of-Heterozygosity; 5 (16.7%) had one BRCA1 copy deleted and the other methylated; in the remaining 18 cases, BRCA deficit was undetected/unclear (BU). 29 patients received platinum-based chemotherapy, with baseline clinical features not significantly differing by BRCA status: after a median follow-up of 44.2 months, 15 had experienced progression: mean PFS was 43.5 months (95%CI: 35.6-51.3) in the BD and 28 months (95%CI: 21.1-35.0) in the BU group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.018). BRCA sequence analysis in respective Formalin-Fixed-Paraffin-Embedded (FPPE) samples detected all the variants found in fresh-frozen tissue, but also multiple additional somatic variants, including pathogenic variants (allelic load 20-40%) in 2 tumours previously classified as BU.

Smoking, alcohol consumption as well as diet and obesity are well known risk factors of this acquired disease. Germline mutations in BRCA2 are the most common cause of familial pancreatic cancer. In addition, the prevalence of ATM mutations has been found to be significantly higher in familial pancreatic cancer cases than in controls. Here we present data that mutations in the ATM gene may be a frequent cause of apparently sporadic pancreatic cancer.</p><p id="Par4707"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We analyzed pedigree information and genes associated with pancreatic cancer (BRCA1/2, ATM, CDKN2A, CHEK2, NBN and PALB2) in 8 families.</p><p id="Par4708"><bold>Results:</bold> Three families showed a pathogenic mutation in BRCA2, four families had pathogenic mutations in ATM. The index patients were all men and diagnosed with pancreatic carcinoma at the age &lt; 60 years. One patient had no further family member with a history of cancer. The father of one index patient was diagnosed with tongue cancer. Two families showed several family members suffering from cancer like breast cancer, sarcoma, colorectal cancer and brain tumours.

Nevertheless, pathogenic germline mutations in the ATM gene were detected in half of patients leading to the possibility of predictive testing in healthy family members.

In addition, multiple gene families related to cell proliferation, migration, adhesion and connectivity are notably enriched among genes harbouring missense or truncating mutations or exhibiting dysregulated gene expression, for example PI3K subunits and protein kinases. In addition, wide-spread copy-number changes are present throughout the genome, including gain of chr7p (<italic>EGFR</italic>) and loss of chr9p (<italic>CDK2NA</italic>). A strongly CNV-altered region on chr11q contains a highly expressed <italic>CTNND1:</italic><italic>PAK1</italic> in-frame fusion gene that likely retains Wnt-signalling as well as p21-binding and protein kinase properties. Presence of the altered region in an early metastasis suggests this fusion as a potentially dominant driver in tumor development.</p><p id="Par4716"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results demonstrate the involvement of multiple cellular signalling pathways in EPC tumor development, many of which are involved in other cancer types, and point towards potential treatment targets.</p><p id="Par4717"><bold>D.

However, the fraction of cancer-derived ccfDNA (ctDNA) is variable, and particularly low in primary disease in capsulated organs like prostate. Most studies explored ctDNA in advanced metastatic prostate cancer (PCa), conversely, detection of ctDNA in localized disease is challenging. Inflammation, exercise, or tissue injury, substantially increase ccfDNA; we therefore hypothesized that prostate biopsies (each typically picking 14-18 samples from the gland) might release prostate-derived ccfDNA/ctDNA, which could be exploited for molecular tests.</p><p id="Par4735"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We collected tissue/blood samples (before and after biopsy at different timepoints) from 34 patients undergoing prostate biopsy: 26 with PCa, 8 negative. ccfDNA was extracted with the Maxwell-RSC ccfDNA Plasma Kit, quantified by Qubit; size-distribution analysis was performed by Tape-station. Somatic mutations, identified by RNAseq on biopsies using the TruSight RNA Pan-Cancer Panel, were searched in ccfDNA (before/after biopsy) by targeted NGS (NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep; mean depth 280,000x).</p><p id="Par4736"><bold>Results:</bold> We demonstrated a significant transient increase in plasma ccfDNA after biopsy (4.23.6 ± 3.39ng vs. 2.72 ± 1.02ng per mL plasma; P-value=0.0098 after 1h; 9.32 ± 5.08ng vs. 6.74 ± 4.35ng, P=0.0052 after 2h). ccfDNA molecules extracted after biopsy were also significantly longer.

This study aimed to detect the presence of androgen receptor (AR) and the androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7) a biomarker associated with worse prognosis, in blood samples of prostate cancer (PCa) patients by two methods: RT-qPCR from platelet-isolated RNA and determination of AR and AR-V7 protein levels in plasma using capillary nano-immunoassay.</p><p id="Par4742"><bold>Methods:</bold> The study included 35 patients with PCa and 16 healthy donors. Whole blood (10mL) was collected and platelets were isolated from the supernatant by centrifugation at room temperature for 20 minutes at 1500 rpm. RNA was extracted and RT-qPCR for GAPDH, ITGA2B, AR and AR-V7 was performed. Proteins were extracted to detect AR and AR-V7 using Simple West Protein analysis.</p><p id="Par4743"><bold>Results:</bold> Both AR and AR-V7 expression were detected by RT-qPCR. Five patients exhibited a high expression of the 2 receptors, 8 showed low levels and 22 patients showed expression levels similar to those of the VCAP PCa cell line, that was used as a positive control. These biomarkers were absent in the 16 healthy donors, as expected. AR protein was detected by Simple West in all plasma patients. However, AR-V7 protein was only detected in 11 patients.</p><p id="Par4744"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results demonstrate that platelets contain tumor-associated RNA and could be used for detection of AR and AR-V7 expression in blood samples in PCa patients. Moreover, determination of AR-V7 protein by nano-immunoassay represents a novel methodology and may serve to detect this biomarker associated with bad prognosis.</p><p id="Par4745"><bold>P.

In non-irradiated retinoblastoma survivors, the incidence rate per 1,000 person years (IR) of SPMs was lower compared to the irradiated patients (IR 11.1 [95% confidence interval 7.9-15.1] vs. IR 4.3 [2.1 -7.9]; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). The IR of SPMs was higher in patients with complete penetrance type variants compared to incomplete type variants (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Without previous irradiation, SPM were only observed in patients with complete penetrance type <italic>RB1</italic> variants. The association between the type of <italic>RB1</italic> variant and penetrance of retinoblastoma in childhood is also present with respect to the risk for SPMs later in life. This finding will help to develop screening programs tailored to the individual risk of survivors with heritable retinoblastoma.

Somatic insertions of L1 and Alu were detected in some cancer types (colorectal, lung, breast). Despite the abundance of data about the regulation of RE activity, the exact mechanisms of RE activation in particular cancer types are still unclear. In this study we investigate the correlation between RE insertional activity in colorectal cancer and other factors, such as gene expression, L1 transcription and methylation profiles of young L1 copies.</p><p id="Par4779"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> sequencing libraries of L1 and Alu flanking sequences were prepared from DNA isolated from paired normal and tumor tissue samples. Digested DNA was ligated to adapters containing unique molecular identifiers (UMI) and amplified with primers, specific to young RE subfamilies. The same DNA samples were used for investigation of methylation profile of young L1-copies by enzymatic based conversion of 5-mC with subsequent amplification and sequencing of L1Hs promoters. Total RNA was extracted from the same tissue samples and used for RNA-seq library preparation.</p><p id="Par4780"><bold>Results:</bold> Tumor-specific insertions were identified in 18 tumors from 55 analyzed normal/tumor paired samples. In these paired samples we also identified L1HS-copies with demethylated promoters. We characterized the differential expression of genes that influence RE activity and transcription activity of individual L1 copies.</p><p id="Par4781"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In this work, we conducted a first systematic study of multiple factors that can influence RE transpositional activity in colorectal cancer.

Pathological diagnosis relies on morphology and immunohistochemistry. It should be complemented by molecular technique, when the diagnosis is doubtful, and when it may have prognostic and/or predictive relevance. This study aims to assess the clinical effect of implementation of FISH to improve sarcoma misdiagnosis.</p><p id="Par4810"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> It is a retrospective study conducted in the pathology department of Hassan II university hospital between 2010 and 2018. 110 cases of mesenchymal tumors were included. HES coloration was performed in all cases followed by immunohistochemistry. FISH was performed in all cases. Probes used were Vysis break apart; EWSR1, MDM2, and SS18.</p><p id="Par4811"><bold>Results:</bold> The median age is 38 years [1-82]. On the basis of histology and immunohistochemical stains. There were 33 ewing sarcoma, 21 synovial sarcomas, 28 lipomas, 5 liposarcomas, and 23 unclassified sarcomas. FISH was successful in 97%. EWSR1 gene was rearranged in 72% of cases. For synovial sarcomas the rearrangement of SS18 was detected in 71%. MDM2 was amplified in 40% of atypical lipomatous tumors and dedifferentiated liposarcomas, whereas 93% of lipomas were negative, with 2 cases labelled as liposarcomas after FISH MDM2.</p><p id="Par4812"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the first and largest moroccan series for molecular diagnosis of STS by FISH. It is important to implement this technique in a local laboratory to make it available at routine for moroccan patients. Our study shows that FISH improves sarcomas misdiagnosis, and it is very useful when histology and immunohistochemistry can’t accurately classify tumors.</p><p id="Par4813"><bold>R.

Here, we present splicing assays of 20 variants representing a variety of mutation types in ten hereditary cancer genes, together with an attempt to incorporate these results into ACMG classification guidelines.</p><p id="Par4817"><bold>Methods:</bold> We selected 16 point mutations, 3 exon duplications and one single-exon deletion prioritized by <italic>in silico</italic> algorithms. RNA was extracted from short-term lymphocyte cultures to perform RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Whenever possible, allele-specific expression was assessed by SNaPshot.</p><p id="Par4818"><bold>Results:</bold> We detected aberrant transcripts in 14 variants (70%). We faced the difficulty of variant interpretation comparing old classification standards to generic ACMG guidelines and devised a proposal to weight functional analyses at RNA level. According to ACMG guidelines only 12 were reclassified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic, since the remaining two did not gather enough evidence.</p><p id="Par4819"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study highlights the importance of RNA studies to improve variant classification. However, it also evidences the challenge of incorporating these results into generic ACMG guidelines and the need to refine these criteria gene-specifically. Nevertheless, 60% of variants were reclassified, thus improving genetic counseling and surveillance for carriers of these variants.</p><p id="Par4820"><bold>Grant support</bold> Contract grant sponsor: Supported by the Carlos III National Health Institute funded by FEDER funds – a way to build Europe – [PI19/00553; PI16/00563; PI16/01898; SAF2015-68016-R and CIBERONC]; the Government of Catalonia [Pla estratègic de recerca i innovació en salut (PERIS_MedPerCan and URDCat projects), 2017SGR1282 and 2017SGR496].</p><p id="Par4821"><bold>P.

However, variant interpretation is still a challenging step and often the lack of functional studies leads clinicians to classify them as variants of uncertain significance (VUS). RNA functional studies can improve the characterization of variants thus allowing the implementation of personalized strategies in cancer patient care.</p><p id="Par4825"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> VUSs were analysed using the Human Splicing Finder (HSF) software, to predict the effect of intronic and exonic variants on splicing. Thereafter, RNA was extracted from short-term lymphocyte cultures (96h) from peripheral blood and /or from lymphoblastoid lines, both in presence and absence of puromycin to inhibit Nonsense Mediated Decay. cDNA was obtained and amplification products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Sanger sequencing to detect any abnormal splicing patterns.</p><p id="Par4826"><bold>Results and Discussion:</bold> A total of fourteen VUS, twelve intronic and two exonic, in the following genes have been analyzed: <italic>MSH2</italic>, <italic>MLH1</italic>, <italic>MSH6</italic>, <italic>APC</italic>, <italic>PMS2</italic>, <italic>MUTYH</italic>, <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>NF1</italic>, <italic>SPRED1</italic>. Ten of them affected exon incorporation as a consequence of intronic sequence changes. In the remaining four no differences were observed in transcript sequences in both untreated and puromycin-treated cultures.</p><p id="Par4827"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study shows that 71% of the splicing variants analyzed by RNA sequencing can be reclassified as pathogenetic or likely pathogenetic. These preliminary data suggest that RNA analysis should be a part of the diagnostic workflow in patients with VUS in hereditary cancer predisposition genes in order to improve genetic testing accuracy and patients managment.</p><p id="Par4828"><bold>A.

Several gene fusions have been discovered and exploited for therapies as they produce fusion proteins that can be targeted by chemotherapeutics such as tyrosine-kinase inhibitors targeting BCR-ABL used to treat CML. In addition, other genomic fusions serve as diagnostic or prognostic indicators important for cancer management. Whole genome approaches to detect fusions have innate limitations, for example, karyotyping is low resolution and whole genome sequencing is blind in the ~66% of the genome containing repeats. Bionano genome imaging is able fill the gap, it provides high resolution and ability to span genomic repeats.</p><p id="Par4832">Here we demonstrate an easy, fluid, largely automated workflow for whole genome detection of fusions and other somatic variants. The Bionano workflow involves a novel rapid isolation protocol for extremely high molecular weight DNA, labeling the DNA to create a barcode across the genome and automated data collection using the Bionano Saphyr instrument. This complete assay can be conducted within 4 days from tissue to variant calls. We detected numerous fusions that have not previously been detected. In a standard assay, whole genome imaging can detect variants at 5% allele fraction and with increased coverage fusions down to 1% allele fraction can be efficiently detected! Whole genome optical mapping for fusion detection is surely going to play an increasing role in cancer research going forward.</p><p id="Par4833"><bold>A. Hastie:</bold> A.

The most common oxidative DNA lesion at the telomeres is 8-oxoguanine which is mainly removed by OGG1, initiating base excision repair pathway. Given that telomere maintenance is crucial for cancer progression, OGG1 inhibition could represent an attractive and unexplored opportunity for compromising telomere integrity in cancer cells.</p><p id="Par4844"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We characterized OGG1 repair dynamics at telomeres in the U20S cancer cell line and we investigated the consequences at telomeres of either CRISPR-Cas9 mediated OGG1 depletion or pharmacological OGG1 inactivation with the recently developed OGG1 inhibitor TH5487.</p><p id="Par4845"><bold>Results:</bold> we found that OGG1 is recruited to the telomeres in response to oxidative stress.

Shelterin is composed of TRF1, TRF2, TIN2, Rap1, TPP1 and POT1. Within shelterin, TIN2 interacts with TRF1, TRF2, and TPP1. TIN2 contributes to telomere protection and is critical for limiting telomerase-mediated telomere elongation. We identified novel germline variants in exon 5 of <italic>TINF2</italic> (encoding TIN2) in four probands affected by multiple malignancies. Three probands shared c.604G&gt;C, which results in alternative splicing causing early truncation of the protein. This variant was maternally inherited in two probands. The second variant, c.557del (p.(Ser186fs), causes a premature stop codon. These six individuals in this study developed 13 malignancies, including three papillary thyroid cancers and three breast cancers. No LOH or second hits in <italic>TINF2</italic> were observed in three tumors tested. The truncated TIN2 proteins encoded by c.604G&gt;C and c.557del do not interact with TRF1, a main factor in telomere length control. Consistent with loss of TRF1 binding, three patients had lymphocyte telomere lengths in the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile. CRISPR/Cas9 edited RPE1 cells heterozygous for the <italic>TINF2</italic> variants showed that the truncated TIN2 proteins do not cause telomere damage or genome instability but result in telomere elongation. The data establish that the <italic>TINF2</italic> variants predispose to cancer through inappropriate telomere elongation and suggest that telomere shortening is a potent tumor suppressor pathway in multiple cancer types. We suggest that previously described cancer-predisposing POT1 variants also act through inducing telomere elongation rather than by generating genome instability.</p><p id="Par4859"><bold>I.

It is highly aggressive disease, more common occurring in younger women and is associated with hereditary forms of breast cancer caused by pathogenic mutations, mostly in the BRCA1/2 genes.</p><p id="Par4888"><bold>Methods:</bold> In the present study, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to analyze mutations in FFPE (formalin fixed embedded) tissues samples of 12 patients with triple-negative breast cancer (mean agewas 50,8 years). Target enrichment with coding sequences of APC, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, CDH3, CDK4, CHEK2, MET, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH, NBN, PALB2, PMS2, PTEN, RET, STK11, TP53, VHL genes was done using Nimblegen (Roche) custom panel of oligonucleotide probes. The sequencing was performed on MiSeq Illumina platform with coverage up to1000x.</p><p id="Par4889"><bold>Results:</bold> Both germline and somatic mutations in tumor cells have been identified comparing sequencing results from paired tumor and normal tissue samples. Two pathogenic germline mutations were found in the BRCA1 gene (185delAG,3347delAG), mutations in the BRCA2 (886delGT) and TP53(c.733G&gt;A) genes. Pathogenic somatic mutations were found in the MUTYH (c.734G &gt; A), PTEN (c.640C&gt;T) and TP53 (c.637C &gt; T) genes. The genotyping results were compared with clinical data.</p><p id="Par4890"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Triple-negative breast cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases. Knowledge of genetic profiles and identification of predictive biomarkersis important for further improvement of therapy results.

A crucial step in this workflow is isolating intact UHMW gDNA. For routine study of leukemic samples, we developed Bionano Prep SP kits for rapid, solution phase, isolation of UHMW gDNA from blood and BMAs. We also developed a rare variant bioinformatic pipeline that detects SVs at 5 % allele fraction. Together, these can potentially replace a suite of “classical” cytogenetic tests for leukemia analysis (karyotyping, FISH, CNV microarrays) with a single Bionano Genome Imaging analysis. For solid tumors, we developed a novel protocol to isolate UHMW gDNA from small amounts (≤ 10 mg) of fresh frozen tissues. Homogenized tissues are processed with the Bionano Prep SP kit, where lysis is coupled with purification steps to bind, wash and elute UHMW gDNA. With this protocol, a batch of 8 samples can be processed in &lt;6h. Eluted UHMW gDNA (3-19 µg DNA/10 mg) is compatible with Direct Label and Stain protocol. When run on a Saphyr Chip, the purified gDNA gives high throughputs (&gt;1.3 Tbp/sample in 24h) with excellent single molecule metrics of DNA size (N50&gt;150 kbp of 260-300 kbp) and mapping rate (80-92%), sufficient for use in SV analysis of cancer genomes from solid tumors. This protocol has been tested on fresh frozen human tumors including liver, lung, kidney, bladder, brain, colon, thyroid, prostate, breast, and ovary. A comprehensive analysis of SVs in these tumors will be presented.</p><p id="Par4895"><bold>H.B. Sadowski:</bold> A. Employment (full or part-time); Significant; BioNano Genomics. <bold>Y.

Metastases develop in approximately 50% of patients with poor prognosis regardless of treatment. UM tumors generally acquire unusually few somatic mutations. Eight genes are recognized as drivers of its tumorigenesis, typically consisting of one mutually exclusive mutation in <italic>GNAQ, GNA11, PLCB4</italic> or <italic>CYSLTR2</italic> followed by one mutually exclusive mutation in <italic>EIF1AX</italic>, <italic>SF3B1, SRSF2</italic> or <italic>BAP1</italic>. Germline variants that predispose to UM have been described in <italic>BAP1</italic>. Recently, germline loss-of-function (LOF) variants in the methyl-CpG binding domain-4 (<italic>MBD4)</italic> gene were found in four patients with UM. Loss of functional MBD4 induces a hypermutated profile, making tumors susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Interface A is important for VCB-complex formation, interface B forms the HIF-α binding site, and interface C plays a role in the Cullin-2 interaction. Twelve patients had a mutation that corresponds with interface C, 11 patients in interface A, and 9 patients in interface B. One patient had a whole gene deletion. An aggressive ocular phenotype was most observed in patients with mutations in interface C (75%), followed by interface B (44.4%) and interface A (18.2%).

The 22q11.2 region involved in the deletion is quite complex and contains highly repetitive low copy repeats (LCR), DNA sequences that make the region susceptible to recurrent genomic rearrangements. Our studies, as well as others in the literature, indicate that 22q11.2 deletion syndrome results in a wide variety of heterogeneous clinical signs, such as congenital cardiac malformations, characteristic facial features, immune deficiency, and psychiatric disorders. One of the hypotheses lies in the fact that allelic variation, such as indels, within the non-deleted 22q11.2 allele or in other genes outside the 22q11.2 region could influence the phenotype outcome of the 22q11.2DS.</p><p id="Par4932"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We performed Ion Ampliseq in peripheral blood from 60 22q11.2DS patients to sequence seven candidate genes (CRKL, MAPK1, HIRA, TANGO2, PI4KA, ZFPM2, and JAM3), located in and outside the 22q11.2 hemizygous region.

Scrutinizing these structures unraveled their importance during evolution. LCRs play an important role in the disease mechanism of genomic disorders as well. Non-allelic homologous recombination between chromosome 22 LCRs (LCR22s) cause the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. LCR22-A hypervariability was uncovered in human. However, it remains unknown whether such variability is human specific or is also a feature of other primates.</p><p id="Par4939"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> The LCR22 variability in the Great Apes was charted using an LCR22-specific fiber-FISH. The structures of five chimpanzees, one bonobo, two gorillas, and six orangutans were de novo assembled to assess the level of inter- and intraspecies variation. In addition, we used Bionano optical mapping to chart the overall 22q11.2 structure of the orangutans.</p><p id="Par4940"><bold>Results:</bold> The chimpanzee and bonobo harbored the smallest LCR22-A allele observed in humans, containing core duplicons, without intra-species variation. The gorilla haplotype had small expansions compared to the chimpanzee. In contrast, the overall 22q11.2 region is different in the orangutan, including rearrangements in the sequence between the LCR22s, intra-individual structural variation, and LCR22-A haplotypes not resembling the human ones.</p><p id="Par4941"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> For the first time, the LCR22s subunits were evolutionary charted and uncovered lineage-specific differences. The LCR22-A hypervariability is human specific, since no structural variation was observed in chimpanzee or bonobo. This suggests an important role of the locus in human adaptation and evolution.</p><p id="Par4942"><bold>Funding:</bold> FWO GOE1117N, Jerome Lejeune Project 1665</p><p id="Par4943"><bold>L.

No MLID causative mutations were identified by WES.</p><p id="Par4949"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This is the first reported case in which methylation analyses was extended to extraembryonic tissues, and results suggest that caution is required when attempting prenatal diagnosis in similar cases. Although the causative mechanism of LOM remains unsolved, the XCI pattern, along with mosaic LOM, suggests that both twinning and LOM/MLID occurred after XCI commitment.

In order to develop a pipeline for the identification of SVs from short-reads WGS data that can be translated into transferred to clinical purposes we tested 7 previously published (publically available) algorithms for SV identification and evaluated their Sensitivity and False-Discovery-Rate. We observed variable level of sensitivity (36-87%) depending on the tool and SV type and size. Read-depth approaches worked better for large deletions (79-86%), while combined paired/split-reads approaches gave better identification of small deletions (81-94%). High sensitivity was found for insertions (93%) and inversions (96-100%). As described by others, we report a high number of False Positives (FP) (10<sup>2</sup>-10<sup>3</sup>) as main issue. To reduce FP, we decided to use one to two tools for each SV type and selected the one with highest sensitivity. After filtering based on quality parameters, SVs were annotated using annotSV and candidate SVs were selected based on frequency, involved genes and inheritance pattern. We applied the approach to a first set of 8 patients for whom no genetic cause was identified using aCGH and panel targeted whole exome sequencing a few years ago.

Commonly observed in cancer, chromothripsis-like rearrangements also occur as a rare event in the germline. We investigated 10 cases with congenital complex or even chromothripsis-like rearrangements and surprisingly mild phenotypes, despite massive large-scale rearrangements. To understand and predict the pathogenic effects of rearrangements, a reconstruction of the shattered chromosomes with precise mapping of the breakpoints is needed. However, due to the high error rate in breakpoint detection by short-read whole-genome sequencing this remains challenging.</p><p id="Par4988">Here, we address these issues by combining Hi-C with PacBio long-read sequencing for the reconstruction of patient genomes. Hi-C was very efficient and sensitive in detecting large scale rearrangements and provided a global coarse-grained atlas of the fusion events and information on their layout. In contrast, PacBio reads provided fine-grained local information of breakpoints, due to long (10-50 kb) reads and the reduced sensitivity to repetitive regions. Hi-C was used to evaluate the breakpoint calls obtained from PacBio sequencing thereby reducing the candidate list to 5-50 rearrangements &gt; 5 Mb per individual. In a next step, the derivative chromosomes were reconstructed using both technologies jointly. The potentially pathogenic effects of these highly rearranged genomes were assessed by mapping the breakpoints in the context of 3D chromatin structure and topologically associated domains (TADs). Thus, we present an efficient method for the reconstruction and evaluation of shattered chromosomes in a cohort of individuals with chromothripsis-like rearrangements.</p><p id="Par4989"><bold>R.

Recent advancements in sequencing technology, however, have opened up new avenues for studying and characterizing global genomic IR-induced effects. Here, we present our investigation of putative IR-induced mutation signatures in whole genome and exome sequencing datasets of human gingiva fibroblasts (HGFs), which were exposed to increasing doses of X-radiation in combination with different post-exposure repair intervals. For our analyses we developed a bioinformatics workflow incorporating three stringent filtering steps for the removal of non-IR induced variants, to eliminate sequencing errors and to remove variants with low sequencing coverage. We studied the accumulation of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) as well as insertions and deletions (Indels) and statistically analyzed the accumulation of variants with respect to different genomic features such as cytogenetic bands and topologically associating domains (TAD). SNVs showed low transition/transversion (Ti/Tv) mutation ratios, while the number of deletions exceeded the number of insertions. SNVs in gene sets related to stress response and DNA-repair, were situated mostly in intronic, up- or downstream regions and sequence ontology analyses showed that they were mostly neutral without effects on protein function. Taken together, our results provide evidence for a characteristic genomic meta-signature of variants after IR exposure. Furthermore, effects related to structural and/or functional chromatin domains of particular chromosomal areas were noted, which may reflect DNA repair pathway choice.</p><p id="Par4993"><bold>N.

To understand the extent and characteristics of missing information, we juxtaposed GRCh38 with high-contiguity genome assembly (AK1) of a Korean, to show that ~53.4 Mbp of AK1 sequences (~1.8% of genome) were missing in GRCh38, which harbors ~1,390 putative coding elements. To validate the possible information loss, we analyzed the “unmapped” (to GRCh38) reads of fourteen individuals’ deep sequencing data (5 East-Asians, 4 Europeans, and 5 Africans), to find that ~5.3 Mbp of previously deserted unmapped sequences were recovered by using AK1 as reference. The recovered regions included 38 globally shared (≥7 individuals out of 14) regions with &gt;25 candidate coding elements. We also verified that many of these common missing regions in GRCh38 existed in multiple populations and a chimpanzee by PCR analysis.

No assessment of their prevalence has yet been made in consanguineous populations.</p><p id="Par5001"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> DNA from 225 severely obese probands (BMI-SDS&gt;3.5), were first screened for the mutations in <italic>LEP</italic> and <italic>MC4R</italic> genes by Sanger sequencing. This was then followed by an in-house developed augmented whole-exome sequencing (CoDE-seq) enabling direct and simultaneous detection of CNVs and point mutations in coding regions. The variants associated with obesity were graded according to ACMG criteria to predict pathogenicity.</p><p id="Par5002"><bold>Results:</bold> We report 110 cases (49%) with 55 different pathogenic variations (49 point mutations; 6 CNVs), in known monogenic obesity genes: Point mutations were identified in <italic>LEP</italic>, <italic>LEPR</italic>, <italic>MC4R</italic> and <italic>ADCY3</italic> (47%, 14%, 11% and 3.5% of cases, respectively).

NF1 mutations are generally associated to Neurofibromatosis type 1, an autosomal dominant disease characterised by café-au-lait spots and neurofibromas. Studying the NF1 gene has been challenging over the years due to its large size and the similarity it shares with over seven NF1 pseudogenes.</p><p id="Par5009"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Forty patients with suspected or confirmed clinical diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1, were screened with NGS (Haloplex and Sureselect panels from Agilent), Sanger sequencing and MLPA (MRC-Holland) for NF1 copy number detection.</p><p id="Par5010"><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-nine patients (73%) harboured pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in NF1, of which 11 (37%) variants were novel. Eight (28%) of all variants were nonsense, 8 (28%) were missense, 6 (21%) were located on splice sites (3 were investigated and resulted in exon skipping), 1 (3%) was an Indel and 6 (21%) were all novel frameshift variants. Two (5% of all patients), harboured an NF1 multi-exon deletion, and a whole NF1 gene deletion, respectively.

Its etiology is multifactorial with a strong genetic component, which is supported by previous identification of 45 risk loci through GWAS. As the majority of risk loci map to non-coding regions, molecular effects on gene regulation or chromatin organization have been suggested. However, the translation of genetic findings into pathomechanisms is challenging, due to the early embryonic time point of facial development and thus, the lack of accessible relevant human tissues for functional analyses. Our group has previously shown that associated risk variants for nsCL/P are strongly enriched in active regulatory elements of human neural crest cells (hNCCs). To unravel genomic interactions and possible target genes of associated variants, we are performing circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) in hNCCs. We selected one novel risk locus on chr.20q13 to establish the method. According to GTEx, the lead SNP is an eQTL for <italic>EYA2</italic> in multiple tissues. Notably, <italic>EYA2</italic> is a developmental gene expressed in hNCCs that is involved in cellular mechanisms such as migration and apoptosis. Our preliminary data based on the viewpoint around the sentinel SNP suggest an interaction between its region and the promoter region of <italic>EYA2</italic>. Analyses using the promoter region of <italic>EYA2</italic> as a second viewpoint and allele-specific investigations are currently on the way, to validate the interaction. Overall, our approach will help to identify target genes that are involved in the molecular pathology of nsCL/P at GWAS loci.</p><p id="Par5016"><bold>R. Hollstein:</bold> None. <bold>J.

Four autosomal-dominant PFBC genes have been reported. Haploinsufficiency of <italic>SLC20A2</italic>, which encodes an inorganic phosphate (Pi) importer, is a major cause of PFBC. During the analysis of exome sequencing data of 71 genetically unexplained unrelated PFBC patients, we detected an 8p11.21 deletion, mapping 35 kb upstream of <italic>SLC20A2</italic> and segregating with PFBC in 3 patients, and assessed its consequences on gene function.</p><p id="Par5027"><bold>Methods:</bold> We explored <italic>SLC20A2</italic> blood expression by RT-ddPCR, performed an ex vivo Pi uptake assay and we deleted a putative <italic>SLC20A2</italic> enhancer mapping to this region in HEK293 cells by CRISPR/Cas9.</p><p id="Par5028"><bold>Results:</bold> The deletion carriers/normal controls ratio of relative <italic>SLC20A2</italic> mRNA levels was 60.2% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).

Here we report a fetus referred for prenatal diagnosis due to cleft palate and left hydronephrosis uncovered during second trimester ultrasound. Affymetrix Cytoscan 750 CMA revealed a 6,7 Mb interstitial gain at 22q12.2q13.1 and a 2,1 Mb terminal loss at 22q13.32q13.33, in a male fetus.

To exclude a complex rearrangement and evaluate recurrence risk karyotype was performed both in the fetus and the parents revealing a de novo ring chromosome 22 in all cells analyzed. While terminal deletions in ring chromosomes are expected, the non-contiguous gain/loss identified here questions whether this ring could have been generated by a mechanism of chromothripsis/chromoanagenesis, as recently described in a child with PMS and a complex ring 22. Although the duplicated region was considered of unknown clinical significance, the cleft palate observed in the fetus has not been described in PMS patients and may be a consequence of this more complex rearrangement.

Multiple antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and hormonal treatment were not effective, the best effect was on the combination Carbamazepine with Levetiracetam. Severe developmental and motor regress, autistic traits, muscle hypotonia with high tendon reflexes, ataxia were reported at 2 y.o.

We describe two previously unknown missense variants confirmed to be <italic>in-cis</italic> configuration each of them with the S mutation, and demonstrated that they modify the properties of the PiS allele in terms of higher AAT intracellular retention and no extracellular secretion. Plasma samples from patients carrying these combinations confirmed null-phenotype behavior.

In addition, a previous study identified an autosomal dominant mutation in <italic>AP4E1</italic> gene to be associated with persistent stuttering. The aim of the present study was to characterize the phenotype of a pediatric patient displaying significant psychomotor retardation, intellectual disability and paraplegia.

The pediatric patient showed severe delayed psychomotor development, impaired global physical development and general illness. Movement disorders were evident during the neonatal period. Moreover, magnetic resonance imaging identified hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. The proband DNA was tested by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and array comparative genomic hybridization. Subsequently, next generating sequencing (NGS) was performed in the patient, and Sanger sequencing was performed in his family members.

Creating such catalogs for small variants from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data is now commonly done for thousands of individuals collectively. We have transferred this joint calling idea from SNPs and indels to larger deletions and developed the first joint calling tool, PopDel, that can detect and genotype deletions in WGS data of tens of thousands of individuals simultaneously as demonstrated by our evaluation on data of up to 49,962 human genomes. Good sensitivity, precision and the correctness of genotypes are demonstrated by extensive tests on simulated and real data and comparison to other state-of-the-art SV-callers. PopDel detects deletions in HG002 and NA12878 with high sensitivity as shown by the large overlap with different high-confidence reference call sets while maintaining a low false positive rate. On data of up to 6,794 trios, inheritance patterns are in concordance with Mendelian inheritance rules and exhibit a close to ideal transmission rate of 49.6%. PopDel reliably reports common, rare as well as de novo deletions and the deletions reflect reported population structure. Meaningful quality measures and metrics of the variants like genotype quality, variant likelihood ratio and allele frequency within the cohort are reported along with the variants, enabling further downstream analysis. Therefore, PopDel enables routine scans for deletions in large-scale sequencing studies and we are currently in the process of implementing the detection of other SV-types.

In this study, we hypothesize that the extra-copy of chr21 may change the chromatin 3D structure, which in turn may affect gene expression. We have used HiC experiments in 3 primary fibroblast cell lines from a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for T21 (to eliminate the noise of the genome sequence variation). We have also used transcriptome, Lamin-associated domains (LAD from PMID, and 24740065) H3K4me3 datasets from fibroblasts. No differences between T21 and euploid cis-chromatin interactions (TADs) were detected. We have, however, observed significant differences in higher-order chromatin contacts, largely explained by differences in A/B compartmentalization. Remarkably, we have detected 83 genomic regions (&gt;1Mb) that change the compartment in T21 (from B to A, or A to B). These reorganized regions (ΔABt21) comprise a total of ~250 Mb of the genome. Genes within ΔABt21 regions display a dysregulated expression in T21: upregulated in the A, and downregulated in the B compartment. A substantial number of the ΔABt21 regions are constitutive annotated as LADs suggesting a partial repositioning of sequences at the nuclear envelope components to the transcriptionally active compartment in T21. A fraction of the observed differences were also observed in comparisons between unrelated T21 and euploid fibroblasts. In conclusion, we have identified measurable chromatin structure differences in T21 versus an euploid nucleus, that likely result in gene expression differences in T21.</p><p id="Par5071"><bold>I.

In particular, the N-Terminal, Transmembrane linker pore region (TLP) and C-Terminal regions were used to assess the variant position. Subsequently, four conservative helical regions, within the C-terminal, were incorporated in the analysis. The GnomAD population was used as a control. Our analysis revealed that missense variants localized in the TLP have the highest probability for pathogenicity (expected predictive value (EPV)=98,4. Within the TLP, the pore and interlink domains showed the highest EPV, 100%, and 99.8 % respectively. Hence results confirmed the critical role of the four helical regions within the C- terminal.

Here, we studied a family case with a multiple abortion history and four affected members showing neurological defects. The index case is a three-year-old girl characterized by corpus callosum hypoplasia, bilateral cleft palate, speech delay and facial dysmorphisms. The father, paternal aunt and grandmother showed partial corpus callosum hypoplasia, psychiatric disorder and short stature, respectively. By conventional cytogenetics, we detected an unbalanced reciprocal translocation t(4;8)(p15.2;q12) segregating in the four individuals through three-generation. Array-CGH showed a 5,8 Mb duplication at 4p15.32-p15.2 in all the translocation carriers. In order to better characterize the chromosomal rearrangement, we performed a whole genome sequencing (WGS) 50x of the proband, father and grandmother. As a result, we revealed the hidden complexity of the translocation event classified as chromoanasynthesis. Taking advantage from discordant reads and coverage depth, we detected six breakpoints clustered within 12,6Mb on 4p and 8q arms, duplications, deletions and inversions, defining the intricate genomic architecture of the translocation. All the breakpoints were confirmed by sanger sequencing, showing that only NKAIN3 is disrupted in its intron. NKAIN3 has not been associated with any known human disease, but its high expression in corpus callosum highlights the gene as a potential candidate for the neurological findings. Our data call for WGS as first tier genomic analysis in order to properly delineate the complexity of chromosomal rearrangements and shed light on the genotype-phenotype association.</p><p id="Par5089"><bold>P.

This was most efficient in cases with a distinct clinical diagnosis. We highlight the importance of the analysis of non-coding regions beyond the non-canonical splice-sites.

Although usually clinically recognizable, the syndrome has a considerable phenotypic variation. We present six cases identified using MLPA and/or Array-CGH in our center in order to illustrate particularities found in our patients and correlate them with genotype. We identified 3 de novo interstitial 1p36 microdeletions of different sizes (2.48 Mb to 5.90 Mb) and 3 with reciprocal duplication (one patient with 4q35.1dup and two brothers with 14q32.33dup). All cases had a wide phenotypic spectrum. Most cases had perinatal distress and hypotonia. Constant features were severe intellectual disability and seizures. Even if straight eyebrows, deep-set eyes and pointed chin are considered highly suggestive for the diagnosis, they are present only in some of the cases. The particularities found in the ”pure” 1p36 microdeletions include: familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, pilonidal sinus, tall stature, obesity, rare eyebrows in external 1/3 (2 cases). The additional chromosomal anomalies present in 3 of the patients contribute to the phenotype severity, and additionally modify the clinical manifestations of 1p36 deletion. Analyzing the familial cases, we noticed that the same chromosomal anomaly generates distinct phenotypes in the two brothers. In conclusion, we are presenting six cases with 1p36 microdeletion to discuss the frequency of definitory features and illustrate particularities.</p><p id="Par5101"><bold>C.

The significance of unique interstitial copy number imbalances detected by this technique is largely informed by the carrier status of the parents, who are generally tested by targeted array CGH. If neither parent carries the imbalance, further studies may be carried out using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) to establish if either parent carries a balanced chromosome rearrangement. In the absence of such a rearrangement, their recurrence risk approaches zero; however, a balanced rearrangement results in a 50% risk of imbalance in future pregnancies. Since 2008, our centre has tested approximately 50,000 patients, with imbalances detected in ~22%; after parental array CGH testing 1,083 imbalances were not detected in either parent. Parents and probands of 203 non-LCR-mediated cases were tested using FISH probes targeted at the regions of imbalance. Deletions represented 175 of these cases, one of which was inherited from a parent with a balanced rearrangement (ins(1;11)). There were 28 duplications, 27 of which were tandem, and the other inherited from a parent with a balanced rearrangement (ins(6;4)). The overall prevalence of parental balanced rearrangements in these cases is therefore 2/203 (~1%). This figure is lower than that previously published, and may indicate that testing for these rearrangements may not be financially justified. Interestingly, we found no cases of de novo duplications caused by insertion of the duplicated region into a distant locus, indicating that this mutational event is rare.</p><p id="Par5105"><bold>S.

Following the identification of fœtal anomalies, molecular diagnostic investigations using CMA will diagnose a clinically significant subchromosomal copy number variation (CNV) in approximately 6% of pregnancies. We performed a retrospective study including 626 fetuses referred to Genetic Medicine in Geneva Hospitals, Switzerland, between 2013 and 2019. The cohort consisted of 458 amniotic fluids and 168 chorionic villi. Referrals for abnormal ultrasound findings were the most frequent indication. Other indications were: high risk for trisomy in maternal serum screening or NIPT, advanced maternal age and family history of chromosomal abnormalities. Cytogenetic investigations included Agilent 44K oligonucleotide array-CGH and karyotyping analysis. Array-CGH identified pathological numerical or large structural rearrangements in a total of 32 cases (5%) and microdeletions/duplications associated to known syndromes in 16 foetuses (2,5%). Variants of unknown significance were identified in 10 pregnancies (1,5%).Conventional karyotyping identified 2 additional aberrations with one de novo balanced translocation and one case of low trisomy 16 mosaicism. After years of experience, our center has developed a strong technical and clinical experience of CMA testing in prenatal diagnosis. This approach improves the yield of chromosome aberration detection for fetuses with abnormal ultrasound scans. In addition, karyotyping remains useful for the mechanistic explanation of chromosome rearrangement and prevention of recurrence in some cases.</p><p id="Par5109"><bold>S.

The pregnancy had occurred after intracytoplasmic sperm injection. The girl presented with difficulties of feeding, speech and motor delay, microcephaly, brachycephaly, and unspecific craniofacial dysmorphism. The cranial MRI was unremarkable. Array analysis discovered a heterozygous deletion of approximately 156kb in 2p16.1, <bold>confirmed in the child and excluded in parents</bold> by quantitative PCR. This deletion encompasses exclusively the entire <italic>BCL11A</italic> gene. Sequence variations in <italic>BCL11A</italic> (MIM 606557) are associated with the autosomal-dominant Dias-Logan syndrome (MIM 617101). Larger deletions including the <italic>BCL11A</italic> and neighboring genes were found in patients with the 2p16.1-p15 deletion syndrome (MIM 612513). Both syndromes are characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, microcephaly, dysmorphic features and persistent fetal hemoglobin. Deletions in 2p16.1 comprising only the <italic>BCL11A</italic> gene are rarely reported. Until now, only two patients with a <italic>BCL11A</italic> deletion were described. The patient described by Balci et al. (2015) showed brain malformations, developmental delay and distinctive facial features. Peter at al.

In summary, this is the third patient described with entire but exclusively deletions of <italic>BCL11A</italic>. These patients demonstrate features of Dias-Logan syndrome which broadly overlap with 2p16.1-p15 deletion syndrome and support the assumption that <italic>BCL11A</italic> is the candidate gene of most findings seen in patients with 2p16.1-p15 deletion.</p><p id="Par5113"><bold>A.

The authors present the case of an asymptomatic 32 year-old male with non-consanguineous parents from European and African ancestry, who received preconception genetic counselling at a medical genetics appointment. After having given his written informed consent for genetic testing, the patient was screened for carrier status for the most common variants of cystic fibrosis (CF) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), sickle cell anemia (SCA) and thalassemia, and balanced chromosomal anomalies by karyotype. No pathogenic variants were found on the CF and SMA screening and no anomalous results were found for SCA and thalassemia. However, in three independent cultures, the patient’s blood karyotype revealed a 46, XY line and another line with a translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22, designated as Philadelphia chromosome, well-known to be associated with hematologic malignancy. The karyotype was thus: 46,XY,t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[6]/46,XY[33]. He was counselled for the test results and a complete blood count was performed immediately showing an elevated white blood count with 2% blasts, thrombocytosis, and hemoglobin values on the lower limit of normal. He was diagnosed with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia and initiated treatment with imatinib with a good clinical evolution.

She was otherwise healthy with normal development. Karyotyping of fibroblasts from hyperpigmented and normal skin, revealed mosaicism with a triploid cell line (69,XXX) in 39% and 24% respectively. CMA verified mosaicism in the hyperpigmented skin biopsy but failed to detect the low-grade mosaic in normal skin. A normal karyotype 46,XX was seen in blood.</p><p id="Par5148"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This case confirms, that diploid/triploid mosaicism can be seen in persons with normal development, representing one end of a broad phenotypic spectrum. Genetic testing is biased towards individuals with cognitive deficit, and it is therefore likely that diploid/triploid mosaicism is underdiagnosed in patients with normal development. While triploid mosaicism was seen by karyotyping in hyperpigmented as well as normal skin, CMA failed to detect the triploid cell line in normal skin, confirming that karyotyping is still a valid and useful diagnostic method for pigmentary anomalies.</p><p id="Par5149"><bold>M.S.

Microarray analysis can detect CNV’s at a high resolution level, but is unable to detect copy neutral SV’s. To get a deeper insight in such variants and to narrow down the breakpoint regions, we started a verification study using 20 samples with known chromosome and microarray analysis results using Bionano Genomics’ optical mapping technology. Bionano Genomics offers a complete workflow solution from sample preparation, DNA imaging and genomic data analysis enabling the identification of balanced and unbalanced SV’s. Ultrahigh-molecular-weight DNA (size 50kb to ≥ 1 Mb) was extracted from fresh human blood followed by a single direct-labeling enzymatic reaction to incorporate fluorophores at a specific 6-basepair sequence motif, yielding approximately 15 labels per 100 kb. The SAPHYR-Instrument loads samples into nanochannels linearizing the labeled sample DNA and visualizing the label pattern. An algorithm converts the images into molecules and aligns molecules ‘de novo’ to construct consensus genome maps. Cross-Mapping to a reference sequence enables an automated SV detection. In a runtime of about 24h, an effective coverage of approx. 318-381x (minimum required 80x for non-mosaic samples) was achieved with a total DNA (&gt;=150 kb) output of 1300 Gb and a map rate of 78-89%. We will discuss our results and demonstrate that this technology can be applied in a clinical diagnostic setting having the potential to replace conventional cytogenetics and microarray analysis.</p><p id="Par5201"><bold>J.

The PHMDS wide phenotypic variation is attributed partly to the type and size of 22q13 genomic deletion, partly to additional undefined factors. This deletion encompasses the <italic>SHANK3</italic> gene which is thought to be the critical gene for the neurodevelopmental features. We report the cytogenetic and molecular characterization of a constitutional de novo ring chromosome 22 (r(22)) in a patient with autism and language disorders Methods GTG-banding karyotype was performed according to standard protocols. Twenty metaphases chromosomes were examined with a 400-550 bands of resolution. Array-CGH analysis was performed by a CGX<sup>TM</sup> HD v1,1 4-plex array 180 k (PerkinElmer), with an average resolution of 40 kb in the backbone and 20kb in the regions of interest. Results Karyotype results were 46,XY,r(22)(p13q13.33). Array-CGH revealed a terminal deletion on the long arm of chromosome 22, involving region 22q13.33 with an estimated size of 734.84 Kb, including <italic>SHANK3</italic> gene; arr (GRCh19) 22q13.33(50,443,314-51,178,149)x1.

However, the possibility that this deletion leads the formation of a ring chromosome can only be evaluated by performing a karyotype which is also necessary to analyse the presence or absence of mosaicism respect to ring chromosome, and therefore, the clinical symptoms and evolution of the patient could have implications for genetic counselling.</p><p id="Par5205"><bold>M.

Only 9 patients with microdeletions spanning the 6q14.1 region including the <italic>PHIP</italic> gene have been reported with a phenotype similar to Chung-Jansen syndrome. However, these patients have a number of additional clinical findings, likely due to the deletion of adjacent genes in 6q14. Here, we report two interstitial deletions at 6q14.1 involving the <italic>PHIP</italic> gene, in two unrelated patients with a common phenotype of developmental delay, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, obesity and dysmorphic features. Methods and results: SNP-CGH analysis using Affymetrix Cytoscan HD microarray has been performed. A 642kb microdeletion at 6q14.1 (79,326,616_79,968,863 hg19) has been detected in the first female patient presenting with obesity, developmental delay, behavioral and facial abnormalities. A smaller 54 kb intragenic microdeletion at 6q14.1, spanning part of exon 8-exon 24 of the <italic>PHIP</italic> gene (79687488_79741515 hg19) has been detected in the second female patient presenting with behavioral problems, developmental delay, dysmorphic features. Her endocrine problems (other than obesity) included hypothyroidism, generalized hirsutism and precocious puberty. Conclusions: To our knowledge the 54 kb deletion is the smallest microdeletion described in this region by the use of SNP-CGH analysis. The patients we report here show clinical overlap with the phenotypic spectrum of previously reported in individuals with <italic>PHIP</italic> variants, which confirms that haploinsufficiency of PHIP is sufficient to cause Chung-Jansen syndrome. This is the first report of endocrine problems eg. Hirsutism, in Chung-Jansen syndrome.</p><p id="Par5209"><bold>A. Boughalem:</bold> None. <bold>D. Trost:</bold> None. <bold>A.

Structural variants (e.g. deletions) often accompany the formation of ring chromosomes, leading to neurodevelopmental disorders which severity strongly depends on the affected genes. However, the exact mechanism and biological effect of ring chromosomes is still unknown. Here, we present RD_P26, a 6-year old girl presenting hemifacial microsomia, developmental and speech delay, and a ring chromosome 21, 46,XX,r(21)(p11.2q22.3).</p><p id="Par5220"><bold>Methods:</bold> Characterization with chromosomal microarray, whole genome sequencing and breakpoint junction (BPJ) PCR unravelled three alternating deletions and two inversions with templated and non-templated insertions in the BPJs. Remarkably, this loss of genetic material, affecting 29% (70/242) of the protein-coding genes on chromosome 21, is not lethal. Moreover, the ring chromosome is stable through multiple passages of neuroepithelial stem cells (NES), differentiated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells. Furthermore, we analysed the transcriptome of NES from RD-P26 and compared the expression profile to two trisomy 21 patients and three healthy controls.</p><p id="Par5221"><bold>Results:</bold> 11.6% genes (2080/17831) were differentially expressed. Of the 171 genes located on chromosome 21, 24% (41/171) were differentially expressed. Within the three deleted segments, 19 genes were significantly downregulated and there were no significant upregulations, consistent with haploinsufficiency. Moreover, the downregulated gene expression was mirrored by an elevated gene dosage in the trisomy 21 patients.</p><p id="Par5222"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The hemizygous genes located within the deletions are considered as likely causing the patient’s phenotype, also other chromosomal rearrangements were found.

Trio exome sequencing, however, did not reveal a causative variant in SCN2A or other epilepsy-related genes. Chromosomal microarray analysis with an Affymetrix CytoScan HD Array revealed a copy number gain of 5,516 kb in 2q24.3q31.1 affecting 34 genes including the sodium channel gene cluster on 2q24.3.

For further characterization of the chromosomal aberration, we performed array CGH analysis and detected an almost 25 Mb large terminal duplication 15q24.3q26.3. The combination of these two methods showed a de-novo pure partial trisomy 15q with the karyotype 46,XX,der(22)t(15;22)(q24.3;p12). The Region 15q24.3-qter contains 151 proteins and is associated with overgrowth and developmental delay. In order to clarify the cause of the asymmetry, methylation-sensitive MLPA and qPCR was performed on mucosal cells of the left and right side. Triplicated copy number variation of 11p15.5 with unsuspicious methylation status was found in mucosal cells of the left side and is known for the growth retardation syndrome Silver-Russel and IMAGe. Subsequent quantitative PCR showed at least 20.8 Mb de-novo duplication 11p15.5p15.1. No mosaicism was found in mucosal cells of the right side.

These extra chromosomes appear in various morphological shapes, e.g. ring, inverted duplicated or centric minute chromosomes. Chromosome conformation capture technologies have the potential to detect structural variants and advanced the interpretation of altered gene expression caused by them. Applying these novel technologies could give new insights into the emergence of sSMCs and their genotype-phenotype correlation. In this study we applied Hi-C in lymphoblastoid cell lines from four samples of individuals presenting developmental delay carrying different sSMCs (1 ring, 1 inverted duplicated, 2 centric minute chromosomes). These samples were previously screened by FISH and aCGH. In addition we also performed RNA-seq to investigate dysregulation of genes included in the sSMC sequence, which when combined with Hi-C could uncover yet undiscovered mechanisms (e.g. enhancer adoption). Strikingly, Hi-C was able to detect the sSMCs and the breakpoints at a higher resolution compared to karyotype and aCGH. Furthermore, Hi-C helped to reconstruct the 3D genome architecture of sSMCs compared to their physiological counterparts. We show that the Hi-C technology is able to contribute substantially to the detailed characterization of sSMCs. Future studies will elaborate the cytogenetic and morphological characteristics further and eventually be able to explain and hopefully treat syndromes and phenotypes resulting from these chromosomal aberrations.</p><p id="Par5237"><bold>J.

Especially, a valid genotype/phenotype correlation is very difficult in patients with sSMCs originating from different parts of multiple chromosomes, because complex sSMCs can multiply all these effects. We report on a 39-year-old patient with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, infertility, small testicles, obesity, gynecomastia, hyperthyroidism, rheumatism and psychiatric problems, carrying a unique highly complex sSMC.</p><p id="Par5241"><bold>Methods:</bold> The patient´s lymphocytes and DNA from peripheral blood cells were analyzed by conventional chromosome analysis (GTG banding) and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH).

We report about a case of a 58 year old male patient with suspected CLL and t(11;14)(q13;q32), detected by chromosome banding analysis (CBA). Additional fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of the IGH and CCND1 loci (dual fusion probe) unexpectedly revealed two independent clones: One clone (1; 60%) harbored the fusion signal constellation for the standard translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) with corresponding IGH/CCND1 colocalization on derivative chromosomes (der) 11 and 14, respectively. The other clone (2; 40%) showed a variant translocation t(11;14), including the pathognomonically relevant IGH/CCND1 colocalization on der(11), but no fusion signal on der(14). Instead, the 3’CCND1 signal was found on an F-group-chromosome. Further FISH-analysis revealed the involvement of one chromosome 19 with isolated translocation of the 3’CCND1 region from 11q to 19p. Both clones 1 and 2 cannot be distinguished by CBA at 300 band levels. We suspect that the variant IGH/CCND1 rearrangement led to a fusion of 3’CCND1 and FSTL3 (follistatin-like-3) on chromosome 19, but due to the lack of commercially available FISH probes for this region this assumption could not be verified. The respective translocation t(11;19)(q13;p13) [CCND1/FSTL3] constitutes a very rare event with to date only one CLL case described. Impact on prognosis is unclear. As a conclusion, we recommend additional FISH analysis of the IGH and CCND1 loci in every case of cytogenetically assured t(11;14), in order to preclude cryptic variant rearrangements and to ensure proper disease monitoring.</p><p id="Par5248"><bold>C.

Routine SNP array analysis did not show any particularities, except two terminal regions of homozygosity, at 20p and 20q, which is suggestive for UPD. To confirm the possible presence of UPD, we requested parental samples and performed a SNP trio-analysis. SNP trio-analysis indeed confirmed the presence of UPD20, which showed of a maternal origin. Maternal UPD20, or upd(20)mat syndrome, is a very rare condition for which only a very limited number of cases are described in literature.

To illustrate the promising outcomes of our method, we showed that imputation quality for low frequency alleles can be improved by augmenting reference panels with AGs and that the RBM latent space provides a relevant encoding of the data, hence allowing further exploration of the reference dataset and features for solving supervised tasks.</p><p id="Par5264">Generative models and AGs have the potential to become valuable assets in genetic studies by providing a rich yet compact representation of existing genomes and high-quality anonymous substitutes for private databases.</p><p id="Par5265"><bold>B.

Hi-C technology has enabled high throughput analyses of chromatin conformation, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms of chromatin folding and gene regulation. However, conventional Hi-C methods can suffer from laborious workflows, sub-optimal analytical sensitivity and reproducibility, and prohibitively expensive sequencing requirements. Realizing these challenges, Arima developed a 6-hour Hi-C protocol that improves analytical sensitivity through rapid, reproducible, multiple restriction enzyme Hi-C chemistry. This improved Hi-C chemistry detects more loops from significantly reduced sequencing depth. For example, Arima-HiC identified &gt;12,500 loops in GM12878 cells from just 600 million raw reads.</p><p id="Par5276">New technologies are being built on the Arima-HiC platform. For instance, Arima developed an optimized low-input protocol proven to detect &gt;10,000 loops from 50,000 cells. Additionally, targeted genome conformation assays such as HiChIP and Capture-HiC have emerged. Our H3K27ac and H3K4me3 HiChIP data demonstrate reproducible detection of long-range gene regulatory interactions at a fraction of the cost as genome-wide Hi-C. Moreover, Capture-HiC enables discovery of chromatin loops around oncogenes and tumor suppressors at 500bp resolution, from only ~10M reads per genetic locus. Lastly, Arima-HiC data is emerging as powerful tool for genome-wide discovery of structural variants (SVs) in cancer genomes. Analysis of a human GIST revealed &gt;70 SVs, with several of these forming “neo-TADs”, bringing genes (or fusion genes) into new regulatory environments potentiating mis-regulation and enhancer hijacking. Overall, Arima-HiC aims to be a flexible protocol for multiple “C” assays (Hi-C, HiChIP, Capture-HiC) that will accelerate research across human genetics and epigenetics.</p><p id="Par5277"><bold>J.

We previously established a method for monitoring based on detection of SNVs by Taqman™ assays on a chip-digital PCR (chdPCR) platform (Thermofisher). This method enabled reliable monitoring on nearly 2,000 samples. However, substantial hands-on-time renders this platform less suitable for high sample throughput.

After careful data filtering, the sets of well characterized individual variants were used for, fingerprinting“ and relatedness determination. 35 000 SVs were detected in the Czech population, 8969 structural variants (SVs) per individual on average (median 9389). The number of detected SVs per individual is highly dependent on the mean coverage value. The sufficient coverage to capture all SVs in the sample should be significantly higher than the conventionally used value equal to 30. To test the genome wide analysis of SVs for relatedness determination, we used WGS data from 10 individuals belonging to a three-generation family. For the relationship category prediction, the following coefficients were computed by using package Demerelate in R: Bxy, Sxy, Mxy, rxy, Lxy, Li, Ioiselle, wang, wang.fin. The distributions of values of all these coefficients for different relationships were computed first using all detected variants as markers. Then the variants not having exactly identical genomic positions within all samples were removed. We demonstrated that WGS in association with appropriate bioinformatic tools is highly effective for SVs detection, the determination of their extent and population frequency. Our approach may lead to the successful determination of coefficients of relationships also for pairs with r=0.125. Supported by the Ministry of Interior of the Czech Republic grant no.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS), traditionally used for detection of small base-level genomic changes, is now gaining wider acceptance as a platform for detecting CNVs in addition to single nucleotide variants (SNVs). With the reduction in cost of whole-genome sequencing (WGS), many labs are considering using “shallow” WGS to replace microarrays for cytogenetic testing. To assess content and design of microarrays, we performed analytical analyses on ten commonly used SNP array platforms for cytogenetic testing offered by Illumina and Thermo Fisher/Affymetrix. The set of arrays included the Global Screening Array (GSA) and the Global Diversity Array (GDA) platforms from Illumina since they offer a very low-cost option. The analyses included number and coverage statistics on heterozygous probe distribution for detection of AOH events, probes spanning exons/genes, and distribution of probes genome-wide covering regions with clinical significance from sources such as ClinGen, OMIM, DDG2P, and including a number of additional genes strongly associated with constitutional and oncology testing.

Here we present accurate detection of variants in the human exome using the novel chemistry of the xGen Prism DNA library preparation kit, optimized for low-input and degraded samples, with xGen Research Exome v2.0 hybrid-capture enrichment. The IDT Exome v2 panel was used to carry out targeted sequencing of Prism DNA libraries generated from archival FFPE samples. The unique library preparation is enabled by an engineered mutant ligase and proprietary adapters that prevent chimeras and suppress dimer-formation, thereby maximizing the conversion of input DNA to sequencing libraries. We achieved high yields of library (300-400 ng) from input amounts as low as 25 ng for severely damaged FFPE samples (DIN 1-3), &gt;90% on-target rates and uniform depth of coverage (&gt;96% bases covered at &gt;20X and &gt;98% bases covered at &gt;10X) for FFPE samples across a wide range in quality. We also observed minimal exon drop-outs in difficult-to-target genes for severely damaged FFPE material. To validate the variant calling performance of the Prism-Exome workflow, we used the Horizon OncoSpan FFPE reference control which contains 1-92% AF SNVs and Indels and achieved &gt;98% sensitivity across ~250 SNVs and Indels. This study demonstrates that the xGen Exome Research v2, when combined with xGen Prism DNA library preparation, provides researchers with a complete human exome FFPE-sequencing solution with robust performance across FFPE samples of varying quality.</p><p id="Par5323"><bold>M.

The phenotype severity is often correlated with the extent of pathogenic expansion or contraction. Inherently, these repeats are unstable.

Most repeat disorders have no direct treatments.</p><p id="Par5336">Southern blotting is the current gold standard for analyzing pathogenic repeats. While sequencing-based methods are being developed, these efforts are hampered by limitations in read lengths and the repetitive and polymorphic nature of these regions.

In addition, a comprehensive streamlined workflow inclusive of sample preparation, DNA imaging, and genomic data analysis has been developed for high-throughput analysis of repeats of interest.</p><p id="Par5337">We recently demonstrated the utility of the platform by focusing on the D4Z4 repeat contraction on chromosome 4q35, which is a marker of FSHD when present on a permissive haplotype.

Mutation analysis allows early detection and treatment of at risk individuals, preventing cardiovascular morbidity. In Scotland, despite availability of testing to anyone fulfilling Simon Broome Criteria, it is estimated that 80% of individuals remain undiagnosed. Use of a screening array of known mutations has the potential to detect actionable mutations more cheaply, allowing testing of many more individuals and improving detection of pathogenic variants in the population.</p><p id="Par5342"><bold>Method and Results:</bold> We evaluated the potential clinical utility of an array based approach to mutation analysis for FH. In NHS Tayside, between 2010 and 2018, 37 pathogenic variants and 8 variants of uncertain significance were identified in <italic>LDLR</italic> in 75 individuals. We compared these to the manifest of the 2016 Illumina Infinium Global Screening Array-24 V2.0, containing 1077 mutations implicated in FH. All 26 of the pathogenic point mutations were present on the array, and 10/11 of the deletions had overlapping SNVs present- giving a potential coverage of actionable variants of 97%. 6/8 (75%) of variants of uncertain significance were also represented.</p><p id="Par5343"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We conclude that array technology for DNA mutation analysis has potential for screening for FH mutations in clinical practice. with the possibility of designing different clinical models for case identification.

Other practical considerations such as turnaround time, multiplexing capability and workflow simplicity or technological limitations such as index cross-contamination and index hopping with newer Illumina sequencing chemistries can also influence how readily NGS is applied to clinical tumor samples. Here we address these challenges by developing a complete but flexible workflow solution which is optimized for a wide range of DNA input (10-200 ng), various sample types (intact or FFPE samples), different shearing methods (mechanical vs. enzymatic), sequencing chemistries (2 × 100 bp or 2 × 150 bp), 90-minute or overnight bait hybridization, and up to 384 unique dual sample indices to eliminate index hopping. Furthermore, we incorporate duplex molecular barcodes at the ligation step to filter out PCR errors by making consensus calls using MBC information from both strands (duplex MBC), hybrid (duplex MBC where info is available), single strand (single MBC) or discard MBC information (no MBC), based on the application. While both duplex and single MBC improve the accuracy of low VAF detection compared to no MBC, duplex MBC enables the most effective error correction. As we will demonstrate, the number of false positive calls of low VAF (≤4%) for duplex MBC were reduced significantly by 74% and 93% compared to single MBC and no MBC, respectively.</p><p id="Par5348"><bold>B.

This study aims to determine the efficiency of whole exome sequencing (WES) as a first-tier diagnostic test to detect aberrations including CNVs and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in comparison with array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) for DD. Subjects (541) diagnosed with global developmental delay (GDD) or intellectual disability (ID) of unknown cause have been enrolled, and aCGH tests have a positive rate of 23.7% (111/468). Fragile X syndrome or Rett-like syndrome tests and treatable targeted NGS-based panel were also utilized for assessment. Furthermore, WES was performed on 34 cases with Agilent SureSelect target enrichment system using Illumina HiSeq2000. WES data were analyzed using Varseq v2.1.0 and Illumina BaseSpace Variant Interpreter. Trio analyses were performed on 24 aCGH-negative cases, thus far revealing 4 known rare pathogenic variants associated with GDD/ID. To determine the consistency in CNV detection between aCGH and WES tests, 10 aCGH-positive singletons were included. CNVs were detected in 11 out of 13 regions using WES. On average, 115 CNVs with <italic>p</italic>-values &lt; 0.01 were called per case. These CNVs ranged from 119bp to 15Mbp in span, with duplications accounting for 65.0% of total calls.

Circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) may provide sensitive and representative marker for that purpose. The project aimed at developing non-invasive genetic diagnostics and cancer monitoring, based on the liquid biopsy (LB) for cancer patients and people at risk. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) of 82 breast, colorectal or lung cancer cases was isolated from plasma. Additionally, breast and colorectal frozen tumours from 12 patients were collected together with the corresponding 9 blood samples. A deep coverage WGS of the tumour DNA and a standard coverage WGS for the corresponding germline DNA were performed to assess mutational burden and somatic CNVs in 10 patients. A shallow WGS (sWGS) and targeted breast cancer-related gene panel sequencing was performed for 80 LB samples. For 6 tumour samples most common PIK3CA somatic variants in breast cancer were identified (H1047R and E545K). None of these variants was uncovered in the LB samples, while somatic variants identified in ctDNA were missing in the tumour DNA. As expected, the CNV analysis performed for tumour samples allowed to distinguish subclonal tumour variations for the same patient. A method allowing breast cancer detection at a relatively early stage, based on sWGS and CNV analysis, was developed. Discrepancies observed between the tumour and the LB results may be partially due to clonal variants in the heterogenous tumour tissues, but it also suggests the need for a further improvement regarding sensitivity of liquid biopsy methods.</p><p id="Par5374"><bold>Funding:</bold> RPMA.01.02.00-14-6209/16.</p><p id="Par5375"><bold>A.

This approach overcoming the space-time profile constraint of tissue biopsies opens a new scenario also for vascular malformations due to somatic mosaicism. We propose here this approach as a fast non-invasive reliable tool for Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) diagnosis. Six patients group suffering from KTS were selected. Blood samples from both peripheral and efferent vein from vascular malformation were collected and cfDNA extracted. Tissue biopsies from vascular lesions were also collected. CfDNA libraries were performed using Oncomine™ Pan-Cancer Cell-Free Assay. Ion Proton for sequencing and Ion Reporter Software for analysis were used. Different mutations on <italic>PIK3CA</italic> gene were detected in all patients including p.Glu542Lys and p.Glu545Gly. The same mutation detected in tissue was detected in liquid biopsy with a variant allele frequency (VAF) ranging from 0,1-0,2% in cfDNA from peripheral vein to 1-2% in cfDNA from efferent vein. We demonstrate that cfDNA-NGS-Liquid Biopsy is able to identify the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation detected in affected tissues. Moreover, we have shown that blood sample withdrawal at the lesion site increases VAF rate with an order of magnitude above the limit of detection (usually 0,05%) lowering the risk of false negative. Finally, the non-invasiveness of the method avoids any risk of bleeding, being easily performed also in children. We propose this method as method of choice for KTS diagnosis and subsequent therapy tailored to the genetic defect. We acknowledge ILA association.</p><p id="Par5386"><bold>M.

Several methods exist for target capturing, most can be broadly categorised under PCR and CRISPR-Cas enrichment approaches. Here we report on the usage of long-range PCR to target capture large regions spanning rare de novo mutations linked to male infertility for sequencing with ONT for phasing analysis. Long-range PCR was used on 5-10kb regions to achieve minimum sequencing depths of &gt;2,000x coverage, &gt;10 fold that of CRISPR enrichments and &gt;90% less off-target sequencing. Individually unique target regions removed the necessity for barcodes, saving time, cost and yield. This approach allowed bringing costs to as little as €15 per sample in runs of 100 samples. The optimised method involved specialised primer design with our bespoke primer tool and improved PCR conditions, followed by sequencing on ONT MinION with adapted library preparation. Using input concentrations twice the standard recommendation achieved &gt;2-fold increased to previous yields. “Refuelling” flowcells mid-run with ATP-containing sequencing buffer restored nanopores from &lt;1% to &gt;80%, a further 6.8 fold increase in yield. More than 30 billion base calls are consistently obtained following this procedure, matching best-in field flowcell performance. Currently available methods for long-read sequencing and target capture can be expensive, time consuming and overly off target. Our proposed methodology provides a combination of common approaches that have been optimised to achieve greater results more efficiently.</p><p id="Par5390"><bold>L.E. Batty:</bold> None. <bold>B.

Short and/or simple SV are being successfully identified by cytogenetic techniques or short read sequencing, while large nested and complex rearrangements demand case-specific investigation via the application of novel emerging technologies. For a clinical case with developmental delay cytogenetic analysis revealed a large complex de novo chromosomal rearrangement.

PCR-free genomic library preparation methods were previously shown to improve whole genome sequencing (WGS) quality on the Illumina platform, especially in calling InDels.

We also assessed the process data performances with three variant calling pipelines.</p><p id="Par5402"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Reproducibly high-quality libraries were obtained with low coverage bias and less than 1% read duplication. Using machine learning (ML) methods (DeepVariant or DNAscope), variant calling performance (SNPs F-measure&gt;99.94%, InDels F-measure&gt;99.6%) exceeded widely accepted standards. Furthermore, PCR-free WGS libraries sequenced on the PCR-free DNBSEQ<sup>TM</sup> platform have up to 55% less InDel errors compared to the NovaSeq platform, confirming that DNA clusters contain PCR-generated errors. We also found some clinical relevant gene locis can only be detected by PCR-free DNBSEQ<sup>TM</sup>. Therefore, true PCR-free DNBSEQ<sup>TM</sup> WGS provides a powerful solution for improving WGS accuracy while reducing cost and analysis time, thus facilitating future precision medicine, cohort studies, and large population genome projects.</p><p id="Par5403"><bold>X.

Among the benefits of this technique are direct and PCR-free sequencing of RNA or DNA, native detection of basepair-modifications and full-length read sequencing. This has led to a number of interesting applications, also for clinical purposes. Here, we were especially interested in the detection of transcript isoforms during neuronal differentiation, thus making use of the capability of a nanopore sequencer to provide full-length transcript sequences. Previous studies have shown that during neuronal differentiation the 3’ends of transcripts can extend by several kilo-basepairs and the presence or absence of this feature conveys critical function. Moreover, key players in neuronal differentiation, such as the BDNF-gene have been shown to have several distinct isoforms, that specifically trigger different receptors, evoking varying signalling cascades. To investigate transcript isoforms during neuronal differentiation, we employed a differentiation protocol in a cell line of murine neuronal precursor cells. During differentiation, the cells were harvested on 4 timepoints. The RNA was converted to cDNA and library preparation for a nanopore sequencing device was done as per manufacturers specifications. Subsequently sequencing on a nanopore device and basecalling using the MinKNOW software followed. Conclusively, we were able to test the feasibility of nanopore sequencing in our lab and to investigate complex splice isoforms during neuronal differentiation.

Our optimal loading concentration for each application is 2.0 nM, 1.5 nM and 2.25 nM in standard workflow, respectively, resulting in 77 – 85% of clusters passing filter and low level of optical duplicates. We observed index-dependent differences in sequencing performance in the NovaSeq: libraries with certain indexes are consistently under- or overrepresented (27% less or 32% more than the average number of reads per library, calculated across 68 runs). In contrast, we observed little effect of insert size on clustering efficiency (for insert sizes ranging 265 – 476 bp in the same flowcell). The end-of-read quality scores are higher in the NovaSeq compared to HiSeq X Five, resulting in less sequencing errors. In contrast, we observed slightly increased systematic bias in C &gt; A and G &gt; T errors at the end of NovaSeq reads, possibly due to the dual channel technology. The reduction in run time is an important advantage over the HiSeq platform, for example in our emergency neonatal genome sequencing for Fastgenomics. In conclusion, NovaSeq produces more output in shorter time, with sequencing quality similar to previous generation of sequencers. However, the unprecedented plexity allowed by the large sequencing capacity of NovaSeq presents new challenges in pooling certain indexes.</p><p id="Par5411"><bold>Z. Gerber:</bold> None. <bold>J.

However, in certain cases, either due to the complexity or the location of the aberration, whole exome sequencing (WES) might not yield a pathogenic variant, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) may be required. We report herein four recent cases diagnosed in our lab, which were all initially missed by WES and later resolved only by sequencing the entire genome:1-Promoter mutation: Four patients of two unrelated families, with portal vein thrombosis and macrocephaly. WGS revealed the –270C&gt;G homozygous mutation, located in the promoter of the <italic>PIGM</italic> gene.2-Large deletions: Eight patients from 7 different families of Iraqi-Jewish origin with autosomal recessive intractable diarrhea of infancy. Linkage analysis with WGS enabled the detection of two overlapping deletions on chromosome 16.3-Intronic mutation: Two siblings with PS6 syndrome without mutation in the coding sequence of the candidate gene, <italic>ARSB</italic>. WGS, revealed deep intronic mutation in the gene, which leads to insertion of a pseudo-exon.4-Large duplication: Three female siblings of Iraqi-Jewish descent, presented with cerebellar ataxia, encephalopathy, seizures and cognitive disability. WGS with Bam file analysis identified a novel biallelic duplications in the <italic>COQ5</italic> gene. It is clear that WGS is a powerful tool, which can improve the rate of discovery of disease-causing mutations, especially in such challenging cases.

For complex diseases, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), precise correction of the associated mutation is crucial. Here, we generated and corrected iPSC lines from two AF patients carrying different heterozygous <italic>SHOX2</italic> mutations. In this context, we developed a novel strategy for the scarless correction of heterozygous mutations. It is based on a stochastic enrichment by sib-selection (subdivision of edited cells into small cell pools), followed by allele quantification via digital PCR and next generation sequencing to detect isogenic subpopulations. This method does not require the use of antibiotic selection or cell sorting and can be easily combined with existing improvements for gene editing such as modified Cas9 enzymes and base editors. By avoiding the insertion of silent mutations that are used to prevent re-cutting by Cas9, this method is suited for the correction of intronic or intergenic variants. The presented strategy helps to overcome the low efficiency of homology-dependent repair in iPSCs and therefore facilitates the generation of isogenic control lines that represent the gold standard for modeling complex cardiac diseases in vitro. In summary, we generated the first AF model using patient-specific and gene-corrected iPSCs and developed a novel method for the correction of heterozygous mutations.

We tried to assess the feasibility of fast genetic diagnosis by trio-GS (genome sequencing) in newborns and children requiring an urgent diagnosis for their care in a French hospital network. This study was designed to identify pitfalls and evaluate our capacity to deliver GS in emergency.</p><p id="Par5437"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> A French prospective multicentric pilot study included newborns or infants in neonatal or pediatric ICU, affected with severe phenotype that made suspect a genetic disease without obvious clinical diagnosis and required etiological diagnosis in emergency for guiding medical care. Pitfalls and duration of each biological step were noted. Every time the duration was above the expected limit, the causes were analysed and blockers handled.</p><p id="Par5438"><bold>Results:</bold> For the 34 newborns and infant included, the positive molecular diagnosis rate (IV and V classes variations) was 56% (19/34) and suggested care management changes for 47% (9/19) of the positive cases. The rapid trio-GS strategy allowed to obtain a median duration of 45 days (27 to 92) from blood sampling to results communication to the clinician. Especially during the first three months, we identified several pitfalls, causing steps longer than planned. Corrective measures or protocol adaptations enabled a clear decrease of such difficulties.</p><p id="Par5439"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Usefulness of rapid trio-GS is undeniable for patients in ICU, but requires adapting all stages of the classic circuit.</p><p id="Par5440"><bold>A.

Similarly, most DNA sequencing technologies struggle to faithfully sequence regions of low complexity. This has especially been trying for repeat expansion disorders such as Fragile X disease, Huntington disease and various Ataxias, where the repetitive elements range from several hundreds of bases to tens of kilobases. We have developed a robust, amplification-free targeted enrichment technique, called No-Amp Targeted Sequencing, that employs the CRISPR/Cas9 system. In conjunction with SMRT Sequencing, which delivers long reads spanning the entire repeat expansion, high consensus accuracy, and uniform coverage, these previously inaccessible regions are now accessible. This method is completely amplification-free, therefore removing any PCR errors and biases from the experiment. Furthermore, this technique also preserves native DNA molecules, allowing for direct detection and characterization of epigenetic signatures. The No-Amp method is a two-day protocol that is compatible with multiplexing of multiple targets and multiple samples in a single reaction, using as little as 1 µg of genomic DNA input per sample. We have successfully targeted a number of repeat expansion disorder loci (<italic>HTT</italic>, <italic>FMR1</italic>, <italic>ATXN10</italic>, <italic>TCF4</italic>, <italic>C9orf72</italic>) with alleles as long as &gt;2700 repeat unites (&gt;13 kb). Using the No-Amp method we have isolated hundreds of individual on-target molecules, allowing for reliable repeat size estimation, mosaicism detection and identification of interruption sequences - all aspects of repeat expansion disorders important for better understanding the underlying disease mechanisms.</p><p id="Par5451"><bold>J.

However, despite the considerable amount of research conducted in this field, the medical use of microRNAs as biomarkers and the translation of microRNA profiling into meaningful clinical data remain a work in progress. This scenario might be caused by the low reproducibility among studies and the low disease-specificity of the microRNAs reported as biomarkers. Here, we aimed to demonstrate that the selection of kit and protocol for smallRNAseq library preparation, the method of choice for microRNA profiling, can have a great impact in the inconsistency of the results. Starting from the same samples, we prepared smallRNAseq libraries using: three commercially available kits based on fixed adapter ligation, two based on degenerated adapters ligation, one based on template switch technology, and one based on monoadapter ligation and circularization, exploiting all current smallRNAseq library preparation methods. We identified strengths and weaknesses of each protocol regarding sensitivity, accuracy and reproducibility. In addition, we evaluated the use of unique molecular identifier sequences in two of these kits.

Today, several methods are used sequentially for variant analysis of thalassemia patients, adding costs and increasing turnaround times. These methods include, but are not limited to, GAP-PCR, Sanger sequencing and MLPA. Often, if a variant or deletion is found in one gene, analysis of the other gene is not performed.</p><p id="Par5475"><bold>Method:</bold> We developed an amplicon-based NGS method on the Illumina sequencers using a single oligo-mix to detect virtually all known variants for alpha and beta thalassemia. The method includes sequencing of HBB, HBA1 and HBA2 genes as well as direct detection of the most common deletions in alpha and beta thalassemia (GAP-PCR). Regions upstream and downstream of the above genes are sequenced to detect deletions by CNV analysis. The protocol is rapid and user-friendly, requiring less than one hour of hands-on time.</p><p id="Par5476"><bold>Results:</bold> Evaluation of 125 clinical samples revealed that all expected single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and deletions were detected.

Applications of RNA-sequencing have vastly expanded with improvements to low RNA input library preparation methods. Although analyzing low-input samples is necessary to answer certain biological questions, generating these libraries introduces greater biases with additional PCR cycles that amplify transcripts disproportionately. To better gauge true transcript abundance levels, unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) can be used to distinguish PCR duplicates from distinct original molecules. Accurate identification of such artifacts can significantly impact quantification of transcript abundance. To address this need in RNA-seq, we have developed barcoded adaptors incorporating UMIs.</p><p id="Par5496">We have developed 96 UMI-containing barcoded adaptors optimized across various RNA inputs (10 ng to 1 μg). Ligation of barcoded adaptors followed by PCR enrichment produced high-quality library and sequencing metrics (e.g. yields and coverage across transcript length). However, duplication rates significantly differed when utilizing traditional computational approaches to identify duplicates based on mapping position compared to analysis incorporating UMIs. As many as 90% of reads identified as duplicates using read position alone were determined to in fact originate from unique molecules, increasing the total number of reads available for further analysis.</p><p id="Par5497">In this study we show that incorporation of UMIs into RNA-sequencing analysis allows for a more accurate calculation of transcript abundance. Use of UMIs allows for identification of true read duplicates in RNA-seq, thereby increasing transcript detection accuracy and improving sensitivity of differential expression analysis. Furthermore, our adaptors incorporate barcodes during adaptor ligation allowing for PCR-free library pooling.</p><p id="Par5498"><bold>D. Posfai:</bold> A.

Patients have been grouped based on their clinical features: isolated NDD (developmental delay, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder and epilepsy); NDD plus (any of the previous plus an additional neurological, systemic or dysmorphic manifestation); NMD (neuromuscular disorders); NDG (neurodegenerative disorders); MCA (multiple congenital anomalies); and “others”.A definite diagnosis was achieved in 27,8% (90/324) and 26,5% (31/117) patients by CE and WES, respectively. The NDD and NDD plus groups represented 55% (243/441) of our patients, with a diagnostic yield ranging from 28.2% to 31.1% (WES and CE, respectively). Among the different clinical categories, diagnostic yield was highest in the NDG (15/38, 39.5% by CE) and MCA (6/18, 33.3% by WES) and lowest in the “others” (1/14, 7.1% by WES). Achieving a diagnosis is important for patients and their families, as it can alter clinical management and the provision of accurate genetic counseling.

The advantage of this technology is exhaustive random priming of the template DNA, which is crucial for minimizing amplification bias and improving genome coverage. Unlike most other WGA methods that either sacrifice specificity of copy number variation (CNV) detection for high genome coverage, or genome coverage for increased accuracy of CNV detection, AB-WGA provides nearly complete genome coverage while maintaining high accuracy of CNV detection. Genomic DNA from the biopsy material (3-10 cells) was extracted and amplified using AB-WGA kit. Libraries were sequenced using either Miseq reagent kit V3 (150 cycles) or NextSeq 500 reagent kit v2.5 (75 cycles). CNV-charts generation was performed using software developed by AB Vector. For comparison, we sequenced several trophectoderm biopsies (TE) samples using Illumina VeriSeq-PGS kit. CNV-charts showed 100% karyotype matching between Illumina VeriSeq-PGS and AB-WGA kits. We also analyzed CNV-charts of TE and the inner cell mass of embryos (ICM). We have observed high concordance between TE and ICM samples using the AB Vector technology. About 10% of samples have shown different karyotypes between TE and ICM, similar to the recent study (Victor et al. 2018). Performance of the new kit was quite satisfactory, featuring a simplified protocol, better throughput and improved CNV resolution. Further studies are required for validation of this technology in PGD for detection of monogenic disorders as well as for registration of the kit as an IVD medical product for use in reproductive genetics.</p><p id="Par5513"><bold>S.

FUDGE couples target-selected and strand-specific CRISPR/Cas9 activity for fusion gene driver enrichment - without prior knowledge of fusion partner or breakpoint-location - to long-read Nanopore sequencing with the bioinformatics pipeline NanoFG. FUDGE has flexible target-loci choices and enables multiplexed enrichment for simultaneous analysis of several genes in multiple samples in one sequencing run. We observe on-average 665 fold breakpoint-site enrichment and identify nucleotide resolution fusion breakpoints - within two days. The assay identifies cancer cell line and tumor sample fusions irrespective of partner gene or breakpoint-position. FUDGE is a rapid and versatile fusion detection assay, providing unparalleled opportunity for diagnostic pan-cancer fusion detection.

As such, WGS may replace SNP arrays and (clinical) Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) for the detection of CNVs and SNVs respectively. WGS is thought to outperform WES as it suffers from limited biases due to the PCR-free library preparation and the absence of capture. However, the B-allele frequency distribution (BAF) of WGS heterozygous variants deviates from the expected binomial normal distribution. An asymmetric enrichment of variants with low BAF (&lt;0.25) is observed in both Genome In A Bottle (GIAB) cell lines and patients, excluding cell culture artefacts as a source. No similar enrichment is observed for heterozygous variants with a high BAF (&gt;0.75). Applying more stringent quality thresholds to the data, such as extracting GIAB confident regions or increasing depth, diminishes the width of the distribution but does not remove it. GIAB data shows that filtering out variants with low BAF successfully diminishes the number of false positives but at the price of removing true positives. Such classical filtering strategies should thus be applied cautiously on real data sets.

In addition, sequencing reads were mapped to viral reference genomes, which indicated that 15 HL and 13 nHL cases had significantly elevated titers of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) at diagnosis. All patients that tested positive during routine EBV testing, had increased plasmatic viral read fractions.</p><p id="Par5533">Longitudinal analysis indicated that, when detectable, copy number patterns were similar across restaging moments in refractory/relapsed patients. Moreover, the overall anomaly of copy number profiles correlated with disease status.</p><p id="Par5534">Finally, predictive modeling demonstrates that LBs might aid in case of doubt between, e.g., HL versus nHL: receiver operating characteristic analysis produced an area under the curve of 0.972.

Comprehensive genomic approaches, clinical exome and whole-exome sequencing (WES) have shown that, in a small subset, the presented phenotype is the product of concomitant monogenic disorders in a single patient, giving rise to so-called "blended phenotypes". We used a WES approach in 4,027 individuals referred for genetic diagnostic study at CGPP (2016-2019), for targeted disease-specific multigene panels (<italic>n</italic> = 3,284); or for clinical exome or analysis of WES in a trio (<italic>n</italic> = 743), in clinically heterogeneous presentations. We systematically reviewed the genetic data of these 743 cases, either (singleton) clinical exome (<italic>n</italic> = 629) or WES in trio (patient and both parents) (<italic>n</italic> = 114). Patients showing variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic, in at least two different genes, and data (at least partly) compatible with phenotype and known inheritance pattern for their disease, were reassessed. Five patients had two genetic conditions: two dominant diseases were found in 3 cases; 2 patients had an autosomal recessive and a dominant disease. Though parental studies were not possible for all cases, of note is that 2 patients had de novo variants occurring in two different gene-pairs: <italic>HUWE1</italic> and <italic>CHAMP1</italic>, and <italic>SETD5</italic> and <italic>KIF21A</italic>.

After allowing blood samples to stand at room temperature (RT) and 4°C for various times (0h, 2h, 6h and 24h), plasma was separated and cfRNA was extracted and sequenced by PALM-seq, an integrated sequencing method for cell-free long and small RNA.

The assay provides quantitative results for total DNA as well as cfDNA separated from high molecular weight (HMW) DNA. The quality score %cfDNA is provided as additional quality parameter, determining the percent cfDNA of total DNA in presence of HWM DNA. This set of quality parameters adjusted to the needs of cfDNA characterization was applied to compare the extraction kits.</p><p id="Par5552"><bold>Results:</bold> The nine cfDNA extraction kits varied in rate of yield and their size selection capacity to remove HMW DNA. In general, each kit afforded either superior yield or high selectivity towards cfDNA.</p><p id="Par5553"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> High yield may be crucial for plasma with low cfDNA content, yet if the plasma is expected to contain considerable amounts of HMW DNA, the selectivity towards cfDNA might be favored. Even if no preference for a single kit could be established, the results present a straightforward way to monitor the impact of pre-analytical parameters on cfDNA yield and quality. Automatic evaluation of a quality score for cfDNA allows to define a threshold for objective sample quality assessment.</p><p id="Par5554"><bold>E. Graf:</bold> A.

For that aim, we compared exome CNV calling results of 45 individuals with results of CMA analysis. The samples belong to the patients with developmental delay/intellectual disability with or without additional abnormalities for whom no pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were reported by CMA and hence, they underwent exome trio testing. The CMA analysis identified 64 regions overlapping with coding regions, but 27 of them were designated as CMA artifacts. The remaining 37 CMA regions (in 27 samples), included 11 deletions (average 537Kbp), and 26 duplications (average size 665Kbp). Exome sequencing was performed following enrichment with TWIST Human Core Exome plus kits (average coverage &gt;250x). Exome-CNV calling was executed using default parameters of DRAGEN Ver. 3.4.14 based on read-depth method. In the current methodology, 33 out of 37 (89%) regions reported by CMA were successfully identified by the Exome-CNV calling. The remaining 4 regions were duplications in size ranging between 256Kbp-890Kbp. In addition, Exome-CNV calling identified at least 150 more high-quality CNV regions not reported by CMA, and also encountered a large number of false positives. We concluded that default parameters of DRAGEN CNV calling for exome samples should be optimized to increase the accuracy and reduce the number of false positives in order to make it comparable with CMA analysis.</p><p id="Par5558"><bold>S.

Individual samples do not, however, include significant numbers of rare or clinically relevant variants. Reanalysis of in-house samples known to contain such variants complements this deficiency, but is limited by its lack of scalability. We present a method for incorporating variant-relevant NGS reads from a multitude of clinical samples into a single hybrid control for efficient pipeline validation.</p><p id="Par5569"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> NIST reference sample NA24385 was whole-exome sequenced using a custom GATK-based clinical diagnostic pipeline.

In laboratory genetic studies this has happened through the International System for Human Cytogenomic Nomenclature (ISCN) and Human Genome Variation Society (HVGS). The Standing Committee of the ISCN has established a standard system for the description of numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities characterized by various methods. The next revision of these standards will be released in 2020, and will address issues raised from members of the cytogenomics community and vetted through the Standing Committee. These include clarity on general principles with more specific definitions of terms. Improvements to oncology, FISH, microarray and region specific assay nomenclatures will be emphasized. ISCN 2020 will align the rules governing the description of all chromosome abnormalities regardless of technology used. The “view” of chromosomes will move from centromere-focused to one based on genomic sequence from pter to qter; sex chromosomes abnormalities will be presented first followed by those affecting autosomes for all techniques. Continued improvements and refinements to guidelines first released in 2016 in collaboration with HGVS will also be included. This new standard combines aspects of both HGVS and ISCN and will meet the needs of both the cytogenomic and molecular communities, making information on both the chromosomal and base-pair level readily evident and providing a consistent description of large intra- and inter-chromosomal rearrangements.

The second group (25%) presented with conditions that were clinically recognisable, by medical geneticists, and so received clinical diagnoses with 39% confirmed genetically.

In this study, we present a simple and highly accurate method for CNV confirmation and segregation analysis using an EvaGreen single colour, digital PCR (dPCR).</p><p id="Par5611"><bold>Methods:</bold> In an EvaGreen multiplex assay (Biorad), the fluorescence amplitude varies with amplicon size, PCR efficiency and primer concentrations allowing amplicon separation. A gene ratio can then be calculated by absolute quantification of events for the target and reference genes with no need of standard curves. For each CNV, we developed a duplex assay with <italic>RPP30</italic> as reference gene and designed primers for the target gene with an amplicon size between 100 and 250 bp. In order to more easily separate amplicons, we used 50nM and 150nM for target and reference primers respectively.

Genetic testing is recommended as part of routine clinical practice since a genetic diagnosis allows confirmation of the clinical diagnosis, ensuring appropriate care and follow up access to personalised treatments, carrier identification, and family planning. The advent of next generation sequencing-based diagnostics has prompted the update of testing guidelines, previously published in 2010. The compilation of these revised guidelines was facilitated by the European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN).We have considered several issues. Technical aspects include variant detection (including small variants and copy number variations); RNA analysis and its use in DMD genetic testing; genotype-phenotype correlation as an implication of genetic testing. Male and female carrier diagnostic flowcharts have been revised with specific recommendation about known or unknown familial pathogenic variant identification. The entire cohort of prenatal diagnostic workflows, including non-invasive foetal sexing and diagnosis (NIPD) and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis are discussed. A section is dedicated to variant annotation, which is of paramount importance for accurate variant reporting. We also provide recommendations on results reporting (in males and carriers), and interpretation of atypical variants or genomic configurations. We discuss and delineate possible modalities of reporting incidental findings related to the DMD gene analysis. The impact of genetic testing in personalized therapies and clinical trials enrollment procedures is also discussed. Finally we provide recommendations on laboratory settings, including accreditation, ERN network (Euro-NMD) participation, Orphanet platform registration and participation in quality-assessment schemes.</p><p id="Par5618"><bold>C.

EvC is caused by mutations in <italic>EVC</italic> or <italic>EVC2</italic> genes in approximately 85% of cases. From year 2003 to 2019 we collected and analyzed for mutations by DHPLC and/or Sanger sequencing the <italic>EVC</italic> and <italic>EVC2</italic> genes in a cohort of 93 patients suspected of having EvC syndrome.

This may deteriorate further as 25-30% of EBMG-registered CLGs with experience in cytogenetics will retire in the next decade. At the same time, trainees entering the field have a preference for molecular genetics.

Previous studies on DeepGestalt’s quality focused on its sensitivity in patients with facial dysmorphisms. However, any diagnostic procedure also requires negative testing to determine its accuracy. We present these systematic tests of DeepGestalt on photographs of healthy individuals and suggest a machine-learning driven approach to infer presence/absence of a syndromic facies from DeepGestalt’s results.</p><p id="Par5633"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We collected 19 images for each of 17 distinct syndromes. 323 images of healthy individuals were matched to these regarding age, sex and ethnicity. Altogether, we analyzed 646 frontal photographs. We accessed DeepGestalt (v. 19.1.7) using Face2Gene CLINIC and evaluated results for the suggested diagnoses’ frequencies, ranks and scores. We trained and tested a linear support vector machine (SVM) using a leave-one-out scheme to distinguish the two classes of images based on DeepGestalt’s output.</p><p id="Par5634"><bold>Results:</bold> We confirm DeepGestalt’s high true positive rate (top-10-sensitivity 91%). Furthermore, false positives showed an interesting distribution. DeepGestalt suggested 171 distinct differential diagnoses in the top-10-results lists of the healthy control cohort. Frequencies differed: For example - although known to the system - it never falsely suggested Apert syndrome, while it proposed Fragile X syndrome in 50% of healthy controls.</p><p id="Par5635">DeepGestalt’s top-1-scores do fairly predict presence/absence of a syndromic facies (AUROC: 0.71).

Lots of existing tools have been developed to search the semantic similarity in the ontology and achieved high accuracy in the task of gene prioritization by patients’ phenotypic features. However, since the similarity search is biased among diseases of varying prevalences, these tools usually perform poorly on patients with rare diseases. Therefore, we propose Case-Annotation plus Disease-Annotation (CADA), a network-based gene prioritization method to improve the gene prioritization for rare diseases patients.</p><p id="Par5648"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> The diagnosed disease, disease-causing gene and phenotypic features of 11,000 patients from the Clinvar and our hospitals are collected. Along with the phenotypic features and their annotated diseases and genes from HPO, A knowledge graph, incorporating nodes of diseases, genes, patients and phenotypic features as well as their relationships as edges, is prepared. Then node2vec is used for node embeddings generation. With node embeddings, the gene prioritization is achieved by similarity-based node link prediction.</p><p id="Par5649"><bold>Results:</bold> The patients with the same disease and disease-causing gene were located in close proximity in node embeddings. Clustering visualization shows that diseases with similar phenotypic features tend to cluster together as well. The prioritization of disease-causing gene improved on more than 60% of rare disease patients.</p><p id="Par5650"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> By integrating real-world case annotations and existing disease annotations from HPO, CADA provides a new way to address the semantic search bias problem in existing tools for the gene prioritization of rare disease patients with phenotypic features.</p><p id="Par5651"><bold>C.

Clinically, these entities are heterogeneous as well, and they show a notable phenotypic overlap. However, the precise identification of the type of defect is a prerequisite for the clinical management and genetic counselling. In fact, the contribution of the four major alterations (UPDs, CNVs SNVs, epimutations) varies considerably in the currently known ImpDis. Due to their formation mechanism, epimutations are particular prone to mosaicism, as well as upd(11)pat in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). It is therefore not surprising that ImpDis are un- and misdiagnosed. We will report on our experience of testing in &gt;1000 patients referred for diagnostic testing of BWS and Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS). Though the majority of patients carried the expected molecular results, we identified a considerable number of unexpected alterations, new changes as well as undiagnosed epimutations / UPDs due to extremely discrepant mosaic distributions. Additionally, the rate of multilocus imprinting disturbances (MLID) and genomewide uniparental disomies is further specified. Altogether, these cases show that comprehensive tests targeting different tissues and including different methods have to be applied, combined with a thorough clinical examination. The precise molecular diagnosis is required as the basis for a targeted management (e.g. ECG and tumor surveillance in BWS, growth treatment in SRS). For genetic counselling it is needed for recurrence risk estimation which is hindered by the impact of the spatial arrangements of imprinting elements and their interactions on the phenotype.</p><p id="Par5655"><bold>T.

A custom gene panel of 29 frequently mutated CRC genes was designed for QIAseq technology (QIAgen). cfDNA library preparation input was 10ng, 20ng, 40ng and 80ng from HD780 standards and 40ng of purified HD816.

Measurement uncertainty is the quality metric that informs the testing laboratory and its users about test fitness for purpose, whether a result is above or below a treatment threshold and its degree of comparability with other laboratories. An ISO15189 laboratory medicine accreditation requirement, the measurement uncertainty of a test is intended to encompass all random and systematic effects on a measurement result. However current models to assess measurement uncertainty have been developed in the field of physical measurement or analytical chemistry and do not apply well to clinical genomic tests. Here we describe two new principles to standardise measurement uncertainty evaluation for genomic tests: 1) the ‘examinand’ -a general concept that applies to both qualitative and quantitative properties- is defined by the genomic target sequence and the source of the sample, 2) the combination of type of data output and reported result, which may be qualitative or quantitative, defines the requirement for the type of analysis. We propose the use of a structured cause-effect diagram for mapping sources of measurement uncertainty in the pre-analytical, analytical and post-analytical phases, along with standard templates for recording sources of uncertainty and their mitigation, in addition to measurement uncertainty calculation when applicable. We propose that using this standardised framework to guide laboratories through measurement uncertainty evaluation will contribute to improving the quality of genomic results and increasing patient’s safety and equity.</p><p id="Par5703"><bold>I.

To verify whether mendeliome (or clinical exome) sequencing can be still proven to be useful, we critically evaluated our experience with 64 patients affected by syndromic conditions that were likely monogenic in origin. Relevant for this analysis were also the following aspects: 1) planning of new pregnancies; 2) early use of mendeliome sequencing in the diagnostic procedure; 3) parental consent. By mendeliome sequencing, we were able to reach the genetic diagnosis in 15 (23,4 %) cases, of which 8 (53.3 %) had a de novo autosomal heterozygous variant; 5 (33.3 %) were compound heterozygous or homozygous for an autosomal recessive condition; 2 (13.3 %) had an X-linked condition. Variants were mostly in classes IV and V. Clinical re-evaluation of patients was crucial for result validation. We could expand the phenotypic spectrum of known conditions in 30% of cases. Prenatal diagnosis in subsequent pregnancies was consistently performed in several occasions. By WES, precision diagnosis was expanded to three genes not included in the mendeliome. By contrast, a high number of VUS was observed, for which additional research activities were required and planned. The use of mendeliome sequencing as an early step of the diagnostic workflow, critically oriented on the basis of the clinical phenotype, has proven efficient also in terms of cost/benefit. Strategies for the use of mendeliome sequencing, mainly in silico, are here suggested.</p><p id="Par5707"><bold>M. Zollino:</bold> None. <bold>S. Frangella:</bold> None. <bold>P.N.

CTG repeat instability and DM1 clinical manifestations depend on the length of the repeat itself and the purity of the repeated sequence. The genetic counseling in DM1 is very complex, due to the highly variable clinical presentation and technical difficulties in determining the size and purity of the CTG expansion. We used Single Molecule Real-Time sequencing (SMRT) developed by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) to precisely measure large CTG repeat size and identify sequence interruptions of expanded allele to understand clinical and genetic variability in DM1 patients. We sequenced 10 DM1 patients with CTG repeat expansion ranging from 130 to &gt; 1000 CTG repeats on the Sequel System. We amplified expanded alleles by PCR and pooled samples equi-mass for library construction, using 10 ng per sample. Selective AMPure purification was done to enrich for expanded alleles. We obtained more than 77% full DM1 reads per sample, with &gt;70% of the reads from expanded alleles. The data includes long reads in the expected size range for all samples, including DM1 patients with more than 1000 CTG repeats. SMRT sequencing is very promising to sequence large triplet repeat expansions and also to identify CTG repeat interruptions and estimate somatic mosaicism in DM1 patients. This method can improve the prognosis and counseling offered to patients. This work was supported by Pac bio and the Association Institut de Myologie.</p><p id="Par5715"><bold>S.

Approximately 10% are missed by conventional DNA-diagnostics, because they are located outside the region of interest, or are misinterpreted by <italic>in silico</italic> splicing predictions. We designed a targeted RNAseq-based approach to detect pathogenic RNA-splicing and thereby causative DNA-variants.</p><p id="Par5719"><bold>Methods:</bold> RNA was extracted from lymphocytes followed by targeted <italic>NF1</italic> RNA-seq. An in-house developed tool (QURNAS) was used to calculate an enrichment score (ERS) for each splicing event. A high enrichment score indicates high abundance of a potentially pathogenic splicing event.</p><p id="Par5720"><bold>Results:</bold> A validation was first performed with nine known pathogenic <italic>NF1</italic> splice-variants and two wildtype <italic>NF1</italic> samples. All normal reference exon-exon splice junctions, several novel and 16 out of 17 previously reported naturally occurring splice events were detected. Furthermore, all expected pathogenic splice events were detected based on high ERS. Next, we blindly replicated the molecular diagnosis (based on RT-PCR) of ten patients from Ghent. Since using our approach all pathogenic splicing events and corresponding splice-variants were detected. Additionally, using RNAseq we identified a de novo deep intronic pathogenic splice variant in a patient with a clear NF1 phenotype, whom lacked a molecular diagnosis.</p><p id="Par5721"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Targeted <italic>NF1</italic> RNAseq can be successfully used to characterize variants of unknown significance (VUS) and identify undetected pathogenic RNA-splicing variants, additionally to DNA-based diagnostics.</p><p id="Par5722"><bold>R.

We present a QC approach based on the genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) technology and the comparison to NGS data for the verification of sample identities. 16 SNPs covered in our NGS capture kit (Agilent SureSelectXT) were selected. To reliably detect sample swaps, 1) haplotype overlaps between samples need to be excluded, i.e. no sample has been pooled twice (uniqueness) and 2) the identity of each sample needs to be confirmed by comparing KASP and NGS data. Due to possible dropouts or erroneous KASP results, some comparisons might not always be possible. The minimal number of successful comparisons and maximum number of mismatches for reliable conclusions was calculated. Concerning uniqueness, the probability of encountering two samples with the same haplotype over a certain number of SNPs in a certain number of samples was calculated; the cutoffs for identity confirmation are based on the probability of a sample showing one specific haplotype over a certain number of SNPs. Results showed that at least two differing SNPs in all pairwise comparisons of the samples exclude overlaps with &gt;99% certainty. With a cutoff of maximally four dropouts or three dropouts and one mismatch the correct sample assignment can be verified with a probability of &gt;99%. The identity confirmation is integrated in our NGS analysis pipeline. Samples failing the criteria are automatically identified and held back from further processing.</p><p id="Par5726"><bold>F.

Sufficient amount of fetal DNA is crucial to avoid false negative NIPT results. Accurate and robust methods to estimate fetal fraction are therefore essential to ensure a valid NIPT result. To what extent the total number of sequencing reads influence the fetal fraction estimate is unexplored. In this study, we tested the robustness of the widely used SeqFF method to provide recommendations on the optimal number of reads needed to obtain accurate fetal fraction estimates.</p><p id="Par5737"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Retrospective data from WGS NIPT samples (<italic>n</italic> = 516) obtained as a part of our local prenatal screening program (Department of Clinical Genetics, OUH, Denmark) were included. For all samples &gt;30M (million) reads had been obtained. Data were randomly down-sampled before estimating the fetal fraction and results were compared with SNP-based and chrY-based FF estimates.</p><p id="Par5738"><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, SeqFF estimates highly correlated with both the SNP-based (R-squared=0.88) and chrY-based (R-squared=0.92) methods. By down-sampling, we observed that the SeqFF estimates were highly affected by the total number of reads used. Accurate SeqFF estimates were achieved using &gt;10M reads. By increasing the number of reads further, additional gain in accuracy was observed. Including more than 20M reads did not result in further significant improvement.</p><p id="Par5739"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> FF estimation is highly affected by the total number of reads used.

Children born with PKU, thanks to the newborn screening and early dietary interventions, can have relatively normal lives. The diet allows them to keep Phe level in range. The best indicator of dietary compliance is regular monitoring of Phe concentrations by using a Liquid Chromatography (LC) based procedure. We developed a qualitative chemometric model able to separate PKU patients based on their response to the diet in three different categories: Low (&lt;2 mg/dl), Compensate (2,5-6 mg/dl) and High (6,5- 20 mg/dl) with NIR spectroscopy.</p><p id="Par5758"><bold>Methods and Results:</bold> A qualitative chemometric model was elaborated using 3000 NIR spectra, from 562 DBS PKU samples from the three different groups, based on their Phe levels assessed by LC. Using a sensor calibrated in the Near infra-Red spectrum, 20 scans per sample in duplicate were acquired. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted. The chemometric model was validated by blind external procedure. Our model is able to correctly assign unknown sample to the Low, Compensate, or High group with a linearity of 0,91 and a σ=0,078, showing a sensitivity ratio between the number of the correctly classified samples (CCS) and the number of the known samples belonging to each class (KS): Sn = CCS⋅100KS close to 100%.</p><p id="Par5759"><bold>Conclusions:</bold>We demonstrated that it is possible to use NIR spectroscopy to quickly monitor the diet compliance in PKU patients.</p><p id="Par5760"><bold>M.F.M.

Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), Angelman syndromes (AS) and 15q11-q13.1 duplication syndrome (dup15q) are 3 clinically distinct disorders associated with multiple anomalies and intellectual disability typically resulting from CNV of imprinted genes.</p><p id="Par5764"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Analysis of CNVs in 15q11-q13 and UPD15 was performed using STR markers D15S817, D15S1513, D15S822, D15S1002 genotyping.

Three PWS and one AS had the 15q11-q13 deletions: paternal del 15q in PWS and maternal del15q in AS patients. The maternal age of UPD15 patients was significantly higher (40,3years) than in mothers of del15q patients (28,4 years).

The parent-of-origin specific expression of these genes is regulated by an imprinting centre. The molecular defects include large deletions of 5-7 Mb, uniparental disomies, imprinting defects (ID) with or without imprinting centre deletions, mosaic IDs, point mutations and deletions of the <italic>UBE3A</italic> gene as well as rare chromosomal rearrangements. Given the broad nature of the underlying molecular causes and the different techniques needed to establish the molecular genetic diagnosis and hence the recurrence risk, diagnostic of PWS and AS is challenging. Furthermore, there is increasing need for proper, universally understandable and standardised diagnostic reports. In the light of improvements and new developments regarding techniques and differential diagnoses together with reporting standards we updated the best practice guidelines for the PWS and AS diagnostics. The guidelines were open for consultation and amendment by the broad community of labs participating in the annual European Molecular Genetics Quality Network (EMQN) schemes for PWS and AS diagnostic and were approved by the EMQN and the Association for Clinical Genomic Science (ASCG).</p><p id="Par5771"><bold>J.

Genetic pathology reports can be difficult to understand, and need to be easily understood by healthcare providers so they can be used to improve patient outcomes. Additionally, a new, national health e-resource now allows patients to independently access their own pathology results, including genetic results in some jurisdictions.</p><p id="Par5775"><bold>Methods:</bold> A multi-disciplinary working party was convened. Example reports and literature were reviewed through different lenses. Membership comprised general practitioners, a surgeon, clinical geneticist, genetic counsellor, genomic scientist and genetic pathologists. Flesh-Kincaid and SMOG were used to analyse report readability. The Australian Genomics Community Advisory Group reviewed the model factsheet and recommendations.</p><p id="Par5776"><bold>Results:</bold> The level of information that requestors wanted in reports was different, with more detail requested by genetic professionals. All wanted a clear summary of the findings, with a standardised, consistent order of report elements. Readability was identified as a major issue. Plain language is important, but accuracy of genetic information must be retained in line with accreditation guidelines. Recommendations were formulated and included a model laboratory report template and model report interpretation fact sheet for primary referrers.</p><p id="Par5777"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Laboratories reporting genomic tests should simplify their reports as much as possible. Synoptic reporting for genomic tests should be encouraged. The matter has been referred to the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia for implementation.

For compatibility with FFPE DNA and cfDNA samples, short 60-100 bp amplicons were designed. Library preparation is achieved by a limited-cycle indexing PCR step on universal tails incorporated in the target-specific primers. We applied this novel Human Sample ID Kit on 3 FFPE samples, 1 cell-free reference DNA and 6 GiB reference DNA samples with input amounts ranging from 1 upto 20 ng. Performance was evaluated by paired-end sequencing on a MiSeq instrument.</p><p id="Par5783"><bold>Results:</bold> Excellent homogeneous coverage and on-target specificity was achieved. For all DNA samples, all SNPs displayed a coverage higher than 20% of the mean and a mean on-target rate of 94.3%. More impressively, 93.2% of the SNPs had a uniform coverage within 2-fold of the mean. Based on the resulting genotypes, DNA samples could be unambiguously discriminated and linked to the corresponding exomes.</p><p id="Par5784"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We developed and validated a novel sample tracking test for WES and WGS, involving a ready-to-sequence 2-step multiplex PCR reaction. The Human Sample ID Kit has a discrimination power of over 1:85,000 and enabled unambiguous discrimination of each DNA sample.</p><p id="Par5785"><bold>V. Dunon:</bold> A.

However, more studies are needed for indels variants and/or copy number variations (CNVs).We present the largest single-center Sanger validation study, with a subset data of clinical exomes in 825 characterized cases, in order to confirm the high concordance expected of our clinical exome diagnostic tool. We also aim to expand the validations of our small deletion/duplication variants and CNVs detected by NGS.</p><p id="Par5789"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Clinical exomes were analysed from peripheral blood samples using the TruSight One Sequencing panel (Illumina) or the Clinical Exome Solution (Sophia Genetics). A total of 1099 good quality NGS-detected variants (&gt;20X coverage, &gt;20% heterozygosity and Quality=PASS) and 30 CNVs were further confirmed by Sanger sequencing and MLPA or array-CGH according to convenience, respectively. Sequencing primers were designed manually or with the ExonPrimer tool, and checked in the SNPchecker program.</p><p id="Par5790"><bold>Results:</bold> Though 11 Sanger discrepancies that required new primers designs were found, we had 100% concordance for the 858 SNVs (80.16%) and 321 (19.64%) indel variants analysed (<italic>n</italic> = 1099). However, we only had a concordance of 96% for CNVs (<italic>n</italic> = 30), as we had a false positive deletion in homozygosis.</p><p id="Par5791"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> NGS is a robust technique for the detection for good quality SNVs/Indel variants, but validation for CNVs is still necessary. Limitations of Sanger sequencing should always be considered.

A significant proportion of such variants may cause disease through disruption of RNA splicing. We examined the effects on splicing of a large set of variants of uncertain significance clinically ascertained through diagnostic genetic testing. We also compared the experimentally determined RNA splicing data to bioinformatic predictions made by several commonly used splicing tools.</p><p id="Par5808"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> 257 variants of uncertain significance were analysed from across three separate laboratories. Blood RNA was collected in PAXgene tubes and targeted RT-PCR was undertaken with agarose gel electrophoresis and Sanger sequencing analysis of products. 17 samples also underwent RNA sequencing of total RNA with depletion of globin mRNA and rRNA. Targeted analysis of splicing was performed on RNA-seq data using Sashimi plot visualisation. Alamut, HSF 3.1 and SpliceAI software were used for splicing predictions.</p><p id="Par5809"><bold>Results:</bold> 85/257 (33%) of analysed variants were found to affect splicing. Skipping of the upstream exon was the most frequent abnormality (39/85) and this was most often seen in association with variants within the splice donor region. SpliceAI had an accuracy of 0.91 and outperformed other prediction tools in terms of sensitivity and specificity.</p><p id="Par5810"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Analysis of splicing from blood RNA is useful in identifying splicing abnormalities that cannot reliably be predicted from DNA sequence alone.

It usually occurs sporadically and results from the premature closure of the metopic sutures with consequent deformation of the anterior calvarium. We describe two patients (a female and a male) with isolated trigonocephaly. WES disclosed in both cases a mutation in the <italic>PTCH1</italic> gene: a de novo heterozygous frameshift variant in the female and a heterozygous stop (inherited from the father later discovered to be affected) in the male. Mutations in <italic>PTCH1</italic> have been found to cause Gorlin syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas, odontogenic keratocysts, skeletal anomalies, macrocephaly, dysmorphisms and an increased risk of tumors in early infancy. Skeletal anomalies with defects in the shape of the skull, ribs and spine are often described, but clinical data do not refer specifically to the presence of trigonocephaly which instead is frequently reported in patients with 9q22.3 deletion. <italic>PTCH</italic>1, included in the region, is the only gene for which the deletion is known to represent most of the features of patients with this rearrangement. Our report reinforces the clinical utility of WES even in apparently non-syndromic trigonocephaly: in fact, the early diagnosis of <italic>PTCH1</italic> variants allowed us the early diagnosis of Gorlin syndrome with consequent prompt surveillance, since approximately 5% of all children with variants in this gene develop medulloblastoma.</p><p id="Par5815"><bold>F.

Several reports showed that HbA1c was more stable indicator of diabetes than blood glucose, since HbA1c level depicts the average of blood glucose in 2-3 months. However, it has not been critically tested whether genetic predisposition to glycation differs among individuals, which would alter the HbA1c levels given the same glucose levels. To answer this question, we here investigated ~270K individuals with 1,892 cases of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in UK Biobank for the blood glucose and HbA1c, and their associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We discovered that 2,349 SNPs were associated only with HbA1c level (dubbed as glycation SNPs), while 2,407 and 720 lead SNPs were associated with HbA1c and glucose, respectively. These glycation SNPs were related to genes such as SPTA1, SPTB, and ANK1, indicating their functional implication on glycation. We further built polygenic risk score (PRS) from the glycation SNPs, which performed as an indicator of the deviated HbA1c levels given the same glucose level across different individuals. In addition, we categorized individuals into several groups along with the PRS, and showed that those groups should have different criteria of HbA1c level to maintain equivalent sensitivity and precision of diabetes diagnosis. We believe that our approach provides insights into personalized diagnosis of complex diseases.</p><p id="Par5819"><bold>S. Ko:</bold> None. <bold>I. Kim:</bold> None. <bold>H.

However, the CHEO Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory does not currently apply PP1 when cosegregation of a variant is observed in a family tested internally.

Total cellular RNA was extracted from WBCs after red blood cells lysis, and transcriptome profiles were assessed by RNA sequencing.</p><p id="Par5838"><bold>Results:</bold> Compared with samples treated immediately, the proportion of neutrophils decreased, but that of T cells increased in the samples stored at RT for 24h. Samples maintained at 4°C were less influenced than that at RT within 24h. We identified 1428 up-regulated and 86 down-regulated genes at 4°C, while there were 4493 genes up-regulated and 5982 genes down-regulated at RT. Up-regulated genes at 4°C were mostly related to HDACs deacetylate histones, and that at RT were mostly related to mRNA processing. Genes down-regulated at RT were mostly due to leukocyte activation involved in immune response. Reference genes such as CHMP2A and PSMB4 were relatively stable, while the expression of IL1RN, which was similar in both men and women, increased more in women than men after 24h stored at RT.</p><p id="Par5839"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We provide a full-scale ex vivo change of WBCs expression profiles, and suggest that these influences should not be ignored in relative studies.</p><p id="Par5840"><bold>Funding:</bold> Shenzhen Municipal Government of China (No.JCYJ20170412152854656).</p><p id="Par5841"><bold>X.

HPO terms were collected prior to analysis. Over 35,000 families have been analysed using this approach.</p><p id="Par5845"><bold>Methods:</bold> Using &gt;950 confirmed genetic diagnoses in patients with intellectual disability, we modelled the outcome of different strategies for automated prioritisation and manual review, focused on diagnostic sensitivity.</p><p id="Par5846"><bold>Results:</bold> 87% of genetic diagnoses were prioritised using a single gene panel selected for the original diagnostic hypothesis. The primary reason for non-prioritisation was that the causative gene was in a different panel; sensitivity increased to 92% using automated HPO-based rules to apply additional panels.</p><p id="Par5847">Neuromuscular disorders (analysed with smaller phenotype-specific panels) gave a panel-based yield of 38%, increasing to 71% with one broad panel.</p><p id="Par5848">Diagnoses of metabolic and mitochondrial conditions, some treatable, were made where these conditions were compatible with the phenotype data but outside the gene panel for the primary diagnostic hypothesis.</p><p id="Par5849">Of the 13% with non-prioritised diagnoses, 72% were trios or larger family structures; we will discuss the impact of family structure on diagnostic yield.</p><p id="Par5850">For families where trio testing is not possible, phenotype-based variant ranking algorithms such as Exomiser contribute.</p><p id="Par5851"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> No single analysis strategy can identify all diagnoses.

While developing the new WGS pipeline as part of a new genomic medicine service for England’s National Health Service, we validated the variant detection of other diagnostically important classes of variants.</p><p id="Par5856"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> The detection of diagnostic variants was assessed using genome data from 100,000 Genomes project participants with diagnostic variants detected and/or confirmed by orthogonal methods.</p><p id="Par5857"><bold>Results:</bold> The sensitivity of diagnostic variants detection was as following: de novo small variants 99.4% (CI 98.43-99.96%, <italic>N</italic> = 354), mitochondrial small variants 100% (CI, 82.92-100%, <italic>N</italic> = 10), pathogenic CNVs &gt;10kb size 97.1% (CI 93.71-99.28%, <italic>N</italic> = 136). The STR detection of full expansions in 13 loci reached sensitivity and precision of 100% (CI 88.8-100%, 16 positive and 428 negative controls), however, the sensitivity was tested in controls identified by the earlier version of the WGS pipeline and confirmed by orthogonal methods, and therefore may be overestimated. We further show high reproducibility of CNV and STR calling using 80 monozygotic twin pairs.</p><p id="Par5858"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We show high sensitivity, and, where possible, precision, of our rare disease pipeline to identify clinically relevant variants in families with rare disease. We also present a framework for validation of WGS pipelines for clinical service, and highlight the challenges posed by the lack of unbiased truth sets of diagnostically relevant variants.</p><p id="Par5859"><bold>D.

It is known that pathogenic genetic variants may reside in non-coding regions or may arise due to mutational mechanisms not detectable using ES. We therefore aimed to characterize the utility of whole genome sequencing (WGS) in diagnosing exome-negative patients. We performed WGS in a 30 patients with negative ES result and high suspicion of genetic etiology based on one of the following inclusion criterions: (1) observation of multiple affected family members, (2) a specific diagnosis with high probability of genetic etiology, (3) presence of significant blocks of homozygosity, or (4) observation a single pathogenic variant in a gene associated with recessive inheritance. We developed an in-house pipeline for analysis of sequence variation in WGS and have extended it with approaches for analysing structural variation (including translocations and retrotransposition events), polynucleotide expansions, mitochondrial variation and artificial intelligence-based splice variant effect prediction approaches. Among 30 selected patients, we identified the molecular cause in 9 (30.0%) using WGS. We detected deep intronic pathogenic variants in 2 patients, a pathogenic promoter variant in 1 patient, a small structural variant in 1 patient, a complex rearrangement in 1 patient, a translocation in 1 patient, polynucleotide expansions in 2 patients and a retrotransposition event in 1 patient. The results of our study indicate that WGS may represent a valuable approach to establish a diagnosis in a carefully selected subset of patients with a negative ES result.</p><p id="Par5863"><bold>A.

It is the consequence of many regulation events such as cis-regulatory variants. Recent studies imply its potential roles in diseases and practical value in genome diagnostics. However, routine genome diagnostics heavily depend on DNA sequencing and usually ignore the regulation of gene expression which can be indicated by ASE. Therefore, a well-developed prediction model is capable to attribute the value of ASE to the successful genome diagnosis.</p><p id="Par5867">We here report on a deep learning model built to understand how the ASE effects of a transcript associated with the adjacent regulatory elements using NGS DNA haplotypes obtained from the Genome of the Netherlands project and RNA sequencing results from Biobank-based Integrative Omics Studies. Then, given a transcript, for paternal and maternal alleles, the ASE effects are quantified from the RNA sequencing results and potential regulatory sequences are acquired from whole-genome sequencing results. Finally, we are piloting a convolutional neural network, which values the objects in an image-like two-dimension matrix (in our case, it is the regulatory sequence) to distinguish one from the other. We also plan to apply the model on diseases-related genes or transcripts to evaluate its added value to the diagnosis. Ideally, the model can contribute to the genome diagnostics and general biological studies by supplying functional interpretation that exploits expression evidence.

Data analysis and interpretation is one of the main challenges and still many cases remain unsolved. However, scientific knowledge evolves rapidly and periodic data reanalysis has been shown to increase the diagnostic yield by up to 5-10%.We have reanalysed 7,495 genomic datasets from unsolved rare disease patients and relatives submitted in the context of the "Solve-RD - solving the unsolved rare diseases" project. Data was processed through the RD-Connect Genome-Phenome Analysis platform (GPAP: <ext-link xlink:href="https://platform.rd-connect.eu/" ext-link-type="uri">https://platform.rd-connect.eu/</ext-link>), and reanalysed using different innovative bioinformatics approaches that enable variant filtering and prioritisation combining genomic and clinical data: i) VFPS, a programmatic approach integrated with the GPAP ii) Exomiser, a tool for phenotype-driven prioritisation of disease-causing variants and iii) CAPICE, a computational method for consequence-agnostic pathogenicity estimation. A consensus output with a minimal set of variant annotations has been defined for all approaches to further facilitate data interpretation and results feedback. Candidate variants are made available in a secured cloud to clinical researchers of the four participating European Reference Networks (euro-NMD, ITHACA, RND and GENTURIS) for data interpretation. Preliminary results on the VFPS approach, where more than 2500 candidate variants from 1700 patients have been returned, already provided diagnosis for 3-8% of patients.

Therefore, we have developed the GenerAVI.v2 tool for the automatic interpretation of bulk variants by American College of Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria. The GeneraAVI.v2 also allows users to make their own interpretation and stores them in a disease-specific manner. The GenerAVI.v2 is developed using C++ and Python. The platform uses vcf files as the file input. After preliminary filtering based on quality and previously known false-positive calls, all variants are annotated using Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor. Disease-specific allele frequency, relative position on the gene, in silico pathogenicity tool metrics, ClinVar records, and more parameters are used for automated ACMG classifications. GeneraAVI.v2 tool can automatically evaluate and report all variants detected in terms of 15 known ACMG criteria. It also analyzes by modified PVS1 criteria which are based on the non-mediated-decay pathway and alternative splicing events. It also allows users to make their own assessments for criteria that cannot be automated. The tool keeps track of each curation made and uses these evaluations in future analysis. The GenerAVI.v2 tool helps researchers and clinicians to easily create genetic analysis reports with automated ACMG classifications and generate dynamic internal frequency and clinical interpretation database.</p><p id="Par5884"><bold>B.

However, success rate is low: many patients do not respond, whereas others suffer from adverse effects.

Understanding complex interactions within immunological synapse will yield new biomarkers, with application to clinical trials optimization, companion diagnostics to existing drugs and better combination therapies.</p><p id="Par5904"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We developed a computational method that infers gene interaction networks from expression profiles in large cohorts of patients using unsupervised Bayesian machine learning model.

We apply this method to bladder and kidney carcinoma TCGA cohorts.</p><p id="Par5905"><bold>Results and Conclusions:</bold> We used the panel of 21 genes expressed on cancer side of immunological synapse and 3 transcription factors that regulate them. We found that a combinatorial markers have significantly better predictive power for patient survivability rate in comparison to single gene expression: <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.0002 for KIRC and 0.0076 BLCA cohorts. Further, we build de-novo gene interactions networks from expression data and analysed influence (loadings) of genes on our combinatorial model in context of other co-expressed genes. Combinations containing NFE2L2, ICOSLG and PD-L1 are particularly predictive in KIRC, and NFE2L2 and VISTA in BLCA. Hence, we show utility of machine learning tools to generate combinatorial, multi-dimensional biomarkers from gene expression measurements.</p><p id="Par5906"><bold>GrantRefs:</bold><ext-link xlink:href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9464-7475" ext-link-type="uri">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9464-7475</ext-link></p><p id="Par5907"><bold>P.

This might result in artifacts and undetected variants when amplicons overlap each other as variant callers take both into account, thereby reporting either incorrect allelic fractions or not calling the variant at all. Multiplex PCR as well as primer extension enrichment suffer from this drawback. Multiple tools are available that trim adapters from raw sequence. However there is an advantage to soft clip primers after alignment as it allows for more accurate indel detection at the ends of a captured fragment. Multiple open source tools are available for soft clipping of PCR primers based on the alignment start/end position, but they do not seem applicable for primer extension enrichment. We therefore developed PESC (Primer Extension Soft Clipper). It matches the starting position and length of the primer to the alignment of read one. The primer is softclipped. The tool then continues to check the end of read two of the same readpair for overlap with the identified primer and soft clips it as well. PESC is written in Python and can remove primers at a speed of ~1.2 million reads / minute on a regular desktop computer given a primer file for detection of tumor mutational burden with ~19000 entries. With a memory footprint of 13.7 MB in this setup it should integrate well into sequencing pipelines.</p><p id="Par5911"><bold>J. Rehker:</bold> None. <bold>M. Ball:</bold> None. <bold>C.

As an alternative, we aimed at salvaging suggestive association signals in a series of increasingly powered BMI GWAS efforts by intersecting our ATAC-seq and high-resolution promoter-focused Capture C datasets. The biological constraint of insisting each SNP both coincide with open chromatin and be contacted directly by a gene promoter at sub-1kb resolution triaged the vast majority of SNPs, leaving a manageable residual number for further interpretation. Conducting retrospective analyses utilizing three published GIANT BMI GWAS efforts of increasing sample size from 2010, 2015 and 2018, we characterized promoter contacts with open SNPs at varying suggestive sub-threshold <italic>P</italic>-values from 5 × 10<sup>−7</sup> to 5 × 10<sup>−4</sup> in cell types relevant to neuronal, endocrine and immune function.

Similarly, extending our 2010-based observations to the 2018 dataset we observed 64 loci. Furthermore, analyzing the 2015 dataset, we identified 160 sub-threshold loci that went on to achieve genome-wide significance in 2018. The proportion of implicated SNPs, of course, varied with the given thresholds, with the most notable outcome being 90% of 2010 biologically-constrained independent <italic>P</italic> &lt; 5 × 10<sup>−5</sup> signals going on to be genome-wide significant in 2018. Finally, applying this approach to the latest 2018 dataset implicated multiple independent novel loci.

Despite data in the literature about the performance of cloud solutions, and the portability of individual applications, we could not identify an exhaustive, use case based comparison between the available options, which was specific for genomics and providing metrics useful for decision making at institutional level. We have therefore designed three use cases, representing some of the most demanding applications in terms of computing and storage footprint: Human Whole Genome Sequencing, Single Cell RNA Sequencing, Shotgun Metagenome Sequencing. The use of large-sized datasets, for a total of 7.5TB, also allowed us to evaluate the effect of data compression solutions. We have designed the analysis pipelines using Nextflow on a Slurm scheduler, with Singularity containers to maximise portability and reproducibility. By employing widely used applications, like GATK, Cell Ranger and Seurat, Metaphlan and Humann2, we ensured the relevance of our results for the community. This allowed us to collect and compare metrics in six dimensions consistently across different environments: performance, scheduling, cost, running features, data transfer as well as risk/benefit. We performed the comparison on a high-performance computing (HPC) cluster on-premise and on a similarly designed Cyclecloud HPC on Azure.

Several algorithms integrate association data and provide insights on the role of QTs in disease predisposition, such as Mendelian randomization, coincident associations and colocalization, all of them having benefits and drawbacks. Among these three, the colocalization aims at identifying shared haplotypes influencing both QTs and disease to find common molecular mechanisms. Here, we carry out a comparison of three colocalization algorithms (coloc, eCAVIAR and gwas-pw) reviewing their strengths and weaknesses.</p><p id="Par5930"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We tested three colocalization software using GWAS summary statistics of 272 immune QTs measured in up to 2,870 individuals from SardiNIA cohort and public data GWAS from a case-control meta-analysis on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (&gt;100,000 individuals). The three tools use different approaches based on Bayes factors to evaluate colocalization signals.</p><p id="Par5931"><bold>Results:</bold> We considered as true positive the 270 trait-locus associations colocalizing (YC) or not-colocalizing (NC) with RA for at least 2 of the 3 tools, resulting in a total of 14 YC and 256 NC.

This suggests that the choice of tool does not have a strong impact on the colocalization results and the identification of links between QTs or diseases.

These data offer the opportunity to compare genetic effects across traits and tissues. For example, by intersecting disease loci with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) we can help identify the regulatory mechanisms and target genes influencing disease. However, it remains challenging to identify which associations observed in multiple traits are driven by shared causal variants as opposed to distinct mechanisms confounded by linkage disequilibrium (LD). The problem is particularly challenging in the presence of allelic heterogeneity, where multiple causal alleles occur in the same genomic region. In fact, the same region may harbor some shared and some distinct causal effects across different tissues, conditions, or traits.</p><p id="Par5937">We introduce a probabilistic model, CAFEH, which leverages multiple association studies to perform colocalization and fine-mapping across studies in the presence of allelic heterogeneity. CAFEH jointly models summary statistics from each study, using a factor analysis approach to identify patterns of association driven by shared and distinct causal variants. CAFEH outperforms competing colocalization methods, specifically when multiple studies are provided. We apply CAFEH to eQTLs from 49 GTEx tissues, demonstrating much more extensive tissue-specificity than previously reported, and numerous cases of allelic heterogeneity with different causal components affecting different tissues. Applying CAFEH to UK Biobank data along with GTEx, we connect these patterns to shared causal factors with disease.

We created an automated tool to directly classify MFC data to diagnosis labels without any human processing. MFC data (FCS files) were obtained from routine diagnostic of 20,622 patients. The dataset includes 8 B-cell lymphoma subtypes and healthy controls. Three 9-color MFC tubes were used to measure up to 50,000 cells per case. Compensated and transformed flow cytometry data from a single case is used to train a self-organizing map, which is used as input to a convolutional neural network generating class predictions.

Molecular biomarkers remain important screening and detection tools, especially in light of novel blood-based assays. DNA methylation in cancer has been linked to tumorigenesis, but its value as a biomarker has not been fully explored. In this study, we have investigated the methylation patterns of the Gasdermin E gene across 14 different tumor types using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) methylation dataset (<italic>N</italic> = 6502).</p><p id="Par5966"><bold>Methods:</bold> Differential methylation was tested through linear mixed models. Binary logistic regression and partial-least squares discriminant analysis prediction models were used for identifying pan-caner and tumor-specific markers. We were able to identify six CpG sites that could effectively distinguish tumors from normal samples in a pan-cancer setting (AUC = 0.86). This combination of pan-cancer biomarkers was validated in six independent datasets (AUC = 0.84-0.97). Moreover, we tested 74,613 different combinations of six CpG probes, where we identified tumor-specific signatures that could differentiate one tumor type versus all the others (AUC = 0.79-0.98). In all, methylation patterns exhibited great variation between cancer and normal tissues, but were also tumor specific.</p><p id="Par5967"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our analyses highlight that a Gasdermin E methylation biomarker assay, not only has the potential for being a methylation-specific pan-cancer detection marker, but can also discriminate between different tumor types.

However, the relationship between longitudinal changes in metabolite levels and differential DNAm is underexplored. We assessed associations between epigenome-wide blood DNAm and changes in the levels of blood proton nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H-NMR) metabolomics-based traits. For 595 non-diabetic individuals from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 with metabolomics data at ages 31 (T1) and 46 years (T2) as well as concurrent DNAm data (T2), we calculated the average change in level per year between T1 and T2 for each of the 228 metabolomics-based variables. We used our methylSCOPA software for fast single-predictor longitudinal epigenome-wide association study (EWAS). We regressed out participant sex from the change in metabolomic variable level and used the resulting residuals as predictors of DNAm in EWAS for 832,569 markers on the Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA) MethylationEPIC BeadChip. We quality-controlled, residualized, and normalized the DNAm data, mapped genomic locations to CGCh37/hg19, and adopted the Bonferroni-corrected <italic>P</italic>-value = 4.4 × 10<sup>−10</sup> threshold to denote epigenome- and metabolome-wide statistical significance of association between predictor and epigenetic mark.

For those, roughly the failed differential diagnoses are about 15%. It is difficult to diagnose epilepsy, in many cases, a genetic study of the patient is required, and these may lead to false negatives. For those cases, we estimate similarity between epilepsy and other close disorders by transforming gene sets into phenotype sets to provide a clinical similarity between genetic diseases. The tool is called PhenoExam.</p><p id="Par5977"><bold>Methods:</bold> PhenoExam uses a score that evaluates how many relevant phenotypes the reference panel shares with the test panel and how similar is the representation of the shared phenotypes in relative terms. It works on HPO and MGI ontologies.</p><p id="Par5978"><bold>Results:</bold> We have created a phenotypic space for 120 diseases whose gene-based definitions where obtained from Genomics England PanelApp. Panels closest to epilepsy are hereditary ataxia, inherited white matter disease and hereditary neuropathy. Through PhenoExam we have refined the epilepsy panel predicting new epilepsy genes. They have a higher PhenoExam score of phenotype similarity than random genes (P &lt; 10<sup>−5</sup>). Amongst those genes are KIF1A, NFASC, RYR2, CELF2.</p><p id="Par5979"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> PhenoExam allows us to situate diseases, defined by a set of genes into a metric space based on phenotypical descriptions emerging from individual genes.

However, a great challenge in the analysis of exome sequencing experiments is how to identify variants that are clinically relevant among an overwhelming number of variants with no functional consequences. Many bioinformatic scores exist for predicting the pathogenicity of genetic variants. In this work, we compared their performances, and we tested if it was possible to improve the accuracy of pathogenicity predictions by combining the available bioinformatic scores into a unified Machine Learning model using Logistic Regression. This integrated strategy improves the performance by almost 5% with respect to the best algorithm available in the literature and interestingly reduces by 7% the rate of benign variants that are wrongly classified as pathogenic. By integrating additional features, among which Minor Allele Frequency (MAF) and the number of Pubmed articles related to the rs code (pubmed_rss), the Machine Learning model further improves the performance of almost 10% with respect to the best single algorithm alone and further decreases the rate of false positive up to 11%. This novel integrated score for pathogenic variant prediction, that incorporates multiple sources of information into a single score, can therefore facilitate the analysis of exome sequencing experiments and speed up the identification of pathogenic variants by performing a more stringent and accurate selection of variants.</p><p id="Par5993"><bold>E.

Information is amalgamated from ENCODE, Ensembl, FANTOM5, VISTA, dbSUPER, EPDnew, UCNEbase, CraniofacialAtlas and GTEx. GeneHancer creates a unique non-redundant and comprehensive view of regulatory elements, including their target gene associations, transcription factor binding sites, tissue specificity and super-enhancer mapping. We recently focus on phenotype/disease annotation of such elements, based on variant-trait mappings from the GWAS Catalog, and literature-curated evidence from DiseaseEnhancer and NCBI Entrez Gene. GeneHancer is now used by a considerable fraction of GeneCards’ 4 million user base to annotate non-coding variants, and is included as a native regulation track at the UCSC genome browser, where it is the only source for explicit regulatory regions and gene associations. GeneHancer provides an indispensable augmentation for the GeneCards’ NGS disease interpretation tools: VarElect, a phenotype interpreter (PMID:27357693), and TGex, a VCF-to-report analyzer (PMID:31888639), used by major clinical sequencing centers. Non-coding variants are mapped to regulatory regions, and then prioritized with respect to diseases and phenotype keywords via direct and target gene-mediated links. Such capacities provide a comprehensive route to deciphering the clinical significance of non-coding single nucleotide and structural variations, thus helping to elucidate unsolved disease cases.

GENCODE (annotation produced by EMBL-EBI) and RefSeq (NCBI) produce comprehensive and complementary human gene annotation. The large number of alternatively spliced transcripts, together with unstandardised use of canonical transcripts across resources, can present challenges, especially in the clinical context. To address this, EMBL-EBI and NCBI are working together on the Matched Annotation from the NCBI and EMBL-EBI (MANE) initiative. The aim is to generate a genome-wide transcript set that: 1) aligns to GRCh38, 2) includes pairs of 100% identical Ensembl/GENCODE (ENST) and RefSeq (NM) transcripts and 3) is well-supported. The output, the MANE Select set, will include one transcript that is representative of biology at each protein-coding locus across the genome. Select transcripts are identified using independent computational pipelines complemented by manual review and discussion. The pipelines utilise evidence of functional potential such as expression levels, evolutionary conservation, and clinical significance. Currently, we have released MANE Select transcripts for 75% of protein-coding loci across the genome, including 83% of validated clinical genes and 90% of ACMG59 genes. We aim to achieve genome-wide coverage in 2020 and are working closely with partners to encourage adoption of the MANE set on browsers and in clinical workflows. We envision this dataset serving as a unified high-value reference set for use in comparative genomics, clinical reporting and basic research. Released transcripts are available on all genome browsers and on the NCBI’s FTP site.

Improved discovery, by further increasing study sizes is not the only strategy. Leveraging information from published studies of related traits can improve inference.

These include refining existing and developing new high-performance tools for missing data imputation, performing multi-phenotype (epi)genome-wide association studies (EWAS/GWAS) and performing EWAS/GWAS of composite measurements, as well as upcycling GWAS summary statistics to more recent genotype imputation panels. The showcase of the developed platform is located at <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.anglia.prokopenkogroup.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.anglia.prokopenkogroup.org/</ext-link> and will serve for the very immediate needs of the scientists working in the fields of genetics, epidemiology and statistical omics, and eventually to different branches of medicine through more accurate research of the omics data. Our proposed framework has potential to enhance statistical omics association studies of any kind, and enable new <italic>in-silico</italic> discoveries to advance further our understating of complex human conditions.

However, in epidemiological studies additional family and temporal information, e.g. family history, disease prevalence and age-of-onset, are routinely accounted for. The recently proposed methods; GWAX: genome-wide association study by proxy (Liu et al., Nat Genet 2017), LT-FH: liability threshold model, conditional on family history (Hujoel et al., BioRxiv 2019) and Cox regression GWAS (Staley et al., EJHG 2017) incorporate either family history or temporal information, but not both. Here we present a new method that extends LT-FH to account for both family and temporal information.</p><p id="Par6021">We compared our approach to both standard GWAS, GWAX, and LT-FH using simulated polygenic liabilities and case-control phenotypes. When only accounting for sex of family members, we observed a modest improvement (3% increased power) over LT-FH and large improvement over GWAX (53% increased power) in simulations assuming a disease prevalence of 4% in males and 1% in females. Accounting for changes in disease prevalence over time, age-of-onset, and oversampling cases (a common strategy in genetic studies) further increases statistical power. We applied our approach to several psychiatric and neurological disorders in the iPSYCH study of five serious mental disorders: ADHD, Autism, Bipolar disorder, Depression, and Schizophrenia with more than 80,000 psychiatric cases and 50,000 controls.</p><p id="Par6022">In summary, the liability-threshold model is a promising approach to increase power in GWAS when family history, disease prevalence over time, and temporal information is available.</p><p id="Par6023"><bold>E.M.

The availability of SumStats has also proven beneficial for the development of new statistical methods, conditional associations, and integration with other omics. The NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas" ext-link-type="uri">www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas</ext-link>) expanded its scope to include SumStats in 2017 and is now the largest and most updated freely available SumStats resource. Thanks to the increase of SumStats links in research articles, along with direct submission to the Catalog, the percentage of new publications with available SumStats in the Catalog has increased from 6% in 2017 to 44% in 2019 and now includes over 10,000 datasets. Despite an increase in author submissions, the percentage of publications with available SumStats remains relatively low, with 86% of Catalog publications not having available SumStats. In an aim to facilitate the data sharing, we have developed a web-based deposition interface to support author submission of SumStats and meta-data from publications. We are also planning a workshop to address the standards, infrastructure and incentives required to promote and enable sharing of SumStats. The workshop will bring together participants from the diverse stakeholder space, including researchers, journal editors, funding bodies, and biobank representatives. The aim is to reach a consensus and publish an agreed action plan for SumStats sharing and standardization which will have a positive impact on the GWAS community.</p><p id="Par6027"><bold>M.

We built three BN structures representing the alternative hypotheses of the causal relations between CNV, gene expression and methylation. The parameters of these networks were estimated by using MLE. Afterwards, we examined the compatibility of these structures with the data by using the AIC score. After fitting all the models, there were 17 models where the best model was at least ten times more likely than the second best model.</p><p id="Par6040"><bold>Discussion and Conclusion:</bold> The availability of different levels of “-omics” data allowed us to explore the relationship between disease-associated “-omics” profiles, specifically for genetic variation, methylation and gene expression. We build three BN structure for the alternative causal relations and detected several cases of three-way associations where either genetically driven DNA methylation levels impact gene expression profiles, or genetically driven gene expression traits impact DNA methylation levels. Overall, these results suggest that the effects of DNA methylation can be both active on gene expression levels, and passive, by being a consequence for gene expression levels.

HH is characterised by the accumulation of iron, which, if untreated, can lead to the development of liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. An iron overload screening tool (IRON), employing traditional statistical methods on self-reported and non-laboratory data, has been proposed. This tool obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 68.5%, demonstrating great potential of integrating different types of self-reported and clinical data into computational screening tools. However, the utility of such tools is limited by challenges associated with efficiently handling and combining large amounts of structured and unstructured data from different sources. We have developed a novel computational model to identify individuals at risk of HH, using the family study data of the HEIRS cohort. This dataset, consisting of 254 cases and 701 controls, contains variables extracted from questionnaires and biomarker values. These variables were ranked using statistical and recursive feature elimination methods. The model was trained on an XGBoost classifier using the most significant risk factors: HFE C282Y homozygosity, age, mean corpuscular volume, iron level, serum ferritin level, transferrin saturation, and unsaturated iron-binding capacity. Parameter optimisation was carried out with multiple runs, resulting in an AUC of 87.03% ± 5.43 for 10-fold stratified cross-validation. Since iron overload is preventable and treatable if diagnosed early, individuals at high risk can benefit from efficient screening strategies employing artificial intelligence-based approaches.</p><p id="Par6045"><bold>P.

Many tools exists for ROH discovery that rely on data from genotyping arrays or exome sequencing (ES). Since most of these tools had bad performances or were difficult to use, we have developed a new tool: AutoMap (Autozygosity Mapper). AutoMap directly uses standard VCF files as primary source of data. A careful variant filtering step is implemented prior to the identification of ROHs by a sliding-window approach and subsequent filtering. The tool was first trained on ES data from 26 samples from consanguineous families, and further validated in 26 additional samples. AutoMap displayed similar performance for both training and validation cohorts, with sensitivity of 90.5% and 92.4% respectively and showed the best sensitivity/specificity combination with respect to 8 existing tools. When applied to unpublished ES data, AutoMap allowed the discovery of ROHs containing homozygous non-coding variants that led to the identification of disease genes for five novel conditions including the Liberfarb syndrome. AutoMap is a reliable tool that can predict, in less than a minute, ROHs with high specificity and sensitivity by using a single VCF file. Our tool is available both via a web-based interface, for a quick analysis with default parameters, as well as a command-line package, allowing assessment of a large numbers of samples, the customization of many parameters and analysis of VCFs from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) experiments.</p><p id="Par6049"><bold>M.

The efficiency our method is achieved by combining advanced data structures (PBWT) with a new powerful linear-time sampling algorithm.

GLIMPSE is more accurate for the full allele-frequency range and for rare variants the difference is more pronounced, as GLIMPSE gets an increased accuracy of more than 20%. Notably, these improvements are obtained in running times that are several orders of magnitude shorter of other methods, archiving imputation of a full genome for less than 1$.</p><p id="Par6072">Our results show that 1x coverage enables effective association studies in standard eQTL settings and is better suited than SNP arrays to access the impact of rare variations.

Prior biological knowledge (such as DNA annotations, pathways, and gene expression) is used to create layers limited to functionally meaningful connections, thereby constructing computational feasible and interpretable network architectures.

Overtrimmed reads and adapter contamination can be challenging for downstream analysis. We have proposed an algorithm called AdapMiR for the trimming adapters and further analysis of miRNA expression that turns these drawbacks into advantages. Our algorithm can achieve high accuracy of adapter trimming and discard non-miRNA reads.</p><p id="Par6109"><bold>Material and Methods:</bold> AdapMiR was implemented in R language. miRNA-seq data of atherosclerotic plaques (<italic>n</italic> = 5) and healthy vessels (<italic>n</italic> = 5) was used as a test dataset. Mature miRNAs sequences were obtained from miRBase and used for construction of artificial reference including adapter sequences. BWA and edgeR were used for read alignment and differential expression analysis. We compared developed algorithm with miARma-Seq and Trimmomatic in high sensitivity mode. AdapMiR is freely available (<ext-link xlink:href="https://github.com/alekseizarubin/AdapMiR" ext-link-type="uri">https://github.com/alekseizarubin/AdapMiR</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par6110"><bold>Results and discussion:</bold> Results of adapMiR and Trimmomatic differed for 55% of miRNA reads. Moreover, we noticed a peculiarity in Trimmomatic output: the lesser read length the more probable was overtrimming, but longer read sequences (≥20 bp) could contain adapter fragments. In contrast, AdapMiR did not produced excessively trimmed reads while filtered out erroneously read nucleotides. Only 2% of total counts per sample differed between algorithms. The number of differentially expressed miRNAs between atherosclerotic plaques and healthy vessels were equal (<italic>n</italic> = 151), but resulting lists of both algorithms was different by 18 miRNA.</p><p id="Par6111"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> AdapMiR is comparable to miARma-Seq approach.

However, despite increasing accuracy of available approaches, the need to assess sequencing quality of the analysis targets at the base-pair resolution poses growing challenges, especially in the clinical settings.

It has been shown that intolerance to variation of coding and proximal non-coding sequence is a strong predictor of human disease relevance. Here, we expand on published methods by applying a tiled genome-wide Residual Variation Intolerance Score (gwRVIS) to Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data from 62,784 individuals with lower gwRVIS corresponding to greater intolerance to genetic variation. We verified that gwRVIS distinguishes sequence occupied by human Mendelian disease genes from intergenic sequence (median gwRVIS −0.54 versus −0.011; <italic>p</italic> = 2.4 × 10<sup>−195</sup>). Remarkably, despite being focused solely on human lineage purifying selection, gwRVIS identified sequence occupied by known ultra-conserved non-coding elements as the most intolerant category (median gwRVIS = −0.85; <italic>p</italic> &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−320</sup>). gwRVIS also boosts predictive performance in pathogenic variant detection from ClinVar in intergenic regions, lincRNAs and UTRs. We then employ gwRVIS along with functional genomic annotation (including methylation and chromatin accessibility) and primary genomic sequence to build “Junk Annotation” RVIS (JARVIS): a comprehensive deep learning model to prioritise non-coding variants using only human lineage-specific information. Despite not incorporating any conservation information, JARVIS outperforms every comparable score on pathogenicity inference of non-coding variants and performs comparably or better in some cases over current state-of-the-art methods that do employ conservation information. Both gwRVIS and JARVIS capture previously inaccessible human-lineage constraint information as derived from 62,784 WGS to help prioritise genetic variants found in the human non-coding regulatory sequence and further enable the pursuit of novel drug targets and biomarkers in the non-coding genome.</p><p id="Par6131"><bold>D.

Unfortunately, the problem of missing heritability still prevails, despite several previous studies had improved the conventional polygenic risk score, for which risk alleles were weighted by the effect size of their association with given trait and summed up. To alleviate the problem here we systematically explore epistasis between genes that may modulate polygenic risk score for greater accuracy. Specifically, we developed a model assuming multiplicative interactions between different loci and applied the model to blood assay quantitative traits in UK Biobank. To avoid overfitting emerged from enumerated variables depicting many interactions between loci, we employed a shrinkage method.

The resulting local selective pressures in each of these geographically distinct populations varied in direction and strength, and led to a plethora of divergent phenotypic adaptations. This research studies the genomic fingerprint left by these processes for hair colour, a trait with substantial inter and intra-population phenotypic variation, that we use as a proof-of-concept for differential adaptation. Genomic regions strongly associated with hair colour are defined based on a published GWAS of the white British population. Evidence for positive selection in these regions is evaluated with a single, composite statistic. This statistic is produced by merging five different tests of positive selection with the De-correlated Composite of Multiple Signals method, used for multivariate analyses. By applying conservative P-rank transformations, we integrate signal information from both of haplotype homozygosity and Site-Frequency Spectrum (SFS) into a single, normally distributed parameter of adaptation. Association between hair colour and selection is tested using permutation-based methodologies. Significant regions from the British hair-colour GWAS are tested for selection across all 26 populations present in the 1000 Genomes database (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.internationalgenome.org/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.internationalgenome.org/</ext-link>), comparing how positive selection shaped each of them. As selective sweeps often lead to extreme allele frequencies (MAF, it is possible that intermediate size alleles undergoing recent adaptation are nearly fixed and thus undetectable by GWAS. To evaluate this effect the analysis is repeated selecting GWAS regions based on effect sizes instead of <italic>p</italic>-values.</p><p id="Par6153"><bold>F. Ganau:</bold> None. <bold>C.S.

Its reliability relies heavily on both the presence in the maternal blood of a sufficient amount of fetal DNA (ff for fetal fraction) and a sufficient sequencing depth (sd).

For missense variants their direct effect is largely determined by their local environment as dictated by their position in the protein structure.

Clumping and Thresholding (C+T) is a widely used method to derive polygenic scores. We implement an efficient way to derive thousands of different C+T polygenic scores corresponding to a grid over several hyper-parameters. We find that optimizing over the proposed four hyper-parameters improves the predictive performance of C+T in both simulations and real data applications, as compared to tuning only the <italic>p</italic>-value threshold of C+T. A particularly large increase can be noted when predicting depression status, from an AUC of 0.557 (95% CI: [0.544-0.569]) when tuning only the <italic>p</italic>-value threshold in C+T to an AUC of 0.592 (95% CI: [0.580-0.604]) when tuning all four hyper-parameters of C+T. Overall, by optimizing C+T polygenic scores, one can achieve prediction accuracies on par with more sophisticated approaches such as LDpred and lassosum (Vilhjálmsson 2015, Mak 2017).</p><p id="Par6171">We further propose Stacked Clumping and Thresholding (SCT). Instead of choosing one set of hyper-parameters that maximizes prediction in some training set, SCT learns an optimal linear combination of all C+T scores (stacking). We apply SCT to 8 different case-control diseases in the UK biobank data and find that SCT significantly improves prediction accuracy compared to C+T, resulting in an average AUC increase of 0.035 over standard C+T.

It is estimated that 30 million people in Europe suffer from a rare disease. There are currently about 7000 rare diseases known with more being discovered continually. The field of rare diseases suffers from a deficit of medical and scientific knowledge. These diseases reside in the ‘unchartered space’ of biomedical research with their treatment marred by a dearth of medical and biochemical knowledge. This has led to development and implementation of several strategies to tackle the treatment of rare and debilitating diseases. For example, the EU supports research into rare diseases through Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation. Via Horizon 2020, about €900 million is available to more than 160 collaborative projects related to rare diseases. The core services of INFRAFRONTIER (the European Research Infrastructure for Mouse Models) comprise of the systemic phenotyping of mouse mutants in the participating mouse clinics, and the archiving and distribution of mouse mutant lines by the European Mouse Mutant Archive (EMMA) which also include lines important for rare disease research. To consolidate and present the INFRAFRONTIER / EMMA resources related to rare diseases in an easily accessible location, the INFRAFRONTIER and Rare Diseases web page was created, providing access to a) EMMA strains related to rare diseases b) EMMA publications related to rare diseases and c) information on INFRAFRONTIER activities at rare disease conferences.

Machine learning tools that predict the consequence of missense variants typically perform unreliably on novel variants since there is little information to be used in training sets. We previously developed Paralogue Annotation (PA); a method that does not require training, but instead exploits an under-utilised source of information. We look for functionally equivalent variants of known consequence at equivalent positions across paralogous protein families and use their information to predict pathogenicity. This method was validated in a restricted set of arrhythmia syndrome genes. Here, we extend it exome-wide.</p><p id="Par6188"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Paralogue relationships as defined by Ensembl were examined in 7,016 protein-coding genes associated with human diseases, that harbor 48,258 (Likely) Pathogenic/Benign missense variants from ClinVar.

With current variants in ClinVar, we identify 178,378 potentially informative annotations exome-wide.</p><p id="Par6190"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> PA represents an under-used source of information with an extremely high positive predictive value for identifying novel and rare disease-causing variants.

However, the reference genome lacks some population-specific sequences, is mainly composed of genomes from African or European origins, and has &gt; 90,000 rare reference alleles. Here we report JG1, a population-specific reference genome built by integrating three de novo Japanese genome assemblies. We performed three de novo hybrid assemblies of &gt;100X PacBio long reads and &gt;100X Bionano optical maps per individual. After error-correction with the long and &gt;50X short reads, the three assemblies were meta-assembled by using mate-pair information. We then replaced minor alleles in the meta-assembled genome by major alleles defined among the three individual assemblies. Finally, we built pseudo-chromosomes by anchoring each scaffold to each chromosome on the basis of marker positional information from genetic and radiation hybrid maps. The resulting genome JG1 was highly contiguous (Scaffold NG50 = 141 Mb), concordant with GRCh38 (only 1,654 mis-assemblies), and replaced minor reference allele in 96% of 650,718 SNV sites (non-reference allele frequency &gt; 90% in Japanese population). Moreover, we performed confirmatory exome re-analysis of rare diseases using JG1 as a reference, and found that the number of total variant calls was smaller in JG1 than in the reference hs37d5, while the variant call set retained the causal variants. These results suggest that integration of multiple assemblies is an effective way to build a high-quality population-specific reference genome.

Current algorithmic approaches focus on characterization of significant differential expression or alternative splicing without integrating both events. Here, we present Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis of Differential Expression and ALternative Splicing (HBA-DEALS), which simultaneously characterizes differential expression and splicing in cohorts. The statistical model of HBA-DEALS characterizes genes as having differential gene expression (DGE), differential alternative splicing (DAST), both, or neither. We analyzed 50 simulated datasets for DGE with HBA-DEALS and five other top-performing DGE analysis tools: voom, DESeq2, edgeR, baySeq, and NOISeq. We analyzed the same datasets for DAST with rMATS. HBA-DEALS displayed a larger area under the precision-recall curve than the other approaches did for both DGE and DAST. To assess the accuracy of HBA-DEALS using real data, we ran HBA-DEALS on estimated isoform levels from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We used HBA-DEALS to identify differentially expressed and differentially spliced genes in 20 different pairs of tissues and found a high degree of overlap of genes identified as differentially expressed or spliced (p &lt; 2.23 × 10<sup>−308</sup> for all comparisons, hypergeometric test). Based on an analysis of the GTEx data, we demonstrate the existence of sets of genes that show predominant DGE or DAST across a comparison of 20 tissue pairs, and show that these sets have pervasive differences with respect to gene structure, function, membership in protein complexes, and promoter architecture.</p><p id="Par6199"><bold>P.N.

Several algorithms have been developed to detect ROHs. Here, we developed a simple, alternative strategy by examining X chromosome non-pseudoautosomal region (Non-PAR) to detect the ROHs from NGS data utilizing the genotype probabilities and the hidden Markov model (HMM) algorithm as a tool, namely ROHMM. It is implemented purely in java and contains both command line and GUI. ROHMM can operate in a range from single sample to population scale data alike.</p><p id="Par6203"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> NGS genotype data is from 1000G phase3. 25 deep sequenced whole genome data (10 males, 15 females) were processed to collect genotyping results from the X chromosome Non-PAR.

We present a drive by Ensembl-GENCODE to radically improve our understanding of disease gene structure and function, deploying a fully integrated, manually supervised workflow incorporating state-of-the-art transcriptomics datasets with enormous tissue coverage alongside targeted proteogenomics and in-depth phylogenetic assessment. Crucially, we can specifically identify ‘missing’ gene features that appear most likely to be biologically relevant, and thus of potential clinical importance. Previously, our re-annotation of 191 epilepsy genes led to the identification of 3 novel <italic>de novo SCN1A</italic> mutations within a panel of 122 patients with Dravet’s syndrome. We are expanding this work in collaboration with clinical partners to query additional genes and experimental datasets, and our efforts have now progressed into gene panels for other diseases. We will present potentially crucial new understandings of genes such as <italic>POLG</italic>, which is linked to mitochondrial disease. Nonetheless, genic insights provided by Ensembl-GENCODE do not efficiently propagate into the clinic, for two major reasons: firstly, genomics projects - both small and large scale - typically utilise older annotations; secondly, investigative work and diagnostics often incorporate a single transcript model per gene. We will therefore outline our proposed strategy for the targeted dissemination of new annotation information into different parts of the scientific community and would welcome feedback on these ideas.

Nowadays the molecular bases of sex associated differences in complex traits remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that given the marked causal involvement of gene expression levels in complex traits, sex-biased trait associations might be driven by sex-biased eQTLs.To challenge this assumption, we performed a genome-wide analysis of sex-specific whole blood RNA-seq eQTLs from 3,447 individuals. Amongst the pre-selected 9 million SNP-gene pairs (based on sex-combined association), we identified 18 genes with significantly (FDR 5%) different eQTL effects in men and women. PheWAS analyses for these 18 eGenes on &gt;700 traits revealed that sex-biased eQTLs in <italic>CDIP1</italic> and <italic>PSMD5</italic> translate into sex-specific trait-associations for trunk predicted mass. However, such examples are sporadic and sex-specific expression regulation does not systematically propagate to high-level traits. Next, we applied a sex-specific transcriptome-wide Mendelian Randomization approach (TWMR) by combining sex-specific summary statistics for both eQTLs and complex traits and observed the presence of a compensatory effect downstream of gene expression, e.g. genes with stronger eQTLs in women have weaker woman-specific causal effects on complex traits. Finally, we show that the sex-specific GWAS associations are not driven by sex-biased eQTLs. Our findings suggest that sex-specific trait associations can rarely occur as a consequence of sex-specific gene expression regulation in whole blood, hence other omics data are necessary to better understand the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism.</p><p id="Par6214"><bold>E.

Epigenetic regulation is an underinvestigated basal cause initiating and sustaining cancer cells development. In this context, Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a fundamental role in remodeling chromatin and thus regulating gene expression towards cell proliferation and de-differentiation (PMID 21416059). Currently, there are more than 20 HDAC inhibitor drugs approved for cancer treatment or in clinical trials. These inhibitors can promote cell differentiation and apoptosis and ultimately reduce cancer cell growth, infiltration and angiogenesis. However, little is known on the early transcriptional response induced by HDAC inhibitors, particularly in Neuroblastoma. Current transcriptomics techniques (microarrays and bulk RNA-Seq) lack the ability to understand short-term transcriptional responses at a single cell resolution. Here, we measure transcript expression from 2000 single cells from Neuroblastoma cell lines treated with an HDAC pan-inhibitor using 10x Genomics with Cell Hashing and Illumina sequencing. Our analysis of single-cell gene expression profiles detected an increased proportion of cells in G1 phase in inhibitor-treated Neuroblastoma cells. Amongst these we were able to identify progressively differentiated and apoptotic cell populations. We also detect a high heterogeneity in individual cells transcriptional response upon drug delivery, linked with short-term rewiring and/or the insurgence of resistance mechanisms. This can help understanding how HDAC inhibitors can benefit from the combination with other drugs, in order to further guide the tumor’s molecular machinery towards differentiation and apoptosis.</p><p id="Par6224"><bold>G.

Mutations outside the ss but affecting “regulatory elements” can be up to 25%. Accurate deleteriousness prediction for intronic variants is crucial for diagnostic purposes. Many deleteriousness prediction methods have been developed, but their relative values are still unclear in practical applications. We comprehensively evaluated the predictive performance of two complementary deleteriousness-scoring methods using information from real patients.</p><p id="Par6237"><bold>Material and Methods:</bold> We selected the dbscSNV (both ADA and RF scores) and SPIDEX algorithms, that study variants in splicing consensus regions or in regulatory regions respectively. The tools, either alone or in combination, were tested on 29294 gene intronic SNVs that have previously been characterised by ClinVar as either “pathogenic” (430) or “benign” (28864). The sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were calculated. Moreover, we applied the algorithms to WES data from undiagnosed patients, and we analysed the mRNA sequence from genes that fitted the patient’s phenotype.</p><p id="Par6238"><bold>Results:</bold> The highest sensitivity corresponds to dbscSNV with 96.55% while the best specificity is for SPIDEX with 95.78%.

Insertions are one of the hardest type to discover and are drastically underrepresented in gold standard variant call sets. The advent of long read technologies has completely changed the situation. In 2019, two independent cross technologies studies have published the most complete variant call sets with sequence resolved insertions in human individuals. Among the reported insertions, only 15% could be discovered with short-read based tools. In this work, we performed an in-depth analysis of these unprecedented insertion call sets, in order to investigate the causes of such failures. We have first established a precise classification of insertion variants according to three different layers of characterization: the nature of the inserted sequence, the genomics context of the insertion site and the breakpoints junction complexity. Because these levels are intertwined, we used simulations to characterize the impact of each complexity factor. Most reported insertions exhibited characteristics that may interfere with their discovery: 50% were tandem repeat expansions, 40% contained homologies larger than 20 bp within their breakpoints junctions and 70% were located in simple repeats. Consequently, the recall of short-read based variant callers was significantly lower for such insertions (7% vs 54% for mobile element and novel insertions). Simulations showed that the most impacting factor on the discovery rate was the insertion type rather than the genomics context, and that the different factors of insertion complexities were handled differently depending on the chosen tool.</p><p id="Par6259"><bold>W.

Efficient variant prioritisation and interpretation is essential for delivering a timely diagnosis which can be facilitated by cross-referencing results from previous patients and applying filtering strategies based on ACMG variant classification guidelines.

It maintains a historical record of previous analyses, displaying variant frequency in the patient cohort, previous variant classifications and allows the application of additional panels to the data as required. TaPAS streamlines the process of variant classification and genomic diagnosis, optimises interpretation and reanalysis of tNGS data and reduces turnaround times.</p><p id="Par6287"><bold>J.

While common risk variants are identified by GWAS, the conclusive identification of causal private/rare variants remains challenging. Collapsing rare variants into groups, as performed in gene burden analyses, is difficult for non-coding regions, due to the lack of functional annotations. Here we combine resequencing data of non-coding regions with information of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), to identify novel etiological variants and molecular players in non-syndromic cleft lip with/without cleft palate (nsCL/P). We used data of 691 European cases and 854 European controls, in which functional candidate regions at three GWAS risk loci (total 56.7 kb) had been resequenced using molecular inversion probes. Based on 624 rare variants (MAF&lt;1%) and position weight matrix information, we predicted TFBS for 810 human transcription factors from JASPAR2020. Of the 370 motifs that were hit by at least one rare variant (total number: 4,013), 21 motifs were hit significantly more often in cases compared to controls. When integrating the predicted allelic effect on TF binding capacity, we identified an additional set of nine TFs where in aggregate the variants’ effects on the motif were stronger in cases. Across both approaches, consistent effects were observed for TF motifs of FOXO6 and ZEB1, suggesting them as molecular players in nsCL/P at these loci. This analysis framework will improve systematic evaluation of rare variant data and can be extended to large data sets, such as from whole genome sequencing studies.</p><p id="Par6291"><bold>H.K.

It provides a set of tools for supporting the full workflow from (i) variant data quality control, (ii) variant filtration and (iii) efficient assessment of variants based on visual alignment inspection and annotation data such as functional and frequency annotation. The system allows to organize data into a folder structure of projects with access control. Variant quality metrics can be displayed project- (and thus cohort-) wise or for single cases/families. The variants themselves can be filtered based on genotype, population frequency, variant effect, quality metrics, and annotation such as membership in ClinVar or HGMD Public. A special ClinVar-centric view allows for the easy screening of variants based on pathogenicity annotation in ClinVar. After filtration of the variants, their quick and efficient assessment is supported by various tools: color flags and commenting allows for simple yet effective note-taking, remote-controlling the genome viewer IGV to display a variant’s locus, and some important database excerpts are available directly within the system. Assessment documentation according to ACMG-AMP is also supported. Further, link-out to external databases (e.g., ENSEMBL or NCBI), allow the assessment of variants using MutationTaster, SIFT, or various splice site assessment tools. Filtered data sets can be downloaded as VCF or Excel files (including comments and flags) or submitted to external tools such as MutationDistiller. VarFish also allows for querying the GA4GH beacon network for individual variants.</p><p id="Par6309"><bold>M. Holtgrewe:</bold> None. <bold>O. Stolpe:</bold> None. <bold>M.

A combination of different variant callers allows a wider set of variant types to be detected. Current approaches that make use of different variant callers rely on merging or concatenating individual sets of variant calls that have high confidence for a specific caller. This approach however, needs to tradeoff between low sensitivity or specificity for variants that have lower confidence calls in individual variant callers, but are still true variants. Our approach obviates this problem by fusing normalized and decomposed variant-records of all different callers to allow filtering of individual variants based on the information from all different callers. Variants in the fused dataset are subsequently filtered using parameters specific to the individual caller, to a combination of different callers and to the combined variant calls of the entire run. The pooled likelihood matrixes of different callers in fused variant entries proved to be especially useful for categorizing low frequent variant calls (AF &lt;=5%). This pipeline was brought in clinical routine for a solid tumor gene panel and a hematological malignancy gene panel. We used 3 variant callers (unified genotyper (2x) and MuTect) and defined over 20 filter rules. Only 2 from 25 cutoffs required a slight adaptation between the two different sample tests with different sample types, FF and FFPE, indicating a general applicability of this approach.</p><p id="Par6313"><bold>S.

As such, genomic variants in splicing regions have been linked to various genetic diseases. In order to assist the identification of splice altering variants from genetic data, a number of methods aim to predict splicing effects. Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to achieve better results on predicting splice variants genome-wide. However, these methods have been barely adopted in genome-wide variant effect prediction.</p><p id="Par6317">We use the Multiplexed Functional Assay of Splicing using Sort-seq (MFASS) dataset to assess several new machine learning methods that score variant splicing effects. To build a general variant effect model, we integrate two of those approaches into our genome-wide variant prioritization tool Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD, cadd.gs.washington.edu), that weights and integrates a diverse collection of other annotations.</p><p id="Par6318">We show that the new DNN scores improve prediction across multiple variant categories. While splice effect scores show superior performance on splice variants, the specialized predictors cannot compete with other variant scores in general variant interpretation, as these also account for nonsense and missense effects that do not alter splicing. This suggests that by integrating domain-specific information from for example splice scores, variant prioritization can generally be improved. We believe that this effect is universal and outlines the importance of developing domain specific scores for regulatory sequences, UTRs or non-coding RNA species.</p><p id="Par6319"><bold>P.

In clinical variant calling, complementary standards to identify high- and low- confidence sites are needed in order to detect systematic effects that generalize to any sample.</p><p id="Par6323">With increased sequencing throughput, we can query population-level sequence data to obtain 1000s of independent per-site measures.

We identified 930 potential high impact coding variants, most of which are rare and discrete to a single African subgroup. Significant frequency differences (i.e. &gt;10%) are seen in common high impact variants between subgroups. For some of the novel variants, we show that their impact could be deleterious at the protein structure level.

Up to 50-60% of differences in sensitivity to therapy in asthma patients is due to genetics. We studied polymorphisms in genes involved in the metabolism of glucocorticoids (<italic>GLCCI1</italic>, <italic>TBXT</italic>, <italic>ALLC</italic>, <italic>FBXL7</italic>, <italic>MAGI2</italic>) and the methylation status of <italic>GLCCI1</italic> gene in asthma patients and healthy individuals. The study was conducted in 350 children with asthma and 363 non-atopic children of different ethnicity from the Volga-Ural region of Russia. Genotyping was carried out by RT-PCR. The methylation status of the promoter region of the <italic>GLCCI1</italic> gene was determined based on bisulfite conversion of DNA, the methylation-sensitive melt curve analysis and sequencing of samples with different levels of methylation. The association of the <italic>GLCCI1</italic>*rs37973<italic>G</italic> allele with uncontrolled asthma (<italic>p</italic> = 0,02, OR=1,74) in Tatars was defined.

Activation is required via the P450 cytochrome system, of which CYP2C19 is a major component. <italic>CYP2C19</italic> is highly polymorphic, with over 30 loss of function (LOF) alleles. Evidence suggests that outcomes could be improved if individuals with LOF alleles were prescribed alternative antiplatelets.

The assay was developed on the Genedrive® rapid thermocycler using synthetic DNA target templates before validation with genomic DNA. A model-based cost-effectiveness analysis was used to assess the indicative incremental costs and consequences of genotype-guided prescribing, compared with current practice. A focus-group composed of stroke survivors explored acceptability of genotype-guided prescribing.</p><p id="Par6381"><bold>Results:</bold> The assay detects *1,*2,*3,*4,*4b,*10 and *17 <italic>CYP2C19</italic> alleles in diplotype, accounting for over 96% of global variation.

CYP2D6 is a prominent phase I metabolizing pathway that mediates up to 25% of clinically used drugs. The goal of this study was to identify CYP2D6 allelic frequencies in an ethnically diverse patient population.</p><p id="Par6387"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> DNA samples were collected from 8457 participants who consented to receive the RightMed Comprehensive test (OneOme, USA). The RightMed Comprehensive test report provides pharmacogenomic interpretation for 27 genes (111 alleles) and guidance on 300+ medications. CYP2D6 genotypes and their respective predictive phenotype interpretation were analyzed.</p><p id="Par6388"><bold>Results:</bold> Out of a total of 8457 participants, 68.9% self-identified as White or Caucasian, 4.4% as Hispanic or Latino, 3.4% as Asian, and 2.6% as Black or African American. The remaining 19.1% of participants selected Unknown or did not provide ethnicity. Poor metabolizers (PMs) with an activity score (AS) of 0 were identified in 7% of individuals identifying as White, 5% of those identified as Hispanic or Latino, 1% of Asian individuals, and 1% of Black or African Americans. Overall, 6% of the total participants were classified as PMs.</p><p id="Par6389"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Pharmacogenomics has become a valuable clinical tool for more effective prescribing by diminishing the risk of adverse drug reactions for several medications resulting in increased success. CYP2D6 plays an essential role, and with more than 110 allele variants, the frequencies fluctuate among populations. Ultimately, for a better understanding and proper implementation, broader allele coverage and accurate collection of sub-ethnicities is needed.</p><p id="Par6390"><bold>B. Esquivel:</bold> A.

Its prevalence in many countries remains unclear, although young-adult non-autoimmune diabetes is increasing. Here, we conducted a transnational multicenter study to identify rare pathogenic mutations causing monogenic diabetes in young-adults, and to assess the diagnosis rates, genetic subtypes and specificities between countries.</p><p id="Par6403"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We performed exome sequencing in 204 unrelated diabetic cases (age-at-diagnosis: 26.1 ± 9.1 years) clinically selected by 30 medical centers in eleven Mediterranean countries. Rare coding variants in 35 targeted genes were evaluated for mutation pathogenicity using American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. One-way ANOVA, chi-squared test, principal component analysis and factor analysis of mixed data were used for data analyses.</p><p id="Par6404"><bold>Results:</bold> Fourty pathogenic (P) or likely pathogenic (LP) mutations were identified in 36 patients yielding an overall genetic diagnosis in 17.6% of the participants. <italic>GCK</italic> (37.5%), <italic>HNF1A</italic> (27.5%), <italic>ABCC8</italic> (12.5%) and <italic>HNF4A</italic> (7.5%) mutations accounted for the majority of cases. We found country wise highly variable diagnosis rates (up to 40% in Greece) and interestingly a higher mutation rate in European ancestry participants. Lower body mass index and HbA1c level at study inclusion, and less insulin treatment at diagnosis and inclusion are hallmarks of the mutation carriers.</p><p id="Par6405"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In practice, our findings impacted patient long-term monitoring and therapeutic regimen. They also highlight broad clinical and genetic spectrum of young-onset diabetes in Mediterranean countries.</p><p id="Par6406">Funded by the French National Research Agency and the Mediterranean Group for Study of Diabetes.</p><p id="Par6407"><bold>M.

In many cases the initial material is insufficient. In those cases EGFR genotyping could be done on BAL or blood samples. In the last few years liquid biopsies prove to be reliable method for EGFR characterization, on the other hand cytology samples are not used that often. In this study we compare the detection rate of EGFR mutations in BAL and blood samples compared to FFPET samples.</p><p id="Par6411"><bold>Materials and Method:</bold> For a period of 9 months 10 patients with EGFR activating mutations have been selected. DNA extraction was performed with QiaAmp Circulating Nucleic Acid kit for plasma and BAL samples. For FFPET samples we used QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit. EGFR genotyping was performed with therascreen EGFR Plasma or tissue RGQ PCR Kits.</p><p id="Par6412"><bold>Results and Discussion:</bold> Activating mutations were confirmed based on EGFR genotyping in FFPET samples. 6 patients had deletions in exon 19, 3 had L858R substitution in exon 21 and one patient had G719x in exon 18. In 9 cases mutations were confirmed in corresponding BAL samples and they were detected in only 4 plasma samples. In 1 case, in both liquid biopsy samples- BAL and plasma, we found T790M mutation along with deletion in exon 19, but not in the corresponding FFPET sample.</p><p id="Par6413"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study shows that BAL samples are superior to plasma samples and almost equal to FFPET samples in detecting EGFR mutations, therefore cytology samples should be preferred before blood samples when possible.</p><p id="Par6414"><bold>I.

However, there has been little real-world evidence published regarding the epidemiology and care delivery of patients with suspected rare genetic diseases at the population level. The objective of this analysis was to characterize the population of patients with indications of rare genetic diseases in a large US healthcare claims database, with a focus on utilization of genetic testing.</p><p id="Par6418"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> This retrospective administrative claims analysis used the Optum Clinformatics database. A total of 12,023,329 patients met inclusion criteria, including continuous enrollment. Curated lists of ICD-9 and ICD-10, CPT codes, and other billing codes were generated to identify patients with indications of suspected genetic diseases. Combinations of variables were used to define patient cohorts for analysis, with different levels of stringency used to define wider vs more conservative cohorts. Separate analyses were completed on critically-ill infants and other pediatric patients.</p><p id="Par6419"><bold>Results:</bold> Up to 12% of pediatric patients (1,450,702) and up to 53% of critically ill infants (26,322) had indicators of genetic disease. Across all cohorts, only a small minority of patients received any genetic testing—between 3 to 9% based on different cohort criteria. Mean time to first genetic test was &gt;350 days for pediatric patients and &gt;140 days for critically-ill infants.</p><p id="Par6420"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The results of this study highlight the substantial patient population with indicators of suspected genetic diseases, but notably, a significant underutilization of genetic testing.</p><p id="Par6421"><bold>B.

PRS were constructed for HipOA (43-SNPs) and KneeOA (23-SNPs) with 11-SNPs shared. Standardized PRSs (zPRS) were constructed to estimate the odds ratios per standard deviation (SD) of zPRS for each subject, weighted by effect sizes and adjusted for age/sex.

If the initiative is national, then it is often population-based. Models are varied, from funding platforms to government-lead initiatives, as well as individual research projects. In some countries, there is full public funding while others opt for public-private-partnerships. The scale of financing varies largely, depending on the span of activities: research, infrastructure, development of genomic testing and analysis, as well as capacity-building and education.

We additionally reported findings whose impact in life-expectancy was not calculated: 15 (3%) pathogenic heterozygous variants in autosomal recessive conditions of ACMG list (<italic>LDLR, MUTYH, ATP7B, APOB</italic> genes) and three variants (0.6%) for autosomal dominant cancer-predisposing conditions not in ACMG list (<italic>CHEK2, RAD51C, BRIP1</italic>).</p><p id="Par6463">We estimate that the reports of incidental findings may have increased life expectancy in our cohort by 88.6 years, or 0.18 year per cohort patient. Since general accessibility to genomic testing is increasing, analysis of clinically-actionable conditions show potential benefit for public health policies in the future.</p><p id="Par6464"><bold>C.R.D.C.

Leveraging genetic information could improve the success rate of drug clinical trial. Previous work showed that molecules with genetic evidence of association with the disease have greater chance of being eventually approved, and that adverse effects can be partially predicted from genetic associations. Here, we argue that multitrait genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is a powerful framework for harnessing genetics to inform drug targeting by: 1) increasing power to identify new drug targets; 2) associating drug targets with biological pathways through clustering; and 3) suggesting drug targets with no indication of likely adverse effects. We conducted a multitrait GWAS of metabolic (lipid and glycemic) traits using our recently developed JASS package (<ext-link xlink:href="http://jass.pasteur.fr/index.html" ext-link-type="uri">http://jass.pasteur.fr/index.html</ext-link>). We identified 405 significant associations, detected six multitrait association signatures (i.e. clusters of genetic variants with similar association pattern) and associated each signature with metabolic pathways. We investigated the links between the identified multitrait association signatures and coronary heart diseases (CHD). Signatures associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, low density lipoprotein or triglycerides were also significantly associated to CHD. Conversely, signatures associated to high density lipoprotein did not exhibit protective effect on CHD. These conclusions were concordant with past or ongoing random control trials on the following molecules: probucol, cetrapid, alirocumab, ezetimibe, and volanesorsen. We provide a list, for signatures associated with CHD, of druggable genes with their associated metabolic pathways that have not been investigated yet.</p><p id="Par6482"><bold>H.

Until now, no universal risk variant(s) have been found. At least 40 different loci have been implicated in PD from genome-wide association studies and an equal number of candidate genes have been revealed by whole exome sequencing-based studies. Thus, highlighting the genetic heterogeneity of PD. Moreover, most of the large scale studies have been conducted in European or Asian cohorts and their findings rarely replicated across populations. Therefore, inclusion of non-European data sets is necessary not only for validating previous findings but also for variant/gene discovery. Genetic studies on complex neurodegenerative disorders in Arabs are lacking. Here we report on the first comprehensive genomic study on 60 PD cases of Arab descent. A three-stage analysis strategy was tailored to detect rare variants in PD. By applying this strategy, 125 new variants affecting 117 genes were identified in 85% of the cases. All of the genes have not be previously linked to PD except two (<italic>EIF4G1</italic> and <italic>ATP13A2</italic>).

Based on the patient’s haplotypes, the MyPGx algorithm predicted possible increased toxicity/risk of side effects for both valsartan and atorvastatin.

Recent estimates point to over 10000 rare diseases, of which 6172 disorders are listed in Orphanet, 71.9% of which being genetic and 69.9% having paediatric-onset. These diseases’ rarity is contextual, varying with the population considered and also geographically. Nonetheless, disease rarity uniformly translates into a delayed diagnosis, with 25% of patients having to wait for 5 to 30 years to have one. It is essential, at the time of diagnosis, to be able to relay information about potential gene and variant-specific therapies to patients. “Solve-RD - solving the unsolved rare diseases” is a research project funded by the European Commission for five years(2018-2022) aiming at improving the diagnostic and therapeutic management of rare diseases. It will deliver seven implementation steps, including one dedicated to treatment as part of the“genetic knowledge web”. With this in mind, we propose a method of allowing clinicians to access this information promptly to benefit patients affected by rare disease and their families. The“Treatabolome” is an evidence-appraised database of rare diseases treatments for specific genes and variants to be made available through genetic diagnosis and support tools, for example, the RD Connect Genome-Phenome Analysis Platform. The Treatabolome aims at contributing to raising awareness and increasing the visibility of existing rare diseases’ treatments to clinicians.</p><p id="Par6534"><bold>Grants:</bold> European Reference Networks ERN Euro-NMD and ERN-RND (project ID 739510), Solve-RD project - EU’s Horizon 2020 grant 779257.</p><p id="Par6535"><bold>A.

However, disagreement exists on what genes and populations should be screened, their clinical utility and the cost/benefit of such tests. This debate should be informed by an understanding of the prevalence of cancer risk variants in different population cohorts. Here we analyzed germline variants from a cohort of 2,658 patients with 38 different types of cancer, whose tumor and matching normal genomes were sequenced as part of the ICGC PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes project. We identified 377,025 non-synonymous germline variants within the regions of an expanded 53-gene hereditary cancer risk panel, which includes genes associated with breast, ovarian, colon, prostate, lung, and other cancers. For expedited and consistent assessment of variant pathogenicity, we utilized a recently developed artificial intelligence-based forward-chaining inference engine, ACE, which implements the ACMG-AMP criteria leveraging variant annotations and codified gene-condition curations. ACE classified automatically 97% of variants, leaving only 1,085 unique variants annotated with a subset of the ACMG criteria for manual review. Overall 5% of cancer patients were carriers of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants, with prevalence higher in patients of renal cell, pancreas adenocarcinoma, ovarian, breast, and liver cancers. A higher frequency of the P/LP variants was observed in the genes ATM, KCHN2, BRCA1/2, and PMS2. As population screening for cancer risk is being actively discussed by healthcare stakeholders, our results illustrate that previously established guidelines could miss people with potentially actionable variants.</p><p id="Par6546"><bold>F.M.

The ACMG (2017) recommends offering the analysis of 59 medically actionable genes (secondary findings, SFs). However, little is known about acceptance rates and penetrance of SFs in patients without family history.</p><p id="Par6550"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We retrospectively reviewed patients (<italic>n</italic> = 641) who underwent exome-sequencing in a Spanish tertiary center from May 2017 to September 2019. During pretest genetic counseling all patients were offered to know SFs or to opt out. We analyzed acceptance and detection rate. In addition, we reviewed type of findings and family history.</p><p id="Par6551"><bold>Results:</bold> The great majority of patients opted to receive SFs. A secondary finding was identified in 11 patients (1,7%). Pathogenic variants were found in genes related to cancer (<italic>SDHB, BRCA2, PMS2, STK11</italic>), cardiomyopathies (<italic>MYBPC3, BAG3, TNNT2, DSC2, DSP</italic>) and channelopathies (<italic>RYR2, SCN5A</italic>). Segregation studies indicated that all variants were inherited with exception of one de novo variant in <italic>RYR2</italic>. Only one family (<italic>BAG3</italic>) met criteria for an a priori genetic testing. In the rest of cases, carriers evaluated so far had no personal/family history and showed no signs of the disease.</p><p id="Par6552"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results show a high acceptance for the return of SFs. Virtually none of the variants would have been a priori identified, since most patients did not have family history to justify specific genetic testing. Further clinical evaluation is being performed to assess penetrance of SFs in the absence of family history.</p><p id="Par6553"><bold>M. Codina Solà:</bold> None. <bold>E.

The NoM was 4.19 ± 1.99, while NoE was 2.54 ± 1.95. Age accounts for 22% of the variability in NoE, while NoM has no impact. Excluding elderly people (≥70 y, <italic>n</italic> = 75) from the analysis, we found that NoE increases with NoM, suggesting a strong role of genetics factors. NoM explains 6% of NoE variability, while age only 4.9% (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p><p id="Par6557">Our findings confirm age as a strong factor influencing smell deficits, and, for the first time, highlight the role of genetics factors (i.e. mutations in OR genes) in predisposing to smell deficits in the general population.

Large-scale reference cohorts such as ExAC/gnomAD are valuable for the population-frequency-based filtering of the myriad of detected sequence variants. Using the example of fibrillinopathies, such as <italic>FBN1</italic>-related Marfan syndrome (MFS) and <italic>FBN2</italic>-related congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA), we assessed the frequency and co-occurrence of pathogenic <italic>FBN1</italic>/<italic>FBN</italic>2 sequence variants in ExAC/gnomAD and the largest Swiss database of Marfan genomes, respectively.</p><p id="Par6583"><bold>Methods:</bold> By focusing on a priori (likely) pathogenic sequence variants in ExAC/gnomAD, we calculated prevalence estimates for MFS and CCA. Furthermore, we screened whole genomes (60× WGS) of ~550 patients with rare (aortic) disorders for (likely) pathogenic and functional sequence variants in <italic>FBN1/FBN2</italic>, and 12 pharmacogenes, respectively.</p><p id="Par6584"><bold>Results:</bold> We show the presence of pathogenic <italic>FBN1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> variants in the apparently healthy reference cohort ExAC/gnomAD, providing prevalence estimates for MFS and CCA.

In spite of using antiretroviral treatments, there are no authorized HIV vaccines. The development in using therapeutic proteins is affected by the limitation on permeability and selectivity of cell membranes. Thus, utilizing cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) as protein transfection reagents or protein transduction domains (PTDs) has been expanded. In addition, heat shock proteins suchlike Hsp27 as intracellular chaperones motivate efficient immune responses.</p><p id="Par6590"><bold>Material and Methods:</bold> Following by the confirmation of the plasmid construct HIV-1 Nef-MPER-V3-LDP12-pET-28a by NdeI/XhoI restriction enzymes digestion, applying prokaryotic expression, SDS-PAGE and western-blotting were utilized. Next, the target protein was purified on Ni-NTA agarose column, dialyzed and evaluated by spectrophotometry. For transfection, 4 × 10<sup>4</sup> HEK-293T cells/well were used and supplied by complete DMEM medium.

Variation in age-specific AMH levels has been associated with breast cancer and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), amongst other diseases. Identification of genetic variants underlying variation in AMH levels could elucidate these AMH-disease associations.</p><p id="Par6620"><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies including data from 7,049 premenopausal female participants of European ancestry, to identify SNPs associated with circulating AMH levels. Study-specific analyses were adjusted for age at blood collection and population stratification, and summary statistics were meta-analysed using a standard error-weighted approach.</p><p id="Par6621"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified four loci for circulating AMH. We confirmed the previously reported association with the <italic>MCM8</italic> locus and identified three novel signals in or near <italic>AMH, TEX41</italic>, and <italic>CDCA7</italic>. The strongest signal was a nonsynonymous missense variant located in exon 5 of the <italic>AMH</italic> gene (rs10417628, β(SE)=-0.34 (0.05), <italic>p</italic> = 1.2 x 10<sup>−11</sup>).

A founder effect has been well described in this Quebec region. A pilot program started in 2010 for carrier screening of ARSACS, tyrosinemia type I, Leigh syndrome French-Canadian type, and hereditary sensory-motor neuropathy with/without agenesis of the corpus callosum. In 2018, this program became province-wide through a web-based strategy that reached previously underserved regions. Simultaneously, new founder conditions have been identified.</p><p id="Par6627"><bold>Methods:</bold> We review the particularities and the results of the web-based test; we present a new group of founder conditions, as well as the strategies under development for their accurate diagnosis.</p><p id="Par6628"><bold>Results:</bold> During the first two years, more than 3000 individuals from 17 regions of Quebec province opted for taking the web-based carrier test, the majority of them were females, and preconceptional predominated over prenatal requests. A project for neonatal screening of vitamin D-dependent rickets is about to begin on a research basis as an initial step. Other initiatives are being discussed for the screening or early diagnosis of mucolipidoses type II, Zellweger disease, junctional epidermolysis bullosa, MPI-CDG, Naxos disease, APECED, autosomal recessive deafness type 57, and familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy type 1.</p><p id="Par6629"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The web-based carrier testing allows equitable access to all individuals coming from Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean and living in any region of Quebec province.

Arsenic-3-methyltransferase, encoded by AS3MT gene, is a key enzyme in the metabolism of inorganic arsenic, methylating it and eliminating in the urine. Dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) has been associated with more efficiently arsenic metabolism a reduced sensitivity to this metalloid; monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) with elevated toxicity. Varying MMA and DMA proportions present inter-population and inter-ethnic variations. Native Americans groups, whose ancestors arrived at the Americas &gt;12,000 ybp seem to metabolize arsenic more efficiently than European-derived populations who have exhibited high toxicity risk. Thus, arsenic tolerance could be related to long-term exposition. The contemporary Native Americans, descendants of the ancient Mesoamerican cultures, along with a prominent admixed population between European and Indigenous (Mestizos), constitute a suitable scenario to delineate the genetic variation of AS3MT polymorphisms, which have been hardly studied.</p><p id="Par6634"><bold>Methods and Results:</bold> Using 28 Ancestry Informative Markers and genotyping four AS3MT polymorphism (rs11191439, rs3740400, rs7085104 and rs10748835) we found that individuals with predominant Native American ancestry exhibited higher frequencies of the “efficient” haplotype TGGA (0.47) than Mestizos (0.31).

Currently, the number and distribution of recessive alleles in the population is not known at genomic-scale. Existing estimates are extrapolations from specific phenotypes and gene-sets.</p><p id="Par6655"><bold>Methods:</bold> We used 4120 exome-sequences of genetically unrelated Dutch samples and an independent replication cohort of 2330 exome-sequences of genetically unrelated Estonian samples, representing two distinct European populations. We analyzed 1758 genes classified as AR-only by OMIM and extracted all exonic and flanking intronic variants. We created a list of pathogenic/likely-pathogenic variants (P/LPs), based on automated analysis and databases of classified variants. We simulated all possible matings within the Dutch and Estonian cohorts (8.5M/2.7M theoretical couples, respectively).</p><p id="Par6656"><bold>Results:</bold> We estimate that there are 2.0 recessive heterozygous P/LPs per individual in the Dutch population giving rise to 1.3% ARCs. We replicate these results in the Estonian cohort where we find 1.6 recessive heterozygous P/LPs per individual, resulting in 1.5% ARCs. The robustness of our approach was confirmed by the fact that &gt;97% of variants had a carrier frequency of at most 0.5% (in both populations), and the remaining ~3% were well-known population-specific founder mutations.</p><p id="Par6657"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In two distinct European populations, we find similar estimates for carrier frequency per person and for the proportion of ARCs for a recessive disease. This is the first overall estimate of AR carriership in European populations and will inform schemes for introducing preconception carrier screening for AR diseases.</p><p id="Par6658"><bold>H.

NMR metabolomics is available for N&gt;40,000. The omics data can be combined with a wide range of questionnaire, clinical examination and laboratory variables, and study participants can be followed up (for up to 27 years) from national registers for disease endpoints and drug purchases. THL Biobank’s most diverse dataset, DILGOM (a subset of FINRISK 2007), includes data from all of the above listed data types.

Literature suggests that alterations in the gut microbiota composition and function precede the onset of CeD. Considering that microbiota characteristics are determined by host genetics, we speculate that the genetic makeup of CeD patients could elicit disease manifestation through alterations in the intestinal microbiota.</p><p id="Par6691"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> To evaluate the causal relationship of gut microbiota with the risk of developing CeD, we performed a Two-Sample Mendelian Randomization (2SMR) analysis. Exposure data was obtained from three raw datasets of a previous Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) of gut microbiota composition and function, and outcome data from summary statistics of the most relevant GWAS on CeD.</p><p id="Par6692"><bold>Results:</bold> We have identified a number of putative causal associations between gut microbiota composition and function with SNPs associated with CeD. Regarding bacterial composition, most of the associated SNPs are related to <italic>Firmicutes</italic> phylum, whose relative abundance has been reported to be altered in CeD patients. In terms of functional units, we have linked SNPs located in intronic regions of known CeD-associated genes, such as <italic>LPP</italic> or <italic>PUS10</italic>, to a variety of bacterial metabolic pathways.</p><p id="Par6693"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study represents the first 2SMR approach to elucidate the causal relationships between microbiome and CeD from GWASs.

Parental prenatal ethnic based common mutation carrier screen was positive for paternal heterozygosity for the known pathogenic <italic>CFTR</italic> variant W1282X. Maternal screen was negative. Sequencing based expanded carrier screen showed similar results. Next-generation sequencing of a multi-gene monogenic neonatal cholestasis panel revealed compound heterozygosity for W1282X and W1282R. The latter classified as a variant of unknown significance. Retrospectively, his 19-months old brother was diagnosed with failure to thrive, abdominal distention and steatorrhea (fecal fat 12.6 gram/24 hours). Two separate sweat chloride levels were 101 and 103 mmol/L Eq. NaCL, respectively. Stool elastase was undetectable.

A majority of these centres have adopted the CEMARA web-portal, set up by the national data repository for all RD, which allows the collation of data for patients seen within these centres. Since 2007, a minimal data set (MDS) was collected prospectively for all these patients.</p><p id="Par6721"><bold>Methods:</bold> After a 10-year period, we analyzed anonymously and retrospectively administrative, demographic, care organization and diagnoses data.</p><p id="Par6722"><bold>Results:</bold> 228,243 individuals were enrolled from 2007 to 2017 through the AnDDI Rares network, including 167,361 affected individuals (median age 11 years, 54% children, 46% adults) with a balanced sex-ratio. Among the 2,872 RD, 1,907 (66,5%) were recorded in less than 10 patients. 45.6% of patients had no diagnosis. Given the centres’ geographical coverage, patients have an average distance to travel of 25.1 km, suggesting an efficiency of the health organization for RD. Focus can be done by disease groups such as chromosomal abnormalities (enabling an extensive overview) or by diseases; leading to operable large cohorts of patients with diverse data within the MDS (demographic, clinical, medical care) and more if filled out.</p><p id="Par6723"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The main objective of CEMARA is, in the field of RD, to provide support for epidemiological, clinical or therapeutic studies, for which a collective and cooperative effort between centres is necessary, and to provide qualitative/quantitative indications for the establishment of national health policies.</p><p id="Par6724"><bold>C.

However, the evolutionary machineries of PE are still largely unknown. Here, we used a method that combines phylostratigraphy information with gene co-expression networks to extensively study the evolutionary compositions of PE. The present co-expression network construction yielded 3987 nodes based on 129 PE and normal pregnancy expression samples obtained from the GEO database. A total of 31 modules were identified as PE related clusters and 34 modules were identified in control group. Using WGCNA, we found 6 clusters containing 86 genes associated only with PE. We identified 9 hub genes (RAD21, YY1, CXCL9, CXCL10, IFI44, IFI44L, GYPA, GYPB and IFIH1) in these clusters using cytoHubba (MCC, rank ˂ 5) and STRING. As part of evolutionary analysis, we calculated the phylostratigraphic age index (PAI) and the divergence index (DI) using Orthoscape. We note that 70,9% genes in network have PAI ≤ 3, but interesting that most of hub genes (GYPA, GYPB, IFI44, IFI44L, CXCL9, CXCL10) have PAI˃5 (Vertebrata); more susceptible to evolutionary processes were genes GYPA, GYPB, IFI44, IFI44L (DI 3,918-0,834), only YY1 and RAD21 have PAI ≤1(Eukaryota) and low DI (0,054-0,186).These results demonstrate that most hub genes for this network diverged from their ancestors. The integrated analysis of the topology of PE modules and the phylogenetic data revealed an evolutionary pattern of PE in human and identified new potential biomarkers PE.</p><p id="Par6728"><bold>A.A.

Despite great successes of the last decade’s genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the results have to a limited extent been translated to genomic medicine. We propose, that one route to get closer to improved medical treatment is by understanding the genetics of medication-use. We hypothesise that, irrespectively of medical condition, medication-use per se has a unique genetic heritable architecture.</p><p id="Par6732"><bold>Methods:</bold> Medication-use from 335.744 individuals from the UK Biobank was obtained, and we conducted a GWAS on 9 million imputed genetic variants. We estimated the heritability of medication-use and partitioned the genetic variance across different categories. Using five-fold cross validation we performed within sample prediction of medication-use.</p><p id="Par6733"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 57 independent loci associated with variation in medication-use and estimated that 14% of the total variation was attributable to common genetic variants. The largest fraction of genetic variance was captured by variants with low to medium minor allele frequency. In particular coding and conserved regions, as well as transcription start sites, displayed significantly enrichment of heritability. The mean prediction accuracy was 0.14.</p><p id="Par6734"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results demonstrate that medication-use per se is a complex trait irrespectively of medical condition. Thus, if the goal is to improve medical treatment it might be insufficient to solely rely on analyses of complex diseases as medication-use per se has its own genetic architecture.</p><p id="Par6735"><bold>Funding:</bold> PDR has received funding from the Lundbeck Foundation (﻿R287-2018-735).</p><p id="Par6736"><bold>P.D.

The number of DNMs in the human germline is correlated with parental age at conception, but parental age explains only part of the observed variation in the number of DNMs between individuals. Here, we investigated whether there is a family-specific contribution to the number of DNMs in offspring. We analyzed DNMs from four large whole genome sequencing cohorts of diverse ancestry. First, we compared the difference in the number of DNMs in 111 dizygotic twin pairs to those from 578 pairs of parental age-matched unrelated children, but we did not observe a significant family-specific contribution. Subsequently we compared differences in DNMs from siblings to those of randomly matched individuals with correction for parental age, and again observed no significant differences. Finally, we used a random effects model to directly estimate the potential impact of family-specific effects on variation in DNM number using a cohort of 1590 families with two offspring and a second cohort of 45 families with an average of 9.3 offspring. We estimated a familial variance component of only 5.2%. Additionally, we found almost no difference between the observed number of DNMs in these offspring and those expected based on a stochastic Poisson model. We therefore conclude that family-specific contribution to DNM number in offspring is small and that stochasticity explains a large proportion of the observed variation.</p><p id="Par6755"><bold>J.E.

Most of the variation in the population is explained by parental age, but little is known about rare outliers with extreme mutation rates. We have tackled this problem using both phenotype and genotype driven approaches.</p><p id="Par6759">For our phenotype driven approach, we identified germline hypermutators and sought genetic causes for this trait. We identified five children with an excessive number of de novo mutations (DNMs) across ~20,000 individuals from the Deciphering Developmental Disorders study and Genomics England Limited dataset. They all have &gt;3.5 times DNMs as expected ranging from 257-426 DNMs per individual. In four children, the excess DNMs all phased paternally implicating the father as a germline hypermutator. We identified a potentially causal variant in two of the fathers: a rare homozygous missense mutation in the gene MPG and a rare homozygous nonsense mutation in XPC. For the remaining child, the mutations appear to have occurred post-zygotically indicating this is unlikely attributable to a parental hypermutator. The genotype-driven approach focussed on whether variants in DNA repair genes impact germline mutation rates. First, we interrogated variants in an established cancer mutator gene, MBD4, and found they did not have the same effect in the germline. Second, we performed analyses of the impact of rare damaging variants in DNA repair genes on individual germline mutation rate.</p><p id="Par6760">Our analyses provide new insights into the role of genetic variation on the human germline mutation rate and uncover possible genetic causes of germline hypermutation.</p><p id="Par6761"><bold>J.

With rapid advancement in high-throughput sequencing technology, progress in sequencing rare and low-frequency variants is constantly being made. For rare variants, region-based analyses have been suggested to be more powerful as compared to standard variant association testing. In this study, we used the sequence kernel association test (SKAT) to test for association with eosinophil counts, performed in the initial release of the UK Biobank whole-exome sequencing dataset (<italic>N</italic> = 49,960). We tested for five different scenarios, with various single nucleotide variant (SNV)-weighting functions. The primary SKAT analyses resulted in 51 significant transcripts throughout the five scenarios, all colocalizing with at least one GWAS signal. When adjusting for all significant, primary and conditional, top GWAS hits, five transcripts mapping to three regions (<italic>CLC, IL-33</italic> and <italic>ST20-MTHFS</italic>) remained significant in the SKAT tests. The association with <italic>CLC</italic> seems to be driven by two common variants, not previously associated with eosinophil counts. In contrast, variants with a minor allele frequency below 0.5% seem to drive the association with <italic>IL-33</italic>. For most of the SKAT signals, a single-marker GWAS seems to capture the majority of variation in eosinophil count. However, it is plausible that a larger sample size is needed to fully resolve the effect of rare variants.

Although these selectively constrained genes are strongly enriched for dominant single gene disorders, for most of these genes the nature of the selective constraint is unknown. We called large deletions from SNP genotyping data on 500K UK Biobank participants and analysed protein truncating variants from exome data on 50K UK Biobank participants. We determined the cumulative burden of likely loss-of-function variants in each UK Biobank participant, weighted according to the degree of selective constraint of the impacted gene(s), which we term their S<sub>het</sub> burden. We found that increasing S<sub>het</sub> burden results in substantially reduced male reproductive success, driven by an increased risk of childlessness (<italic>p</italic> = 4x10<sup>−15</sup>). This reduction in reproductive success is much weaker in females (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0026). S<sub>het</sub> burden is also associated with reduced fluid intelligence, educational attainment and household income, but without strong sex-bias. We present evidence that this reduced male reproductive success is most likely mediated by cognitive and behavioural traits, which, due to female preferences for mating partners likely to invest resources in their offspring, renders male carriers of such variants less able to find mating partners. Our findings support a substantial role for sexual selection due to mate choice preferences shaping the recent evolution of human genes.</p><p id="Par6783"><bold>E.J.

It is strongly linked to quality-of-life measurements such as subjective well-being, paid employment, overall health, mortality and obesity. Socioeconomic factors have been suggested to influence the effect of education- and intelligence-associated genetic variants. However, results from previous studies on the interaction between socioeconomic status and education or intelligence have been inconsistent. We therefore assessed the effect of socioeconomic deprivation on education- and intelligence-associated genetic variants by estimating the SNP heritability for fluid intelligence, educational attainment and years of education, in subsets of the UK Biobank with different degrees of social deprivation using LD score regression (LDSC). We also generated polygenic scores with LDpred and tested for interactions with social deprivation. The SNP heritability for all phenotypes were found to increase with socioeconomic deprivation. Polygenic scores for all phenotypes were also found to interact with socioeconomic deprivation, where the effects of polygenic scores increase with increasing deprivation. These results imply that genetics have a larger influence on educational and cognitive outcomes in more socioeconomically deprived UK citizens, which has serious implications for equality of opportunity.</p><p id="Par6787">This project is funded by grants from the Swedish Society for Medical Research (SSMF), and the Swedish Medical Research Council (Project Number 2015-03327).</p><p id="Par6788"><bold>M.

The study of genetic variation of rural populations such as the Pyrenean one, can be of great interest. In addition, the existence of natural barriers and the well characterized demographic history, make the genetic study of this population as an important piece of the puzzle on genetic variation in Europe.</p><p id="Par6792"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We selected for this study a sample of 435 subjects with their eight grandparents born in the Catalan Pyrenean counties. DNA was extracted from blood. Genotyping data was obtained from each subject by using the Axiom PMDA genotyping array at the CEGEN facilities. Genotypes were merged with 1000 Genome Phase III data resulting in a final data set of 2939 individuals and 552.000 common SNPs.</p><p id="Par6793"><bold>Results:</bold> A PCA analysis shows the distinctive European genetic constitution of the Pyrenean population, as compared to other continents.

A genetic liability, measured through Polygenic Risk Score (PRS), for infections and mental health disorders could also drive this association. Here, we studied the genetic liability on the association between several different types of infections that led to hospital visits, with the risk of being diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To study this association, we used the Danish-based iPSYCH case-control study population, as well as a cohort of randomly sampled individuals from the Danish population. We observe that having certain types of infection, but not all types, can increase the lifetime risk of autism for those with a genetic liability.

A number of inflammatory protein biomarkers have been identified to be associated with development of inflammatory diseases or disease outcomes. These proteins might therefore serve as potential drug targets, or shed light into the pathogenesis of the diseases. However, if the biomarker itself increase the risk (is causal) of getting the disease is usually not known. Here we applied a two sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach, using data from two cohorts (NSPHS and UK Biobank), to investigate the causal effect of 20 inflammatory protein biomarkers, known or suggested, on 18 inflammatory diseases. We identified five statistically significant biomarkers (IL-12B, IL-15RA, TNFB, TWEAK, VEGF-A), having a tentative causal effect on eight different inflammatory diseases (FDR ≤ 0.05). IL-12B showed a causal effect on psoriatic arthritis, IL-15RA on eczema, TNFB on Type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory polyarthropathies. We also identified a causal effect of TWEAK on asthma and a causal effect of VEGF-A on both inflammatory bowel disease and its sub phenotype ulcerative colitis.

While clinical implementation of PRS is underway, it remains unclear how such scores propagate in pedigrees. Here, we determine the inheritance patterns of PRS to aid clinical counselling of genetic liability for complex traits.</p><p id="Par6850"><bold>Methods:</bold> We simulated polygenic risk for six complex diseases in 10,000 multigenerational families, modelling both random and consanguineous mating. We determined inheritance patterns for up to ten generations. Furthermore, we examined biparental inheritance patterns.</p><p id="Par6851"><bold>Results:</bold> Correlations of polygenic risk ranged from 47.1% to 49.0% for between first-degree relatives and from 23.1% to 24.3% for second-degree relatives (<bold>Table 1</bold>). When both parents’ PRS is known, the ranges become narrower for their offspring, especially for the extremes (<bold>Table 2</bold>). In high-risk (&gt;95%) individuals, median polygenic risk for first- and second-degree offspring was respectively 85.2% and 69.7%, and approximated population average in the fifth generation. Results were similar across traits, and for random and consanguineous mating.</p><p id="Par6852"><bold>Discussion:</bold> Extreme polygenic risk propagates for multiple generations and is particularly informative in biparental inheritance. Future steps include validation in real multigenerational datasets and extension to larger number of genetic variants.</p><p id="Par6853"><bold>Table 1.

It is estimated that the heritability of longevity in humans could be up to 25%. To identify potential factors that contribute to this phenotype we performed whole-genome sequencing on DNA samples from 16 centenarians from the Bulgarian population. Their genotypes were extracted at more than 20 genetic loci associated with high parental lifespan - an appropriate measure for heritable longevity, from two large GWAS meta-analyses (AncestryDNA and LifeGen) utilising the UK Biobank and their own cohorts. We established that 5 genetic variants were significantly enriched within our centenarian cohort compared to individuals of non-Finnish European ancestry in the gnomAD population database. Only one of them was exonic - the well-recognised rs429358-T in the <italic>APOE</italic> gene, while the other ones: rs10455872-A in <italic>LPA</italic>, rs6224-G in <italic>FURIN</italic>, rs599839-G between <italic>CELSR2</italic> and <italic>PSRC1</italic> and rs9872864-G in <italic>IP6K1</italic>, were non-coding suggesting that mechanisms regulating gene expression might play a role in longevity. Interestingly, all these genes are involved in different cardiometabolic conditions. Combinations of these variants, as well as with other factors, could therefore be protective against cardiovascular risk factors - a common cause of death in many older people, or could potentially slow down the process of biological ageing. A larger cohort of precious samples from centenarians could validate these findings and provide one more piece of the complex puzzle of human longevity.</p><p id="Par6861">Grant reference: DN03/7(18.12.2016), NSF, Bulgaria</p><p id="Par6862"><bold>L.T.

As such variants in disease-related genes are under strong negative natural selection, their frequency across major ancestral groups is expected to be highly similar. In this study, we tested this assumption by systematically assessing the presence of highly prevalent population-specific PTVs in human genes using gnomAD data. We discovered unusually high incidence of population-specific pLoF variants in all major ancestral groups, with a total of 1,972 genes harboring such population-specific sites. Such prevalence of PTVs does not conform to a deterministic statistical model developed by Cassa et al. in 2017, indicating either systematic differences in disease penetrance in different human populations or the failure of current annotation criteria to accurately predict the loss-of-function potential of PTVs. We demonstrate that high-frequency population-specific PTVs tend to reside in exons that have low conservation scores and belong to transcripts with low expression levels, suggesting that these variants should not be treated as genuine LoF alleles. As such, additional data resources should be used during interpretation of genotypes in both population genetics and clinical genetics studies.</p><p id="Par6866"><bold>Y.A.

The presented haplogroups in our samples H, K, J and T arose in frequency in different European populations during the Neolithic.

The results support the hypothesis of Thracians origin from the local people with a low percentage of gene flow from the Steppe.</p><p id="Par6893"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The Thracian maternal gene pool is mostly represented by Western Eurasian haplogroups. After comparing between the complete mitochondrial sequences of Thracians and Eurasian (ancient and contemporary) populations we observed that Thracians genetic profiles reflect their nexus geographical position between east and west.

The model was built using data including lifestyle, environmental factors, genetic variation, and blood and nasal DNA methylation (450 K), collected from 348 subjects at 16 years old from a birth cohort, with 67 children having allergic disease. Elastic net regulation was used to train the model. The model performance was validated by 10-fold cross validation and was replicated in an independent cohort with 481 children.</p><p id="Par6938"><bold>Results:</bold> We observed that most predict power can be attributed to nasal DNA methylation.

The final model was based on nasal DNA methylation levels at only 5 CpGs with the prediction performance of AUC 0.86 in the discovery cohort and AUC 0.83 in the replication cohort. Matched nasal gene expression data was used to annotate these CpGs. Genes that were significantly correlated to the 5 CpGs were enriched in immune pathways including Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-13 signaling, neutrophil degranulation and leukocyte transendothelial migration.</p><p id="Par6939"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We present a prediction model for allergic disease based on only 5 CpGs from nasal epithelial cells.

Short reads have low sensitivity for structural variants (SVs, differences ≥50 bp), miss variants in segmental duplications that comprise 5-10% of human genome, and do not phase haplotypes. Further, large sequences absent in the reference genome are ignored. Highly accurate long-read (HiFi) sequencing overcomes these limitations.</p><p id="Par6957"><bold>Results:</bold> Long-read sequencing has been used successfully to create ethnicity-specific reference genomes of Asian, African, and European populations. Each genome adds up to 10 Mb of unique sequence beyond GRCh38 and provides a superior target against which to map short reads. We demonstrate that de novo assembly with HiFi reads reliably produces genomes that approach GRCh38 in contiguity and accuracy (contig N50 &gt;30 Mb, accuracy &gt;Q55).</p><p id="Par6958">HiFi reads also provide high precision and recall for variant detection at 15-fold coverage. For the Genome in a Bottle benchmark samples, DeepVariant and pbsv achieve an F1 score of 99.7% for SNVs, 96.6% for indels, and 96.4% for SVs. WhatsHap produces a phase block N50 &gt;100 kb. HiFi reads resolve 152 of 193 medically relevant genes noted to be difficult for short reads.</p><p id="Par6959"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We propose to improve catalogs of human variation using HiFi reads through: 1) de novo assembly of a representative male and female from each subpopulation to discover novel sequences; and 2) whole-genome sequencing of thousands of individuals to discover small variants in difficult regions and SVs genome-wide.</p><p id="Par6960"><bold>R.

An important aspect that has not sufficiently been investigated theoretically, is the influence of inbreeding on mutation load and incidence rates when the population sizes change. We therefore developed an individual-based population model to study these dynamics for a wide range of growth and mating conditions. In the phase of population expansion and shortly afterwards, our simulations show that there is a drop of diseased individuals at the expense of an increasing mutation load for random mating. On the other hand both parameters remain almost constant in highly consanguineous partnerships. This explains the empirical observation in present times that a high degree of consanguinity is associated with an increased risk of autosomal recessive disorders. However, the simulations also state that the higher frequency of severe recessive disorders such as intellectual disability in inbred populations is a transient phenomenon before a mutation-selection balance is reached again. Mathematic simulations can help to gain new insights in processes, where several factors interact in a complex manner.</p><p id="Par6964"><bold>L.A. La Rocca:</bold> None. <bold>J.

A study by Delaneau et al. (Science 364, eaat8266, 2019) used population-based chromatin data to identify cis-regulatory domains (CRDs), which show cell type-specific coordinated chromatin activity, follow the local chromatin organization into topologically associated domains, and were observed to control coexpression of nearby genes. Since CRDs are also under strong genetic control, they offer a great insight into the regulatory organization of the human genome. However, chromatin data are not available for most human genetics’ studies, rendering the identification of CRDs expensive on a large scale. Therefore, we extend our previous work to characterize regulatory organization of the genome using only gene expression data from RNA-seq studies and genotypes. Specifically, we identify coexpression domains (CODs) as groups of significantly correlated proximal genes with inter-individual coordinated expression patterns, and assess their temporal dynamics exploiting a longitudinal dataset from the MultiMuTHER study, including 336 individuals with whole-blood RNA-seq data collected at three time-points over seven years, and imputed genotypes from the TwinsUK cohort. We identify genetic variants associated to the coordinated expression regulation of the CODs, as well as to their age-associated changes. Using the unique properties of twin studies, we perform a variance decomposition analysis to estimate COD-heritability. Finally, we perform association studies to clinically relevant phenotypes in an attempt to identify CODs involved in the regulation of cardiometabolic traits such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.</p><p id="Par6968"><bold>A.

However, allele frequencies might significantly differ in poorly studied populations that are underrepresented in large-scale projects, such as the Russian population. In this work, we leveraged our access to a large dataset of 1,021 exome samples to analyze genetic variation in the Northwest Russia. We compared the spectrum of genetic variants to the dbSNP build 151, and made estimates of ClinVar-based autosomal recessive (AR) disease allele prevalence as compared to gnomAD r. 2.1. In total, around 10% of discovered variants were not present in dbSNP. We report statistically significant overrepresentation of pathogenic variants for several Mendelian disorders, including phenylketonuria (<italic>PAH</italic>, rs5030858), Wilson’s disease (<italic>ATP7B</italic>, rs76151636), factor VII deficiency (<italic>F7</italic>, rs36209567), kyphoscoliosis type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (<italic>FKBP14</italic>, rs542489955), and several other recessive pathologies. We also make primary estimates of monogenic disease incidence in the population, with retinal dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, and phenylketonuria being the most frequent AR pathologies.

The main population is Russian old settlers - ruskoustintsy. The ruskoustintsy have preserved old Russian traditions and dialect typical for Russians of the 16th century, despite living ~400 years neighboring with indigenous Siberian populations (Paleo-Asiatic, Uralic, Tungusic and Turkic people) which have expanded in this territory in various historical period. In our days it’s amazing to see a Slavic population among the indigenous people of this land. The aim of this study is to analyze the autosomal diversity and to reconstruct genetic history of Russian old settlers living in the Arctic region. DNA samples of 30 unrelated residents of “Russkoe Ust’e” were collected and genotyped using the Illumina OmniExpress 730K. The samples were analyzed using ADMIXTURE approach (Alexander et al., 2009). Final dataset included 192776 SNP’s presented in 5458 individuals from 365 different worldwide populations. The ADMIXTURE (K=8) analysis showed that all 30 individuals in average have two major components - European (42.4%) and Siberian (41.3%) and minor different components (Middle-Eastern, East Asian, American-15% and 1.3% others). The results do not refute the hypothesis that the first settlers of “Russkoe Ust’e” were the Russian Pomors, that fled from the persecution of the Ivan-IV the Terrible from the old territories of the Velikiy Novgorod (~1570 year). This study was supported by Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Russia (basic_part_to_NEFU) and RFBR_grants (#18-05-600035_Arctica, #19-34-60023_Perspektiva).</p><p id="Par6977"><bold>A.V.

This is especially so for highly polygenic neurological disorders whose mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we present the first sequence-based protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) analysis of 92 neurological proteins. We perform a meta-analysis using deep whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from two isolated Greek cohorts, MANOLIS (22.5x WGS; <italic>N</italic> = 1,356) and Pomak (18.4x WGS; <italic>N</italic> = 1,537). A total of 123 independently-associated variants in 84 loci reach study-wide significance (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 1.14x10<sup>−10</sup>) for 63 proteins, all of which are at least nominally significant (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 3.78x10<sup>−4</sup>) and have the same direction of effect in both cohorts. To further elucidate the genetic architecture, independent variants were classified into 89 (72%) <italic>cis-</italic> and 34 (28%) <italic>trans-</italic>acting pQTLs. Ten variants have consequences equal to or more severe than missense, and 33 overlap regulatory regions. We also discover variants that have previously been linked to psychiatric disorders. For example, an intronic <italic>trans-</italic>pQTL in the <italic>ITIH4</italic> gene is associated with increased NEP levels (<italic>rs2239547; P</italic> = 1.19 x 10<sup>−129</sup>; BETA = 0.637983; SE = 0.026328), and is an established risk variant for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This analysis represents the largest and only WGS-based pQTL study of neurological proteins to date, delivering insight into the rare and common genetic variant landscape underlying the human neurological proteome and its connection to neurological diseases.</p><p id="Par6981"><bold>G.

Heritability of RSV-ALRI is 20% indicating that extensive genotype-by-environment interactions determine phenotypic variation. In this context, RSV-ALRI GWA studies are underpowered, because adequately sized infant cohorts have been unattainable. Integrating GTEx eQTLs from adult lungs is not informative due to the age-dependent pulmonary/immune RSV induced responses.</p><p id="Par6991"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> We developed an experimental system combining the BXD family of recombinant inbred strains with the neonatal mouse model of infant RSV-immunopathology. We infected 28 BXD strains and measured levels of viral NS1 gene transcription in lungs to obtain quantitative measure of the host-virus interaction. Heritability of NS1 transcription was 67%. We mapped QTLs with Haley-Knott regression (5000 permutations and 2000 bootstraps). The analysis yielded 2 QTL intervals in chromosomes 14 (LRS=18.8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.05) and 13 (LRS=11.34, <italic>p</italic> = 0.63).

Recent studies from the Human Functional Genomics Project have successfully characterized the impact of genetic and environmental factors on immune response in health. However, how this variability relates to the risk of developing an autoimmune disease, such as type 1 diabetes (T1D), is largely unknown.</p><p id="Par7032"><bold>Methods:</bold> Blood samples were collected from 243 T1D and 534 healthy volunteers of Western European descent. &gt;200 immune cell populations and &gt;100 cytokine-stimulus pairs were measured in both cohorts. We used a systems approach to comprehensively assess the impact of environmental and genetic factors on immune phenotypes. The results were compared between T1D patients and healthy controls.</p><p id="Par7033"><bold>Results:</bold> Age and seasons show impact on both immune cell abundance and cytokine production upon stimulation, e.g. resting T regs show higher levels in summer. The T1D associated genetic factors show stronger impact on T cell than B cell subpopulations in peripheral blood (<italic>P</italic> = 4.17 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, K.S. test), highlighting the importance of T cell immunity in T1D. Rs35092096 of the CCR region associated with CCR5+ CD4+ regulatory T cells (<italic>P</italic> = 1.64 × 10<sup>−12</sup>) showed co-localization (H3 = 0.95) with T1D, suggesting a shared regulation of this locus. Genome-wide quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping revealed 16 significant loci in T1D. 75% of the identified QTLs are specific in T1D, implying a distinct regulatory mechanism of immune parameters and functions between auto-immune disease and health.</p><p id="Par7034"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our approach provides novel insights into immune trait variability in T1D.</p><p id="Par7035"><bold>X.

Selection of genetic instruments for D5D (20:4n-6/20:3n-6 ratio) and D6D activity (18:3n-6/18:2n-6 ratio) relied on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene-wide screens (restricted to the <italic>FADS</italic>-gene region that encodes for both desaturases) in a representative sub-cohort (<italic>n</italic> = 1853) of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam Study.

Although nearly all WGS-generated NIPT data analysis is limited to detect common trisomies, the possible re-use of NIPT data increasingly becomes popular and expanding. Here, we systematically analyzed NIPT data at the population-scale to characterize the virome in maternal plasma.</p><p id="Par7053"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> A total of 13,802 NIPT data were generated from Turkish pregnant women during the period of 2018-2019 at Genoks Diagnostic Center. Sequencing was performed on BGI SEQ-500, producing 35-bp single-end reads. Following quality filtering, clean reads that did not map to human reference genome were blasted against the NCBI viral reference sequence database (release 97). Only matching reads with e-value &lt; 1e-10, a percent identity ≥ 97 and alignment length ≥ 32 bp were kept for further analysis.

Age is one of the strongest predictors of chronic disease and mortality, but biological responses to aging differ among people and can have an important role in the consideration of the relationship with disease-related covariates. Aging eludes precise definition at the systemic level and denotes a multitude of processes at the cellular level.</p><p id="Par7067"><bold>Material and Methods:</bold> We investigated a cohort of 300 subjects exposed between 2000 and 2010. Using methylation-based "clock" (Horvath), namely extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA), we defined biological age acceleration for each of three hundred asbestos-exposed subjects. EEAA is defined as the weighted average of DNAm age and imputed proportions of naïve CD8+ T cells, memory CD8+ T cells and plasmablasts. Asbestos exposure-related variation in age acceleration measures and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using multiple regression models.</p><p id="Par7068"><bold>Results:</bold> EEAA showed that biological age acceleration was statistically significantly associated with increased asbestos exposure (Horvath’s clock: Estimate = 0.704, 95% CI: 0.067, 1.475, <italic>P</italic> = 0.043).</p><p id="Par7069"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> DNAm profiles have been used as indices of biological age and the roles of epigenetic age acceleration measures were investigated.

In normal cellular physiology, CHD8 co-purifies with MLL1 and MOF transcriptional activation complex, with elongating RNAPII and directly binds to DNA promoters and enhancers regions, thus a regulatory role in transcriptional initiation and elongation could be postulated. Here we investigated how chromatin landscape reacts to <italic>CHD8</italic> suppression by analyzing a panel of histone modifications in induced pluripotent stem cells-derived neural progenitors. We interrogated transcriptionally active and repressed regions as well as active and poised enhancers. <italic>CHD8</italic> suppression leads to a significant reduction (47.82%) in histone H3K36me3 at gene bodies, particularly impacting on transcriptional elongation chromatin states. Highly expressed, CHD8-bound genes present a stronger and more significant H3K36me3 reduction compared to CHD8 unbound genomic regions. Genes presenting histone H3K36me3 reduction are implicated in “macromolecule catabolic”, “cell cycle” and “mRNA processing” biological processes and enriched for “essential and constrained genes”, ‘FMRP targets in brain’, ‘post synaptic genes’, whose expression peaks early during nervous system. Significantly, <italic>CHD8</italic>-suppression associated histone H3K36me3 reduction does not functionally impact on global transcriptional levels, but significantly correlates with altered alternative splicing pattern of ~ 2000 protein coding genes implicated in “RNA splicing”, “mitotic cell cycle phase transition” and “mRNA processing”, especially affecting alternative first exon and exon skipping events. In summary, our results point toward broader molecular consequences of <italic>CHD8</italic> suppression, implicating altered histone deposition/maintenance and RNA processing regulation as important regulatory processes in ASD.</p><p id="Par7074"><bold>E.

However, the causal variant, gene, cell type, and mechanism underlying these associations remain unclear. Most GWAS variants are in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with many other non-coding variants, complicating fine-mapping and mechanistic characterization. Cell-type specific gene regulation plays a causal role at many complex trait-associated loci. Changes in chromatin accessibility are key mechanisms leading to gene expression differences. To understand the mechanisms that lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality worldwide, we quantified chromatin accessibility in more than 200 human liver tissue samples. We identify more than 500,000 open chromatin regions, many of which exhibit tissue-specific activity, and identify transcription factor binding sites at nucleotide resolution. Integration with epigenomic profiles identified specific cis-regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. We identifiy thousands of cis-regulatory elements whose chromatin accessibility is associated with local genetic variants, called chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTLs). At dozens of CVD GWAS loci, chromatin interactions and colocalization of molecular QTL and GWAS signals generate specific hypotheses about causal variants, affected genes, and cell types. With a combination of experimental approaches in multiple model systems, we fine-map complex trait-associated loci to single-nucleotide resolution. These findings highlight the benefits of integrating multiple cellular traits for the identification and characterization of disease-causing variants and contribute to basic understanding of genetic and epigenetic regulation of gene expression.</p><p id="Par7092"><bold>C.D.

Genetic and epigenetic modifiers may play a considerable role in the phenotypic heterogeneity of CF disease. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is a key regulatory enzyme in the metabolism of folate. A common variant of the <italic>MTHFR</italic> gene, C677T, is associated with variety of disorders, including cancer, chronic inflammation and etc. In this study we investigated the DNA methylation level of the LINE-1 and Alu interspersed repetitive sequences (IRS) in CF patients with the C677T variant of the <italic>MTHFR</italic> gene.</p><p id="Par7096"><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> The study was approved by the ethics committee of Tbilisi State Medical University. All patients were genotyped for the CFTR gene. Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of CF patients using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, US). For Bisulfite treatment of DNA we used EpiTect Bisulfite Conversion Kit (Qiagen, US). The MTHFR C677T polymorphism was detected by PCR-RELP method. Methylation levels of LINE-1 and Alu were examined by the combined bisulfite restriction analysis-interspersed repetitive sequences (COBRA-IRS).</p><p id="Par7097"><bold>Results:</bold> Significant differences were observed in methylation levels of both LINE-1 and Alu sequences between CF patients with CC and TT genotypes.

Despite this genomic homogeneity there is a great phenotypic variability. This indicates the existence of genetic and/or epigenetic modifiers. Which are exactly these modifiers and, in particular, how they act is still poorly defined, but diet could be one of the candidates. Our hypothesis is that altered vitamin A (vitA) levels in the diet of pregnant mothers could modify the penetrance of one of the phenotypic traits (Aortic Arch Defects; AADs). We used a mouse model (Df1) with a hemizygous deletion equivalent to the human 22q11.2DS. Our experimental setup consisted of 3 diet groups (vitA-supplemented, -control and vitA-deficient) and 2 types of crosses between Df1 mothers with WT fathers and WT mothers with Df1 fathers. Embryos were collected at gestational day E18.5 and phenotyped. Serum retinol levels were determined in the blood of the pregnant females. AADs are more frequent in the Df1 embryos of WT mothers fed a vitA supplemented diet (47 %) than in those fed with a vitA deficient diet (29%). On the contrary, when the mother is Df1 we observe more AADs in Df1 embryos of mothers fed a vitA deficient diet (45 %) than in those fed a supplemented diet (27%). In general, independently of the diet, we find a correlation of higher frequencies of AADs with lower expression of mitochondrial genes, and lower expression of key heart development genes.

This prevents the use of highly effective, socially responsive, incentive-based reinforcement smoking cessation therapies. Recent developments in epigenetics may address this shortcoming. Previously, we have shown that a methylation sensitive digital PCR (MSdPCR) assay of DNA methylation at cg05575921 can precisely quantitate current cigarette consumption using DNA from saliva or whole blood. However, whether changes in that DNA methylation can be used to monitor the effectiveness of smoking cessation was uncertain. To determine this, we monitored serum cotinine and determined DNA methylation levels for ninety days in 63 subjects participating in a nicotine replacement-free incentive based smoking cessation program. (NIH R01 HL130883) Overall, 18 of 63 (29%) subjects had undetectable levels of cotinine at the 30 day visit and maintained undetectable levels through the 90 day exit visit. Correspondingly, cg05575921 levels showed a marked time and dose-dependent reversion of methylation with cg05575921 levels increasing over 10% with 3 months of cessation in the heaviest smokers (initial cg05575921&lt; 50%), while levels in more moderate smokers increasing only 7% after 3 months. We conclude that MSdPCR cg05575921 assessments are a sensitive, rapid method of monitoring the effectiveness of smoking cessation. Because these DNA methylation levels are not affected by nicotine replacement and are quantitative in nature, they can be used in socially responsible, incentive-based programming for the quantitative reduction of smoking induced harms.</p><p id="Par7117"><bold>R.A.

While we have shown recently that methylated DNA sites are correlated with gene expression levels in blood, the function of many other DNA methylation sites and co-methylation, however, is unclear. Previous studies have used gene co-expression networks to predict links between genes and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. Here, we compare co-methylation and co-regulation patterns, and investigate the functions of DNA methylation sites to improve gene-symptom predictions.</p><p id="Par7121">For this purpose, we have created a co-methylation network using 33,000 public 450k Illumina methylation assays from various tissues and cell types. We identified 6,067 significant correlations between DNA methylation and genes through a meta-analysis using blood, nasal and brain tissues. These correlations link methylation sites with genes, and consequently to HPO terms associated with those genes. Using this data, we will compare the co-methylation network with our previously published co-expression network consisting of 32,000 samples in terms of their power to predict HPO term membership per gene and methylation site. We expect that this comparison will assign methylation sites to human phenotypes, and provide functional interpretation for many others.</p><p id="Par7122">Our preliminary results comparing networks in 2905 blood samples show that the co-methylation and co-expression networks have comparable predictive power.

In particular, exposure to harmful substances during pregnancy affects the fetus and can lead to disease. Therefore, epigenome was studied to confirm the change caused by environmental factors. The effect of heavy metals on atopic dermatitis, which is representative of environmental diseases, was examined using DNA methylation experiments, one of the methods for identifying epigenomes. The samples used in this study were cord blood DNA from some MOCEH cohort samples. The degree of methylation according to the concentration of heavy metals was confirmed in 84 children diagnosed with atopic dermatitis. For methylation profiles, an experiment was performed using an Infinium Human Methylation EPIC kit (Illumina, CA, USA) and analyzed using GenomeStudio (version 2011.1). As a result, 37 genes in mercury and 58 in lead were found in regions with significant methylation differences when exposed to high concentrations compared to low concentrations. Pathway analysis was performed using genes selected from each heavy metal group, and it was confirmed that specific genes were involved in the cytokine signaling in Immune system. In conclusions, the effect of heavy metals on atopic dermatitis was confirmed. In other words, it was confirmed that environmental diseases may be caused by harmful environmental substances.

After filtering and curating 1,002 propolis-derived chemicals, 58.5% of the molecules were grouped into five most representative clusters according to the components’ atomic positions. After hierarchical clustering, the in silico screening analysis indicated catechin 3’-O-gallate and propolin-B as possible new DNMT and HDAC inhibitors, respectively.</p><p id="Par7139"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data indicate that propolis can modulate the expression of the RASSF1 gene via epigenetic mechanisms.

L-1 (Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements) sequences are transposable elements accounting for 17% of the human genome, considered a surrogate for global methylation. To investigate the global methylation at birth in association with neonatal birth, we recruited at the delivery 195 women with singleton, spontaneous and uncomplicated pregnancies and we investigated L-1 methylation by pyrosequencing in cord and maternal blood and in placental samples. We found a significant severe L-1 hypomethylation in placenta from SGA (Small for Gestational Age, ≤10 percentile) compared with normal and LGA babies (Large for Gestational Age). This finding suggests a compensatory epigenetic mechanism in response to a reduced growth; or a placental insufficiency responsible for SGA. This association was not present in cord blood. A strong correlation (Pearson r=0,79, pvalue&lt;0,01) of L-1 methylation between maternal (62,7% +/- 5,3) and cord (mean+/- StDev: 63,3% +/- 5,4) blood was found. This similarity seems to be lost after birth, based on the weak correlation (<italic>r</italic> = 0,26, <italic>p</italic> value &gt; 0,05) observed in the L-1 methylation levels of 31 mothers and children (&gt;4 years of age).

Recently, a narrow spectrum of functionally equivalent frameshift mutations at the C-terminal tail of HIST1H1E, a member of the linker histone family, has been causally linked to Rahman syndrome. Previous work demonstrated that these mutations disrupt proper compaction of DNA and affected multiple cellular processes, resulting in accelerated replicative senescence, and are associated with a specific methylation pattern.</p><p id="Par7148"><bold>Results:</bold> Methylome analysis from peripheral blood samples of six affected subjects led us to identify ~9,000 CpG probes located in ~600 differentially methylated regions, defining a specific and predominantly hypomethylated pattern.

A computational classifier trained on these methylation profiles yielded full sensitivity and specificity in detecting subjects carrying dominant-acting <italic>HIST1H1E</italic> frameshift mutations among healthy controls or individuals carrying pathogenic lesions in other proteins of the epigenetic machinery associated with human disease.

Here, a significant regulatory effect of the lead variants on the expression of the hair cycle regulator <italic>WNT10A</italic> has been reported. Interestingly, one of these variants is located within a binding site for the transcription factor EBF1, whose gene is located at another AGA risk locus (5q33.3). We hypothesized that changes in EBF1 mediated regulation of <italic>WNT10A</italic> expression may contribute to the deregulated hair cycle dynamics observed in AGA. To analyze a potential interaction between EBF1 and <italic>WNT10A</italic>, we performed luciferase reporter assays in HEK cells.

To further investigate this potential interaction in AGA-relevant tissue and identify the relevant cell population we performed immunofluorescence co-staining in human scalp hair follicle. The strongest co-expression of EBF1 and WNT10A was observed in hair follicle keratinocytes of the inner and outer root sheath. A major challenge in complex genetics is to bridge the gap between association and function. To our knowledge, our study is the first functional follow-up study on AGA that (i) together with previous mRNA data enabled identification of a regulatory mechanism at an AGA risk locus and (ii) proves functional interaction between two risk loci that is likely to contribute to the pathophysiological changes in hair cycle dynamics.</p><p id="Par7162"><bold>L.M.

MLID has been described in a broad ranfge of CIDS but most frequently Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS), Transient neonatal diabetes (TNDM) and Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1B (PHP1b). The specific impact of MLIDs on clinical phenotype is not well defined though some patients with MLID will have a discordant epigenotype-phenotype (e.g. clinical features of SRS and molecular findings associated with SRS).

Recently, genome scanning has allowed the discovery of novel NS-related genes, representing signal transducers or modulators not belonging to the “classical” RAS pathway. Among them, the leucine zipper-like transcriptional regulator 1 (<italic>LZTR1)</italic>, encoding a member of the BTB/POZ protein superfamily, was identified in patients carrying both dominant or recessive form of NS. Furthermore, constitutional monoallelic mutations in the same gene cause schwannomatosis, a cancer-prone disorder clinically distinct from NS. LZTR1 has been suggested to act as substrate receptor for the CUL3-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL3) complex, a multi-subunit RING-class E3 ligase implicated in protein mono- and poly-ubiquitination. Here we demonstrate that dominant NS-causing mutations do not influence protein stability and subcellular localization nor perturb binding of LZTR1 to CUL3, but specifically affect the surface of LZTR1 Kelch domain, mediating substrate recognition. On the contrary, recessive NS-causing variants behave as loss-of-function mutations, affecting LZTR1 synthesis, stability, and/or binding to CUL3. Collectively, our data suggest a model in which LZTR1 contributes to the ubiquitination of proteins functioning as positive modulators of the RAS-MAPK pathway. <italic>LZTR1</italic> mutations variably impair binding of these substrates to the multi-component ligase complex and their efficient ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in MAPK signaling upregulation.</p><p id="Par7184"><bold>M.

A comprehensive non-redundant gene-centric view of human ncRNA genes and their annotations is critical for understanding their involvement in health and disease, and for whole genome sequencing (WGS) interpretation. GeneCards, the widely used human gene database, is integrating data of ncRNA records and annotations from EBI’s RNAcentral, and its 15 primary sources, as well as from Ensembl, NCBI Entrez Gene and HGNC. Many ncRNA sources are transcript-centric, and for WGS variant analysis it is essential to transform this information into a unique and all-encompassing compendium of ncRNA genes. Utilizing the capacities of GeneCards, being gene-centric, we clustered overlapping transcript entries from all sources using an algorithm based on genomic coordinates. This strategy eliminates redundancies and allows for full coverage of genomic gene positions. Adhering to GeneCards strategy, each RNA gene, with affiliated transcripts, appears with annotations from all relevant sources. The unified compilation includes more than 200,000 ncRNA gene entries, including ~100,000 Piwi-interacting-RNAs.VarElect, GeneCards’ NGS interpretation tool [PMID 27357693], allows disease interpretation of variants mapped to ncRNAs by two routes. First, direct ncRNA-disease associations are extracted from our knowledgebase, now augmented by novel ncRNA-disease connections. Second, our strengthened capacity to associate ncRNAs with protein-coding genes now enables interpretation of poorly characterized ncRNAs. The combination of an extensive ncRNA knowledgebase with gene interpretation algorithms allows fathoming the disease-related significance of non-coding variants identified by WGS.

To promote the development of efficient therapy approaches, it is first necessary to unravel the genomic architecture of OA. We investigated DNA methylation in cartilage and synovium tissue from 97 patients, the largest epigenetic data set for knee OA to date. Genome-wide DNA methylation data from primary chondrocytes from macroscopically intact (low-grade) and degraded (high-grade) cartilage as well as synovium samples were generated from patients that underwent total knee replacement for OA. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) to identify methylation marks of cartilage degeneration. Genotype-dependent methylation changes (mQTL effects) were identified in synovium, low-grade and high-grade cartilage across the genome. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate putative causal effects between methylation state and OA, and colocalisation analysis to identify causal loci. The EWAS discovered 15,328 differentially methylated positions exceeding the genome-wide significance threshold (<italic>P &lt; 1.24e</italic><sup><italic>-7</italic></sup>) between low-grade and high-grade cartilage. We identified 2,477 differentially methylated regions linked to cartilage degeneration. The mQTL analysis revealed widespread associations between genetic variants and methylation in all three examined tissues, with partial overlap between tissue types. Two of these mQTLs colocalised with OA-associated variants, thus helping resolve GWAS signals. The application of MR identified methylation loci with a putative causal influence on OA. In this study, we identify widespread epigenomic profile changes related to cartilage degeneration. We find likely effector genes for methylation and GWAS signals, enhancing our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning disease development and progression in OA.</p><p id="Par7213"><bold>P.

Peanut oral immunotherapy (OIT) can successfully desensitise many peanut-allergic children. Although such treatment appears effective and safe for the majority of patients, life-threatening allergic reactions can still occur in a minority of children. Therefore, predictors of positive OIT response are still required. Blood samples were collected at baseline from 38 peanut-allergic children who successfully completed an OIT trial. Methylation and RNA sequencing data was obtained from isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following in vitro cultivation both in medium and peanut antigen stimulation conditions over 48 hours. We conducted DNA methylome- and transcriptome-wide profiling of both positive response to treatment and complete desensitisation, accurately phenotyped by an oral food challenge before and after the OIT trial. We developed a random forest classifier using PBMC multi-omics data. Several significant differentially methylated CpGs, differentially methylated regions and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. A few differentially methylated CpGs identified were associated with gene expression levels of significant DEGs. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed many pathways enriched by DEGs. Our random forest classifier showed accuracies of over 70% and 90% in distinguishing positive treatment responders from non-responders and completely desensitised from non-completely desensitised children, respectively. Our results identify potential biomarkers of positive peanut OIT response. If validated, such omics markers may serve to predict OIT response, to better select children that could benefit from OIT, and to identify targetable pathways underpinning successful response to OIT in peanut-allergic children.</p><p id="Par7230"><bold>A.

In a prospective study of expecting mothers, we screened women for chronic stress exposure at the 28<sup>th</sup> week using the Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Prenatal Distress questionnaires (PDQ). Expectant mothers were classified into the stressed group (SG, PSS-10 ≥ 19, <italic>N</italic> = 55); the control group (CG, PSS-10 &lt; 19, <italic>N</italic> = 55) matched 1:1 for parity, maternal age and gestational age.

A predictive classifier was developed using the recursive feature elimination method and Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis. The classifier performance was calculated using the leave-one-out cross-validation test (BRB array tools v.4.4.0).

The CpGs exclusively altered in each group (3,470 in pCR vs. NT and 54,440 in pIR vs. NT) were most frequently hypermethylated in pCR (44% vs. 18% in pIR). pCR cases presented more DM CpGs in promoter regions (49% vs. 37% in pIR) and CpG islands (66% vs. 36% in pIR).

However, their focus has been on coding sequence. Here, we address regulatory changes, jointly referring to changes in promoter and distal regulatory elements covering ~5-20% of the non-coding genome. Pathogenic regulatory variants still correspond to a minority of known variants and quantitative readouts are not commonly available. Further, larger reporter assay datasets are limited to specific loci or readouts of standing variation. While inherently biased and unsuited for machine learning, these datasets provide important validation and show that although myriad annotations and scores exist, none consistently predicts experimental regulatory variant effects.</p><p id="Par7276">Here, we develop a deep neural network (DNN), trained on active and non-active regulatory regions from multiple cell-types. We selected open chromatin peaks from publicly available DNase data (e.g. HepG2, HEK293T, K562, iPSCs) and use a multi-task convolutional network based only on genomic sequence. The multi-task approach provides critical insights into regulatory mechanisms and our model outperforms others’ in predicting experimental variant effects. This method inherently learns sequence features of epigenetic factors and DNA binders, and enables us to study sequence correlates of chromatin marks and transcription factor binding. Using recent methods for DNN interpretation, we extract important regulatory mechanisms from our model, identifying motifs of various key players in cell-type specific transcriptional regulation. We conclude that DNNs have a high potential in predicting regulatory effects and tissue-specific regulation, a critical step forward in the interpretation of genome-wide variants in common and rare diseases.</p><p id="Par7277"><bold>M.

DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism which impacts gene expression in reaction to genetic, developmental or environmental conditions. Conventional epigenome-wide associations studies (EWAS) inquire the relation of phenotypes to the genomic DNA methylation pattern. We performed an EWAS of blood cell DNA from Restless-Legs Syndrome (RLS) patients and age- and sex-matched controls, using the Illumina EPIC (850K) chip. EWAS results were generated by applying mixed models in two datasets with 1000 and 2000 subjects, respectively, submitted to rigorous quality control and inflation correction, and then combined by meta-analysis. We obtained three genome-wide significant methylation sites. The strongest signal (<italic>p-value ≤ 1.6e-22</italic>) was located within <italic>MLLT6</italic>. This site is annotated to be promotor associated, suggesting promotor inactivation and consequent down regulation of <italic>MLLT6</italic> expression in RLS patients. Gene products of <italic>MLLT6</italic> and other MLL genes act as transcriptional regulators of <italic>MEIS1</italic>, a gene highly associated with RLS. Our study is currently in the replication stage, where we intend to verify our findings. Because DNA methylation and gene expression are tissue-specific, we also generate EWAS and other omics results in post-mortem brain tissue samples of 25 RLS patients and 15 controls across four different brain regions. We thus aim for a comprehensive understanding of RLS pathogenesis and potential entry points for therapy.</p><p id="Par7281"><bold>Acknowledgments:</bold> International EU-RLS-GENE Consortium</p><p id="Par7282"><bold>N.

Gluten triggers a proinflammatory response but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. CD-associated SNPs map mainly to noncoding regions, and their effects are difficult to assess. Additionally, post-transcriptional RNA modifications, including m6A, have been shown to play key roles in different autoimmune diseases. We hypothesize that noncoding CD-associated SNPs can alter m6A levels in adjacent motifs, affecting different cell processes and increase CD predisposition. SNP rs3087898, on the 5’ UTR of <italic>XPO1</italic> gene, is close to an m6A motif. We confirmed methylation in this region, and observed that the RNA carrying the CD-risk allele is more methylated and binds YTHDF1 reader more efficiently, promoting higher <italic>XPO1</italic> translation. m6A-related machinery KO produced lower XPO1 protein levels; while gluten stimulations provoked increased XPO1, METTL3 and YTHDF1 expression and an enhanced <italic>XPO1</italic>-YTHDF1 interaction, both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we confirmed that the genotype of the associated SNP influences XPO1 protein levels in human intestinal biopsy samples. In addition, biopsies from CD patients stimulated with gluten also presented XPO1, METTL3 and YTHDF1 induction. We demonstrate that intergenic SNPs associated to autoimmune diseases can alter m6A levels and contribute to pathogenesis. This is the first approach linking gluten with alterations in m6A-related mechanisms. We observe that gluten induces the m6A machinery for an allele-specific increase of m6A levels on the 5’UTR of XPO1, leading to augmented XPO1 and NFkB activation in patients harboring the risk allele.</p><p id="Par7286"><bold>A.

While many evolutionarily conserved developmental processes are well studied in mouse models, our understanding of human-specific neurodevelopmental processes is limited. Our lab aims to provide transcriptomic and epigenomic reference atlases with single-cell resolution. In this ongoing project, we are characterizing chromatin accessibility of cell types in the human brain during early development (5 – 13 p.c.w.) using single-cell ATAC-sequencing.So far, we have sequenced a few tens of thousands of cells and will profile up to one million individual human cells, identifying both region- and cell lineage-specific enhancers as well as enriched motifs and gene accessibility. We use a two-step approach to feature identification, first performing superficial decomposition and clustering on binned genomic ranges to stratify peak calling and then performing Hierarchical Poisson Factorization on more detailed PeakxCell data to identify lineages and cell types. We have identified 29 clusters and 325.484 unique peaks. 115.048 of these peaks are intergenic and 28.622 of these peaks (25%) don’t align to any known element in the GENCODE GRCh38 reference, indicating the presence of unannotated cell lineage specific enhancers. To validate the cluster identities and lineages, our scATAC-seq data will be integrated with the scRNA-seq data that has been acquired as part of the Human Developmental Cell Atlas initiative.

T-cells play a key role in initiating and/or maintaining the disease and antigen presentation is important in mediating this. Monocytes, precursors of antigen presenting cells, are typically characterised by expression of two cell surface proteins (CD14 and CD16). However, recent studies have shown further heterogeneity, some associated with RA. Understanding monocyte heterogeneity is therefore crucial in understanding the mechanisms leading to autoimmunity. We therefore sought to investigate peripheral blood monocyte heterogeneity, using single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), from three healthy volunteers and three patients with RA. Overall, we analysed 17,831 profiles and identified fourteen clusters. There was a clear separation of classical (CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>−</sup>) and non-classical (CD14<sup>−</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>) monocyte sub-types, as well as intermediate (CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>+</sup>) and “natural killer” (0.38%) identities. Interestingly, we identified a cluster defined by expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) in both healthy and RA samples (3.62%), which recently has been shown to be expanded in RA synovia. These findings show that monocytes are indeed more diverse than previously indicated, highlighting the power of scRNA-seq to uncover this heterogeneity. Further work will be required to validate these findings and functionally define a role for this IL-1β monocyte subset. However, the presence of pro-inflammatory monocytes in the blood of healthy individuals would suggest that they are not a feature of RA specifically, but may interact with other cell types to influence or cause disease.

Findings obtained over the last decade that not only promoters but also enhancers are characterized by local transcription have challenged the traditional notion that promoters and enhancers represent distinct classes of regulatory elements. Over half of human promoters are associated with CpG islands (CGIs), relatively CpG-rich stretches of generally several hundred nucleotides that are often associated with housekeeping genes. Only about 6% of transcribed enhancers defined by CAGE-tag analysis are associated with CGIs.</p><p id="Par7318"><bold>Results:</bold> Here we present a detailed analysis of the relation between enhancer and promoter characteristics and the presence or absence of CGIs. We show that transcribed enhancers share a number of CGI-dependent characteristics with promoters, including statistically significant local over-representation of core promoter elements. CGI-associated enhancers are longer, display higher directionality of transcription, greater expression, and a lesser degree of tissue specificity, as well as a higher frequency of transcription-factor binding events than enhancers not associated with CGIs. Genes putatively regulated by CGI-associated enhancers are enriched for transcription regulator activity.</p><p id="Par7319"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings show that CGI-associated enhancers display a series of characteristics related to sequence, expression, and function that distinguish them from transcribed enhancers not associated with CGIs.</p><p id="Par7320"><bold>R.

These iNCs can be used for a combinatorial cell-gene therapy strategy to treat or cure of genetic-based neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) in newborns.</p><p id="Par7356"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Human fibroblast cells were treated with DSM, in presence of TSA and a cocktail of neurotrophic factors including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor, in neural induction medium. On day 6, cells were seeded on culture dishes coated with poly-L-ornithine + Laminin + Fibronectin. Cell characterization was carried out by morphological tracking, gene expression profiling of markers including Vimentin, PAX6 and Nestin by real time PCR, immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry.

However, some partially misfolded ER-retained proteins may retain some biological activity and are therefore good drug targets. GM1-Gangliosidosis, a lysosomal storage disorder, is associated with mutations in <italic>GLB1</italic> leading to β-galactosidase (β-Gal) deficiency. Deoxygalactonojirimycin (DGJ) and its derivatives are pharmaceutical chaperones that could bind to mutated β-Gal in the ER promoting its folding and trafficking to lysosomes.</p><p id="Par7363"><bold>Patient and Methodology:</bold> An Emirati child has been diagnosed with infantile GM1-Gangliosidosis with GLB1 mutations (p.D151Y). Confocal microscopy and biochemical analysis were used to establish the subcellular localization of β-Gal and its enzymatic activity was measured using 0.8mM 4-Methylumbelliferyl β-D-galactopyranoside.</p><p id="Par7364"><bold>Results:</bold> We show that p.D151Y β-Gal in patient’s fibroblasts retained &lt;1% residual activity due to impaired cellular processing and trafficking. Molecular simulation analysis revealed that the amino acid substitution significantly affected the enzyme conformation. However, p.D151Y β-Gal was amenable for partial rescue by culturing the fibroblasts in the presence of glycerol or at low temperature. The DGJ derivatives butyl (NB-DGJ) and nonyl (NN-DGJ) were examined as potential pharmacological chaperones for the mutant enzyme. Although NN-DGJ showed higher affinity to β-Gal, it didn’t show a significant enhancement in p.D151Y β-Gal activity. However, NB-DGJ promoted p.D151Y β-Gal maturation and enhanced its activity up to ~4.5% of normal control activity within 24hrs which significantly increased to ~10% over a period of six days.</p><p id="Par7365"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> NB-DGJ is a promising pharmacological chaperone in infantile GM1 missense variants.</p><p id="Par7366"><bold>Grant number:</bold> UAEU31R134.</p><p id="Par7367"><bold>F.

Using a mouse vEDS model, we established an objective read-out system for the assessment of the clinically highly relevant biomechanical integrity of the murine thoracic aorta.

Of the two, the c.767_771delCAAAT is more prevalent, with 0.8% carrier rate. Therefore, genetic testing was mostly limited to these two variants. The extensive electronic pedigrees used in genetic counselling in Iceland, show clearly the hereditary breast and ovarian (HBOC) patterns in families, aiding decision on genetic testing. However, in one part of the country, the Westfjords, hardly any invidual tested postive for either of the founder PVs despite many HBOC families with classic BRCA1 cancer pattern. By sequencing the BRCA genes, the first patient tested positive for the BRCA1 c.4096+3A&gt;G in 2010, and in 2014, another one. The two patients were related within 6°of relatedness. But, the variant had conflicting pathogenity in ClinVar, mostly of unknown significance. In 2017, a Danish study classified the variant as VUS (1), based mainly on one homozygous healthy individual. We sought information from deCode genetics (personal communication), which established 0.2% population frequency and pathogenity, with 16 fold risk of ovarian cancer and 3.5 fold risk of breast cancer. In 2019, an Icelandic study found their data to accord with the variant being pathogenic (2). Of the 467 tested for this variant, 87 are postive (19%). All positive individuals trace their ancestry to the Westfjords and no other significant HBOC PV has been found there. The variant is now routinely tested for, in HBOC families with roots in the Westfjords.</p><p id="Par7378"><bold>V. Stefansdottir:</bold> None. <bold>J.J.

This research is aimed at informing (using the systematic literature review method) the existence and effectiveness of automated CGC governance frameworks. The gap in the literature revealed the absence of a formalised approach to linking CGC processes which are currently highly dependent on the person involved in counseling sessions. Although professional guidelines are used to identify patients at risk, they are not in a standardised form. Few resources exist in CGC service assessment which are mainly the National Cancer Institute Community Cancer Centers (NCCCP) and the CGC Assessment Tool (CGCAT) tool. Also, four core bodies are mainly responsible for generating policies for CGC services with no major differences between their policy documents. CGC Quality requirements include accountability, value, safety, equity, sustainability, effectiveness, etc. Seven core CGC processes are mainly followed from patient identification to post-counseling. However, there is no consensus on metrics to inform the satisfaction of quality requirements of CGC programmes. Moreover, no comprehensive CGC frameworks exit that reflect the interaction between standards, quality requirements, policies, and processes. In conclusion, without such interactions, automatic governance for each CGC case is not possible which has led the researchers to embark on developing a CGC process architectural framework to inform governance of CGC processes, and their effectiveness in reducing incidence and mortality in relation to hereditary.</p><p id="Par7389"><bold>L.

An online mix-methods questionnaire was used to capture the data. Descriptive statistical and thematic qualitative analysis was carried out on the data.

All paediatricians had varied experience in communicating uncertain array-CGH results and a mixed knowledge of genomic testing and its possible implications for the patient and their family. This study demonstrated a general understanding of array-CGH results and their implications alongside a willingness to communicate uncertainty to patients. The importance of ongoing education and support for paediatricians was highlighted, along with the need for additional patient information.

England is implementing a national Genomic Medicine Service, leading to genomic testing being utilised across an increasing number of specialties and resulting in a requirement for workforce development around the consent conversation. In response to this, The Genomics Education Programme has developed a nationally agreed cross-professional competency framework outlining the knowledge, skills and behaviours required to facilitate genomic testing. Using the principles of the nominal group technique, a one-day expert consensus meeting reviewed clinical scenarios in iterative rounds, mapped themes to an initial framework and voted on areas of inconsistency. A revised framework was open for consultation with key stakeholders including patient communities and Royal Medical Colleges before being finalised. A short-term external evaluation has been conducted, assessing how early adopters are using or intending to use the framework. Evidence-based competencies are an important basis to support responsible delivery of genomic medicine. This framework can be used as a guide for best practice by clinicians involved in requesting genomic tests. For those delivering education, the framework provides a foundation to identify learning needs and structure training, such that consent conversations can be delivered in a consistent manner across specialties. In addition, these competencies can be used as a reference to evaluate how consent is facilitated in different specialty areas to enhance the delivery of genomic medicine.</p><p id="Par7405"><bold>A.

In April 2019, we began planning, assigning priorities and contacting then meeting individual lead clinicians and contributors to 100,000 Genomes Project. We held teaching sessions for clinical teams, taught at regional speciality meetings and hosted meetings for regional early adopters. Subjects included testing techniques, use of the National Genomic Test Directory, Record of Discussion, test request forms, NGIS and giving genomic results. Teams of educators comprised clinical scientists, SpRs, genetic counsellors and clinical geneticists, reaching out to peripheral hospitals and specialist colleagues. Mainstream clinical teams were encouraged to identify ‘Genomic Champions and Practitioners’ to educate their teams and work together in networks. We used tools including role-play, interactive discussions, recording frequently-asked-questions and development of slide-decks to ensure consistency and avoid duplication of effort. We worked with Genomic Champions to develop care-pathways, using a ‘Do Once and Share’ model. We worked with colleagues in Wessex and Birmingham to share good practice and Health Education England developing documents and competency frameworks. By December 2019 we had started rapid Whole Exome Sequencing for NICU/PICU, made ready services in Phase 1 of the WGS roll-out and are readying those in Phase 2. The Oxford Genomic Medicine Centre and Genetic Laboratories embedded all this engagement, education and support in Genomic Academies, over-arching, virtual structures that received widespread support from mainstream clinicians.</p><p id="Par7426"><bold>H.

This is the first randomised clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of GC for fCRC.</p><p id="Par7430"><bold>Method:</bold> We included individuals affected or at risk for fCRC (Lynch syndrome, APC-associated polyposis, MUTYH-associated polyposis or clinically defined fCRC). Participants are randomised to (1) genetic counselling and standard care or (2) standard care alone (control). Measures include: Genetic Counselling Outcome Scale (GCOS), knowledge, risk perception, emotional distress, screening/surveillance behaviours, perceived social support, decisional conflict and quality of life.</p><p id="Par7431"><bold>Results:</bold> We currently recruited 24 participants with an average age of 42 years old, 80% females, 40% at risk and 60% individuals diagnosed various types of fCRC cancer.

While general practitioners (GPs) were always involved in finding index cases, after 2013 especially follow-up and active cascade screening was no longer systematically pursued by an organization. The number of family screenings dropped. Aim of this study was to explore views on the role of GPs in FH screening and care, and identify barriers and facilitators for optimizing care.</p><p id="Par7437"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Two focus groups (17 GPs) and eight interviews (GPs, vascular specialists, a clinical geneticist, health law expert and consultants of the Dutch Expertise Centre for Inheritance Testing of Cardiovascular Disease (LEEFH) coordinating FH screening) were conducted. Descriptive analyses of data from anonymized electronic medical records of 26988 patients registered in 50 general practices in Amsterdam, the Netherlands addressed registration of International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-1) codes and free text.</p><p id="Par7438"><bold>Results:</bold> Registration using ICPC code T93.04 (having FH) was suboptimal and varied between practices. GPs had specific knowledge gaps. Although GPs acknowledged their role in discussing with patients the relevance of informing first degree relatives, active support and checking whether patients actually had informed the family was welcomed by some stakeholders, but regarded unfeasible by several GPs.</p><p id="Par7439"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> For optimising FH care more adequate information should be available for GPs, patients and family. Knowledge of GPs should be increased. Attunement between primary and secondary care and LEEFH should be strengthened.

Patients should be supported by both genetic services and their fertility clinic when receiving genetic information about a donor so they can make empowered and informed decisions about their next steps. Clear pathways of communication between the fertility clinic and genetic services are required to provide a streamlined patient service when a donor is retrospectively found to have or be at increased risk of passing on a genetic condition.</p><p id="Par7447"><bold>V.

The HDG is an initiative of the Human Genetics Department of the Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, in collaboration with the University of Washington and the University of Adelaide. Each gene website is moderated by a dedicated team of clinicians and molecular biologists, and provides up-to-date - mostly unpublished - clinical information on one specific gene or copy number variant. HDG aims to fill the gap between first publication of several cases and consecutive publication of a large review paper. Professionals can use the information of the disorder for genetic counseling and will have the opportunity to share clinical data. Patients and parents/caregivers will find useful information on the disease and have the opportunity to share detailed clinical information through the website of our partner GenIDA. HDG is also a platform where researchers can collect and share (functional) data. Recently a new version of the websites has been launched which not only allows collection of phenotypic data using HPO, but provides an up-to-date graphical overview of the clinical data that have been collected. These tools will be highly valuable for the clinical practice. Currently, over 400 genes have been adopted by more than 300 moderators world-wide.

In spite of that, literature on quality assessment of genetic counselling is scarce. Measures available are insufficient, poorly disseminated, and focused mainly on genetic counselling effects. A theoretically-underpinning scale for quality assessment by healthcare professionals was recently published; however, the need for a measure for patients’ assessment persisted. This study describes the development and initial validation of a theoretically-informed scale for genetic counselling quality assessment by patients. Scale items were developed based on the pre-existing quality assessment scale for professionals, the reciprocal-engagement model of genetic counselling practice, and literature on genetic counselling patients’ perceptions. Items were refined through cognitive interviews. Patients from five Portuguese clinical genetics services (<italic>n</italic> = 123) completed the scale. Principal component analysis using direct <italic>oblimin</italic> was conducted to establish the initial construct validity of the scale and reduce the number of items. Cronbach’s alpha was calculated as a measure of internal reliability. Final scale consisted of 51 items scale organised into six dimensions. The scale presented adequate internal reliability. Initial evidence of construct validity was also demonstrated. This scale is the first theoretically-underpinned measure designed for patient’s assessment of genetic counselling quality. Genetic counselling professionals and researchers can use this scale to identify areas for quality improvement of genetic healthcare services and design interventions. We discuss practical implications and clinical utility of this new tool as well as challenges of the validation process at genetic services.</p><p id="Par7513"><bold>M.

At the same time, 48.8% of respondents were unable to give a correct answer to the question about the genetic background of neoplasms. Some respondents were also unable to give an example of a genetic test, mentioning mammography, cytology or medical ultrasound.</p><p id="Par7519"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study clearly shows that patients don’t have sufficient knowledge about genetics but at the same time they perform or would perform a genetic test without a specialist’s consultation.

The University has been able to incorporate ASHG/APHMG Medical School Core Curriculums (1995, 2001, 2013) into an undergraduate medical program. Students’ Scientific Debate Club “FBG - Future Belongs to Genetics” was established in 1995, which held 25 students’ conferences and events. In 2006 a department of Molecular &amp; Medical Genetics was established in our university for the first time in Georgia. We have embedded problem-based learning (PBL) within the integrated course, centered on clinical case studies; High quality scientific and educational literature, including textbooks: Thompson&amp;Thompson Genetics in Medicine (7th and 8th editions) have been translated and published by the department. Several local and international conferences, including “Genomics and Epigenomics in Personalized Medicine” (2016, 2017), “Human Genome and Heath” (2018, 2019) have been organized by the department and the Georgian Society of Medical Genetics and Epigenetics (GSMGE). In addition, since 2014 we have been running a Georgian DNA Day Essay Contest for Georgian and international students. Our department and GSMGE, in collaboration with ESHG, encourage young scientists to participate in the annual conferences organized by ESHG. In 2014 the research and diagnostic laboratory was founded at the department, where PhD programs, CME courses and educational courses for students in genetics, genomics and epigenomics were designed and developed. As a result, nowadays, many medical professionals in Georgia have sound understanding of genetics and can successfully deploy their knowledge in their clinical practice, when needed.</p><p id="Par7524"><bold>E.

We therefore developed an expert-reviewed survey based in theory (behavioural change) and empirical qualitative data (McClaren et al., Front Genet 2019). Domains included: personal characteristics (demographics, specialty, years of practice); current genomic medicine practice; perception of how proximal genomic medicine is to practice; preparedness to practice genomics (competence and confidence); and preferences for future roles and models of care in genomic medicine and for CGE. The survey was deployed nationally through medical colleges, societies, hospitals, social media and snowballing in 2019, with 409 analysable responses from physicians across Australia. Respondents represented 30 specialties (majority paediatricians, 20%), from mainly public hospitals (70%) in metropolitan areas (75%). Only 13% of respondents ordered whole exome/genome sequencing tests in their practice, with the main reason for not ordering tests being relevance to practice (39%). A third (32%) referred patients to a clinical genetics service for testing and this was largely unchanged (34%) when reporting future preferences. Two-thirds of respondents felt genomics will soon impact their practice and, while a third recently completed CGE, only a quarter felt prepared. Respondents lacked confidence in genomic knowledge and ability to explain concepts to patients and incorporate test results in patient management. These data can inform genetic services (re test referral patterns) and support genomic education providers to best meet learner needs and develop a competent, genomic literate workforce.</p><p id="Par7528"><bold>Grant reference:</bold> GNT1113531</p><p id="Par7529"><bold>E.

However, training is very heterogeneous and partitioned with isolated trainees learning highly-specific expertise areas. There was a need for an international group easily accessible online to connect young human geneticists around the world. We aim to present how this group operates and develops. Based on the Facebook social media, we created the “Young Geneticists Network" private group in February 2018 (<ext-link xlink:href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/young.geneticist/" ext-link-type="uri">https://www.facebook.com/groups/young.geneticist/</ext-link>). All people registered on Facebook can request to join the YGN group. Requests are reviewed by administrators. All members can post and share text, photos, and multimedia related to Human Genetics topics with other members who receive notifications. We present anonymous group insights data obtained until November 2019.We gathered 529 members from 57 different countries and selected 14 volunteer moderators. The majority of the members were under 34 years old (74.9%) and female (74.6%). Six European countries gathered most of the members (55%): France (108), Italy (71), Romania (30), The Netherlands (28), Portugal (27) and the United Kingdom (27). We counted 37 posts with 74 comments and 408 reactions from the community. The YGN is a collaborative group that allows members to share training opportunities (online courses, funding resources,...) and queries related to Human Genetics. We are able to engage a global audience of peers in a very short period.

Joint evaluation by a neurologist and a medical genetics specialist can potentially increase diagnostic effectiveness by ensuring the exclusion of non-genetic mimics and by rationally selecting appropriate genetic diagnostic tools. Therefore, a monthly adult Neurogenetics clinic was established.</p><p id="Par7572"><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective review of medical records.</p><p id="Par7573"><bold>Results:</bold> 85 patients were evaluated. Age: 47.1 ± 15.7, Male: 40(47%), 44 (51%) had a positive family history. Disease duration was typically long (11.4 ± 0.9 years). Futile use of expensive diagnostic modalities was very common [45(52%) had repeated MRI, 28(32%) hospitalized for observation in neurologic departments, 12(14%) had a normal metabolic workup, 4 (4%) with a non-conclusive muscle biopsy, 1 with a normal cerebral angiography]. Following clinical evaluation molecular genetic testing was offered to 70 (82%) patients. In the other 15(18%) routine workup for the exclusion of non-genetic mimics was not complete, obtainable information regarding family members was missing or that a neurogenetic disorder seemed improbable. 29 (34%) patients received a definitive diagnosis, either a genetic (29%) or non-genetic (5%). The adherence to genetic testing recommendations was 62%. The reasons for non-adherence were lack of public funding for the required test (56%) and patient decision not to proceed (44%).</p><p id="Par7574"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Given the frequent futile use of expensive modalities due to diagnostic uncertainty and the complexity of clinical genomic data analysis, a comprehensive multi-disciplinary neurogenetic clinics seems reimbursement and cost effective for the patients and medical health institutions.</p><p id="Par7575"><bold>A.

Materials and methods: Totally 800 questionnaires were collected from pregnant women living in 16 regions of Russia. Results: The statement “Every pregnant woman must undergo combined screening in the first trimester” was agreed by the majority of respondents - 90.16%. 63.38% of the respondents did not know before our survey about NIPT. After explaining its capabilities, 74.74% believe that it should be used. It was revealed that despite the high compliance to the early prenatal screening between pregnant women in general, only a little more than half of the women with an increased risk of chromosome abnormalities were ready to undergo invasive diagnosis in the fetus and only a quarter of the pregnant women were ready to terminate the pregnancy with chromosome abnormalities in the fetus. Women who were ready to terminate the pregnancy were statistically significantly older, had more pregnancies, were at a later gestational age. It was more important for them to receive the test results as early as possible with as much additional information as possible and have the state/insurance type of payment for the test (Mann-Whitney, p &lt; 0.002). Conclusion: The survey will allow comparing the results with other countries where NIPT is used in early prenatal screening and to develop recommendations for our country.

In this context, the EXOMA study (2016-2019) proposed somatic/constitutional exome for patients with advanced cancer. Considering the risk for identifying genetic predisposition, with genetic counseling and management implications, a genetic consultation was proposed; which value needed to be assessed.</p><p id="Par7583"><bold>Methods:</bold> A 20 minutes consultation, with a prior collection of family history by the patient, was carried out within 15 days of inclusion in EXOMA. Tumoral and constitutional analyses were limited to 317 genes involved in oncogenesis.</p><p id="Par7584"><bold>Results:</bold> In 36/716 patients (5%), a constitutional pathogenic variant was identified in 13 actionable genes, but half were already identified in the care circuit. Among 18 cases identified by the exome, 10/18 did not meet the predisposition search criteria, and in 2/10, the variation can be considered as incidental (unrelated to the presented cancer). In 3/18 cases, a genetic consultation had been previously performed, but the analyses were limited to <italic>BRCA/MMR</italic>. In 5/18 cases, the criteria for the search of predisposition were present but not identified by the oncologist. In 18 additional patients, a variant was identified in genes that do not lead to a specific surveillance protocol in France, such as <italic>ATM/CHECK2</italic>.</p><p id="Par7585"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In 2.5% of patients, a constitutional genetic predisposition, related or not to the clinical presentation, was identified, making it important to inform the patient beforehand.

Psychiatric genetic counseling has been proven to be effective in improving patients’ empowerment, self-efficacy, and knowledge even in the absence of genetic testing. Despite this, only one specialist psychiatric genetic counselling clinic currently exists. In order to engage and empower genetic counsellors in providing psychiatric genetic counselling worldwide, a two-day workshop: “Psychiatric Genetic Counseling for Genetic Counselors”, was developed and implemented. The aim of the present study was to qualitatively explore the impact of the workshop.</p><p id="Par7590"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Semi-structured interviews were carried out with twelve genetic counsellors who attended the workshop between 2015 and 2018. Interviews were then transcribed, and thematic analysis was used to identify themes from the data. Constant comparative method was employed on the qualitative data themes throughout analysis.</p><p id="Par7591"><bold>Results:</bold> 100% of participants reported an increase in empowerment in offering psychiatric genetic counselling to patients. Participants also reflected how the workshop normalised mental illness and aided the counsellors in identifying sources of their personal stigma. The workshop also provided participants with a practical tool to describe multifactorial inheritance, the Jar Model.</p><p id="Par7592"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The “Psychiatric Genetic Counseling for Genetic Counselors” workshop empowered genetic counsellors to feel confident and comfortable offering psychiatric genetic counselling to patients.</p><p id="Par7593"><bold>A.

After de-duplication, 990 citations were screened and 847 rejected. The remaining 143 citations were reviewed, and 20 met inclusion criteria. Most studies (<italic>n</italic> = 10) investigated both process and outcomes, and a few of these reported similar rates of compliance with post-disclosure recommendations (~70%); rates of family communication were as high as 90%. Other studies focused on the disclosure process (<italic>n</italic> = 4) or post-disclosure outcomes (<italic>n</italic> = 6) only. Across studies the psychosocial impact of receiving SF was minimal.</p><p id="Par7599">Since the release of the ACMG guidelines, only twenty studies have examined the disclosure process or evaluated clinical utility. Our review suggests that not all SF recipients communicate results to their doctors or relatives, and a substantial fraction may not engage in the recommended healthcare behaviors.

Peer-reviewed papers published between January 1995 and May 2019 were searched using five databases. Of 1505 studies identified, 27 were reviewed in full-text, 9 met the inclusion criteria. Satisfaction and usefulness of support groups was analyzed by three studies, which reported high level of satisfaction, appreciation of psychological support and interest for future psychoeducational groups. Major themes emerged were distress and feelings of guilt about transmission to offspring, when to disclose information to relatives, anxiety and depression related. Between September 2018 and January 2020 we arranged six support groups for BRCA carriers and their families. Of 43 individuals participating to at least one group, 23 (53%) participated to more than one. Main reasons reported for participating were: desire to meet other BRCA carriers (17; 40%) and the need for further information (14; 33%). 95% felt comfortable and 90% considered the group very useful. Twenty-seven participants (62,7%) declared their expectations had been completely satisfied; almost all declared they would participate to future groups. Major themes emerged were: how and when to disclose the information to offspring (particularly sons), why minors cannot be tested, differences between BRCA1 and BRCA2, prophylactic surgery, diet and hormone therapy.

However, currently, there is not a comprehensive mapping of resources for undiagnosed or newly diagnosed Ultra-Rare diseases. Within the EU funded project, Solve-RD, EURORDIS initiated the Community Engagement Task Force (CETF), a multi-stakeholder community of patients, scientists, and clinicians, to support the needs of the undiagnosed and recently diagnosed patients and leave a legacy of a strengthened undiagnosed community.</p><p id="Par7631"><bold>Methodology:</bold> Key stakeholders in the field of diagnosis were invited to become members of CETF. These include Undiagnosed Diseases Network International (UDNI), SWAN (Syndrome Without A Name) Europe, Patient Advocacy Groups within the European Reference Networks and The Global Commission to End the Diagnostic Odyssey for Children.</p><p id="Par7632"><bold>Results:</bold> Members gathered through 3 teleconferences and a face-to-face meeting over 15 months where they discussed issues addressing specific needs of undiagnosed rare disease patients and their families such as lack of information for medical professionals and the need for standardization when receiving a diagnosis. Resources (toolkits, surveys, factsheets, illustrations) were compiled to develop a roadmap.</p><p id="Par7633"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Regular and meaningful engagement of representatives across key initiatives represents the start of an active undiagnosed community.

As this is an incurable disabling condition, they are confronted with the decision of having a termination of pregnancy (TOP).

The aim of this study was to gain an understanding of the experiences of South African women who have had a TOP for DS and the psychosocial impact thereof.</p><p id="Par7644"><bold>Methods:</bold> A phenomenological qualitative approach was used. Eight participants were purposively selected from a prenatal clinic at a state sector hospital in South Africa (SA). They were interviewed shortly after being admitted to hospital for the TOP and again 6 to 12 months afterwards. The audio-recordings were transcribed and thematic analysis was used.</p><p id="Par7645"><bold>Results:</bold> Prenatal testing services are not widely accessible in SA and therefore the participants all had a second-trimester TOP. The themes identified with regards to the psychological implications were: grief, impact of seeing stillborn, guilt, isolation, finding meaning, decision satisfaction and finding peace. The social impact included change in workplace, TOP stigma, moving house and change in relationships. The participants valued support from religious groups, partners, family, friends, health care workers and employers.</p><p id="Par7646"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The major long-term psychosocial impact of a TOP made it difficult for the women to return to their normal daily routine.

However, in the context of low-penetrance diseases, gathering reliable phenotypic information to facilitate such early detection is challenging, since many at-risk individuals will never develop the disease. In particular, there is a risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, leading to an inefficient use of scarce healthcare resources. Furthermore, it is crucial that clinically healthy individuals are not prematurely designated as patients. To address these issues, we have developed a rigorous, 100-point-scale scoring scheme for prioritising low-penetrance diseases to facilitate long-term risk monitoring and early disease detection. A key variable to our scoring scheme is “at-home phenotyping”, that is, the ease and accuracy with which an at-risk individual can regularly sample and monitor relevant phenotypic markers over time, without recourse to their medical professional. We have applied the scoring scheme to evaluate and rank 23 monogenic disorders characterised by reduced penetrance and variable expressivity. The scores for the 23 disorders ranged from 40.0 to 88.3, with a mean of 65.3 (median of 65.8). Disorders with the highest scores were hereditary hemochromatosis (88.3), familial hypercholesterolemia (86.7), and hereditary hyperparathyroidism (85.0). By systematically evaluating and ranking medically relevant gene-disease associations, it may be possible to prioritise low-penetrance disorders for facilitating long-term personalised health surveillance in an efficient and responsible manner.</p><p id="Par7651"><bold>R.

Despite its favorable diagnostic performance compared to conventional testing strategies, routine use of WGS is hampered by insufficient evidence of clinical utility. Largely, this evidence gap stems from complexities and inconsistencies in how this concept is defined and measured. For example, what constitutes clinical utility for WGS varies by stakeholder perspective, clinical context, and test application. A rapidly evolving technology landscape and challenges associated with executing robust comparative study designs in the context of rare disease further impede progress in this area.</p><p id="Par7670"><bold>Methods:</bold> An expert working group, representing a range of clinical settings in which WGS is in translation, was formed to provide practical guidance to practitioners and researchers to address the challenge of measuring clinical utility.</p><p id="Par7671"><bold>Results:</bold> Following a consensus-based process and aligned with a broad definition of clinical utility, we propose a conceptually-grounded and empirically-guided measurement toolkit focused on four domains of clinical utility: diagnostic thinking efficacy, therapeutic efficacy, patient outcome efficacy and societal efficacy. For each domain, we offer specific indicators and measurement strategies that can be integrated into new and ongoing studies.</p><p id="Par7672"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> While we focus on diagnostic applications of WGS for rare germline diseases, this toolkit offers a flexible framework for best practices related to measuring clinical utility for a range of WGS applications. As such, it provides a resource for laboratories, clinicians, and researchers looking to characterize the value of WGS beyond the laboratory.</p><p id="Par7673"><bold>R.Z.

Yet, many patients struggle with communicating these results and it is unclear to what extent this is discussed during the consent process. To better understand if and how the communication of genetic information to family members is addressed in the clinical context, we systematically searched for consent forms for diagnostic genomic sequencing online and used content analysis to analyze the forms. We identified 68 consent forms from 11 countries. The forms indicated that genetic findings were often presented as familial in nature, yet varied in how findings with familial implications were discussed. A minority of providers addressed communication of genetic information with family members, with differences in whether the health professional or the patient would be responsible for this process. Several forms offered patients options regarding communication that contradicted national guidelines and legislation regarding the disclosure of results in the absence of patient consent. This is concerning because it shows how patients and clinicians could be misled about whether or not communication is permissible in cases where the patient does not consent. Our research questions whether providers and health professionals receive adequate education and training, especially with regards to the ethical problems raised by genetic findings.

The objectives of this survey were to determine the extent of genetic literacy and attitudes of the Japanese public toward genomic medicine and to estimate the prevalence of genetic discrimination. Cross-sectional and anonymous online surveys were distributed to adults in Japan in February 2017 and again in January 2020. The findings of the surveys conducted in 2017 (<italic>N</italic> = 10,881) and 2020 (<italic>N</italic> = 10,245) were compared, referring to our dataset since 2005. The recognition rate of “genome” became higher (69.7% in 2005, 73.2% in 2017, 85.1% in 2020 respectively). Respondents’ experiences of being required to submit personal genetic information were “life insurance for medical benefits or death benefits” (2.1% in 2017, 1.5% in 2020 respectively) and “from my partner or his/her relatives” (0.3% in both years). Overall benefits of using genetic information were recognized higher than concerns. As genome medicine becomes more familiar to people in the near future, their concerns about the utilization of genetic information may increase. The policy to prevent genetic discrimination should be considered urgently.</p><p id="Par7703"><bold>K. Muto:</bold> None. <bold>A. Nagai:</bold> None. <bold>I. Ri:</bold> None. <bold>Z.

Genetic counselling supports their decision-making process. However, factors influencing the genetic testing decision-making process have not been studied in Switzerland so far. This study thus aims to investigate the decision-making process of people undergoing genetic counselling for cancer predisposition in Switzerland. Grounded theory is the methodological approach of this qualitative interview study. Eighteen individuals were retrospectively asked about their decision-making process, including both acceptors and decliners of genetic testing. Additionally, participants were asked in hypothetical vignettes whether they would undergo genetic testing for nonactionable genetic variants. Two healthcare professionals providing genetic counselling were interviewed for data triangulation. We found that the underlying life philosophy of either leaving life to fate or preferring control influences genetic testing decision-making importantly. However, other factors might shape this decision: People look for certainty; anticipate consequences; are socially influenced; simplify risks; decide intuitively or reflectively, and trust in science to different degrees. Our results visualise a theory of genetic testing decision-making that comprises both acceptors and decliners. It might help healthcare professionals and carriers informing family members to anticipate differing life philosophies, and, thus, differing attitudes towards genetic testing for both actionable and non-actionable genetic variants.</p><p id="Par7721"><bold>B.M.

Results obtained for the frequency of epilepsy or other previously reported comorbidities are consistent with published data. Inclusion of probands from a wide age range generates data on natural history. A major finding was the identification of recurrent respiratory problems in 40% of patients, including asthma (39 cases) and pneumonia (31 cases, mostly before 10y).

NGS not only generates a vast amount of data, the results are often not very clear-cut. In many instances, analysis does not reveal a straightforward diagnostic cause for the symptoms, requiring a more complex interpretation and negotiation process. The type of delineation work this lack of clarity necessitates is not uncommon in medicine: diagnostic definitions and criteria change over time, which allows new diagnoses to arise and others to be lumped together, split or dissolved. In NGS, the boundaries of what counts as ‘evidence’ for variant interpretation, what is relevant to report to patients, and what constitutes a diagnosis is continuously reshaped in everyday practice. In this early implementation phase of NGS, in which standardization efforts are not yet solidified, the boundary struggles in laboratory and clinical practice are particularly visible. To explore the complexities in the social shaping of diagnosis in NGS settings, we critically review the literature on the sociology of health and illness, sociology of diagnosis, and science and technology studies on the meaning and social construction of diagnosis. We then assess the current state of NGS practice through this lens. We discuss what it entails to give and receive a diagnosis using NGS, how this differs from diagnoses identified through more ‘traditional’ diagnostic technologies, and what role uncertainty plays in this.</p><p id="Par7738"><bold>J.M.L.

Findings other than trisomy 21, 18 or 13 are reported on request of the pregnant woman, 78% of women chose to have these reported. The first year, a total of 207 incidental findings (IF) other than the three common trisomies were detected. This survey study examined women’s experiences of being informed of an IF and its psychological impact. One-hundred thirteen (54.6%) women completed the questionnaire. Most women (59.3%) chose for IF because they wanted to know as much as possible about the health of their unborn child. Slightly more than half (57.5%) did not find deciding for IF difficult, however only 25.6% felt they had an idea of what IF could be before having NIPT. Almost all (98.2%) women met with a clinical geneticist to discuss their IF, for 82.3% of them this helped in understanding their result. Sixteen women (14.2%) ended their pregnancy because of abnormalities resulting from the IF, whereas 85 (75.2%) gave birth to a child without anomalies. For most women (85.9%) the IF caused them great worry. However, a vast majority (89.3%) would opt for NIPT again in a future pregnancy, of whom 71% would opt for IF again. This study gives an insight in how pregnant women experience receiving an IF from NIPT.

Arguments evolved around the 2013 American College of Medical Genetics recommendations to analyze and disclose a minimum list of actionable variants. Reasons to support opportunistic screening include, utilizing available data as an opportunity to identify and manage risks for the selected highly penetrant genetic disorders. Experts, however, have also questioned the clinical validity and utility of these findings and posed serious ethical and social issues around informed consent, equity, potential psychosocial harm of receiving results and impact on health care budgets. Pharmacogenetic variants have received little attention in these debates, while guidelines with actionable gene-drug prescriptions are available. The “Dutch Consortium for Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues of Personalized Medicine (ELSI-PM)” organized a workshop on opportunistic screening for pharmacogenetic variants, for relevant Dutch stakeholders. We aimed to elucidate the arguments for and against offering opportunistic pharmacogenetic screening to patients undergoing sequencing with an overview of variants relevant for future drug prescriptions; their personal “myDNAmedicationcard”. Participants agreed that such practice would pertain screening, should therefore meet corresponding screening criteria, and does not automatically fall under the duty of the physician offering the initial sequencing. Although many argued that it could be beneficial to have your personal pharmacogenetic information readily available when requiring drugs, many uncertainties emerged. Pilot studies could provide more insight in consequences of opportunistic pharmacogenetic screening.

However, the extent to which genetic tests are currently utilised for prevention purposes remains unknown. In this study, we explore the practices of a large sample of European prevention centres (PCs) - i.e. medical institutions specialised in health maintenance and disease prevention - regarding their use of medical genetics. We identified PCs located within the European Economic Area based on their membership of relevant professional organisations, participation in academic and business events related to preventive medicine, and a comprehensive online search. We reviewed PCs’ websites and information materials, such as marketing brochures and videos, to gain insights into the availability of genomics-guided preventive services. In cases where provided information was deemed insufficient, PCs were contacted with additional questions via email. Those PCs who did not reply to our email inquiries within two weeks were subsequently contacted via a phone call. Our search identified 74 PCs located in 20 European countries. The highest number of PCs were based in Germany (17/74; 23%), followed by Spain (9/74; 12%) and the Czech Republic (7/74; 9%). Of these, only six (8%) PCs fully incorporate genetic testing into their services to personalise preventive healthcare pathways for their customers. These PCs also employ qualified genetics professionals who support customers through genetic counseling. The paucity of genome-informed services among PCs indicates a slow rate of adoption of genomics in preventive healthcare.</p><p id="Par7766"><bold>A. Blazkova:</bold> A.

They were able to be named “Group of aggressive promotion” (41.5%), “Group of passive support”(20.8%), “Group not making judgment” (19.2%), “Group making prudent judgment” (18.5%), and “Group not interested in genome”. The results in 2008 and 2009 were almost the same as that in2005. It is possible to forecast to which cluster to belong according to respondent’s attribute, and we can forecast the reaction to other questions by using a cluster oppositely. For examples, “Group of aggressive promotion” is the layer of a high academic background, and is positive to donate their blood for the genome research, “Group making prudent judgment” is high academic back ground persons as same as “Group of aggressive promotion”, and is interesting in the science and technology, but is negative to the blood donation for the research.</p><p id="Par7772"><bold>Z.

This study reports accounts of their reproductive decisions from people at-risk for or affected by the incurable, late-onset neurological diseases, familial amyloid polyneuropathy ATTRVal30Met and Machado-Joseph disease. We draw on individual and family semi-structured interviews with participants recruited through the respective national patients’ associations (<italic>n</italic> = 35, 19 women; mean age: 39.2y, range 17-68). Data were analysed thematically. Findings revealed that participants drew on various - sometimes ambivalent and competing - relations to their awareness of genetic risk and their wish to have children. The elimination of genetic risk was perceived as responsible behaviour by some participants. For others, however, responsibility entailed accepting risks, because they prioritized values such as parenthood, family relationships and the value of life, above any concern about genetic disease. Some accounts were fraught with ambivalence, repentance and guilt, especially when children were born before participants knew of their or their partner’s risk. Hope for future scientific advances was often emphasized by those participants who already had children at-risk. We discuss the findings in the context of the participants’ negotiations between reproductive risks and their sense of responsibility to self and others (including those not yet born), and how the accumulated multigenerational experience with the disease influence participants’ decisions. We conclude that ‘genetic responsibility’ is present not only in the accounts of those who chose not to have children but also in those who knew their situation beforehand and still chose to have at-risk children.</p><p id="Par7776"><bold>Á.

This exam can eventually reveal constitutional information of interest for family members linked to the child cancer or incidental findings.

In addition, different consents forms were compared. Focus groups with patients and parents were organized in several pediatric oncology units to identify the information needs and to shed light on path improvements (professionals involved and temporal organization of such proposals).</p><p id="Par7781"><bold>Results:</bold> Initial results show disparate medical practices and an absence of specific rules regarding the somatic genetic above all when realized on minors.

Two main molecular mechanisms have been identified: a maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (5-10%), and methylation abnormalities of the 11p15.5 region (40-60%). To date, few studies have focused on the intellectual and cognitive profile of individuals with SRS. However, these are important concerns for families. The few existing studies are mainly focused on pediatric cohorts, but it is important to evaluate the intellectual profile and cognitive abilities of patients with SSR across lifespan.</p><p id="Par7787"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Ten adults aged 18-39 years completed the Wechsler scale for adults. All of the patients had SRS due to epimutation in the 11p15 region. Measures of interest included patients’ intelligence quotient (IQ) and four cognitive domains: verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. Clinical and medical information were also collected from interviews and questionnaires.</p><p id="Par7788"><bold>Results:</bold> The mean IQ score was in the average range (<italic>M</italic> = 95.40, <italic>SD</italic> = 18.55). Patients had better performance in verbal comprehension compared to other domains. Frequent daily difficulties were reported by patients: learning disabilities and low self-esteem were perceived in 60% of adults.</p><p id="Par7789"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study is one of the first to document the intellectual functioning of adults with SRS. It shows that early intervention and multidisciplinary care from childhood to adulthood appear to be important in this syndrome for care potential medical, cognitive and psychosocial problems.</p><p id="Par7790"><bold>M.

We aimed to investigate how uncertain prenatal WES results might be handled by healthcare professionals (HCP’s) and patients and which individual characteristics may play a role. Exploring the impact of uncertainty in decision-making is instrumental in optimizing counselling in a prenatal setting.</p><p id="Par7794"><bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> Two experiments were conducted among 51 medical students (HCP’s) and 76 psychology students (in the role of patients) respectively. Vignettes covering several types of uncertain prenatal WES results were ranked on perceived uncertainty. Medical students answered whether they would report each result to the couple (experiment 1). Psychology students indicated whether they would want to receive the result (experiment 2). In both experiments participants indicated how certain they were about their choice.</p><p id="Par7795"><bold>Results:</bold> In experiment 1, highly uncertain results were reported less often (59%) than results low in uncertainty (98%), <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001.
