Photovoltaics (PV), the conversion of sunlight to electricity has been reported to be the fastest-growing technology for electricity generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. One-fifth of the world's total energy consumption is delivered for civil applications, residential and commercial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Developing energy-efficient buildings is of prime importance and future building industry regulations will have energy-efficiency requirements that meet the growing demand on energy resources. Ideally, new energy technologies must be integrated into the existing and future infrastructure elements (e.g. buildings) and at the same time provide savings by reducing the energy consumption. Designing “energy-saving and energy-producing solar windows” provides a way of boosting building-integrated PV (BIPV) energy outputs dramatically and beyond what is possible currently, simultaneously with reducing the cooling- and heating-related energy consumption.</p><p>Various glazings and coated-type windows are in use worldwide as they offer thermal comfort improvements, energy savings, aesthetic value and ultraviolet (UV) protection. With the widespread use of glass panels covering vast areas of walls and roofs in modern buildings, significant economic benefits could be achieved if these glass surfaces had energy-generation capabilities. An economically-ideal energy-saving approach is to use window glazings that offer a combination of IR-range transparency blocking and energy-harvesting (due to the ability to efficiently convert the lighting-unrelated IR and UV solar energy into usable electric energy). It is likely that windows possessing these useful properties offer substantial economic and environmental benefits and would rapidly be recognized and marketed globally. It is well-known that industrial solar and wind farms require allocation of sizeable land areas in order to generate significant power. Conventionally, the power generation capability of green-energy PV installations is limited by the available roof area, especially for tall buildings. Wall-mountable BIPV modules are starting to appear on the market, however, these mainly rely on thin-film photovoltaics of limited efficiency and also cannot provide high optical transparency or energy savings related to solar-control properties.</p><p>Solar energy contains strong IR radiation flux coming from direct, diffused, reflected and re-emitted radiation from illuminated surfaces. Therefore, by using high-efficiency photovoltaic solar cells, energy-harvesting windows can generate measurable electric power even in non-ideal illumination conditions.</p><p>The development of principally new BIPV systems capable of high transparency and energy saving simultaneous with energy harvesting will bring the future goal of achieving net zero energy consumption in buildings closer to reality. The Luminescent Solar Concentrator (LSC) technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> is currently being considered potentially suitable for engineering the PV windows of the future<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, even though ensuring the high transparency in high-efficiency concentrators remains problematic for reasons of IR-luminophore limited availability. Organic dye-based LSCs have been employed to concentrate sunlight re-emitted at wavelength bands efficient for power generation by PV cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. This type of concentrators commonly use dyes as luminescent organic species dispersed in optically clear polymer matrices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, it has been reported that when using organic dyes, the overlapping of absorption and emission bands reduces the concentration capabilities of LSC, which also contributes to their poor stability under long-term solar illumination exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Moreover, most of LSC technologies and demonstrator samples featuring PV conversion of light concentrated by planar structures reported in the literature to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, share the following major limitations that still prohibit product-level development of energy-harvesting windows and at the same time emphasize the need for further research in this field:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The concentrator-area scalability of all current LSC technologies is severely limited by the effects of re-absorption that reduce the propagation path-length of luminescence emissions within light-guiding structures; </p></list-item><list-item><p>No LSC structures reported so far in the literature were designed to enhance the visible transparency simultaneously with spectrally-selective harvesting of non-visible solar radiation using inorganic-only luminophores.

Concentrators of this type can be called “hybrid”, since luminescence effects play only a partial role in energy harvesting functionality, together with multiple scattering and diffraction enabled by embedding quasi-random disordered arrays of luminophore particles inside polymer interlayers. Despite its contributions to optical losses within the concentrator structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, multiple scattering effects can enhance light-trapping performance in planar-geometry structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Our approach to the development of transparent hybrid-type solar concentrators relies on the experimental optimization of electric energy output generated by the solar cells attached to the structure edges, by trialing a large number of luminescent material combinations. Some of these materials are presented in <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and some others cannot be disclosed due to the confidentiality agreements. Generally, these materials are capable of converting the non-visible solar energy into near-IR emissions. Different ways of distributing the luminescent powders geometrically within interlayers have been trialed, including varying the particle sizes, epoxy loading concentrations and layer thicknesses. Since a rather complex combination of several inter-related physical mechanisms and effects acting simultaneously was expected to lead (at least statistically) towards the increased IR illumination levels at sample edges, we chose to characterize the resulting structures' performance in terms of the actual energy harvesting output observed, in both the outdoor and solar-simulator experiments. Using PV cells attached to the sample edges was in this case the best practical way of detecting and measuring the total integrated contribution from all possible light redirection pathways present within the system structures, through measuring the electric output parameters such as open-circuit voltage (V<sub>oc</sub>) and short-circuit current (I<sub>sc</sub>). The relative contributions of different physical effects e.g. luminescence-assisted energy conversion versus multiple scattering or multiple diffraction events on powder particles is subject to our ongoing study.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Luminescent material types used for interlayer functionalization</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="justify"><p>Phosphor ID</p></th><th align="justify"><p>Luminophore composition type</p></th><th align="justify"><p>Excitation/Emission wavelength bands</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="2"><p>α</p></td><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> co-activated with several rare-earth ions and sensitized with Yb<sup>3+</sup>.</p></td><td align="left"><p><bold>Ex</bold>: mainly between 980 ± 40 nm</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p><bold>Em</bold>: 1000 ± 50 nm and some visible upconversion emissions excited by 980 ± 40 nm</p></td></tr><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="2"><p>β</p></td><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>YPO<sub>4</sub>:Nd</p></td><td align="left"><p><bold>Ex</bold>: 940–980 nm</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p><bold>Em</bold>: near 1060 nm</p></td></tr><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="2"><p>γ</p></td><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>(Zn, Cd)S:Cu</p></td><td align="left"><p><bold>Ex</bold>: 300–550 nm</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p><bold>Em</bold>: near 940 nm</p></td></tr><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="2"><p>δ</p></td><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>ZnS:(Ag, Tm)</p></td><td align="left"><p><bold>Ex</bold>: 300–430 nm</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p><bold>Em</bold>: near 795 nm</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>A thin film interference-coating was especially designed to achieve minimized transmission of UV and IR energy as well as fulfil durability requirements related to environmental-stability. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(c, d)</xref> shows the modelled and measured transmission and reflection spectra of a metal-dielectric thin film, which was developed using an e-beam/thermal evaporator.

Multiple coatings of this type were deposited onto glass substrates following the methods described in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Functionalized luminescent interlayers</title><p>To improve the light collection efficiency of light-trapping glass structures, we adopted an approach based on incorporating inorganic luminophore mixes into a transparent epoxy-based lamination layer, thus realizing a transparent, spectrally-selective, coating-assisted all-inorganic solar concentrator.</p><p>The selection of inorganic luminophore types for developing the interlayers as well as the optimization of powder particle sizes, concentrations and interlayer thicknesses were subject to application constraints imposed by our industry partner (Tropiglas Technologies Ltd). The principal requirements were related to ensuring a substantial visible-range sample transparency and clear, non-color-biased glass appearance. These requirements limited the selection of potential luminophores to inorganic substances possessing photoluminescence excitation ranges within either the UV or near-IR ranges, which could be ground into fine (of the order of 1 μm) particles and then incorporated effectively by either dissolution or ultrasound-assisted disperse suspension, into the interlayer host material (epoxy). The required transparency and visual clarity of the functionalised interlayers were the variables that primarily controlled the upper limits of powder concentrations and interlayer thicknesses used. Prior to undertaking the research activities described in this paper, we had evaluated the relative energy-collection performance of a large number of 20 × 20 × 6 mm samples of similar structure, which employed different inorganic luminophore mixes of various concentrations and layer thicknesses as well as some luminescent organic dyes (Lumogen F Red and others). After extensive experimentation with multiple high-performance commercial photoluminophore substances from a range of suppliers, we identified four inorganic compositions from three different manufacturers which, when used individually or mixed together in small concentrations (sub-1 wt% of each), led to substantial measured increases in the electric output from edge-mounted PV cells, when tested using a solar simulator beam directed at normal incidence (compared to a reference sample that did not contain luminophore materials within its epoxy-based interlayer). The beam of simulated sunlight was significantly smaller than the sample dimensions (2″diam. vs 100 mm size), therefore some effective photon redirection mechanism within the glass structure (e.g. luminescence, Mie scattering promoting the wavevector deflection, diffraction events occurring on powder particles, or a combination of these) was crucial for increasing the photon flux reaching the side-mounted PV cells, as was evidenced by the significant dependency of electric output parameters on the interlayer type and composition. All samples constructed had interlayer thicknesses below 3 mm, to ensure large visible transmission and good visual clarity, despite some noticeable scattering and diffused transmission effects. Here, we report on the empiric optimisation of the pre-selected functionalised interlayer compositions in 100 × 100 × 18 mm<sup>3</sup> clear glass samples to maximise the electric power output in PV cells attached to structure edges to detect and convert the optical power deflected towards the edges of glass structures. The effective path length of the luminescence excitation was difficult to evaluate, since the multi-pass propagation through the luminophore-loaded interlayer assisted by the multiple coating reflections and scattering events was engineered to occur within the structures.</p><p>Four different finely-ground luminophore powder types (described in <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were selected (based on their performance characteristics such as excitation and emission spectral bands and quantum efficiency), and, in order to optimize the performance of the proposed energy-harvesting clear glass panel structure, various mixes were used to construct a number of concentrator prototypes of different interlayer chemistries.</p><p>The luminophore powders and their mixes were primarily selected to enable improved energy harvesting performance by providing both the UV, short-wave visible and also near-IR wavelength regions for photoluminescence excitation and special care was also taken to place the emission wavelength regions inside the near-IR band, where the solar cells used had good responsivity and also within the high-reflectance regions of the spectrally-selective coating. The function of (Zn, Cd)S:Cu luminophore (γ) was to convert a fraction of light from (300–550) nm band into (840–1040) nm. The main feature of this material and also of luminophore δ, is related to the practical absence of overlapping between the excitation and emission wavelength bands, which effectively eliminates reabsorption-related energy losses.

The goal was to search for an optimized interlayer type and properties, so as to deflect most of the non-transmitted incident optical power towards sample edges more effectively. For example, the results showed (as was somewhat expected) that the ability to deflect more radiation towards edges correlated inversely with visible transmission of samples. It is important to note that only the spectrum of direct transmission was measured, however diffuse transmission was also significant in our samples, as was evident from their visual appearance as well as from their light diffusion properties as illustrated in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Light diffusion throughout the concentrator volume observed when illuminating a 200 × 200 mm<sup>2</sup> sample with a narrow (1–2 mm) collimated beam from a 532 nm laser source at normal incidence.</p><p>(a) Diffused light rays reaching the sample's edge; (b) circular fringes of Young type observed within the diffraction halo formed across the glass panel surface originate from the interference of multiple scattered and diffracted rays propagating inside glass panel structure which contains a lamination interlayer loaded with a quasi-random distribution of luminophore particles.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep06632_Fig3_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>As an example, the functionalized interlayer of sample <italic>C</italic> was made by mixing two luminophore powders α and β the excitation bands of which overlapped significantly which, in conjunction with a relatively large scattering observed in all samples containing powder β, resulted in a relatively weak light collection performance. The optimization of light scattering intensity and the related light diffusion effects on the light collection efficiency and samples transmission was made only empirically in our experiments, since multiple factors affecting concentrator performance (from the varying solubilities of various powders in polymer materials to the final particle or agglomerate size ranges available from grinding and homogenization processes) could not be realistically predicted computationally.

Luminophore γ dissolved fairly well into our epoxies, had a rather small mean particle size of about 1 μm and did not cause significant scattering at concentrations not exceeding about 0.05 wt%. The addition of other luminophores to the same sample increased scattering and decreased direct transmission in the visible range, while increasing the diffused transmission component.

For concentrator systems designed to provide significant spectral selectivity and thus spectrally separating the energy-harvesting wavelength bands from the enhanced-transmission bands, the definition of flux gain can be adjusted to account for the limited spectral bandwidth available for radiation routing and flux concentration.

This definition emphasizes the capability of the samples to deflect the energy available, accounting for the effects of transmission, scattering and absorption which limit the possible energy flux available for trapping or re-direction within the structure of the samples and interlayers.

The “peak” conditions were observed typically for horizontal-plane sample orientation angles near the 45° flux incidence condition with respect to the Sun azimuth direction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the extensive support for this research provided by the Australian Research Council (ARC Linkage grant LP130100130), Tropiglas Technologies Ltd, Edith Cowan University and the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission in Australia and Taif University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>The authors contributed equally to the review of research results and to the final presentation of this manuscript. The manufacture of solar energy harvesting glass samples included several preparation stages and component integration. The authors' contributions varied slightly during each of the stages. The design of thin film coating and running the deposition processes was mainly accomplished by R.A., M.V. and M.N. M.V. and M.N. designed the electrical interconnections circuitry and performed the integration of solar modules. All four authors (R.A., M.V., K.A. and M.N.) worked on selecting the luminophore chemistries suitable for use in functionalised lamination interlayers and contributed to the fine-tuning of glass panels lamination processes. All authors participated in the design of both the indoor and outdoor solar energy harvesting performance characterisation experiments. The final data analysis was accomplished by R.A. and M.V. The figures and images included in the manuscript were generated throughout the research program and all authors contributed actively to their contents. The research progress and the results achieved at each stage were supervised by K.A. from the intial stages; M.N. and K.A. reviewed the manuscipt after it had been written by R.A. and M.V., after which all authors again contrubuted to producing the final manuscript version.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare no competing financial interests.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Green, M.
