The resulting devices, termed microbial fuel cells (MFCs), have several potential advantages over more prominent sustainable energy technologies such as solar or wind power. For example, they can directly convert organic waste into electricity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] without pollution or inefficient intermediate steps that involve mechanical generators. This feature, energy recovery from solid wastes, has been exploited in proposed national strategies for many Asian countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It may be possible to achieve the same goal by inorganic catalysts or enzymes, but using living cells makes it possible to exploit their adaptability to environmental conditions and avoids the high capital cost of installation for other waste-to-energy systems reviewed by Eddine and Salah [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The whole organisms used in MFCs contain various enzymes and therefore allow different substrates (or mixed substrates) to be used. The organisms in the fuel cell system can be considered as micro-reactors and provide optimal conditions for different enzymes. Because the organisms are self-replicating, the organic matter oxidation implemented by these bio-catalysts are self-sustaining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and not subject to catalytic poisoning like metallic catalysts or degradation of enzyme catalysts. By selecting photosynthetic microbes, solar energy could be converted at the same time. One can envisage portable electronics powered by MFCs that are ‘charged’ by feeding them nutrients rather than electric current, or medical implants that derive their power directly from nutrients circulating in the bloodstream. Perhaps the process can be reversed, and external electrical power supplied to an MFC converted into biomass, as a temporary storage, to overcome the intermittent nature of many other sustainable energy sources - a possibility currently under serious consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>However, these future possibilities are still severely hampered by the low energy yields per mass or volume that are currently achieved. Generally MFC energy output is reported in milliwatts per square metre of electrode area or per cubic metre of electrolyte volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Scientific research has increased the densities of MFCs to over 1 kW m<sup>−3</sup> (reactor volume) and to 6.9 W m<sup>−2</sup> (anode area) under optimal conditions in the laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, these values still cannot meet the needs of many applications, which require a power output larger than 100 kW m<sup>−2</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For this reason large-scale waste water treatment is the application closest to industrial realisation and is the domain of much current MFC research.</p><p>A variety of designs are under development to improve the efficiency and potential application of MFCs to industry. Areas under investigation include the selection of electrode materials for optimal electrochemical performance and maximising electrode surface to volume ratios; improving charge transfer between microbes and electrodes either chemically or by mechanical design; and finding and maintaining optimal living conditions for microbe colonies, efficient supply of nutrients and removal of effluent. Different configurations are being investigated for extracting current, sometimes in combination with production of hydrogen or other metabolites of further use in energy generation and with or without exploitation of photosynthesis. The choice of process configuration and engineering design is also closely linked with the selection of the most suitable organism for a particular design or for whether overall priority is given to energy generation, waste disposal or some other objective.</p><p>A schematic representation of MFC research activity is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. While there is a large volume of biochemical research literature on, for example, electron transfer chains and redox processes in cell metabolism that is relevant to MFC, relatively few studies focus specifically on MFC. This is exacerbated by the fact that ongoing research continues to identify new mechanisms for electron exchange between microbes and electrodes, new design strategies to exploit these and consequently new candidate organisms. Such organisms have not necessarily been well studied experimentally before.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Areas covered in current microbial fuel cell research.</bold></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40095_2012_Article_50_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p><italic>In silico</italic> modelling is well suited to bridge this gap and extend knowledge in the biochemical interface between MFC biology and engineering design. Externally, electron flow (in the external circuit) and the counterflow of protons in the electrolyte make up the current that carries useful electrical power. Internally, both of these are comprehensively woven into the fabric of metabolism: electrons being transported by redox carrier molecules such as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) that participate in a large fraction of all biochemical reactions, and protons that, for example, drive adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis needed for energy transport are also ubiquitously involved in a great many reactions. This clearly calls for a systems-level approach rather than the reductionist strategy of pathway-oriented, conventional biochemistry.</p><p>This is the domain of systems biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Systems biology provides <italic>in silico</italic> models that incorporate biological data, metabolic flux data and different physico-chemical constraints such as the conservation of mass and energy, thermodynamics, redox balance, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and thus provides an opportunity to identify the bottlenecks hidden in a complex network of interactions and cellular compartmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The kinetic behaviour of a metabolic network at a whole-genome level can be constructed and analysed through a mathematical model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, the characterization of metabolic networks is still far from comprehensive in databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and even in the best-understood organisms, the majority of kinetic parameters are undetermined.</p><p>The development of new computational methods allows for the whole-network modelling of metabolism and conduction of compelling and testable predictions even without many parameters. The key idea is to incorporate stoichiometry and other fundamental principles as mathematical constraints, which separate feasible and infeasible metabolic behaviours. Compared with kinetic parameters, these constraints are much easier to identify and make it possible to build a large-scale model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These constraint-based modelling approaches allow integration of high-throughput post-genomic data but describe steady states and generally offer no information about metabolite concentrations or the temporal dynamics of the system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Genome-scale metabolic modelling requires high-quality metabolic network reconstructions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The reconstructions are based on sequenced genomes and are generally built manually using information from metabolic databases (e.g. KEGG and BRENDA) and primary literature. The metabolic network reconstruction process is described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Recently, due to the development of the high-throughput technologies, the reconstructions have now been built for various organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Flux analysis can be combined with cell biology and sub-cellular biochemistry to reveal the functionality and efficiency of the enzymes associated with cell biological components or structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Metabolic regulation can be deeply understood only when multiple system components are examined simultaneously. This kind of analysis has been conducted in microbial and medical research in recent years.</p><p>Flux determinations can produce results that are hardly predictable from observed changes in transcript or protein levels because most of metabolic control takes place at post-translational levels and enzyme activities are often not correlated with changes in transcript or protein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The incorporation of data from enzyme platforms should make the functionality of genomics strategies more clear. System-wide metabolic flux characterization is an important part of metabolic engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, there is no published literature that uses genome-scale flux models to study the metabolic behaviour of biocatalysts in MFCs. The only attempt to use a genome-scale model to study biocatalyst behaviour in an MFC was presented as a conference abstract paper in the 17th European Symposium on Computer Aided Process Engineering (2007) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, this paper is an immature work that did not provide the source of the central metabolic network, describe the gene knockout methodology or discuss the results in relation to other MFC experimental work. Therefore, future research activities are urgently needed to fill the research gap indicated in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, with recently advanced constraint-based modelling approaches.</p><p>An essential first step in applying constraint-based analysis to microbial fuel cells is to choose appropriate organisms for further study. Due to the varied strategies and designs alluded to above, no single organism can serve as a suitable model, and a major advantage of <italic>in silico</italic> modelling is that different organisms can be studied in the same framework to facilitate mutual comparisons. This paper reviews the background against which such choices can be made and proposes a set of four organisms for the purpose.</p><p>The ‘Microbial fuel cells’ section explains the construction, operation and classification of current MFC designs, and the ‘Current directions of MFC research’ section reviews the issues being addressed in current MFC research. Based on this, the ‘Microorganisms for <italic>in silico</italic> study of MFC functioning’ section discusses a selection of organisms that are representative of various combinations of biological aspects that can be exploited in MFCs, while also featuring well-established metabolic network reconstructions, suitable for the computational analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Microbial fuel cells</title><p>MFCs are unique devices that can use microorganisms as catalysts for transforming chemical energy directly into electricity. The biggest advantage of an MFC is that it can generate combustion-less, pollution-free bioelectricity directly from the organic matter in biomass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In an MFC the energy stored in chemical bonds in organic compounds is converted to electrical energy through enzymatic reactions by microorganisms. Thus, the electricity production by MFC is associated with the normal living processes of bacteria capturing and processing energy.</p><p>In a typical MFC configuration (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), microorganisms are situated in the anodic compartment and use the biomass for growth while forming electrons and protons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The electrons are transported out of cells to an electrode using redox mediators or directly expelled by some microorganisms for reducing the substrate. The protons or H<sup>+</sup> ions are diffused through the electrolyte to the cathode where it is oxidised to water. The cathode can be in a separate chamber (i.e. double-chambered MFCs) or in the same chamber (i.e. single-chambered MFCs). A single-chambered MFC eliminates the need for the cathodic chamber by exposing the cathode directly to the air. The only by-product released by MFCs is carbon dioxide, which can be fixed by plants for photosynthesis.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>The working principle of a microbial fuel cell.</bold> (<bold>A</bold>) A bacterium in the anode compartment transfers electrons obtained from an electron donor (glucose or light in the case of photosynthetic organisms) to the anode electrode. Protons are also produced in excess during electron production. These protons flow through the proton exchange membrane (PEM) into the cathode chamber. The electrons flow from the anode through an external resistance (or load) to the cathode where they react with the final electron acceptor (oxygen) and protons. (<bold>B</bold>) Three electron transfer modes: (1) directly via membrane-associated components (DET), (2) mediated by soluble electron shuttles (MET) or (3) primary product (Product), e.g. H<sub>2</sub> can act as a fuel to be oxidised to provide electrons for the electricity circuit.

Thus, factors affecting the MFC's efficiency include electrode material, pH buffer and electrolyte, proton exchange system and operating conditions in both the anodic chamber and the cathodic chamber. MFCs are usually operated at ambient temperature, at atmospheric pressure and at pH conditions that are neutral or only slightly acidic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>MFCs harness the electrons from these systems in three main operation modes: mediated electron transfer (MET), direct electron transfer (DET) and product mode.

For example, multi-heme proteins have especially evolved in sediment-inhabiting metal-reducing microorganisms such as <italic>Geobacter</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], <italic>Rhodoferax</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and <italic>Shewanella</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

The DET via outer membrane cytochromes requires the cytochrome (the bacterial cell) to be physically adhered to the fuel cell anode. When a biofilm is formed, only bacteria in the first monolayer at the anode surface are electrochemically active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Thus, the maximum cell density in this bacterial monolayer usually influences the MFC performance. However, it has been shown that some <italic>Geobacter</italic> and the <italic>Shewanella</italic> strains can evolve electronically conducting molecular pili (nanowires of 2 to 3 μm long, made of fibrous protein structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]) that make the microorganism able to reach and use more distant solid electron acceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The pili are connected to the membrane-bound cytochromes and allow transference of the electrons to the distant electron acceptors without cellular contact (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). Thus, thicker electroactive biofilms can be formed to increase anode performance. It was shown that fuel cell performance can be increased up to tenfold upon nanowire formation of <italic>Geobacter sulfurreducens</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Product type</title><p>In product-type MFCs, microbes metabolize the substrate, releasing a secondary fuel product such as hydrogen that then diffuses to the electrode and is oxidised or reduced (as appropriate) to form a final waste product, which is discharged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The product operation is similar to conventional fermentation processes, in that products of the microbial metabolism are used as the fuel at the electrode.</p><p>The product system is made up of two independent stages: one is storage of the microbial reaction product, and the other one is the product being fed to a conventional fuel cell process driven by non-biological catalysis, such as in the case of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell, where H<sub>2</sub> is converted into electricity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These stages may also be physically separated in different containment vessels. However, a product system only truly belongs to a biofuel cell system when the microbes and the electrode are together in the same anode compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

Moreover, the coulombic efficiencies were found to be low (&lt;6%), when calculated based on the incomplete oxidation of lactate to acetate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>].</p><p>Conversely, <italic>G. sulfurreducens</italic> can effectively oxidise acetate with electron transfer to electrodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>] and convert acetate to current with coulombic efficiencies of more than 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>]. <italic>G. sulfurreducens</italic> is an anaerobe that can withstand low levels of oxygen and may use oxygen as an electron acceptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>]. It has recently been shown that with a new configuration, MFCs based on <italic>G. sulfurreducens</italic> can become 100% aerobic, allowing for floating and/or untethered applications. At the same time, the performance of the MFCs is similar to their anaerobic/aerobic counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>]. It is expected that with this aerobic configuration, power could be produced in a <italic>G. sulfurreducens</italic> MFC suspended in aerobic seawater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Electricity generation in MFCs is based on the metabolic activity of living microorganisms at the anode. The selection of microorganisms is based on many criteria, but the power output, electron transfer ability and biological functions such as photosynthesis and hydrogen production are particularly important. These important properties, in different combinations, are exemplified by the four representative microorganisms discussed above, and their referential facts for modelling are compared in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Studying these individually, and in combination, should reveal significant insights in the quest for higher power output MFCs.</p><p>Most MFC researchers have been active in engineering designs, i.e. how to create scalable and economical architectures and engineer more efficient hardware and how different microbes interact with the anodes/cathodes when transporting electrons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. Such research covers optimizing anodic conditions, housing constructs and component materials, learning more about microbial community ecology and isolating vigorous biocatalysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Biological aspects of MFCs have also received some attention, such as the anodic activity of different organisms. However, very little research has been done on the biochemical interface between the engineering design and the biological aspects (see Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that future studies are required to work on that interface, i.e. how to enhance the anodic activity by means of adjusting the metabolic activity of biocatalysts, for example, utilizing metabolic network analysis. The genome-scale metabolic networks are quite new concepts and have only been produced in the last few years. The analysis of the metabolic network through modelling approaches, such as flux balance analysis, plays an important role in filling the gap between genotypes and phenotypes of microorganisms to provide a full picture of the biological system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Endnote</title><p><sup>a</sup>Representative microorganisms chosen by this article and discussed in the ‘Microorganisms for <italic>in silico</italic> study of MFC functioning’ section.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Authors' information</title><p>LM is a PhD candidate in the Department of Wine, Food and Molecular Biosciences, Lincoln University.
