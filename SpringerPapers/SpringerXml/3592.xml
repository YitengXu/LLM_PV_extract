sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">The discovery of the first laser in 1960<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> has opened up a wide variety of applications, ranging from fundamental usages, such as scientific optical excitation and photolithography, to industrial laser cutting, drilling, military applications, medical imaging and surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Compared to their inorganic counterparts, organic lasers offer many advantages such as compact size, high mechanical flexibility, high transparency and high wavelength tunability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Moreover, among organic laser dyes, solution-processable dyes offer additional advantages of employing low-cost and large-area manufacturing techniques such as spin-coating or ink-jet printing in device fabrication.</p><p id="Par4">So far, all organic lasers require a secondary excitation source such as gas lasers, inorganic solid-state lasers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> or light-emitting diodes (LEDs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> for optical excitation. Direct electrical excitation of organic lasers, however, is significantly more challenging. While, very recently, Sandanayaka et al. demonstrated current-driven organic semiconductor laser diodes (OSLDs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, the current threshold is still extremely high with a value of around 1000 A cm<sup>−2</sup>. This high current density inevitably creates a major issue for OSLDs, that is high accumulation of triplet excitons, leading to significant losses such as triplet absorption, singlet–triplet annihilation (STA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> and triplet-polaron annihilation (TPA). Given that in optical excitation there is only a small fraction of triplets converted from singlets via intersystem crossing, it is important to note that in electrical excitation, 75% of excitons generated are triplets according to spin statistics. This means that the large proportion of the non-emissive triplet excited-state together with its significantly long lifetime (often in microsecond range) leads to fast triplet accumulation in electrical excitation, compared to singlet excited-state (in ns range). These non-emissive triplet excited-states bring about above-mentioned losses, including the related stability issues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. As a result, lasing thresholds under electrical excitation are significantly higher than those under optical excitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Therefore, the ability to manage the non-emissive triplet states is crucial for the improvement of OSLDs.</p><p id="Par5">Intelligent approaches to reducing the triplet excited-state population have been reported by using different triplet excited-state quenchers (TSQs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Among these TSQs, the most efficient quenchers are oxygen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, anthracene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and cyclooctatetraene (COT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, all of these TSQs have their respective limitations that render them incompatible for OSLDs. Specifically, due to the unique triplet ground state, molecular oxygen is easily converted into reactive singlet oxygen species, which is detrimental to the active organic semiconductor materials in the devices due to photo-oxidation and photodegradation, in addition to the undesired singlet quenching<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Anthracene and its derivatives are known to have relatively long triplet excited-state lifetimes (≈20 ms)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, where accumulation of triplets on the anthracene molecules is the key issue and source of another triplet accumulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In contrast, COT has been highlighted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> as a more promising TSQ candidate thanks to its considerably shorter triplet excited-state lifetime (100 µs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> and low triplet energy without oxidising organic laser dyes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, at ambient conditions, COT is a liquid (with a melting point of around −5 to −3 °C) and volatile. Hence, it has only been demonstrated for liquid-state organic dye lasers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> as well as polyfluorene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> but has not been compatible with thin-film devices and applications for real potential.</p><p id="Par6">In this work, we designed and synthesised a solid-state organic TSQ based on COT, i.e., mCP-COT, in which mCP (i.e., <italic>N,N</italic>′-dicarbazolyl-3,5-benzene) is a common host with a high singlet and triplet energy, widely used in OLEDs. To maintain the individual electronic properties of mCP and COT, it is essential that a non-conjugated linker is employed. For mCP-COT to achieve a high solubility in common organic solvents for solution processing, without adversely affecting its thermal property, an <italic>n</italic>-hexyl linker was chosen for our initial study. We further used BSBCz-EH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, which is a solution-processable version of state-of-the-art organic semiconductor BSBCz dye, to investigate its photophysical behaviours, ASE characteristics and photoluminescence (PL) stability. Notably, negligible effects on the film PLQYs and ASE thresholds of BSBCz-EH were found when blended with (equal or &lt;20 wt%) mCP-COT. Under continuous-wave (CW) excitation, exceptionally efficient suppression of STA was achieved, attaining over 20-fold increase in PL stability compared to BSBCz-EH without mCP-COT. By using small-area OLED architectures, we demonstrated efficient STA suppression in ns range under electrical excitation. To provide more insights into the observed STA quenching of mCP-COT under electrical excitation, we conducted theoretical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a non-emissive solid-state triplet quencher, exhibiting distinguished triplet quenching ability under both optical and electrical excitations, coupled with excellent solution processability.

High thermal stability with a 5% weight loss temperature at 408 °C (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) was found, which is much higher than that (280 °C) of simple mCP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

In contrast to the parent liquid form of COT at ambient conditions, mCP-COT is a solid with a melting point (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) of 73 °C. Coupled with the high thermal properties, the results show our integration of COT with mCP enabling the material to become a solid at room temperature, which is of use for thin-film devices and applications. The electrochemical properties of mCP-COT were probed by using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) to show its redox behaviours arisen from the COT and carbazole species, respectively, which can be attributed to the non-conjugated linkage of the two electroactive species with different electronic properties.

Coupled with the fact that COT has low molar extinction coefficient (with essential zero oscillator strength, see below TD-DFT calculations), the low energy absorption of mCP-COT peaked at 339 nm can be assigned as π→π* transition from the mCP moiety. While no PL was observed for COT, mCP-COT showed weak PL with a solution photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 6 ± 3% (in toluene). In essence, mCP-COT shares a similar PL spectrum to mCP with PL peaks at 344 and 343 nm, respectively, indicating the similar emission species due to the non-conjugation of the emissive mCP and non-emissive COT in the molecule. The considerable reduction in the solution PLQY of mCP-COT than that (43 ± 3%) of mCP can be attributed to the quenching by the COT moiety attached since it has lower singlet and triplet energies than the mCP unit—see the theoretical calculation section below. Such PL quenching is consistent with a much shorter excited-state lifetime of 1.5 ns for mCP-COT, as determined by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) with a 3rd order fitting (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>), compared to that (5.3 ns in toluene) of mCP. Moreover, the phosphorescence of mCP-COT was significantly reduced (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), compared to mCP from our low-temperature PL measurements, indicating efficient triplet quenching by the COT component.</p><p id="Par11">In order to gain further evidence of triplet quenching, we performed nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) for mCP and mCP-COT in acetonitrile. In ambient conditions, mCP showed long-lived excited-state absorption band with maximum at 400 nm (decay lifetime of 52 ns) and broad short-lived excited-state feature with maximum at 617 nm (bi-exponential lifetime of 5.8 and 51 ns) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a, b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6a</xref>). Herein, the decay kinetics of the short-lived absorption band (5.8 ns) were found to match closely with the singlet emission decay obtained from TCSPC (see Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>) measurements (5.3 ns) suggesting this transient absorption band arises due to the singlet excited-state absorption. In order to get further insights into the long-lived feature (<italic>τ</italic> ≈ 50 ns) we performed TAS for mCP under deoxygenated conditions. For deoxygenated solution (degassed using a freeze-pump-thaw method), the lifetime of the long-lived feature increased by more than two orders of magnitude (<italic>τ</italic> ≈ 32 µs) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c, d</xref>, and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6b</xref>), suggesting this transient absorption band arises due to the triplet excited-states that were otherwise quenched by molecular oxygen under ambient conditions. In case of a deoxygenated mCP-COT solution, similar singlet and triplet excited-state absorption bands were observed. The decay lifetime of singlet excited-state absorption band was found to be 0.9 and 7.3 ns which is similar to the singlet emission lifetime obtained in the TCSPC measurements (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). Furthermore, triplet excited-state absorption decay of the mCP moiety at 400 nm was found to be significantly quenched (<italic>τ</italic> ≈ 26 ns) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e, f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6c</xref>). The shortened decay lifetime of mCP’s triplet excited-state absorption in mCP-COT suggests ultrafast transfer of triplet excitons from the mCP unit to the COT moiety, though due to the low triplet energy level of COT, we could not observe the transient absorption band arising from the COT moiety alone.

To get insights into these, we performed theoretical calculations and found that mCP-COT has two triplet energy levels, behaving like a non-vertical triplet quencher of COT. At ground state, the optimised structure of the COT moiety in mCP-COT was a non-planar tub-shaped conformation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref> and Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). It is important to note that the vertical excited-state energies for the first singlet (S<sub>1</sub>-ver, 3.88 eV) and triplet (T<sub>1</sub>-ver, 3.15 eV) of mCP are higher than those (3.27 and 2.22 eV, respectively) of COT. Hence, the S<sub>2</sub>-ver (3.89 eV) of mCP-COT corresponds to the S<sub>1</sub>-ver of mCP, and the S<sub>1</sub>-ver (3.32 eV) and T<sub>1</sub>-ver (2.28 eV) of mCP-COT were nearly the same as those of COT, where the S<sub>2</sub>-ver and S<sub>1</sub>-ver transitions of mCP-COT are mainly populated over mCP moiety [HOMO → LUMO + 1 (57%)] and COT moiety [HOMO−2 → LUMO (100%)], respectively (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). However, the S<sub>1</sub>-ver of COT is forbidden (with an oscillator strength of 0, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>), which agrees with its absorption spectrum, appearing at shorter wavelength than mCP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). On the other hand, the S<sub>1</sub>-ver of mCP-COT appears to be an allowed transition because of the slight spreading of its MOs over the alkyl linker—see the MO distributions of its HOMO−2 and LUMO in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>, which might be related to the decrease in PLQY for the doped films (vide infra). The structure relaxation with planarisation in the excited-states resulted in a significant decrease of the energies (see S<sub>1</sub>-adi and T<sub>1</sub>-adi for the adiabatic excitation), and the triplet quenching by COT is known to include non-vertical triplet energy transfer with conformational changes. Although the S<sub>1</sub>-adi and T<sub>1</sub>-adi energies were slightly different for COT and mCP-COT, it is considered that mCP-COT can also effectively quench triplet excitons with the same mechanism because of its low T<sub>1</sub>-adi energy.</p><p id="Par13">In contrast to simple mCP, mCP-COT was found to exhibit excellent solubility in common organic solvents, allowing for good-quality thin-film formation while using solution process, which is desirable to progress toward low-cost and room-temperature device fabrication by using techniques such as spin-coating or ink-jet printing. Consequently, a solution-processable version of the state-of-the-art organic semiconductor BSBCz dye<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, BSBCz-EH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> (see the chemical structure in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8a</xref>), was chosen as the active organic semiconductor laser dye for our mCP-COT triplet quenching studies.</p><p id="Par14">Steady-state neat and blend-film absorption and PL spectra of BSBCz-EH with various mCP-COT blend concentrations (i.e., 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 90 wt%) are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>. The absorption and PL maxima are nearly constant, suggesting no particular interactions in the excited-states of BSBCz-EH. We further determined PLQYs of these films and summarised the trend in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>. High PLQY values of ≈70% were retained for the neat and blend films of BSBCz-EH with up to 20 wt% mCP-COT using excitation wavelength of 380 nm, where only BSBCz-EH was excited. Higher mCP-COT blend concentrations gradually decreased the blend-film PLQYs to 53 and 34% (for the 50 wt% and 90 wt% blends, respectively). Since blend films of BSBCz-EH in common hosts such as CBP showed high PLQYs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, the decrease of blend-film PLQYs of BSBCz-EH with mCP-COT can, therefore, be ascribed to the quenching by the COT moiety. However, the quenching seems to be not efficient at moderately high PLQYs even with high COT concentrations (i.e., BSBCz-EH:COT = 1:17 mol/mol in the blend film of BSBCz-EH with 90 wt% mCP-COT), probably due to complicated energy transfer processes. It is interesting to note that the decrease in PLQYs with increasing mCP-COT concentration is dependent on the singlet/triplet energy of the emitter. Thus, the higher the singlet/triplet energy of the emitter, the sharper the decrease in PLQYs with increasing mCP-COT concentrations as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref> for CBP (<italic>S</italic><sub>1</sub> = 3.5 eV, most quenching), BSBCz-EH (<italic>S</italic><sub>1</sub> = 2.9 eV) and BSBCz-CN-EH (<italic>S</italic><sub>1</sub> = 2.6 eV, least quenching).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Triplet quenching studies under optical excitation</title><p id="Par15">First, the PL transient responses of encapsulated BSBCz-EH neat and blend films with different mCP-COT blend concentrations (5, 10 and 20 wt%) as well as a blend film with 20 wt% mCP were investigated. These spin-coated thin films were excited at 355 nm using a circular beam with a diameter of 200 µm. The excitation power, pulse width and pulse interval of the laser beam were 2.65 mW, 200 µs, and 10 ms, respectively. All obtained PL spectra were normalised at their initial PL intensities as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. A significant decrease in transient PL intensity under CW excitation for BSBCz-EH neat and the blend films (with 20 wt% mCP) can be clearly observed. The initial PL intensities of both films were reduced by ≈25% under a pulse width of 200 µs. These reductions can be attributed to quenching of the emissive singlet excitons [i.e., singlet–triplet annihilation (STA)] due to accumulation of the long-lived triplet excited-state generated via intersystem crossing. In contrast, almost completely no reduction in the PL intensity for the blend films of mCP-COT was observed, regardless of blend concentrations, indicating absolute suppression of STA, which in turns advocates the exceptional triplet quenching ability of mCP-COT. While partial STA suppression under CW excitation had previously been reported using an anthracene derivative (i.e., ADN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, we noted that these films were vacuum-deposited and that significantly higher blending concentration of the triplet quencher ADN was required while the extent of STA reductions were not as effective. A comparative analysis of the triplet quenching performance of ADN and mCP-COT was conducted to show the relative drop in the initial STA in these two systems (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). These results support the superior triplet management properties of mCP-COT, since at the 10 wt% concentration mCP-COT removes over 98% STA present originally in the neat system, while the same concentration of ADN results in ≈25% reduction of STA (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>).

To realise STA quenching, OLEDs with a small area are required (≪1 mm<sup>2</sup>) to limit the resistor-capacitor (RC) constant of the devices, as small RC constant allows rapid response (in ns) of the devices to be detected. In contrast, a device with pixel area of several mm<sup>2</sup>, where the EL signal evolves slower in time due to larger capacitance, results in loss of STA quenching visibility in the EL signal. We used BSBCz-EH with mCP-COT blend to realise OLEDs for testing STA quenching and compared with a neat BSBCz-EH OLED device.</p><p id="Par19">Accordingly, the structure of small-area OLEDs studied was ITO (100 nm)/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/BSBCz-EH (neat or with 2 wt% mCP-COT) (60 nm)/TPBi (40 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm), where ITO is Indium tin oxide, PEDOT:PSS is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) and TPBi is 1,3,5-tris(2-<italic>N</italic>-phenylbenzimidazolyl)benzene. The device area of OLEDs was 0.2 mm<sup>2</sup>. To achieve high current densities and high luminance, a fundamental requirement for injection lasing, the small-area OLEDs were subjected to pulse widths of 100 ns at voltages varying from 20 to 100 V, where the nanosecond pulse widths also enable limitation of the Joule heating.</p><p id="Par20">Once the nanosecond pulse was applied to the small-area OLEDs, EL signals were generated in the organic emissive layer with a delay resulting from the time needed for holes and electrons to form excitons. Singlet excitons are short-lived and usually have a lifetime of few ns for fluorescent emitters (e.g., 1.4 and 1.5 ns for neat BSBCz-EH and blend BSBCZ-EH with 1 wt% COT, respectively), whereas triplets are slower to reach maximum concentration but are generally orders of magnitude higher in density than singlets due to the longer lifetimes. These non-radiative triplets annihilate singlets causing STA, resulting in higher energy triplets and charge carriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The evidence of STA can be seen in an EL waveform as a reduction in EL intensity after the initial EL peak within tens of nanoseconds.

Photophysical, thermal and electronic properties of the compound were reported, showing the integration of COT onto mCP enables mCP-COT to be a solid at room temperature with a high decomposition temperature, useful for thin-film devices and applications. The triplet quenching ability of mCP-COT as an additive was investigated using the solution-processable dye BSBCz-EH under both optical and electrical excitations. Under CW photoexcitation, even small blending concentrations of mCP-COT (equal or less than 20 wt%) showed unprecedented STA suppression. Moreover, over 20-fold improvement in PL stability of BSBCz-EH was found by blending with mCP-COT. Notably, negligible impact on the ASE characteristics of the dye BSBCz-EH was observed as comparable ASE threshold values were measured for the blend films compared to the neat films of BSBCz-EH. Remarkably, the dynamics of STA suppression under electrical excitation in ns regime were demonstrated by employing small-area OLED structures. Compared to a BSBCz-EH neat film, a 2 wt% blend of mCP-COT resulted in a substantial reduction of STA observed in the EL-current density curve, coupled with an increase in EL intensity and brightness, comparable EQE maximum, as well as a reduction in EQE roll-off. In addition, theoretical simulations were conducted to provide insights into the observed STA quenching of mCP-COT under electrical excitation. This is the first report of a non-emissive solid-state triplet quencher, exhibiting excellent triplet quenching ability under both optical and electrical excitation, coupled with excellent solution processability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>General</title><p id="Par25">All commercial reagents and chemicals were used as received unless otherwise noted.

Thin films were fabricated by spin-coating from a chlorobenzene solution of 1.0 wt% fluorescent dyes and mCP-COT at 1000 rpm for 60 s on clean quartz substrates. UV–Vis absorption spectra were measured using Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950-PKA UV–vis spectrophotometer. Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using Horiba Jobin Yvon FluoromMax-4. PLQYs were measured using an absolute PLQY measurement system (Hamamatsu Photonics Quantaurus-QY C11347-01). The measurement error for the obtained QY values on this instrument was ±3%. Transient photoluminescence decay was recorded on a Hamamatsu Photonics Quantaurus-Tau C11367-03.

Molecular orbital calculations were performed using the programs Gaussian 16. The geometries for the ground state were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level. The presence of energy minima was confirmed by the absence of imaginary modes (no imaginary frequencies). The time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were conducted at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level. To numerically achieve accurate values, we have used a fine grid. The solvation effect in a solvent was considered by using the polarizable continuum model (PCM). Since the optimization at the excited-states for COT and mCP-COT using TD-DFT resulted in convergence failures, TD-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)//CIS/6-31+G(d,p) was used, while the optimization at the excited-states of mCP was conducted using TD-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p).

The laser pulses were coupled to an OPA system (Topas Prime, Light Conversion) to generate “pump” pulses tuned at 330 nm. The samples were prepared by dissolving mCP/mCP-COT in acetonitrile to achieve an optical density of 0.4 at 330 nm in quartz cuvette with the optical path length of 2 mm. A white light continuum ‘probe’ (ca. 380–900 nm) was generated using a pulsed Nd:YAG based Leukos-STM super continuum light source. The timing of the ‘probe’ pulses was controlled electronically via the sync trigger from the amplified laser system. The sample solutions were stirred continuously to avoid any degradation during the measurements; absorption spectra were measured before and after the measurements to confirm no degradation due to the pump beam.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Australian Research Council (ARC DP160100700 and DP200103036), Department of Industry, Innovation and Science (AISRF53765), JST ERATO Grant Number JPMJER1305, JSPS KAKENHI Grant Number JP19H02790, and JSPS Core-to-Core programme for financial support.
