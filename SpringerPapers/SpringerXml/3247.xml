Geospatial technology approaches that integrate statistical data, spatial models, earth observation satellite data, and climate modeling can be used to conduct strategic analyses for understanding the potential and efficiency of renewable energy development. This study aims to create the first spatial model of its kind in Southeast Asia to develop multi-renewable energy from solar, wind, and hydropower, further broken down into residential and agricultural areas. The novelty of this study is the development of a new priority model for renewable energy development resulting from the integration of area suitability analysis and the estimation of the amount of potential energy. Areas with high potential power estimations for the combination of the three types of energy are mostly located in northern Southeast Asia. Areas close to the equator, have a lower potential than the northern countries, except for southern regions. Solar photovoltaic (PV) plant construction is the most area-intensive type of energy generation among the considered energy sources, requiring 143,901,600 ha (61.71%), followed by wind (39,618,300 ha; 16.98%); a combination of solar PV and wind (37,302,500 ha; 16%); hydro (7,665,200 ha; 3.28%); a combination of hydro and solar PV (3,792,500 ha; 1.62%); and a combination of hydro and wind (582,700 ha; 0.25%). This study is timely and important because it will inform policies and regional strategies for transitioning to renewable energy, with consideration of the different characteristics present in Southeast Asia.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Capacity Building Research Program for ITB Young Scientists by the Institute of Research and Community Service Institut Teknologi Bandung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sakti</surname><given-names>Anjar Dimara</given-names></name><name><surname>Hadi</surname><given-names>Pradita Octoviandiningrum</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>340</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2022_Article_25570.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Under Sustainable Development Goal 7, many countries have agreed to increase and distribute renewable energy sources, which made up only 11% of the total global energy supply in 2020<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. With the global energy demand expected to increase by 50% between 2018 and 2050, strategies to increase the number of renewable energy sources to meet future energy demands have become more important than ever. Countries in Southeast Asia have been experiencing rapid economic and demographic growth over the last few decades, which has led to soaring energy needs. Unfortunately, fossil fuels account for more than half of the region's energy supply<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Southeast Asian countries have committed to target a 23% increase in renewable energy by 2025<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. As areas that receive sunlight year-round and are dominated by numerous islands and mountains, countries in Southeast Asia have great potential for renewable energy. However, the main challenge in developing renewable energy is finding areas with high suitability for developing the infrastructure needed for sustainable power generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In addition, regulatory certainty, stable political and administrative coordination, thorough planning, and the identification of mature land constraints are needed to ensure that the energy tariffs in different regions are valued appropriately. Strategic renewable energy sources that have been developed in recent decades in the region include solar, wind, and hydropower. These sources have promising prospects for large-scale development to meet the region's renewable energy targets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> as well as to distribute energy to areas that do not yet have electricity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Owing to the potential and constraints of developing sustainable energy infrastructure in Southeast Asia, a strategy is needed to identify the optimal locations for sustainable energy development in the region, for which this study seeks to contribute.</p><p id="Par3">Remote sensing technology integrated with spatial analysis has been widely used to support decision making to determine the optimal locations for renewable energy infrastructure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For example, to determine the optimal solar area, Lopez et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> used the MODIS remote sensing product to model solar radiation. Letu et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> estimated the values of surface solar radiation, clouds, and aerosols from Himawari-8 satellite measurements. Furthermore, Principe and Takeuchi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> conducted an assessment of potential solar photovoltaic (PV) energy in the Asia–Pacific region based on meteorological factors. After identifying the potential areas for solar energy using remote sensing, it is possible to select the areas with the highest optimal values for the construction of solar power infrastructure. In addition, spatial analyses have been conducted based on a multi-criteria approach related to solar PV placement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. For wind farms, Blankenhorn and Resch<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> estimated the locations for potential wind energy in Germany based on the parameters of wind speed, land cover, slope, and protected area locations. Sah and Wijayatunga<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> modeled the potential regions in Bali, Indonesia, by integrating wind speed data from MODIS and physical infrastructure parameters; they produced a map of the potential wind energy distribution and the amount of power that could be generated. To identify areas in Iran with the potential for wind power plants, Noorrollahi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> conducted a case study that successfully integrated multiple criteria analysis methods involving physical and environmental aspects. Furthermore, several development-related studies have focused on modeling the potential of hydro-energy. Korkovelos<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> compared two LISFLOOD hydrological models with their own model that used data from the Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC) and digital elevation model (DEM) observation stations. Additionally, Rojanamon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> conducted a review of the physical, environmental, and economic aspects of achieving hydropower energy development.</p><p id="Par4">Some studies have modeled multiple energy sources to determine their combined potential for maximizing energy production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> Wang et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> conducted spatial modeling of the potential for solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, and hydropower energy in Fukushima, Japan, resulting in a map of the combined renewable energy potential. Asadi and Pourhossein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> conducted research in eastern Azerbaijan using technical, economic, and environmental data to determine the areas suitable for the construction of solar and wind power plants. Moreover, Yeom et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> used the COMS MI satellite to determine the spatiotemporal distribution of potential solar and wind energy resources over North Korea. Other studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> mapped hydro-solar-wind energy potential in West Africa and developed an optimally designed system of renewable energy resources based on the region of South and Central America. Previous studies have mapped multi-renewable energy sources by considering physical, social, and economic parameters. However, there has not yet been any research on this topic covering the Southeast Asian region as a whole and considering both a land suitability analysis and an estimate of the total potential energy produced.</p><p id="Par5">There are many factors limiting the relevant research in this area. One reason is the changing dynamics of the weather, which can influence the available solar, wind, and hydro energy. Investigating weather changes either diurnally or seasonally is challenging because it requires observation tools with high temporal and spatial resolutions. For example to observe solar radiation and wind conditions which are location-dependent and greatly fluctuating, a high density of solar and wind observation sensors are necessary. Satellites equipped with a scatterometer to observe wind vectors, such as QuikSCAT (QSCAT), have low spatial and temporal resolutions; in the case of QSCAT, the spatial resolution is only 0.25° × 0.25° and the temporal resolution is only 3 days, making the satellite usable only in the ocean<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The new generation of satellite-scatterometers, named Advanced Scatterometers (ASCAT), has similar capabilities but with improved spatial resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is necessary to develop studies for planning the optimal location for solar PV, windfarms, and hydropower stations that can support the efficient deployment of energy. In addition, it is necessary to develop the potential produced energy with consideration of various meteorological factors, which are all strongly influenced by weather conditions.</p><p id="Par6">The limited number of observations has caused there to be no studies considering seasonal factors in modeling the optimum energy for solar, wind, and hydro energy. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate solar, wind, and hydro energy across the entire region of Southeast Asia. The objectives of the study included modeling the energy needs of urban and rural areas, determining the level of suitability for multi-renewable energy production, and calculating the total estimated energy potential of multi-renewable energy. The integration of dominant energy probabilities for solar, wind, and hydropower in urban and agricultural areas, which we believe to be the first attempt in the field, is also discussed. This study also creates a new model that integrates the energy requirements of the study area with its suitability for energy production, accompanied by an estimate of the amount of potential energy that can be generated. The results of this study are expected to be used by multi-level governments in the region as well as the private sector to inform energy and spatial planning policies and strategies to prioritize and accelerate the energy transition in Southeast Asia based on different regional characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Spatial distribution of estimated urban and rural energy demand</title><p id="Par7">In the analysis of the energy demand of Southeast Asia, the study area was divided into two land cover classes: urban and rural. In this study, the classification for these two land cover classes was created by combining nightlight and impervious surface data. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a depicts that the obtained land cover class can represent the urban class in selected four Southeast Asian capital cities. In addition, Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the percentage distribution of urban and rural land cover classes in each of the six cities: Bangkok, Thailand; Hanoi, Vietnam; Jakarta, Indonesia; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; Manila, Philippines; and Singapore, Singapore. The cities were found to have the High (night light)–High (impervious surface) class as the majority, which was represented as urban area. The total consumption was calculated for a coverage area of 100 × 100 m in kilowatt-hours. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b,c show the distribution of electricity consumption in urban and rural areas in Southeast Asian countries. The dark shade indicates areas with more energy consumption; almost all urban areas with a high population density are displayed in red. The areas with low consumption are indicated in blue. The value of average electricity consumption per capita in urban areas was 10% higher than that in rural areas. The results showed that Indonesia had the highest total energy consumption, with a total electricity consumption of 212,747 GWh in 2020. The country with the lowest total electricity consumption was Timor Leste at 124 GWh.

Upstream rivers would be dominated by micro- and mini-scale power generation classes. In contrast, larger downstream rivers, such as the Mekong, which flows across Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, would be dominated by medium and large power plants. Other large rivers, such as the Pahang River in Malaysia and the Indragiri River in Indonesia, are also included in the small and medium classes (micro, mini, small). Such rivers can have this designation because rivers with significant flow accumulation and stream order have a relatively large discharge value. However, with regard to the head parameter, upstream rivers have more potential because of their steep slopes.

For the three types of renewable energy combined, the areas with the greatest potential are parts of Vietnam and Laos, as well as the northern Philippines. In this study, the analysis of the dominance of multi-renewable energy was carried out for four specific target areas, namely irrigated agriculture, rainfed agriculture, urban areas, and rural areas, to identify the areas with the most potential for constructing renewable energy. The urban and rural areas were divided into three classes of energy demand: high (HED), moderate (MED), and low (LED). This was done by classifying the estimated urban and rural energy demand (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) into three categories using the geometric interval method, and then overlaying these estimations with the three types of renewable energy. This classification process details the energy potential based on the characteristics of each region. An analysis of the agricultural area was conducted to determine the potential of renewable energy in supporting sustainable food security. For example, the water pumps used to irrigate agricultural areas are expected to be powered by renewable energy rather than fossil fuels in order to increase agricultural productivity. In urban areas, the massive energy demand can be addressed by utilizing environmentally friendly energy sources currently receiving public attention, such as through installing solar panels on the roofs of buildings. In urban and rural areas, it is possible to use the construction of solar panels, wind farms, and hydropower to achieve energy distribution, especially in areas that do not yet have electricity.</p><p id="Par18">Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a, b show the solar, wind, and hydroelectric energy demands for agricultural areas with irrigated and rain-fed crops. The rainfed area in Southeast Asia is larger than the irrigated crop area, meaning that rain-fed agricultural systems are dominant. Additionally, in rainfed crop areas, energy sources can also be used to assist pumping and irrigation processes, so that they do not rely solely on rain for irrigation. Irrigated agricultural land is dominated by solar and wind power potential. The areas with the highest probabilities of combined renewable energy are southern Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. In the rainfed agricultural area, the potential for these three types of energy is equal. Most of Indonesia's territory and northern countries such as Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, and the Philippines are covered by areas with solar and hydro potential. There is also ample wind potential in northern countries, such as the Philippines, Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand, and it is possible that solar panels and wind farms could be combined in these areas. It is most likely for the three energies to be combined in the rainfed agricultural regions of Vietnam and Laos, as well as in the northern and southern parts of the Philippines. Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c,d show the urban and rural areas for which the construction of solar panels, wind farms, and hydroelectric power plants could be targeted. Urban areas with the highest energy demand have the most solar potential, including Bangkok (Thailand), Hanoi (Vietnam), Manila (Philippines), and Jakarta (Indonesia).</p><p id="Par19">It is recognised that the transition to renewable energies such as solar energy will intensify the global competition for land and drive land use change, resulting in further environmental impacts. Focusing on the EU, India, Japan, and South Korea, Van de Ven et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> found that solar energy may occupy as much as 5% of the total land area to produce 80% of the electricity in these areas by 2050. This land requirement is significant; for illustration, 4% of the land in the EU land is currently covered with manmade surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. A solution to this problem is to integrate solar energy into urban spaces, for example, by placing small-scale PV systems on the roofs of buildings, even though the potential is somewhat limited; only around 3% of urbanized surfaces are suitable for such purposes with reasonable efficiences<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Urban areas typically have high energy needs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, and most of these areas are covered by solar potential. Solar PV installation on the rooftops of buildings has the potential to provide clean energy sources in urban areas. The deployment of rooftop solar PV has been increasing in recent years, especially with the increased interest in the net-zero energy building (NZEB) concept<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. To achieve NZEB goals, buildings are expected to install sustainable energy sources such as rooftop PV systems, especially for commercial and high-end residential buildings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par20">In rural areas with high energy demands, the three types of renewable energy are equally dominant. This is because constructing wind turbines with heights of 100 m requires a large area, and hydropower plants are constructed in existing river networks that are primarily found in rural areas. Rural areas with high energy demand due to a high concentration of industry are mainly found in Java (Indonesia), Brunei, Malaysia, southern Thailand, and northern Vietnam. In this analysis, three samples were taken from urban and rural areas based on the prominent differences in their energy demands and renewable energy potential. The three urban samples highlighted, namely Bangkok (Thailand), East Java (Indonesia), and Manila (Philippines), each have characteristics that are intermediate between urban and rural areas. Urban areas have high energy needs, and most of these areas are covered by solar potential.</p><p id="Par21">Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> lists the area distribution for the potential of each type of energy and its combination in eight targeted areas. Physical characteristics and the energy demand are important factors that determine the type of energy that can support each targeted area. Overall, it can be seen that solar energy dominates the urban, rural, and agricultural regions. Urban areas that already have energy infrastructure based on fossil fuels are challenged with an energy crisis. Therefore, it is time to transition to alternative energy sources, and this can be achieved because, although the energy demand in urban areas is increasing, the supply of energy sources, such as solar power, is also very high. In addition to the potential of solar panels, the potential for wind power development is also high in MED and LED urban areas. With a large supply of energy sources, rural areas should be able to use energy that is not as widespread as in urban areas. The energy demand in rural areas is high, but there are still residential areas that do not have electricity. Rural areas therefore exhibit unique patterns based on their energy needs. The lower the energy demand in the area, which corresponds to lower population levels, the greater the potential for building wind and hydropower plants. This is especially the case considering that such facilities require a large land area and, in the case of wind farms, must be far from settlements, or in the case of hydropower plants, require a network of rivers with large discharges that can generate considerable power. As previously mentioned, an analysis of the agricultural area was conducted to determine the potential of renewable energy in supporting sustainable food security.

There are 246 solar power plants, 7 wind power plants, and 214 hydropower plants that were compared using the root mean square error (RMSE) and R<sup>2</sup>. Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b shows a scatter plot of the results of the comparison between our research products and the data from the Global Power Plant Database in the form of estimated power generation. The R<sup>2</sup> value for the comparison of estimated and actual solar energy was 0.8323, with estimated solar panel power tending to be overestimated compared to the actual power capacity. This value can be influenced by parameters not included in the calculation, such as cloud cover, solar PV tilt azimuth angle, and solar PV working temperature. In addition, the efficiency of the solar cells was defined as 15% assuming that the solar cells were made of crystalline silicon, which is not always the case for solar power plants in Southeast Asia. The R<sup>2</sup> value for comparing hydropower energy was 0.9986, indicating that the estimated and actual datasets had a reasonably strong relationship. The resulting RMSE value was significant, with a value of 6.39. This value may have been influenced by the assumption used in this study that the adequate working time of wind turbines is 24 h; therefore, the potential theoretical energy was overestimated. In addition, the sensitivity of the analysis was affected by the limited number of power plants built in the study area. Any significant change in the data affects the overall results. The R<sup>2</sup> value for the comparison of estimated and actual wind energy was 0.4679, and the estimated power value for hydropower tended to be underestimated. This condition is the opposite of that for solar panel power in that the data with low values had considerable differences compared to the data with higher values. This shows that the results of the power calculation in this study had a higher sensitivity for medium- and large-scale power plants. In contrast, small-scale power plants would need to be further developed so that the study results would be more sensitive. Improved sensitivity could also be achieved by using additional parameters, such as the length of the diversion path, and a more precise definition of turbine and generator efficiency figures for small-scale power plants.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The distribution of solar, wind, and hydropower plants in Southeast Asia and their generating capacity.

Therefore, this study attempted to specifically determine the monthly fluctuating sensitivity levels of solar energy in each Southeast Asian country. The sensitivity range was obtained by comparing each month's average, minimum, and maximum potential power values; the wider the range, the lower the sensitivity level. Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> shows the trend for each country’s solar power potential sensitivity level. The varying levels of sensitivity in each Southeast Asian country are influenced by several factors, including the size of the country's administrative area and geographical conditions. Indonesia has the most extensive range of potential values among all other Southeast Asian countries; this means that Indonesia's sensitivity level for its potential power was relatively low. In contrast, Singapore and Timor Leste had the smallest value ranges. These results indicate that the monthly power potential in Singapore and Timor Leste have relatively high sensitivity. The broad range of sensitivity values for Indonesia is influenced by the country’s large area and its diverse and vast geographical landscape. In contrast, Singapore and Timor Leste are relatively small in area and have relatively homogeneous geographical landscapes. The highest average potential power values (~ 100 MW) were observed in the Philippines in February, April, and September. The same pattern was observed for Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, and Timor Leste. There was a significant increase in the potential power in February and a decrease from June to August. This result indicates that seasonal and weather changes affect the potential power values of these countries. In the dry season, the power generated by solar PV is much greater than that generated in the rainy season. The monthly average value of the potential power in Indonesia is relatively stable (80–98 MW) each year. However, some areas have high rainfall in the dry season due to various geographical and topographical conditions; therefore, each region does not have the same characteristics and patterns of potential generated power.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Time series analysis of the sensitivity of potential solar photovoltaic (PV) energy in Southeast Asian countries.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_25570_Fig9_HTML.png" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par24">The results of the comparison between generated energy and actual conditions using the Global Power Plant Dataset revealed that the hydropower calculation results were underestimated for large hydropower plants, but quite accurate for small hydropower plants. For example, the San Roque Hydropower Plant in the Philippines has a capacity of 411 MW but is estimated to be only 21 MW, and the Asahan 1 plant in Indonesia has a capacity of 186 MW but is estimated to be only 78.9 MW. In terms of hydropower plants that can be accurately estimated, Yan-Tann-Sien (Mini) in Vietnam has an actual capacity of 0.30 MW and an estimated capacity of 0.33 MW; Bersia (Medium) in Malaysia has an actual capacity of 48 MW and an estimated capacity of 46.82 MW; and Tarpein-1 (Large) in Myanmar has a capacity of 240 MW and an estimated capacity of 231.5 MW (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">Despite the optimistic future for Southeast Asia’s shift to renewable energy as well as its projected economic boost with significant macroeconomic attainment, this region still faces great challenges in terms of policy and regulation. To achieve the target of a 23% energy mix sourced from renewable energy in 2025, governments in Southeast Asia must build more renewable energy-based power plants. This study will help in the crucial phase of determining the feasibility and viability of such projects; it is a so-called prefeasibility study, in which potential sites are identified, short-listed, and studied in detail. This study can be a source for technical ministries and local government in terms of authorization and the application of licenses and/or permits. Governments and state-owned enterprises are among the important stakeholders for the adoption of relevant energy policies. After all legal, administrative, and business requirements have been met, the construction and operational phase will follow. Thus, the target supply of renewable energy can be easily fulfilled in the future.</p><p id="Par26">This study had some limitations primarily due to data availability. The analysis of urban and rural energy demand involved limited parameters, such as the defining of urban and rural areas based on population density, impervious surfaces, and nightlight parameters. Furthermore, electricity consumption data are only available at the state level. These factors resulted in difficulties in identifying priority areas and effects for determining LED, MED, and HED in the analysis of specific target areas. For solar power specifically, the solar radiation data that were used had a spatial resolution of 20 km, whereas the results in this study were presented at 1 km. It is therefore recommended to use solar radiation data with higher resolution, such as that from MODIS, Himawari, or very-high resolution satellites. The inclusion of several additional parameters, such as the temperature of the solar panel and the tilt of the panel during operation, could also improve the quality of the power value to bring it closer to the actual conditions. Furthermore, the analysis of wind energy production can be further developed by integrating additional parameters, such as soil conditions, plate activity, and tidal riding, to analyze the suitability of the location of wind energy generators. For hydropower site analysis, several additional influential parameters of river characteristics should be considered, such as the hydrology cycle, suspended sediment, and irrigation networks. The temporal resolution can also be increased to consider more than the average river discharge for 1 year. It is necessary to use a higher basin level to analyze the effect of rainfall on the hydropower generation potential. Energy grid transmission data could also be used to help analyze the priorities for deployment of renewable energy sources. However, the priority development level necessitates further research to develop the methods for priority analysis, which must consider various aspects of accessibility, cost, and investment; to calculate the risk of vulnerability to disasters; and to calculate the air pollution factor and ultimately allow the analysis of the contribution of renewable energy to carbon neutralization. We also recommend that future studies incorporate climate model parameters; for example, they could account for the influence of El Niño and La Niña on solar radiation, wind speed, and the resulting river and basin discharges. For comparative analyses, better validation and verification methods are required, for example, by conducting direct measurements in the field.</p><p id="Par27">In this study, research was conducted to determine the potential of multi-renewable energy sources in 2020. This year was chosen as the research period based on the novelty of the data and differences in topographical phenomena that occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. By conducting research in 2020, these results can be a starting point for a new pattern due to natural changes that occurred to allow for predictions in the next year after COVID-19. One limitation of this study is that it does not provide a predictive model, so the results are most accurate in representing the year 2020. However, this does not mean that these results cannot be used for subsequent years because topographic and meteorological conditions will not change significantly in a short period of time.

However, because the spatiotemporal resolutions of these data vary, a bilinear interpolation process was used to standardize the data resolution and ensure that the data used in the analysis all had a spatial resolution of 1 km. This research used tabular data and statistics on the energy demand per capita. Energy demand and supply data were taken from several sources, such as the Energy Information Administration, the World Bank, and Index Mundi-supported data from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. The data unit of energy consumption per capita was expressed in watt-hours, and the data was divided into rural and urban energy needs. Point vector data included airport point data, reservoir distribution data, and data on the distribution of existing power plants. Line vector data types included rivers, and polygon vectors include water bodies and protected areas.

To model the potential for solar energy, monthly average data on solar radiation (W/m<sup>2</sup>), temperature (K), AOD, and precipitation (mm/day) from January to December 2020 were used. There were three modeling steps. The energy potential produced by solar PV technology modeled the theoretical solar power potential, the effective solar power potential, and the solar PV-generated energy potential. The compelling power potential of solar panels was calculated using Eq. <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="disp-formula">3</xref>, which comes from the research of Principe and Takeuchi<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and is expressed in units of megawatts (MW). <italic>A</italic><sub><italic>cell</italic></sub> represents a solar panel installation pixel in a 1 km<sup>2</sup> grid area.

The WRI database includes the location of power plants up to 2018 and information on the power generated in megawatts. Standardizing the data was necessary to accurately compare data from the models with data from the field. For example, because this study used satellite data represented in raster form with a resolution of 1 km<sup>2</sup>, it was essential to equalize the cross-sectional area of the power plants between the product and the field data. To determine the area of solar panels in the field, we used Google Earth to digitize the area of the solar panels after obtaining their location coordinates from the database. In the wind energy generation analysis, the resulting product was in the form of generated power; therefore, the results needed to be first transformed into energy by integrating the angular cross-sectional area and the adequate working time of the power plant. This process assumes that the power plant can operate for 24 h and is not affected by weather or day and night conditions. It was necessary to equalize the power unit, which refers to the field data with units of MW, and calculate the average power at points in the buffer area.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to acknowledge the support from Institut Teknologi Bandung.
