In terms of passively isolating building interiors from cold or hot outdoors, windows and skylights are the least-efficient parts of the building envelope because achieving simultaneously high transparency and thermal insulation of glazing remains a challenge. Here we describe highly transparent aerogels fabricated from cellulose, an Earth-abundant biopolymer, by utilizing approaches such as colloidal self assembly and procedures compatible with roll-to-roll processing. The aerogels have visible-range light transmission of 97–99% (better than glass), haze of ~1% and thermal conductivity lower than that of still air. These lightweight materials can be used as panes inside multi-pane insulating glass units and to retrofit existing windows. We demonstrate how aerogels boost energy efficiency and may enable advanced technical solutions for insulating glass units, skylights, daylighting and facade glazing, potentially increasing the role of glazing in building envelopes.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Windows are one of the least energy efficient parts of the building envelope because of poor thermal insulation.

id="Sec1"><title>Main</title><p id="Par3">To provide desired indoor conditions irrespective of the outdoor environment at little or no additional energy supply, building envelopes need to minimize the interior–exterior exchange of energy through thermal conduction, convection and emission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. To achieve this with glazing is especially challenging because of the typical stringent requirements on visible-range transparency and haze<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. While current approaches to this challenge utilize the insulating glass units (IGUs) with air or fill gas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, high thermal-barrier performance of such IGUs requires large gap thickness between glass panes, which in turn is limited by gas convection, number of panes and structural constraints. The use of much thinner vacuum-insulated glass units, on the other hand, is limited by the seal integrity and high costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Low-emissivity silver and other coatings allow for limiting the energy loss due to black-body-like electromagnetic emissivity originating from the room-temperature building’s interior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, though they can capture only a fraction of escaping energy at a cost of deteriorating visible-range transparency. Aerogels, highly thermally insulating materials used in applications ranging from pipe insulation to a Mars rover<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, have been highly sought after for applications inside IGUs as a solid material replacement for gas fillers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> because they stand out as a class of materials capable of outperforming still air and other gas fillers as efficient thermal barriers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, aerogels are typically mechanically fragile and strongly scatter light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Manufacturing aerogels with low haze, high transparency and mechanical robustness at building-relevant scales and costs also remained a challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Development of transparent aerogels, including cellulose-based ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, remained limited to small scales while also featuring haze and transparency characteristics still inadequate for uses in most types of glazing. While the technological solutions for controlling thermal-range emissivity are highly adequate and widely used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and the recent advent of the electrochromic approaches promise to address the needs of solar gain and privacy control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, the lack of good transparent thermal barriers strongly limits the energy efficiency of window technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Here we demonstrate scalable manufacturing of highly transparent silanized cellulose aerogels (SiCellAs) with material characteristics adequate for glazing applications. These highly thermally insulating SiCellA materials, sandwiched between glass panes, may allow for windows with high resistance <italic>R</italic> to heat flow, such as <italic>R</italic><sub>B</sub> = 5 h ft<sup>2</sup> °F Btu<sup>−1</sup> (Imperial units common for North America, where Btu stands for a British thermal unit) and <italic>R</italic><sub>S </sub>≈ 0.9 m<sup>2</sup> K W<sup>−1</sup> (SI units). SiCellA may help to achieve such high-<italic>R</italic> insulation for a geometric form factor of a conventional double-pane IGU and may enable glazing for daylighting and skylights, potentially exceeding the current standards and targets not only for windows but even for building walls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. While the deployment of IGUs with air or other gas fillers is limited by convection at large inter-pane gaps and by reflections of light from glass–air interfaces of multi-pane IGUs, no such intrinsic limitations exist for SiCellA-based IGUs. This glazing may allow for the building envelopes to be designed to better take advantage of external conditions to provide natural occupant comfort. We show how SiCellA films can be used as IGU fillers and in multi-pane IGU designs to replace the inner glass panes and are fully compatible with the existing solutions for thermal-range emissivity and solar gain control. We envisage that SiCellAs will provide a holistic solution to the energy-management challenges that building technologies face, potentially even helping the next generation of buildings harness energy from the environment by allowing for better taking advantage of solar heating and natural lighting through the increased use of glazing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, provided that economically viable manufacturing of SiCellA can be achieved.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Fabrication of window-scale nanostructured SiCellA materials</title><p id="Par5">Our transparent, thermally super-insulating SiCellA materials are envisaged to boost the efficiency of pre-existing windows and enable advanced window products (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>), as we demonstrate using prototypes of SiCellA-based retrofit films and IGUs at window-relevant scales (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c–e</xref> and Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). The SiCellA films readily adhere to the surfaces of plastic films and glass panes due to electrostatic charging. A thin film of SiCellA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) allows for boosting the thermal barrier performance of a single-pane window when used as a retrofit laminated on its inner surface as vividly revealed by thermal imaging of the exterior glass surface temperature during winter (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). The temperature of the outer surface of retrofitted panes is measured to be lower than that of similar panes without retrofits because of more effective blocking of the heat transfer through the window enabled by the installation of a SiCellA retrofit (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Hot and cold boxes (Methods), which mimic the interior–exterior heat exchange during summers and winters, respectively, illustrate similar superior thermal barrier performance enabled by SiCellAs when laminated atop a single-pane glass or inserted into the gap of a double-pane IGU (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g,h</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>SiCellA-based window retrofits and IGUs.</title><p><bold>a</bold>,<bold>b</bold>, Schematic drawings of a window retrofitted with a SiCellA film (<bold>a</bold>) and an IGU with a SiCellA film inserted between glass panes (<bold>b</bold>).

Consequently, the surface charges associated with the carboxylate anion preclude aggregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> of the nanofibres and allow formation of stable aqueous colloidal dispersions at varying concentrations, which can be poured into moulds of desired shapes and sizes (Methods and Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Adding acid interlinks these nanofibres by hydrogen bonds between the carboxyl groups, transforming the colloidal dispersion into a hydrogel (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4b</xref>) with a network of sparse nanofibres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

The results of numerical modelling for such SiCellA IGUs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b,c</xref>) are consistent with experimental measurements performed for a set of prototypes that we manufactured (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8d,e</xref>), revealing that the general principles commonly applied to designing glass-based multi-pane IGUs can be adequately adapted to using SiCellA panes and fillers.

Many aerogels referred to as ‘transparent’, including our previously developed cellulose–polysiloxane hybrid aerogels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, do not meet stringent requirements for applications in IGUs because of the relatively large haze values caused by the large fraction of transmitted light being forward scattered. Our work overcomes these major challenges as follows: (1) mechanically robust, crack-free monolithic SiCellA was demonstrated at window-relevant square-metre scales; (2) low haze and high transparency of SiCellA meet the requirement of applications in windows; (3) silanization enables super-hydrophobicity of SiCellA, making it durable; (4) adhesion of SiCellA to glass and plastic films enables its utility in many glazing products and (5) simple fabrication steps, including ones compatible with roll-to-roll processing, and low-cost source materials (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) will help with the deployment.</p><p id="Par21">The fundamental difference of SiCellA as compared with conventional aerogels is that the size of &lt;100 nm pores and &lt;10 nm diameter of nanofibres forming the network (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) is controlled to be much smaller than the visible light wavelengths uniformly on window-relevant (square-metre) scales, assuring high visible-range light transmission 97–99% (much better than ~92% transmission of generic clear glass) and haze ~1%. These lightweight materials with mass density ~1% of glass density are mechanically robust to take forms of free-standing films that exhibit thermal conductivity lower than that of still air (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). SiCellA can be manufactured at a relatively low cost (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) and in a scalable way, promising to enable entirely different types of IGU, skylight, daylighting and even SiCellA-containing window frame design.

However, the ability of using rolled aerogel films within the CPD-based drying process, along with pumpless operation and solvent drying mitigates this problem for SiCellA while yielding superior optical properties. While specific economically viable technical solutions for manufacturing of installation-ready window products still need to be developed, similar to the case of non-transparent aerogels used in pipe insulation and recently even in some parts of building envelopes, the ability of rolling during different stages of aerogel manufacturing may help lowering manufacturing costs and, thus, also market penetration.</p><p id="Par23">Deployment of SiCellA could increase the use of glazing in building envelopes because the aerogel-enhanced windows can exceed current and near-future targets for <italic>R</italic> values of glazing. The low mass density is a key for structural compatibility and retrofitting old windows and for unconventional multi-pane IGU designs. SiCellA’s combination of very high transparency and low thermal conductivity at the scale of building materials is a breakthrough, which opens unique opportunities in harnessing and controlling solar energy delivered to buildings, depending on climate- and season-related needs. The boosted performance of SiCellA-based IGUs is directly linked to low thermal conductivity and high visible transmission of these materials when used as the middle panes of IGUs. The reflection coefficient at the air–SiCellA interface is approximately ten times lower than at the glass–air interface, so that multi-pane assemblies with SiCellA-based middle panes exhibit lower light loss due to reflections as compared with their standard counterparts. For a quadruple-pane IGU assembly, for example, the light loss can be reduced by ~16% upon replacing two middle glass panes with SiCellA counterparts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). Each additional SiCellA pane reduces light transmission by less than 1% so that, hypothetically, even ten-pane IGUs can be possible (not possible for glass mid panes as a glass-based ten-pane IGU prevents nearly all light from passing due to reflections at 20 interfaces).</p><p id="Par24">In SiCellA-based IGUs, panes can be separated by gaps of a thickness varying within 6–16 mm, which can be optimized depending on a gas filler (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8b–f</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). For example, with ~3 mm outer glass and mid-layer SiCellA panes, a triple-pane IGU can be made to have ~21 mm overall thickness of a standard double-pane IGU to replace one while providing much better insulation at comparable optical transmission. Designs of IGUs can mix free-standing SiCellA mid-layers and ones adhered to glass panes on their inner surfaces. With thermal conductivity lower than ~26 mW K<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>−1</sup> of still air and no convective transfer, the SiCellA-based IGUs can allow for better insulation per inch of a material than a regular double-pane window with an air gap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).

This hardwood kraft pulp with a water content of 92% had been kept in a wet stage after the bleaching treatment. The pulp was demineralized by stirring it in an HCl (0.1 M) solution for 1 h, after which it was washed with deionized (DI) water by filtration and then stored at 4 °C without drying. The TEMPO oxidation of the cellulose pulp was started in a basic medium with a pH of 10 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3d,e</xref>). TEMPO (28.92 mg, 0.094 mmol) and NaBr (317.64 mg) were added to the suspension, followed by addition of 1 M NaOCl solution (10 ml). When the pH drop was less than 0.01 per minute, the solution was transferred to a blender and blended for several minutes with a relative centrifugal force of 300 g (at 1,500 r.p.m.) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3f</xref>). This breaks down the cellulose fibre agglomerates and allows deeper penetration of the oxidation agent. After a total blending time of 15 minutes, the solution was placed back on a stirring plate and the pH was again adjusted to 10. This process was repeated until the pH of the solution drops less than 0.5 after blending. When the pH of the solution dropped less than 0.03 in one hour, the reaction was considered finished. The solution was then centrifuged at 10,800 g (9,000 r.p.m.) for 20 minutes to filter the excess chemicals out of the cellulose solution. This process was repeated several times, each time replacing the waste liquid with DI water to remove the remaining chemicals from the solution until only pure, oxidized cellulose fibres remained. The oxidized nanocellulose was then recovered by centrifugation and washed thoroughly with DI water, which was then mechanically ground with a 1,500 W grinder (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3g</xref>), followed by sonication with Branson Sonifier for 15 min at 30% amplitude. Oxidation of the unreacted C6 hydroxyl groups of cellulose into C6 carboxylate groups was further performed using NaClO<sub>2</sub> as the primary oxidant, with catalytic amounts of TEMPO and NaClO in water at a pH of 4.8–6.8. TEMPO again allowed for the selective and efficient conversion of the C6 hydroxyl groups. One M dibasic sodium phosphate (2.35 ml) and 1 M monobasic sodium phosphate (2.65 ml) solutions were added to 1 g TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibre solution (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3h</xref>) to act as a buffer during the reaction. This was stirred at 15 g (500 r.p.m.) for approximately 5 minutes and then 20 ml was removed and set aside to dilute the sodium hypochlorite later before adding it to the reaction vessel. TEMPO (25 mg) and sodium chlorite (1.13 g) were then added to the oxidized cellulose nanofibre dispersions and were stirred at 15 g (500 r.p.m.) for approximately 20 minutes until these additives were fully dissolved. Sodium hypochlorite (0.455 ml) was then added to the 20 ml separate solution. The diluted sodium hypochlorite was then added to the cellulose nanofibres dispersion, and the reaction vessel was immediately sealed. The solution was placed in a water bath at room temperature and stirred at 15 g (500 r.p.m.) for approximately 30 minutes. The water bath was then heated to 60 °C and the reaction was allowed to run continuously for 72 h. The solution was centrifuged at 10,800 g (9,000 r.p.m.) for 20 minutes to filter the excess chemicals out of the cellulose solution. This process was repeated several times, each time replacing the waste liquid with DI water to wash out the remaining chemicals until only pure, oxidized cellulose fibres remained. Next, the dispersion was sonicated with a Branson Sonifier for 30 minutes and filtered with Whatman filter paper 2 to get the final oxidized cellulose nanofibre dispersion in water.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Preparation of aerogels</title><p id="Par28">Aqueous TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibre dispersions with concentrations ranging from 0.5% to 2% were poured into plastic moulds of desired thickness ranging from 1 mm to 25 mm (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4a,b</xref>). To initiate gelation, 0.5 M HCl was sprayed into the dispersion for a few seconds with a fine spray. Keeping the sprayed HCl spread over the dispersion, it was allowed to stand for 30 min without any disturbance. The resulting hydrogel was then moved to a 0.1 M HCl solvent bath for 24 h to make sure that the gelation is complete. The ensuing rigid hydrogel was taken from the mould, and the acid was then washed out by DI water and moved to a water–ethanol mixture (50 vol% each) followed by the solvent exchange to ethanol (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4b–d</xref>). Because the ethanol makes azeotrope with water, we used an elevated temperature of 60 °C during the water-to-ethanol exchange (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4c,d</xref>). The ensuing alcogel is then rolled and moved to a CPD chamber to dry (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4g</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5a–c</xref>), with the initial chamber temperature and pressure set at 5 °C and 800 psi (pound per square inch), respectively. The next step involved purging ethanol from the chamber and replacing it with liquid CO<sub>2</sub>. Then, the temperature was raised to 40 °C and the pressure was set at 1,500 psi, and the ethanol leftover was purged while within the supercritical phase for 30 min. The final step of the process, bleeding of supercritical CO<sub>2</sub>, was then started slowly, at 25 psi min<sup>−1</sup>, and the chamber was gradually depressurized within about 1 h. The resulting aerogels were kept at 60 °C for 1 day before characterization and functionalization (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4i,h</xref>). CPD chambers with cylinder-shaped inner volume of two different dimensions were used (diameter × height sizes of 16.5 cm × 2.5 cm and 16.5 cm × 104 cm), depending on the size of SiCellA being dried (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4g–k</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5c–f</xref>). Additional details on CPD drying while recycling solvents via pumpless operation are provided in Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>. We also note that a slightly modified fabrication procedure as compared to what is described above can involve first rolling the gel on the plastic support in its hydrogel state while using spacers and then doing solvent exchanges in cylindrical containers before again obtaining a rolled alcogel for CPD drying.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Silanization of dried aerogels</title><p id="Par29">Chemical vapour deposition of 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (PFOES) on the unmodified TEMPO-oxidized aerogels was done to transform the amphiphilic cellulose to the one with the hydrophobic surface via silane functionalization of the cellulose nanofibres. The unmodified TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibre aerogel was placed on the top of a Teflon mesh supported with a stainless steel mesh. It was then placed in the middle of a 3 l clear polycarbonate vacuum desiccator with the sample thus suspended to functionalize through the interaction with the vapour-phase (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11a</xref>) silane molecules.

The silanized aerogels exhibited enhanced mechanical performance (200–300% of the increase in tensile and compressive stress of SiCellA than unmodified aerogel), with modified nanoscale porous structure also achieved through silanization (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). The SiCellA has higher values of tensile stress (270 kPa) and strain (8.8%) than their corresponding unmodified counterparts (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a,b,f</xref>). The ultimate compressive stress of the SiCellA is 1.5 MPa, which is three times higher than the respective unmodified aerogel. The enhanced interaction of the silanized cellulose chains within the network after silanization resulted in a substantial increase in deformation resistance, ductility and toughness of SiCellA (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). No notable difference was detected in optical properties of the SiCellA and unmodified cellulose aerogels for the studied samples prepared under optimized conditions.

To enable the mounting of these modestly large samples, the standard sample compartment covers were removed and a light-tight customized housing was used.</p><p id="Par36">Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy experiments were performed in the mid-infrared (2.5–25 µm) region using a Nicolet 6700 Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer with a deuterated triglycine sulfate detector (4,000–400 cm<sup>−1</sup>) in a transmission mode. A gold-coated integrating sphere with a diameter 75 mm (PIKE Technologies, Mid-IR Upward-looking InegratIR) was used in both reflection and transmission modes with a wide-band (4,000–500 cm<sup>−1</sup>) Mercury Cadmium Telluride detector. These measurements allowed for characterizing thermal–infrared-range transmissivity of various unmodified and SiCellA aerogels shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>. The weighted transmissive emittance (W m<sup>−2</sup> µm<sup>−1</sup>), that is, the ratio of the thermal transmittance from aerogels to the radiation from an ideal black body at the same temperature, were calculated by multiplying black-body emittance at 300 K by the averaged transmittance of aerogels at each wavelength (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>).

The compression, three-point bending and cycles of compression and elongation were recorded using the RSA-G2 Solids Analyser. Initial dimensions of samples were used to convert these measurements to stress and strain with TRIOS software (TA Instruments). Mechanical properties were also probed under cyclic tension/compression up to a maximum strain of 6% for silanized aerogels (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>).

The excessive moisture and oxygen in the air can react, for example, with the secondary silicone sealant, accelerating its ageing process and degrading the performance of the IGU. In our study, a high RH environmental test chamber was used to generate a temperature regime of 80 °F (27 °C) at a high RH of 80%. SiCellA-containing IGUs were placed in the chamber for 14 days. The properties of the IGUs before and after the test were then measured, revealing robust performance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>). The fogging test (also known as a ‘chemical outgassing test’) is intended to determine the resistance of preassembled, sealed IGUs to fogging, which could occur due to chemical outgassing of materials and assembly components within the IGU. The test is conducted for 14 days in a special box equipped with an ultraviolet light source, an air circulating fan and a cooling plate according to the standard ASTM E2189, with the outcomes revealing no degradation of physical properties (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7d</xref>). For the ultraviolet exposure test, the IGUs were placed into the ultraviolet illumination chamber and exposed to a 500 W ultraviolet radiator with the output power of 40 W m<sup>−2</sup> or higher, where the ultraviolet exposure photons have energies comparable to the dissociation energies of polymer bonds (300–1,000 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>). SiCellA-containing IGUs were kept in the chamber at 50 ± 3 °C for 30 days of exposure and then characterized, revealing no substantial property degradation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Condensation resistance</title><p id="Par42">Cold temperatures of a window’s inner surface can cause moisture from the interior of a room to condense on it as droplets of water when these temperatures are below the dew point. Being highly likely at high indoor RH, the condensation impacts the transparency of windows and the indoor humidity, which may degrade the indoor air quality. To compare the condensation resistance of SiCellA-based window products and their counterparts, we measured their CRF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>, which quantifies how well a window resists condensation on the interior-facing surface. Typical CRF values are 5–15 for single-pane, 35–50 for double-pane and 60–80 for triple-pane IGUs. To measure CRF, we used a home-built cold box apparatus (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9a</xref>). The temperature inside the apparatus, which represents the outside ambient environment and exterior temperature, was lowered using dry ice and the temperatures of all IGU surfaces were continuously monitored by thermocouples (FluxTeq).
