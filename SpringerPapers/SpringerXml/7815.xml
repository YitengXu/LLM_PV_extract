The main issues, challenges and opportunities are highlighted together with perspectives of process alternatives for more efficient energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emission management. Analysis of the data indicate that not all available energy resources are being utilized efficiently, while the energy resources causing the largest emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> are being used in the largest amounts. Also, the chemical and related industries are among the largest consumers of energy, indicating that solutions for reduction of energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in these industries need to be investigated. Information on promising alternatives for reduction of energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are collected and a selection of them are evaluated. Also, two specific case studies involving energy intensive separation operations replaced by recently developed technologies that may achieve significant reductions in energy consumption, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and total annualized costs are presented. Through these examples issues of energy need versus CO<sub>2</sub> neutral design, sustainable conversion, retrofit design, and process intensification for chemical and related industries are highlighted.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Energy resources</kwd><kwd>Energy consumption</kwd><kwd>CO<sub>2</sub> emission and management</kwd><kwd>Sustainable process alternatives</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>BioMed Central</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/42480_2019_Article_8.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Industrial Chemistry/Chemical Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Industrial and Production Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering Fluid Dynamics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry and Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par16">The human race is the master of the planet earth because it has managed to convert the available resources to desired products (fuels, cars, planes, polymers, drugs, food, cloths, etc.) that it needs for survival and sustainability. The chemical and related industries continue to play an important role in this respect. However, the processes employed to convert the resources to the desired products use energy, cause negative environmental impacts and also produce waste. The rate of utilization (consumption) of energy in different forms has been increasing continuously at a rapid pace, especially in sectors such as transportation, industrial and residential since the 1900s. Energy consumption per capita is an important parameter to assess the quality of life for the population of a country. Therefore sustainable harnessing of the available energy resources with a view to meeting the necessities of increasing world population, to ensure safety and health of the present as well as the future generations on earth, should be an essential goal of all governmental planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. With the rapid industrialization and growth in population, the demand for energy is increasing continuously. However, because of the cost and availability, the most used sources of energy are non-renewable, which also has the largest effect on the environment because of the emission of CO<sub>2</sub> other green-house gases.</p><p id="Par17">Energy is needed in some form, directly or indirectly, for almost all of our activities within sectors such as transportation, commercial, industrial and residential. The energy needs (demands) for different sectors are met through different sources of energy that are dependent on geographical location, availability, cost of harnessing as well as environmental effects. Availability of the energy resources is not uniform across earth and neither are costs or needs. The sources of energy can be broadly classified as conventional and unconventional. Conventional sources of energy are the natural fossil energy (coal, oil, natural gas, etc.) and nuclear energy resources, which are generally accepted as fuel resources to produce heat, light, food and electricity. Unconventional energy resources are classified as solar, wind, biological wastes, hot springs, tides, biomass, etc., that may also be used to generate heat and power. Unlike the conventional fossil energy resources, which are non-renewable, limited in terms of availability and cause pollution (for example, emits CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere), the unconventional energy resources are renewable, are present in abundance in nature and they generate much less pollution throughout their lifecycles. Their utilization is however limited by the available technologies to convert them to usable energy forms.</p><p id="Par18">Initiatives to capture the released CO<sub>2</sub> is therefore similar to trying to <italic>cure</italic> the pollution problem after the incident has occurred. However, as the amounts and sources of energy used effect earthâs environment and thereby itâs sustainability, to meet energy demands, the conventional resources need to be supplemented with the unconventional resources so as to manage the CO<sub>2</sub> and other GHG emissions at acceptable levels, and thereby <italic>prevent</italic> the pollution problem.</p><p id="Par19">Recently, Vooradi, et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] provided a detailed overview of the different types of energy resources versus their current levels of consumption, while Gani et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] highlighted some perspectives on how to manage the process energy demands versus CO2 emissions in a short conference proceedings paper Using these developments as the basis, this paper further extends the discussion with additional data on industrial energy utilization versus CO<sub>2</sub> emission and, analysis related to new developments in the area of synthesis-design of more sustainable chemical and related processes. In particular, use of techniques such as process intensification, process integration and energy integration at different levels, that aims to minimize the energy consumption (demand) and <italic>prevent</italic> the pollution problem rather than <italic>cure</italic> it after the incident has occurred, are highlighted. That is, <italic>prevent</italic> the pollution problem through more sustainable process alternatives. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to review the current status in terms of issues (energy consumption by the chemical and related industries; the associated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions; and the need for their reduction), opportunities (means available to simultaneously increase process efficiency and reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions) and challenges (how to achieve the targeted process improvements including economic feasibility also). Different options for process improvements proposed by others are also evaluated.</p><p id="Par20">The current energy status with respect to resources and their consumptions is briefly reviewed, followed by a brief discussion on the issues, challenges and opportunities for reduction of energy consumption, CO<sub>2</sub> emission as well as economic feasibility. Alternatives for achieving targeted process improvements are then evaluated and details of two specific case studies applying recently developed energy reduction technologies are highlighted. The paper ends with future perspectives and conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Review of Energy status</title><p id="Par21">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the energy consumption in different sectors in 2015 and 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and it is clear that the industry and transportation sectors are more energy intensive than others. The industrial sector alone is responsible for 37% of the total energy consumption and 24% of the total global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuel usage is around 31.4 billion tons per year. To limit the scope of this paper, only the energy and CO<sub>2</sub> management issues for the chemical and related industries are considered.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Percentage of total energy consumption by sector in 2015 and 2016</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42480_2019_8_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Energy consumption in the industrial sector</title><p id="Par22">Analysis of the data show that USA, European Union, China and India consume nearly 60% of the total global industrial energy consumed. During 2010â2016, the highest annual growth rates in industrial energy consumption are found in the Middle East (2.5%), China (2.6%), South Korea (2.7%) and India (4.7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the industrial sector, according to the International Energy Outlook (IEO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the five main sources of energy are liquid fuels, natural gas, coal, electricity (generated through various energy resources) and renewables. According to IEO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], in 2014 the distribution of energy resources for electricity generation is the following: coal at 40.8%, natural gas at 21.6%, nuclear at 10.6%, hydro at 16.4%, other sources (solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, etc.) at 6.3% and oil at 4.3%. Increasing use of unconventional sources of energy for electricity generation is a welcome trend.</p><p id="Par23">Most industrial energy consumption occurs in the manufacture of bulk chemicals and petrochemicals, iron and steel, nonmetallic minerals, and nonferrous metals. The chemical and petrochemical industries are among the largest energy consumers with 1078 Mtoe of energy consumption in the year 2016. Between 2000 to 2016, these industries had a 2% annual rate of increase in energy consumption versus a 2.5% annual rate of increase in CO<sub>2</sub> emission. In USA, the bulk chemical industry is still the largest industrial consumer of energy, followed by the refining industry and the mining industry, which account for 28, 18 and 11%, respectively, of the total USA industrial sector energy consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Other related energy intensive processes are the iron and steel industry (with a global energy demand of 819.23 Mtoe in 2016) and the cement industry (with a global energy demand of 250.7 Mtoe in 2016). Clearly, reductions in the energy consumptions in these industries can help to bring down of the global CO<sub>2</sub> emission rate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Energy supply for the industrial sector</title><p id="Par24">How is the energy needed by the industrial sector, especially the chemical and related industries, supplied? From an energy consumption point of view, the chemical and related industries could be considered energy <italic>demanding</italic> technologies that need to be serviced by energy <italic>producing</italic> technologies, which supply the demand in various forms. Selection of an energy resource to meet any demand is based on the following factors: resource availability, geographical location, harnessing technology, associated costs and environmental effects. Conventional resources such as coal, oil, natural gas and wood, which all contribute to CO<sub>2</sub> emission, are still the primary resources for energy generation globally. Other resources of energy that do not release CO<sub>2</sub> are solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, and biomass. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows recent energy consumption statistics in the industrial sector and the projection as per Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS) targets of the International Energy Agency (IEA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] for different fuels. Clearly, despite the projected growth in industrial production needed to sustain the demands of an increasing global population, the growth in energy consumption by industry needs to be restricted to 0.9% per year to realize the SDS objectives by 2030. In April 2018, the average concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is above 410âppm measured at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and it has been the highest monthly average in history.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Fuel wise energy consumption in the Industrial sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42480_2019_8_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par25">To arrest the increase of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, IEA proposed a plan for reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emission through different means as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. An important issue to note in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> is that energy efficiency plays a major role, which also affects the process sustainability in terms of reduced operating cost, reduced environmental impact and reduced waste [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Therefore, research needs to be focused on technologies that can provide energy efficiency improvements through sustainable process engineering and the adoption of energy management systems and practices with the goal of energy demand reduction as well as meeting these demands with more sustainable energy supply. To meet the energy demand utilization of a single energy resource may not be a viable or sustainable option. Hence, sustainable integration of geographical (local) industrial energy demands with energy supply capacities (i.e., energy from solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, fossil fuel with CO<sub>2</sub> capture, etc.) can result in better utilization of energy resources, leading to a better environment.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>CO<sub>2</sub> emission reduction targets and the means to achieve them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42480_2019_8_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Issues, challenges and opportunities</title><p id="Par26">With the rapid industrialization and growth in population, the demand for energy is increasing continuously. However, because of the cost and availability, the most used resources of energy remain non-renewable, which also have the largest effect on the environment because of the resulting emissions of CO<sub>2</sub>. Among the challenges that are currently being considered, one of the most important concerns is energy as it effects directly and/or indirectly most of the other challenges related to water, food and environment. The issues discussed in this paper are how the energy demand is supplied, which resources could be used, and what are the associated environmental impacts with respect to the chemical and related industries.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Energy resources</title><p id="Par27">The main issue is the availability of the energy resources, which is not uniform across earth, neither are costs or needs. The conventional resources of energy are naturally available but there are extraction costs, which is related to the location of the energy resources (underground, or deep underground or under the sea bed, for example). The technologies to extract these resources are, however, more developed than the unconventional energy resources. The latter, generate much less pollution throughout their lifecycles but currently their conversion to usable energy forms is more expensive than the conventional resources. Therefore, they are under-utilized for industrial needs.

Another common example of transformation of energy from one form to another is in a power plant. However, power plants using non-renewable energy resources (coal, natural gas, oil, wood) transform the chemical potential energy trapped in the fossil fuels to electricity (releasing, thereby, CO<sub>2</sub>); while nuclear power plants change the nuclear potential energy of uranium or plutonium into electricity, wind turbines change the kinetic energy of air molecules in wind into electricity, hydroelectric power plants transform the gravitational potential energy of water as it falls from the top of a dam to the bottom into electricity and biomass is converted to different types of fuels by, for example, combustion, pyrolysis or chemical conversion.

Three interesting developments are highlighted here. I) A method for synthesis of processing routes for conversion of biomass to useful chemicals and biofuels has been developed by Bertran et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], which takes into account the location and amount of available biomass, the chemical (product) demand, the local CAPEX and OPEX as well as transportation costs. With this method and associated computer aided tools, it is possible to determine more sustainable processing routes for conversion of a given biomass at a specific geographical location to a set of desired products for sale at other locations, according to their demand. According to one scenario, a sustainable option is to ship cassava rhizome and bagasse from Thailand to Canada for pre-treatment of the biomass, and perform the actual production of fuel-grade ethanol in Mexico and sell thee product in USA. Changing the prices and/or constraints, a totally different scenario is obtained. Note that production of chemicals reduces the use of non-renewable resources for their production, thereby making the bio-conversion route more sustainable. II) Another option to convert biomass to energy is proposed by Girones et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], where use of a biomass gasifier to convert lignocellulosic biomass such as wood into syngas that can be used in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) to produce heat and electricity has been highlighted. III) Sharma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] compared many biomass conversion options considering the complete energy conversion pathway, from the resource to the supply of energy services. The comparison, which includes 56 scenarios, is performed by evaluating the CO<sub>2</sub> abatement potential of integrating these different pathways into a national energy system. Results show that biofuels can allow for an overall better performance in terms of avoided CO<sub>2</sub> emissions compared to direct combustion of biomass. To exploit this potential, however, it is necessary to link the production of biofuels to a wider deployment of the corresponding efficient end-use technologies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Application of green energy technology</title><p id="Par60">Decarbonization of the power sector is a prime remedial action to secure a maximum 2âÂ°C rise of atmospheric temperature by the twenty-first century. According to the 2âÂ°C scenario (2DS), the global power sector should have a net zero CO<sub>2</sub> emission by 2060. This would require 74% of global power generation from renewables, 7% from fossil fuels with CCS, 15% from nuclear and remaining 4% from natural gas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Currently, two main approaches can be adopted for the use of green energy in the industrial sector: (a) direct use of electricity/heat energy from renewables, (b) energy from fossil fuels integrated with CO<sub>2</sub> capture and utilization. Figure <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> shows the characteristics of the sustainable energy generation system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Use of clean electrical energy from sustainable sources can create a carbon neutral industrial atmosphere. Industrial processes, which cannot be electrified can reduce their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by increasing the energy efficiency and using energy from renewables. In this section a brief analysis of the usability of green energy technologies is presented.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Sustainable energy generation system</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42480_2019_8_Fig10_HTML.png" id="MO10"/></fig></p><p id="Par61">Energy from renewables including solar PV (photo voltaic), wind, hydropower, bioenergy, geothermal, and concentrating solar power can have low carbon footprint. Power generation using solar PV showed a record growth of 34% in 2017 and new additions to the capacity are on track as per the 2DS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. By 2020 the global solar PV installed capacity is expected to be 725 GW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and it is anticipated that the average levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is expected to be about 13.3 US cents / kwh and by 2050 the LCOE will be about 5.6 US cents /kwh, which will be an economically feasible option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. At present in some regions the energy from renewables is cheaper than the energy from fossil fuels. For instance: i) in Iceland and other specific locations, the use of geothermal hot water is less expensive than coal or oil heated water for heating buildings; ii) in the US Pacific Northwest hydropower is more economical than other alternatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. However, capacity additions in renewable power sectors need more attention to be aligned with sustainable targets. In addition, the energy from renewables is often intermittent in nature and mature technologies are not available to meet the base load demand. For instance, currently, the progress of solar power utilization is in line with the sustainability targets. The power generation is expected to increase to 27âÃâ10<sup>8</sup> MWh by 2030. To harvest the solar power, modern technology requires approximately 0.02âkm<sup>2</sup> of land for 1 MWh power output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. By 2030, 54âÃâ10<sup>6</sup>âkm<sup>2</sup> of land will be required, which is 36.25% of the total land area of the planet, to meet the projected capacity. To meet the sustainable targets by the twenty-first century, the land required by renewable power plants will be more than 50% of the land available on earth, which is not a viable option. Therefore, to meet the baseload demand, increase of renewables-based power production capacity without significant improvement in energy efficiency can pose a serious threat to ecosystems. As an alternative to this, energy from fossil fuels integrated with CO<sub>2</sub> capture and nuclear power integrated with zero hazardous emission could lead to potential green energy technologies and sustainable energy resources to meet the global base load demand in the near future. At the end, a judicious mix of use of fossil fuels with CO<sub>2</sub> capture, nuclear power with zero hazardous emission and renewable energy can be a more sustainable and viable option rather than using a single source of power.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Power from fossil fuels combined with CO<sub>2</sub> capture</title><p id="Par62">Today around 39.9% of the power industry uses coal while natural gas contributes around 22.6% for electricity generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. However, besides being one of the most economical options for large scale electricity generation, these conventional power plants also contribute huge amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, performance enhancement of fossil fuel based power plants through increased efficiency and thereby reduced fuel consumption and gas emissions has received much research interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Currently, thermal efficiency of modern power plants range between 43 and 55% for subcritical and supercritical coal-fired power plants, while it is 62% for combined cycle thermal power plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. However, to achieve sustainability, the improvement in conversion technologies need to be matched with CO<sub>2</sub> emissions reduction technologies. During the last decade, integration of CO<sub>2</sub> capture technologies with power generation plants with the goal to transform thermal power plants into sustainable technology has received much attention. A search of the literature between 2007 and 2017, found 28,000 patents and 5000 scientific documents.

To realize this option, electricity demand needs to be met from sustainable sources of energy supply, such as solar, wind and fossil energy integrated with CCS/CCU.</p><p id="Par64">Since the industrial revolution, the manufacturing sector has been evolving with new technologies at a rapid pace and delivering a wide variety of chemicals-based products needed by modern society. The demand for raw materials and energy has therefore been increasing continuously with increasing industrial productivity. However, to curtail the associated industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emissions within a sustainable target, serious efforts are needed to improve the energy efficiency of energy intensive manufacturing processes. Technologies to convert renewable energy resources to meet the energy demands need to be improved and made economically feasible. The complex and energy-intensive processes need to be replaced by more sustainable alternatives that are able to use energy of different qualities and forms. In chemical and related industries, PSE techniques such as process intensification and process integration have been playing a key role in generating new, innovative, integrated, more sustainable and energy efficient process alternatives. Innovations in some of the potential areas can open up new avenues for development of energy efficient industrial processes: (i) catalysis â objective: development of new catalysts such that the same conversion tasks can be performed at a much lower temperature and/or energy demand. Notable contributions in this area include: Davda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] proposed a single step low temperature (128âÂ°C) aqueous-phase reforming process for H<sub>2</sub> production from biomass-derived oxygenated hydrocarbons using metal catalyst. Recently, Yao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>] synthesized a catalyst consisting of layered gold clusters on molybdenum carbide (MoC) nanoparticles, which enables the water gas shift reaction at 150âÂ°C. Yabe et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] observed that La-doped Ni/ZrO<sub>2</sub> catalyst in the presence of 6.9 w electric field equivalent at 423âK has high dry reforming of methane activity with about 77.2% CH<sub>4</sub> and 87.6% CO<sub>2</sub> conversions. (ii) hybrid separations â objective: development of separation techniques based on exploiting the available driving force, which is inversely proportional to energy need. Recent developments in this direction include heat pumps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], dividing-wall columns, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] heat-integrated distillation column [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], multi-effect distillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], membrane distillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and hybrid schemes with membrane modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Due to their low price and easy availability, humans will still rely mainly on fossil fuels for the foreseeable future. Therefore, improvements should be placed on advanced energy generation and CO<sub>2</sub> capture technologies to minimize CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. To this end, technologies such as advanced gasification systems and chemical looping combustion (CLC), which has inherently zero net CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and high energy efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Additionally, integration of energy supply and demand at different levels can result in a more sustainable and optimal energy utilization. Thermal integration at unit level uses the latent stream energy content and minimizes the external utility requirement. Whereas application of combined cooling, heat and power system integration at process/site level can be more advantageous than thermal integration by means of interaction between the core processes and utilities. Energy integration at region level has a high potential to address the CO<sub>2</sub> emission problem at bulk scale by re-allocating the available sustainable energy resources. To perform energy integration at the region level, collection of energy demand and supply (existing and potential for addition) data and development of appropriate models is a good starting point.</p><p id="Par65">This paper has analyzed available data related to the current status of energy resources, energy consumption by various sectors and especially focused on the industrial sector, where chemicals and related industries are the largest consumers. Although many promising technologies with respect to reduction of energy and CO<sub>2</sub> emission management are available, their implementation and use is still lacking. Therefore, urgent action still needs to be taken if the planetâs temperature increase is to be controlled and kept to the agreed limit of 2âÂ°C. That is, a wider application of the most promising technologies that can make a significant impact is necessary. For example, replacement of all currently operating distillation columns with hybrid schemes that require minor changes and investment but promise significant energy reductions could be considered as a bold step in the right direction. Opportunities exist to tackle the challenges in a systematic and coordinated manner. The chemical and related industries offer these opportunities because they are energy intensive and therefore are prime targets for application of new and innovative technologies that are more sustainable. In this respect, process alternatives that lead to significant improvements need to be determined. Model based computer aided techniques that can quickly identify the promising alternatives must be employed for rapid and reliable resolution of the grand challenges facing us.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><sec><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Prof. P.
