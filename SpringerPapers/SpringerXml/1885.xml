In this review, the efficiency of both conventional and advanced treatment methods is discussed. The applicability of these treatments with phenol and some common derivatives is compared. Conventional treatments such as distillation, absorption, extraction, chemical oxidation, and electrochemical oxidation show high efficiencies with various phenolic compounds, while advanced treatments such as Fenton processes, ozonation, wet air oxidation, and photochemical treatment use less chemicals compared to the conventional ones but have high energy costs. Compared to physico-chemical treatment, biological treatment is environmentally friendly and energy saving, but it cannot treat high concentration pollutants. Enzymatic treatment has proven to be the best way to treat various phenolic compounds under mild conditions with different enzymes such as peroxidases, laccases, and tyrosinases.

id="Par2">Phenolic compounds are present in the effluents of various industries such as oil refining, petrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, coking operations, resin manufacturing, plastics, paint, pulp, paper, and wood products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Discharge of these compounds without treatment may lead to serious health risks to humans, animals, and aquatic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Phenol has been designated as a priority pollutant by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI) of Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. International regulatory bodies have set strict discharge limits for phenols for a sustainable environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For example, the EPA has set a water purity standard of less than 1Â ppb for phenol in surface water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The toxicity levels usually are in the range 9â25Â mg/L for both humans and aquatic life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Phenol possesses hazardous health effects that can be both acute and chronic. Long-term exposure can lead to irregular breathing, muscle weakness, tremor, coma, and respiratory arrest at lethal doses in humans. Human exposure to phenol results in the irritation of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Chronic effects due to phenol exposure can be anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, vertigo, salivation, and a dark coloration of the urine. Chronic exposure to phenols leads to irritation in the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems and liver, kidney, and cardiovascular tissues in animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Animal studies have shown fetal body weight reduction, growth retardation, and abnormal development in the offspring. Thus, there is a need to treat wastewater affected with phenolic compounds before discharge. Phenol exists in common derivatives such as Bisphenol A (BPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], chlorophenols (CPs), and phenolic endocrine disrupting compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The technologies described in this paper for removing phenols from industrial wastewater are classified as conventional and advanced methods.</p><p id="Par3">Conventional methods have been applied such as steam distillation, liquid-liquid extraction, adsorption, solid-phase extraction, wet air oxidation, catalytic wet air oxidation, and biodegradation for removal of phenols.</p><p id="Par4">Advanced technologies for removal of phenols include electrochemical oxidation, photo-oxidation, ozonation, UV/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, Fenton reaction, membrane processes and enzymatic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The time frame for this review was from 2013 through January 2016.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Distillation</title><p id="Par5">Distillation technologies for removal of phenols from water are all variants of steam distillation and thus have an energy requirement to be economically met. The technologies are either destructive or non-destructive, the latter allowing for recovery of the phenolics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Steam or azeotropic distillation based on the relative volatility of phenol is capable of purifying water containing phenol impurities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In another study, aqueous phenol solution was directly introduced into a novel steam plasma torch (steam plasma jet treatment), and phenol was rapidly decomposed in the thermal plasma jet, by the production of hydroxyl radicals that caused oxidative degradation of organic pollutants in aqueous solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The primary intermediates formed from phenol were pyrocatechol, hydroquinone, maleic acid, butanedioic acid, and muconic acid in the liquid phase, while the major gaseous products were H<sub>2</sub>, CO, and CO<sub>2</sub>. Steam thermal plasmas have high enthalpy and activity while, at the same time, they are eco-friendly, which makes them popular in the field of environmental remediation.</p><p id="Par6">Olive mill wastewater (OMW) is noted for its high organic load and the presence of phenolic compounds. Sklavos et al. used a solar distillation apparatus to investigate the solar drying of OMW and the recovery of phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties in the distillate. More than 50 types of phenolic compounds have been identified in OMW of which hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol are the two most common phenolic compounds detected. These two compounds have the capability to protect low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles from oxidative damage and have been approved by the European Food Safety Authority. Solar distillation parameters like temperature of the ambient air, vapor pressure inside the apparatus, phenolic recovery, retentate (sludge) production, and solar radiation were monitored during the experiments. Solar distillation also effected OMW dewatering within a very short time. Thus, solar distillation was suggested as an economical and eco-friendly process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>â¢].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Adsorption and Extraction</title><p id="Par7">Adsorption and extraction technologies for removal of phenols from water are effective from trace concentrations to percent concentrations, depending on the economics (including energy) of using and recycling the required secondary material, adsorbent, or extractant. Activated carbon is the most used and a highly efficient adsorption method. It is expensive but has been shown to be effective for removal of trace organic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>â¢]. Therefore, new options are being developed including chemical modification of the activated carbon, impregnation with nanoparticles, different sources of carbon, different activation methods, as well as substitution with low-cost biosorbents, such as lignocellulose and chitin/chitosan, which are promising alternatives to remove phenolic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>â¢, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Nadavala et al. studied the adsorption of phenolic compounds using pine bark, a lignocellulosic waste from forestry. The optimal pH was 6, reaching biosorption equilibrium in 120Â min, with a total biosorption capacity for phenol of 143Â mg/g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Another possible option is the combination of activated carbon with a biosorbent. For example, Huang et al. used a composite of activated carbon and chitosan (ratio of 1:1) to remove phenol as well as chromium (VI), achieving up to 95Â % removal of both, reaching equilibrium in 40Â min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A chemical modification of activated carbon was developed by Carvajal-Bernal et al., in which activated carbons of two different types, granular and pelletized, were impregnated with phosphoric acid or potassium hydroxide. Both impregnations modified the surface area, micropore volume, and the volume of mesopores due to reaction with superficial oxygen groups. Phosphoric acid promoted better adsorption of 2,4-dinitrophenol. On the other hand, potassium hydroxide did not show a benefit on the adsorption process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Substances like natural organic matter (NOM) can interfere in the removal of phenolic compounds such as Bisphenol A (BPA). For example, Park et al. impregnated powdered activated carbons (PACs) with different types of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPACs) to enhance the removal of BPA in the presence of organic matter. The adsorbents were PAC, ferrihydrite/PAC, magnetite/PAC, and hematite/PAC. Electron-microscopic analysis showed that the iron was impregnated in the PAC inner pores not on the surface at 12.6â17.4Â mg-Fe/g-PAC. Equilibrium for BPA and NOM on these IONPACs was reached at 150Â min. Adsorption of BPA was similar by all the adsorbents used; but for NOM, adsorption was better with the IONPACs. The Freundlich isotherms for both compounds showed greater adsorption for IONPAC adsorbents than for PAC. For example, the Freundlich isotherm coefficient (<italic>K</italic><sub>F</sub>; which corresponds to the adsorption capacity at unit equilibrium BPA concentration) for PAC was 94.1 and for IONPACs they were in the range 119â270, which means a greater sorption capacity for IONPACs than for bare PAC. It was also found that if the concentration of NOM increased, the BPA absorbed onto PAC was decreased; however, in the IONPAC, the adsorption capacity was nearly the same in the presence of large amounts of NOM, making it more stable in the presence of organic matter and enhancing the removal of both NOM and BPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>â¢].</p><p id="Par8">Liquid-liquid extraction, also known as conventional solvent extraction, is a standard, non-destructive process for treatment of phenolic compounds, suitable over a wide range of phenol concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; it is cost-effective in some circumstances. Liu et al. investigated the efficiency of using cumene as extractant for phenol in wastewater. The experiment was carried out with 100Â mg/L phenol aqueous solution and three parameters (temperature, pH, and extraction time) were studied. On the one hand, the extraction time did not have much effect on the phenol removal, whereas a change of temperature had an impact on the extent of phenol removal, for example, the phenol removal can increase 5Â % with a 30Â Â°C temperature raise. The cumene extraction process was pH-dependent, since phenol ionizes at high pH. The method performed well over a wide range of phenol concentrations (50â2200Â mg/L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Cloud-point extraction (CPE) is based on surfactants separating into two phases (coacervate and bulk aqueous solution) when the solution reaches a certain temperature, known as the cloud point. The phenolic compound will gather in the coacervate and can be separated from the surfactant by pH changes. El-Abbassi et al. used CPE to remove phenolic compounds from pretreated olive mill wastewater. With Triton X-100 as a surfactant, it was found that phenol removal was dependent on both the surfactant concentration and temperature. At a certain temperature above the cloud point (67Â Â°C), the phenol removal extent relied less on surfactant concentration when Triton X-100 concentration was higher than 5Â % (<italic>w</italic>/<italic>w</italic>). However, increasing temperature achieved a higher removal, for example, when the temperature was raised from 70 to 90Â Â°C, the removal increased 20Â % at the same Triton X-100 concentration, due to the phenol solubility change. Phenol removal of 66.5Â % (initial phenolic content is 9150Â mg/L) was observed using 10Â % Triton X-100 at 90Â Â°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Phenol Removal by Membrane Processes</title><p id="Par10">Membrane technologies are reliable and economically feasible to treat phenol and have many advantages such as low power consumption, high quality effluent, small footprint, and easy scaling up with membrane modules. However, consideration must be given to membrane fouling which can occur due to particles and colloids present in the feed streams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The most important membrane technologies used to remove phenols from wastewater are extractive membrane bioreactors and hollow fiber membranes; photocatalytic membrane reactors; high-pressure membrane processes such as nanofiltration, reverse osmosis, and pervaporation; and membrane distillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Extractive Membrane Bioreactors (EMBR) and Hollow Fiber Membranes</title><p id="Par11">An EMBR combines an aqueous-aqueous extractive membrane process and biodegradation to show high potential in treating phenol in wastewater.

Praveen and Loh investigated removal of phenol from wastewater by hollow fiber membranes impregnated with trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), which was immobilized in the hollow fiber membrane for removal of phenol.

Membranes like PDMS, urethane polymers, and poly(ether block amide) (PEBA) membranes have been used for phenol removal.

It was also found that higher BPA concentrations resulted in a decrease in nitrification activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Enzymatic Treatment</title><p id="Par38">Enzymatic treatment, taking inspiration from biological treatment, uses a biocatalyst, an enzyme, to carry out a transformation on phenolic compounds that leads to their removal from water. The process can have significant advantages (including cost-effectiveness) over conventional biological and chemical treatments, as long as the enzyme in question is available as a commodity at the right price [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>â¢]. In the early 1980s, Klibanov and co-workers started enzymatic treatment of aromatics using horseradish peroxidase (HRP). This technique can be applied as a primary treatment or in combination with a biological unit. Ease of control, reduced sludge volume, effectiveness over wide ranges of substrate concentration, pH, and salinity, short contact time, and no limitation due to shock loading are the major advantages of this method. Among all enzymes, oxidoreductases like laccases, tyrosinases, and peroxidases have the ability to catalyze removal of phenolic pollutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In contrast to biological treatment, the strategy involves polymerization of the target compounds, not breakdown, until the products reach their solubility limits and precipitate. In all cases, enzyme concentration is specified as standard units of activity (U) per volume.</p><p id="Par39">Tyrosinases and laccases are copper-containing enzymes. Tyrosinases catalyze <italic>o-</italic>hydroxylation of monophenols to <italic>o-</italic>diphenols followed by oxidation of <italic>o-</italic>diphenols to <italic>o-</italic>quinones. Non-enzymatic polymerization of the quinones forms insoluble products. Immobilizing tyrosinase covalently on nylon membrane, magnetic, or siliceous supports can enhance stability and industrial application of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Laccases are activated by molecular oxygen (four electrons), while heme-protein peroxidases are activated by hydrogen peroxide (two electrons). They each then carry out successive one-electron oxidation of reducing substrates like phenols to form the corresponding phenoxy radicals, and these radicals couple non-enzymatically to form dimers. Additional enzymatic cycles with these dimers lead eventually to polymers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Although HRP is the most studied heme-protein peroxidase, soybean peroxidase (SBP) has received lots of attention because of numerous advantages over HRP. SBP has proven to be an effective enzyme to remove phenol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Immobilization techniques such as support- or carrier-binding through physico-chemical interaction, encapsulation which traps enzyme inside the pores of the support, or covalent cross-linking of enzyme functional groups have been investigated to enable large-scale enzymatic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">Rezvani et al. immobilized SBP in a semi-permeable alginate membrane in a packed-bed bioreactor and studied the effect of different factors such as the flow rate, temperature, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration on phenol removal. For an initial phenol concentration of 1Â mM and 2.25Â U/mL enzyme, the optimal conditions obtained for a 97Â % removal were 56Â Â°C, 14Â mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and 5.5Â mL/min flow rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">A drawback in enzymatic treatment is inactivation of the enzyme, and one of the approaches to limit this is the use of additives. For example, Torres et al. studied the influence of the additives polyethylene glycol and Triton X-100 on the removal of phenol and other compounds from coffee-processing wastewater using soybean and turnip peroxidases. There was only an effect on the removal of phenol in the presence of the additives (a change in phenol oxidation of 50Â %) at pH 7 using turnip peroxidase. At pH 3 with turnip peroxidase, only Triton X-100 showed an effect in the oxidation of caffeic acid with a 22Â % increase. However, there was no influence on the oxidation of other phenolic compounds in the presence of these additives using SBP because previous work has shown that the additives inhibit enzyme deactivation by adsorption to solid polymeric products and in this process no precipitate formed; consistent with the proposed adsorption mechanism for inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Recent work from this lab has further characterized the Triton X-100 effect and turned it to advantage, on the one hand, through recycling of precipitates carrying active SBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], while on the other hand, exploiting the adsorption for concentrating SBP from a dilute hull extract as a route to cost-effective production of SBP for wastewater treatment applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Another plant peroxidase, from potato pulp has been successfully used by Kurnik et al. to remove over 90Â % of phenol from a manufacturing industry wastewater in a 2Â h reaction, with 2.59Â mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, for phenol in the range 0.02â0.1Â mM. The reaction was done over a wide range of pH (4â8); however, the phenol removal efficiency decreased sharply when the reaction was done at pH 10. In addition to pH, several concentrations of enzyme, phenol, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, were studied as well as range of temperatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par45">Extensive research continues to be carried out on phenol removal from water, from conventional methods like adsorption on activated carbon to new technologies such as enzymatic treatment. Improvements to overcome low efficiencies and high operational costs of conventional techniques provide attractive alternatives, for example low-cost adsorbents, chemical modification on the adsorbents to increase surface area, hybrid systems like electro-Fenton to increase the efficiency of phenol removal, achieving total destruction of diverse phenol compounds. Enzymatic treatment has proven to be an effective method with more than 95Â % phenol removal using different peroxidases such as soybean and horseradish. New developments in the use of additives substantially mitigate enzyme inactivation, hitherto the most important drawback in industrial application of enzymatic treatment.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Compliance with Ethical Standards</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p id="Par46">On behalf of all authors, the corresponding author states that there is no conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list id="BSec1"><title>Papers of particular interest, published recently, have been highlighted as: â¢ Of importance â¢â¢ Of major importance</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>We</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Treatment of phenolic wastewater by combined UF and NF/RO processes</article-title><source>Desalination</source><year>2015</year><volume>355</volume><fpage>68</fpage><lpage>74</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="other" assigning-authority="ChemPort ( Chemical Abstract Service )">1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXhvVSqtrrM</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.desal.2014.10.018</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kazemi</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Peydayesh</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Bandegi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohammadi</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Bakhtiari</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Stability and extraction study of phenolic wastewater treatment by supported liquid membrane using tributyl phosphate and sesame oil as liquid membrane</article-title><source>Chem Eng Res Des</source><year>2014</year><volume>92</volume><fpage>375</fpage><lpage>83</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="other" assigning-authority="ChemPort ( Chemical Abstract Service )">1:CAS:528:DC%2BC3sXhtlClurbI</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.cherd.2013.07.023</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mohammadi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Kargari</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanaeepur</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Abbassian</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Najafi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mofarrah</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Phenol removal from industrial wastewaters: a short review</article-title><source>Desalin Water Treat</source><year>2015</year><volume>53</volume><fpage>2215</fpage><lpage>34</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="other" assigning-authority="ChemPort ( Chemical Abstract Service )">1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2cXitV2lurw%3D</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/19443994.2014.883327</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) Section 313 Chemical list for reporting year 2014.
