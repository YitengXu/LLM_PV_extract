TSN essentially is a set of features that have been added to standard Ethernet. By bringing industrial-grade robustness and reliability to Ethernet, TSN offers an IEEE standard communication technology that can be used to enable deterministic communications for industrial applications. Being an IEEE standard<index-term id="ITerm5"><term>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</term><index-term><term>IEEE standard</term></index-term></index-term>, it enables interoperability between standard compliant industrial devices from different suppliers. TSN removes the need for physical separation of critical and noncritical communication networks, reducing the cost of the infrastructure needed to allow open data exchange between operations technology network and enterprise/information technology network – a concept that is at the heart of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). At the network system level, TSN supports deterministic communication based on network schedules that are distributed to devices via standard configuration interfaces.</p><p id="Par4">TSN standards address a wide range of functions, and their implementation<index-term id="ITerm6"><term>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</term><index-term><term>functions and implementation</term></index-term></index-term> can be similarly broad, encompassing various hardware elements such as endpoints and switches, embedded software, standard interfaces, routing algorithms, and configuration tools. To ensure the highest levels of TSN performance, a system-level solution is required that takes each element into account and provides a seamless interface between them. Seamless fault-tolerant communication and enhanced cybersecurity with robust network planning, configuration, and monitoring will be a necessity in the networks of the future.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Legacy Ethernet-Based Connectivity in Industrial Applications</title><p id="Par5">Today, there are multiple variants of Industrial Ethernet protocols available on the market. In most cases, the Industrial Ethernet protocol selected for use in industrial devices differs from vendor to vendor or from Industry Alliance to Industry Alliance, which means that devices are only compatible with other equipment from the same vendor or an Industry Alliance using the same protocol. This is known as manufacturer lock-in. It forces customers to either buy all industrial equipment from one vendor or a limited set of vendors who are part of the same Alliance. This approach may not be the most cost- and performance-optimized way to implement the required solution. If a customer chooses not to do this, there is considerable challenge of integrating equipment from multiple vendors into a single network system or there needs to be a set of protocol conversion gateways implemented between the various Industrial Ethernet protocols. Both options will lead to unnecessary expense and limit innovation on the factory floor over many years. Thus industrial automation architectures become hierarchical, purpose-built, and inflexible.</p><p id="Par6">This approach is currently undergoing a dramatic change with the advent of the IIoT and Industry 4.0, which demands for full automation and greater insights in manufacturing. These demands are pushing industrial automation architectures to become more flexible and seamless to interoperate. In these types of increasingly converged architectures, real-time connectivity is essential for controlling critical processes, as well as for collecting and analyzing data from machines, in a timely manner. TSN offers the real-time connectivity capabilities that match and sometimes exceed what current Industrial Ethernet protocols can provide, with the added flexibility of being based on IEEE standards. Similar to what is the norm in the enterprise world, TSN Ethernet can therefore be the common communication protocol that connects industrial equipment from different vendors, simultaneously delivering the very challenging functional requirements demanded by mission-critical embedded and industrial applications<index-term id="ITerm7"><term>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</term><index-term><term>embedded and industrial applications</term></index-term></index-term>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Key Benefits of<index-term id="ITerm8"><term>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</term><index-term><term>benefits of</term></index-term></index-term> TSN</title><p id="Par7">The primary strength of TSN is its status as an open standard–based technology, unaffiliated to any Industry Alliance or company. For an industrial automation market that has struggled for many years with multiple incompatible proprietary communication protocols, TSN brings several key benefits.</p><p id="Par8">TSN guarantees compatibility at the network level between devices from multiple suppliers. This gives customers much greater choice of devices for building their system, avoiding manufacturer lock-in and enabling seamless connectivity across various subsystems and systems.</p><p id="Par9">As TSN is part of the Ethernet standard family, it naturally scales with Ethernet, which means that the technology will not be limited in terms of bandwidth/speeds, thus allowing more and more sensors and actuators that are needed for implementing complex automation applications to be connected to a network system.</p><p id="Par10">TSN supports standards-based network configuration capabilities. This means that new nodes can be added to the network and discovered without the need for costly downtimes and manual configuration. New data streams can be added to the network without the risk of disturbing existing traffic and without the need to reconfigure the entire network.</p><p id="Par11">TSN can be used for communication<index-term id="ITerm9"><term>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</term><index-term><term>communication</term></index-term></index-term> between machines as well as from machines to enterprise systems. Communication between mission-critical TSN-based systems and existing noncritical Ethernet-based systems can be achieved over the same infrastructure. In other words, non-TSN Ethernet nodes can work over a TSN network, without modification.</p><p id="Par12">Overall system costs are significantly reduced when we adopt standards-based technology. Consumer choice and competition will result in lower device prices. Research, development, and maintenance costs are all driven down when solution providers and customers can focus on one standard technology rather than a number of different proprietary protocols and solutions.</p><p id="Par13">Breaking down communication barriers between critical and noncritical systems is a foundational concept of the IIoT and Industry 4.0. TSN enables the convergence of networks and systems that were previously kept separate for reasons of operational integrity, real-time performance, safety, and security.</p><p id="Par14">TSN allows time-critical messages to be sent over the same communication line as all other Ethernet traffic, without disturbance or increase in delay and with controlled delay variation. Different traffic classes can coexist on the network with no impact on higher criticality level traffic from traffic with lower priority.</p><p id="Par15">End-to-end latency<index-term id="ITerm10"><term>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</term><index-term><term>end-to-end latency</term></index-term></index-term> is guaranteed even under heavy traffic load, and standard mechanisms can be used to accelerate message transport for high-priority communications. Thus, the most challenging motion control and safety-critical applications can be converged with other Ethernet traffic on Ethernet networks using TSN.</p><p id="Par16">Convergence makes accessing data from industrial systems easier. With more systems on the same network, the task of gathering data from a wide variety of sources is simplified. Data from industrial systems can be sent to enterprise systems over standard Ethernet without the need for protocol conversion gateways. Overall system costs are significantly reduced by the convergence of different traffic classes on a single network infrastructure. Hardware and maintenance costs are lower because we need fewer devices and cables to build the network infrastructure.</p><p id="Par17">Higher layer protocols can be combined with TSN, as the technology is implemented primarily at the data link layer (OSI model layer 2).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> One example is the Open Platform Communications-Unified Architecture (OPC-UA) protocol.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>TSN Standards</title><p id="Par18">Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">5-1</xref> lists the TSN set of features that have been added to standard Ethernet<index-term id="ITerm11"><term>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</term><index-term><term>standard Ethernet</term></index-term></index-term>. The features are defined and published in a number of IEEE 802.1 standards that address topics such as timing, synchronization, forwarding, queuing, seamless redundancy, and stream reservation.

They are addressed by the 802.1AS and 802.1Qbv standards, respectively. All devices participating in the TSN network are synchronized to a global time and are aware of a network schedule that dictates when prioritized messages will be forwarded from each switch. TSN makes use of multiple queues per port at the egress of the switch, where messages are held until a gate opens (at a time slot specified by the schedule) to release queued messages for transmission. The timed release of messages ensures that delays in the network can be deterministically predicted and managed. This allows for the convergence of critical traffic and noncritical traffic on the same network.</p><p id="Par21">The preemption feature<index-term id="ITerm13"><term>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</term><index-term><term>preemption feature</term></index-term></index-term> defined in the TSN 802.1Qbu standard can be used to increase the efficiency of bandwidth use for noncritical messages. In highly converged networks, it could be the case that large low-priority frames are delayed by higher-priority traffic on the network and dropped. Preemption enables the transmission of large frames to be interrupted, sent in smaller fragments and reassembled at the next link. This maximizes bandwidth utilization for all traffic types on the TSN network. Another important benefit of message preemption is the reduction of transmission latency for so-called Express traffic, which can preempt regular (lower-priority) Ethernet packets. Especially on lower-speed networks (e.g., 10 or 100 megabits per second (Mbps)) carrying large regular Ethernet packets up to 1,500 bytes and more, the latency reduction for Express traffic can be useful for building converged networks.</p><p id="Par22">TSN provides a standard method for achieving seamless redundancy for industrial communication over Ethernet. The feature allows for the simultaneous transmission of duplicate message copies across different paths in the network. The first message copy to be received in time without error is processed, while the other copies are discarded. This adds another layer of determinism to the delivery of critical messages in converged networks.</p><p id="Par23">A crucial feature of TSN is the support for open, vendor-independent network configuration. This is achieved through the standardization in IEEE of YANG models for various TSN standards. These can be configured over the NETCONF protocol using encoding formats such as XML or JSON. YANG models for bridging, traffic scheduling, frame preemption, seamless redundancy, and policing ensure that configuration of key TSN features is done according to standard methods. This allows TSN networks to be composed of any standard compliant device from any vendor and can be configured by any standard compliant network configuration software.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>TSN Profiles<index-term id="ITerm14"><term>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</term><index-term><term>profiles</term></index-term></index-term></title><p id="Par24">TSN is essentially a toolbox of features that address various needs such as reliability, bounded low latency, time synchronization, and resource management. These capabilities are realized through various TSN specifications (e.g., IEEE 802.1AS-Rev, IEEE 802.1Qbv, etc.), and customers can choose the relevant standards to implement based on their specific application needs.

Based on the shared global time provided by 802.1AS, a schedule is created and distributed between participating network devices. 802.1Qbv defines the mechanisms for controlling the flow of queued traffic through gates at the egress of a TSN switch (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">5-3</xref>). Frames are assigned to queues based on Quality of Service (QoS) priority<index-term id="ITerm19"><term>Quality of Service (QoS) priority</term></index-term>. The transmission of messages from these queues is executed during scheduled time windows. Other queues will typically be blocked from transmission during these time windows, therefore removing the chance of scheduled traffic being impeded by nonscheduled traffic. In other words, there is a gate in front of each queue which opens at a specific point of time which is reserved for that queue. This means that the delay through each switch is deterministic and that message latency through a network of TSN-enabled components can be guaranteed. The IEEE 802.1Qbv standard defines up to eight queues per port for forwarding traffic. The scheduler is designed to separate the communication on the Ethernet network into fixed length, repeating time cycles.</p><p id="Par28">Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">5-3</xref> shows an example with four queues, with a cycle time of td and guard band of tg. At time t0, the time-critical data queue, Queue 3 is open. Once that frame is transmitted, the best effort Queues 0, 1, and 2 are opened. Before the end of the cycle, at time t0-tg, all the non-time-critical data is blocked, so that the port is free to transmit the time-critical data at the start of the next cycle. This is essentially a time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 5-3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>802.1Qbv operation<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/430190_1_En_5_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>802.1Qbu</title><p id="Par29">Frame Preemption<index-term id="ITerm20"><term>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</term><index-term><term>profiles</term><index-term><term>frame preemption (802.1Qbu)</term></index-term></index-term></index-term>: While the 802.1Qbv mechanisms protect critical messages against interference from other network traffic, it does not necessarily result in optimal bandwidth usage or minimal communication latency. Where these factors are important, the preemption mechanism defined in 802.1Qbu can be used (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">5-4</xref>). 802.1Qbu allows the transmission of standard Ethernet or jumbo frames to be interrupted in order to allow the transmission of high-priority frames, and then resumed afterward without discarding the previously transmitted piece of the interrupted message. Frame preemption always operates on a link-by-link basis. A frame is only fragmented from one Ethernet switch to the next Ethernet switch, where it is reassembled.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 5-4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>802.1Qbu frame preemption<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn6">6</xref></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/430190_1_En_5_Fig4_HTML.jpg" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par30">In Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">5-4</xref>, without preemption as shown in the top, if a high-priority frame in Queue 3 arrives after a low-priority frame, the high-priority frame is delayed until the transmission of the low-priority frame is finished. In the case of an Ethernet port with preemption enabled, as shown in the bottom, the low-priority traffic passes through a preemptable MAC. The transmission of the low-priority frame is stopped, once a high-priority frame arrives and the high-priority frame from Queue 3 is allowed to go out. Once the transmission of the high-priority frame is completed, the rest of the low-priority frame is transmitted. Each partial frame is completed by a CRC32 for error detection. In contrast to the regular Ethernet CRC32, the last 16 bits are inverted to make a partial frame distinguishable from a standard Ethernet frame. Also the start frame delimiter (SFD) is changed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>802.1CB</title><p id="Par31">Frame Replication and Elimination: Redundancy management implemented in 802.1CB follows similar approaches known from High-Availability Seamless Redundancy (HSR) (IEC 62439-3 Clause 5) and Parallel Redundancy Protocol (PRP) (IEC 62439-3 Clause 4). It supports zero switch over time when a link fails or frames are dropped. To increase availability, redundant copies of the same messages are communicated in parallel over disjoint paths through the network as shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5-5</xref>. Time-critical frames are expanded to include a sequence number, and then they are replicated where each identical copy follows a separate path in the network. The redundancy management mechanism then combines these redundant messages to generate a single stream of information to the receiver(s). At any point in the network where the separate paths join again, duplicate frames can be eliminated from the stream as shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5-5</xref>. The 802.1Qca standard for Path Control and Reservation defines how such paths can be set up.

It works at the ingress of the switch (forwarding engine) in order to protect the outgoing queues from being flooded with frames. In this process, the data packets are checked to ensure that they fit to a reserved data stream at the network input. If this is not the case, the packet will be filtered out and rejected and won’t be forwarded further. This can be leveraged to prevent attacks on level 2 of the OSI layer model. It utilizes well-known flow identifiers and policers used in the industry. Per-Stream Filtering and Policing (PSFP) allows filtering and policing decisions to be made on a per-stream basis. The various stages of data flow for one stream are depicted in Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">5-7</xref>.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 5-7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>802.1Qci per-stream filtering and policing</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/430190_1_En_5_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>802.1Qch</title><p id="Par35">Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding<index-term id="ITerm25"><term>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</term><index-term><term>profiles</term><index-term><term>Cycling Queuing and Forwarding (802.1Qch)</term></index-term></index-term></index-term>: This defines cycles for forwarding traffic that is queued using 802.1Qci to assign buffers and 802.1Qbv to shape traffic. This cyclic enqueuing and queue draining procedure gives a defined (but not optimal) upper boundary for latency. Basically this is a simplified way to use TSN if controlled timing is desired, but reducing latency to absolute minimum is not highly important. The synchronized operations effectively allow bridges to synchronize their frame transmissions in a cyclic manner, achieving zero congestion loss and bounded latency, independently of the network topology.</p><p id="Par36">In this scheme, time-sensitive streams are scheduled (enqueued and dequeued) at each time interval resulting in a worst-case deterministic delay of two times the cycle time between the sender (talker) and the next (intermediate) receiver (listener). As shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">5-8</xref>, each high-priority traffic frame scheduled on a cycle is scheduled to be received at the next bridge in the next cycle. A guard band before the start of the cycle prevents any interfering low-priority traffic from affecting the high-priority traffic. 802.1Qch can be combined with frame preemption, to reduce the cycle time from the transmission time of a full size frame to the transmission time of a minimum size frame fragment. Thus, preemption can improve the performance for high-priority traffic. For this to work correctly, all frames must be kept to their allotted cycles, that is, all transmitted frames must be received during the expected cycle at the receiving bridge.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 5-8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>802.1Qch operation with preemption (802.1Qbu)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn9">9</xref></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/430190_1_En_5_Fig8_HTML.png" id="MO8"/></fig></p><p id="Par37">To summarize, the network transit latency of a frame is completely characterized by the cycle time and the number of hops.

Previously described TSN standards such as Time-Aware Shaper (802.1Qbv) and Cyclic Queuing and Forwarding (802.1Qch) depend on network-wide coordinated time and packet transmission at enforced periodic cycles, resulting in suboptimal utilization of available network bandwidth. 802.1Qcr operates asynchronously, without the need for bridges and endpoints to synchronize in time. Therefore, it is expected that this technique can utilize available network bandwidth efficiently under heavy link utilization with mixed criticality traffic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>TSN and Security</title><p id="Par39">Since TSN is Ethernet based, the security mechanisms<index-term id="ITerm27"><term>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</term><index-term><term>profiles</term><index-term><term>security mechanisms</term></index-term></index-term></index-term> that are state of the art today can be employed to secure the TSN network. Traditional security solutions such as firewalls will be the key to this. Since firewalls need to inspect packets, the resulting computational overhead in firewalls can create an additional transmission delay. This delay should be taken into account while configuring the TSN network schedules. If security mechanisms introduce longer delays than that are tolerable by the TSN application, they can be implemented at the border or periphery of the TSN network, such as an Industrial Demilitarized Zone that connects the TSN industrial control network to the rest of the IT system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>OPC-UA Over TSN</title><p id="Par40">Of the many higher layer industrial communication protocols that could be combined with TSN, one of the prominent ones is OPC-UA. Much like TSN, OPC-UA<index-term id="ITerm28"><term>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</term><index-term><term>OPC-UA</term></index-term></index-term> is an open, standard technology that is vendor independent and useful for a wide range of industrial applications. The combination of OPC-UA and TSN therefore provides a complete open, standard, and interoperable solution that fulfills a plurality of industrial communication requirements.</p><p id="Par41">By representing data in a uniform way, OPC-UA enables interoperability between devices that could not previously share data and gives you new insight into a wealth of information. For this reason, it has been adopted and integrated into products by all of the major industrial automation vendors. OPC-UA was originally limited to a client or server architecture; however the recently released publish/subscribe (PubSub) extension<index-term id="ITerm29"><term>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</term><index-term><term>publish/subscribe (PubSub) extension</term></index-term></index-term> now enables multicast communication. In combination with TSN, OPC-UA PubSub allows data to be sent with precise timing and thus be used for real-time industrial applications as illustrated in Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5-9</xref>. In the horizontal direction, OPC-UA-based controller-to-controller communication can be done over TSN. In the vertical direction, OPC-UA-based controller-to-cloud communication can be done directly, via a gateway or broker. This enables IT (Information Technology) systems having less stringent timing requirements to interwork with OT (Operations Technology) systems that need guaranteed data delivery with precise timing.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Figure 5-9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Factory automation network<index-term id="ITerm30"><term>Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)</term><index-term><term>factory automation network</term></index-term></index-term> with OPC-UA over TSN</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/430190_1_En_5_Fig9_HTML.jpg" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par42">OPC-UA also enables a standard method for configuring TSN networks online and in a dynamic way.

In these situations, low-power wide area networks (LPWAN) or Narrowband IoT technologies could come to the rescue.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Considerations for Choosing Wireless Technologies for IoT</title><p id="Par45">There are many wireless networking technologies that are deployed in IoT today, each with a different set of capabilities.

Access to licensed spectrum is typically purchased from local government to provide an organization exclusive access to a particular channel in a particular location. Operation in that channel should be largely free of interference from competing radios. The drawback is that the spectrum of interest may be extremely scarce or expensive to access. In some other cases, radio connectivity bands allowed in one country may not be available in other geographical area for same usage. For instance, mobile networks in India use the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz frequency bands, while GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) carriers in the United States operate in 850 MHz and 1900 MHz frequency bands. To deploy an IoT device globally, then it may have to support multiple radio bands making the device costly as well as time-consuming to develop. Even when more easily accessible, it can take months to gain the approval to operate, so licensed bands are not well suited to rapid deployments. Unlicensed spectrum is generally open and available to anybody to use with no exclusive rights granted to any particular organization or individual. The downside is that competing systems may occupy the same channel at different power levels leading to interference. Manufacturers of radio systems operating in unlicensed bands include capabilities in these radios to adapt their operation for this potential interference. These techniques include adaptive modulation, automatic transmit power control and out-of-band filtering, and so on.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Range and Capacity<index-term id="ITerm35"><term>Range and Capacity</term></index-term><index-term id="ITerm36"><term>Wireless connectivity technologies</term><index-term><term>range and capacity</term></index-term></index-term></title><p id="Par47">Several factors impact the amount of data capacity that can be delivered at a particular distance. Those factors include spectrum, channel bandwidth, transmitter power, terrain, noise immunity, and antenna size. In general, the longer the distance to be covered, the lower the data capacity. The longest propagation distance can be achieved by using a low-frequency narrowband channel with a high-gain antenna, while higher capacities could be achieved by selecting wider channels, with limited range. For optimal performance for each application, we need to choose the best combination of channel size, antenna, and radio power and modulation schemes to achieve the desired capacity.</p><p id="Par48">A radio link can be described as being line of sight when there is a direct optical path between the two radios making up the link. A link is called non-line of sight when there is some obstruction between the two radios. Near line of sight is simply a partial obstruction rather than a complete obstruction. In general, lower-frequency solutions have better propagation characteristics than higher frequencies. Higher-frequency solutions that operate in multi-gigahertz range are typically line-of-sight or near line-of-sight systems. From 1 GHz to 6 GHz range, the propagation characteristics capabilities will vary depending on other factors, and typically below 1 GHz the propagation becomes much better, making those frequencies suitable for longer range.

A Wi-Fi network<index-term id="ITerm46"><term>Wi-Fi network</term></index-term> can be used to connect electronic devices to each other, to the Internet, and to wired networks that use Ethernet technology. It can provide real-world performance similar to that of basic wired networks. Wi-Fi networks operate in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz radio bands, with some products that contain both bands (dual-band). Wi-Fi is also pushing into a third band – the 60 GHz band – using ultra-wideband channels and the baseband solution originally developed by WiGig. The Wi-Fi Alliance is a wireless industry organization that promotes wireless technologies that are based on IEEE 802.11 and their interoperability<index-term id="ITerm47"><term>Wi-Fi network</term><index-term><term>interoperability</term></index-term></index-term>. The Alliance also certifies products that comply with its specifications for Wi-Fi interoperability, security, and application-specific protocols.</p><p id="Par59">Wi-Fi offers low power consumption and low cost relative to cellular. Unlike cellular<index-term id="ITerm48"><term>Wi-Fi network</term><index-term><term>cellular</term></index-term></index-term>, Wi-Fi operates in unlicensed spectrum, resulting also in lower data transmission costs. Range is limited by proximity to a wireless router or relays, and the quality of connection can be diminished by network congestion. There are several different Wi-Fi standards optimized for IoT applications. Next, we will take a brief look at them.</p><p id="Par60">Wi-Fi Direct enables two or more devices to connect directly in the absence of a traditional Wi-Fi hotspot.</p><p id="Par61">With the broad availability of the 802.11ac Wi-Fi standard, Wi-Fi operates in the 5 GHz band with wider channels (Note: 802.11n could also operate in 5 GHz but in smaller channels), thus enabling more capacity. Theoretical throughput of 11ac can exceed 1 Gbps.</p><p id="Par62">Also known as Low-Power<index-term id="ITerm49"><term>Wi-Fi network</term><index-term><term>Low-Power</term></index-term></index-term> Wi-Fi, 802.11ah operates in the sub-1 GHz band. It is viewed as central to IoT, given support for extended range Wi-Fi and efficient power profile. 11ah extends Wi-Fi beyond 2.4 and 5 GHz, enabling coverage in challenging environments such as in building, basements, and so on. It also supports low-cost sensors without a power amplifier, and minimum data rates result in short-term data bursts.</p><p id="Par63">802.11p is an approved standard for vehicle-to-vehicle communications. It uses dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) for applications such as toll collection, interaction between cars, and safety and roadside communications.</p><p id="Par64">With the increased adoption of Wi-Fi networks for IoT applications arose the need for providing wireless network in places where connecting an access point (AP)<index-term id="ITerm50"><term>Wi-Fi network</term><index-term><term>access point</term></index-term></index-term><index-term id="ITerm51"><term>Access point (AP)</term></index-term> to wired network infrastructure (e.g., a wired Ethernet switch) was not possible. A typical example would be the case of positioning an AP in the middle of a large warehouse, since the length of an Ethernet cable is limited to 100 meters. Some other use cases are the extension of an indoor wireless network to a parking lot or a campus, providing Wi-Fi coverage to outdoor industrial areas such as an oil refinery and others. Such a network can service applications like wireless security cameras, utility meters, flow and pressure sensors, vehicle tracking systems, and so on.</p><p id="Par65">802.11s defines Wi-Fi mesh networking<index-term id="ITerm52"><term>Wi-Fi network</term><index-term><term>mesh networking</term></index-term></index-term>. As shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">5-13</xref>, mesh networks allow rapid deployment with lower-cost backhaul, and they make providing coverage in hard-to-wire areas easier. Inherently, mesh networks are self-healing, resilient, and extensible. Under the right conditions, they increase the range of the network due to multihop forwarding and provide higher bandwidth and better battery life due to the lower power transmissions caused by shorter hops between neighboring nodes.<fig id="Fig13"><label>Figure 5-13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison of classic and mesh wireless<index-term id="ITerm53"><term>Wi-Fi network</term><index-term><term>classic and mesh wireless</term></index-term></index-term> local area network topologies</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/430190_1_En_5_Fig13_HTML.png" id="MO13"/></fig></p><p id="Par66">Wi-Fi uses TCP/IP stack<index-term id="ITerm54"><term>Wi-Fi network</term><index-term><term>TCP/IP stack</term></index-term></index-term> for Internet connectivity. Wi-Fi technology is hugely popular for consumer electronics and enterprise applications due to its ubiquitous presence in laptops, tablets, smartphones, and home entertainment devices. Wi-Fi access points are deployed today in many public spaces such as stadiums, airports, bus and railway stations, coffee shops, and schools. They are also present in most homes and offices. The increasing demand for cost-effective and easy Internet access along with the interoperability and ecosystem programs run by Wi-Fi Alliance has contributed to the wide adoption of this technology across the world. This worldwide availability makes Wi-Fi a natural choice for IoT connectivity, for applications that can leverage existing infrastructure without the need for custom protocol translators or gateways.</p><p id="Par67">Today, most Wi-Fi networks operate in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz ISM (industrial, scientific, and medical) band<index-term id="ITerm55"><term>Wi-Fi network</term><index-term><term>industrial, scientific, and medical band</term></index-term></index-term>. With more channels being available in the 5 GHz spectrum, higher data rates are possible. Wi-Fi networks have a start topology, with the access point acting as an Internet gateway. The transmit power permitted by Wi-Fi standards are high enough to enable in-home coverage in many cases. In large buildings, multiple access points and range extenders are often deployed at different locations to ensure adequate coverage and to avoid dead zones. Some Wi-Fi products support multiple antennae and transmitter and receiver chains for diversity. This helps in overcoming dead zones as well as increases data throughput.</p><p id="Par68">Wi-Fi and TCP/IP software stacks<index-term id="ITerm56"><term>Wi-Fi network</term><index-term><term>TCP/IP software stacks</term></index-term></index-term> are fairly complex and big in size. In traditional applications like laptops, smartphones, and tablets with adequate processing power and memory footprint, this was not a major issue. IoT devices – or things – often come with very low processing power and memory size and are typically battery powered. Till recently, adding Wi-Fi connectivity to those devices was neither practical nor cost-effective. Today, many wireless modules with embedded microcontrollers that run the TCP/IP stack and Wi-Fi software are available, thus offloading the task of networking from the main microprocessor unit. Wi-Fi devices targeted for low data rate IoT applications apply advanced sleep protocols and support fast on/off times to reduce the average power consumption dramatically. Since many IoT applications do not need the maximum data rates that Wi-Fi offers, intelligent power management techniques can efficiently draw bursts of current from the battery for very short intervals and keep products connected to the Internet for multiple years without battery replacement.</p><p id="Par69">Wi-Fi modules<index-term id="ITerm57"><term>Wi-Fi network</term><index-term><term>modules</term></index-term></index-term> for IoT applications typically integrate the RF frontend, thus eliminating the need for extensive radio design experience for the embedded system designer. They often come pre-certified for regulatory compliance such as FCC (Federal Communications Commission) in the United States, thus making the system certification process less time-consuming. Wi-Fi is the most ubiquitous wireless Internet connectivity technology today. Its high power and complexity has been a major barrier for IoT developers, but new silicon devices and modules reduce many of these barriers and enable Wi-Fi integration into emerging IoT applications and battery-operated devices. On the other hand, latest Wi-Fi standards offer very high bandwidth and capacity where needed, such as in video surveillance, retail, and sports arena applications. Thus Wi-Fi can support a wide variety of applications.

The Wi-Fi Alliance coined the term “Wi-Fi 6” when referring to the IEEE 802.11ax standard, indicating the sixth generation of Wi-Fi. Continued growth in the number of Wi-Fi-enabled devices, increased per-user traffic demand, greater number of users per access point (AP), higher-density Wi-Fi deployments, growing use of outdoor Wi-Fi, heterogeneous device and traffic types, and a desire for more power and spectral efficiency are all major driving forces behind 802.11ax. There are many 802.11ax enhancements in the 2.4 GHz band that will help increase the viability of Wi-Fi for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. These include target wake time (TWT), orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), 2 MHz clients, and coexistence improvements with other IoT wireless technologies. With sub-1 GHz Wi-Fi HaLow (802.11ah) having gained very little traction to date, there is still considerable potential for 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi in the IoT. If certain 2.4 GHz 802.11ax implementations can offer comparable battery life to 802.11n, or other short-range wireless IoT connectivity solutions, it may open new opportunities for Wi-Fi across several IoT vertical applications.

The new specification makes it easier for manufacturers to design and develop the inexpensive, compact, and low power consumption wireless LTE modems that LPWANs demand.</p><p id="Par143">LTE is an open standard, operates in a licensed portion of the RF spectrum, leverages existing infrastructure for coverage, and has coexistence mechanisms that enable scaling to high node counts per base station.</p><p id="Par144">Low-power LTE operates in up to 44 different licensed frequencies across the world, ranging from 450 MHz to 2.6 GHz. By using the licensed spectrum, the owners of the spectrum allocation (the carriers) can control and prioritize data, and the bands are immune from interference from other sources of RF radiation.</p><p id="Par145">Because the spectrum allocation isn’t shared with other RF transmissions, the coexistence between connected devices is much easier to manage. LTE’s coexistence technology is based on proven frequency- and time-domain solutions and other mechanisms such as “autonomous denials” of conflicting RF signals. Consequently, LTE can support a node density of up to 200,000 active low-power modems per base station. Finally, data carried over LTE is safe from prying eyes because the standard has incorporated advanced security from its inception. These features ensure that carriers can offer reliability and high quality of service.</p><p id="Par146">In contrast, proprietary technologies<index-term id="ITerm121"><term>Low-power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies</term><index-term><term>proprietary technologies</term></index-term></index-term> limit the participation in the vendor ecosystem and innovation in technology evolution over time. As they operate in unlicensed allocations of the RF spectrum (typically sub-1 GHz), coexistence could also be a challenge. They must share RF spectrum with many other services. While basic interference avoidance techniques are employed, so many services are sharing the spectrum allocation that it is extremely to match the node density, reliability, and quality of service of LTE.</p><p id="Par147">Proprietary LPWAN vendors are also faced with the major challenge of building infrastructure to support their networks. These are likely to be expensive and long-winded projects slowing adoption. In contrast, worldwide LTE infrastructure is largely in place comprising 480 networks in 157 countries. Some upgrading (mainly of software) is required to support low-power LTE, but this is relatively a less complex effort compared to building the infrastructure in the first place. Because the infrastructure is installed, support for low-power LTE is likely to be added rapidly, further encouraging its uptake. Companies adopting low-power LTE for their IoT-connected products can leverage this infrastructure without bearing its build or maintenance costs, instead investing in their own services and business models.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>A Case Study – Smart Homes</title><p id="Par148">A typical smart home gateway<index-term id="ITerm122"><term>Wireless connectivity technologies</term><index-term><term>smart home gateway</term></index-term></index-term> is illustrated in Figure <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">5-18</xref>.<fig id="Fig18"><label>Figure 5-18</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Smart home system<index-term id="ITerm123"><term>Smart home system</term></index-term> using multiple connectivity technologies<index-term id="ITerm124"><term>Multiple connectivity technologies</term></index-term></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/430190_1_En_5_Fig18_HTML.png" id="MO18"/></fig></p><p id="Par149">In reality, many IoT endpoints and gateways will employ multiple communication technologies based on cost, improved flexibility, and interoperability. A primary example is connected thermostat which incorporates both Wi-Fi and ZigBee. Many smart meters support cellular, ZigBee, RF mesh, and Wi-Fi capabilities. A key advantage of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth is that they are already embedded in essentially all smartphones. This type of coexistence of multiple technologies in a single system is illustrated in the smart home IoT system example shown earlier. The gateway supports Wi-Fi and Ethernet for LAN connections that need higher bandwidth such as audio and video applications. PAN and mesh networks based on Bluetooth Low Energy and ZigBee are used for energy-efficient sensors and controllers for lighting, security, and so on. The gateway provides WAN connectivity to Cloud using cellular technologies like LTE and 5G. Local analytics and intelligences provided by the gateway. The cloud service providers enable cloud-based applications to deliver the various services.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Summary</title><p id="Par150">There are many connectivity technologies that can be used for enabling IoT. Each one has its own benefits and shortcomings. One should choose a technology or a combination of technologies that is best suited for the application. Cost, ease of system integration, and security should also be considered along with features such as throughput, range, power consumption, network topology, and existing infrastructure.</p><p id="Par151">The IEEE has already standardized dozens of use cases and applications for IoT protocols. In addition to the basic communications standards discussed earlier (layer 2 in the OSI stack), which handle the underlying communications, there is a need for standardization at higher layers of the stack as well. Working groups belonging to many industry alliances such as OPC Foundation, Industrial Internet Consortium, 5G-ACIA, and ZigBee Alliance and standardization bodies such as ETSI coordinate and establish the priorities and enabling technologies of the Industrial Internet in order to accelerate market adoption and drive down the barriers to entry.</p></sec><sec
