been made over the last decades in thermal spray technologies, practices and applications. However, like other technologies, they have to continuously evolve to meet new problems and market requirements. This article aims to identify the current challenges limiting the evolution of these technologies and to propose research directions and priorities to meet these challenges. It was prepared on the basis of a collection of short articles written by experts in thermal spray who were asked to present a snapshot of the current state of their specific field, give their views on current challenges faced by the field and provide some guidance as to the R&amp;D required to meet these challenges. The article is divided in three sections that deal with the emerging thermal spray processes, coating properties and function, and biomedical, electronic, aerospace and energy generation

regarded as a key and environmentally friendly technology to design and modify the properties of surfaces and characteristics of components. It is commonly used in many industrial sectors including transport, energy, materials extraction and processing, biomedical and electronic applications (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>). The global market (revenue generated through material, equipment and coating manufacturing) was estimated at USD 7.58 billion in 2015 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 7.79% to reach USD 11.89 billion by 2021 (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). Market drivers include the rising demand for electricity production, air transport, automotive manufacturing and economic development.</p><p id="Par3">Thermal spray is being developed continuously to meet the challenges raised by the global market evolution and pressures put by the price competition, product and materials regulations and environmental, health and safety requirements. However, these challenges often come along with opportunities, e.g., environmental concerns about chrome electroplating hexavalent chromium have brought about the replacement of hard chrome coatings by the “greener” thermal spray coatings.</p><p id="Par4">Industry is responding to these challenges in a number of ways. They include the traditional concerns of industry (e.g., cost reduction, quality and reliability improvement, productivity and profitability increase with lean manufacturing approaches) and more risky approaches (e.g., development of new thermal spray coating processes, innovative plasma torch designs, new coating materials). However, the science often lags behind these developments, and technological issues may slow down or even stop them. Many universities and research institutes, worldwide, are attempting to better understand the science behind thermal spray and use it to address these issues. This article aims to identify the challenges posed by current market needs and propose research directions and priorities to meet these challenges. The formative idea is to develop a <italic>Thermal Spray Roadmap</italic> by surveying well-known experts in academia, research institutions and industry and soliciting their ideas on (i) the scientific and technology issues facing existing and emerging spray processes, coating materials and applications and (ii) the advances necessary to address these issues. A similar approach was followed by the plasma community in 2012 and resulted to the Plasma Road Map (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">The 2016 Thermal Spray Roadmap was built on the individual vision of the authors who responded to the request of the editors of Journal of Thermal Spray Technology. It does not claim to present a comprehensive picture of the status of the interdisciplinary and complex thermal spray domain; for example, environmental barrier coatings, automotive applications, process on line control are not tackled in this review despite their growing importance. Nevertheless, we believe that the ideas expressed in this roadmap reflect the current activity of the thermal spray community and we hope they will provide useful guidance regarding current and emerging issues that offer opportunities for R&amp;D investment for developing improved products, in terms of quality and performance at a lower life cycle cost.</p><p id="Par6">This review is divided into three sections. The first identifies the challenges faced by existing and emerging spray processes and suggestions for meeting these challenges. The second deals with traditional functions of spray coatings (resistance to wear and corrosion) and more recent applications; the last section is an overview of the issues ahead and of possible approaches to address them for biomedical, electronic, aircraft propulsion and energy generation applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Thermal Spray Processes</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cold Spray: Coatings and Additive Manufacturing</title><p id="Par26"><bold><italic>Bertrand Jodoin, Franck Gärtner, and Eric Irissou</italic></bold></p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Current State of the Field</title><p id="Par27">Cold gas dynamic spraying (also termed cold spray or Kinetic Spray) is the latest spray technique of the thermal spray (TS) processes family (that include plasma spraying and HVOF spraying). In cold spray (CS), compressed inert gases (typically nitrogen and helium) accelerate powder particles (typically metallic particles with diameters ranging between 10 and 100 μm) in a De Laval nozzle to supersonic speeds (up to 1000 m/s) prior to impact onto the substrate (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>). Process gas heating to temperature of up to 1000°C is applied to reach a higher velocity of sound of the gas passing the nozzle throat and thus higher particle velocities. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates schematically a CS setup. The spray particles are injected inside the nozzle to be directed toward the substrate to be coated. Upon impact with the substrate, the particles plastically deform resulting in a material flow directing outwards the contact zone disrupting the thin surface oxide films (cleaning effect). The particle and substrate interfaces are locally heated under the high strain rates causing thermal softening of the material to thresholds over compensating strain hardening and strain rate hardening, thus resulting in adiabatic shear instabilities (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). This results in intimate conformal contact between the exposed metal surfaces allowing mechanical and metallurgical bonding to occur, leading to the formation of a coating (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> presents examples of CS TiAlV64 particles after impact on a titanium substrate, demonstrating the high degree of local deformation and metallurgical bonding at interfaces of a removed particle.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of cold spray equipment setup</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2016_473_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Single impacts of cold-sprayed TiAlV 6 4 particles on titanium, showing (left) a cross section, (middle) particle flattening and jets under perspective view, and (right) a particle that was removed from the substrate.

Process gas temperatures are usually kept in a range that the sprayed particles are never exposed to temperatures close to their melting point. Consequently, the process is referred to as a solid-state process (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). As such, it is possible to spray temperature sensitive materials such as titanium (and alloys), copper (and alloys), aluminum (and alloys), nanocrystalline materials and metallic glasses without affecting the powder feedstock phase content and without oxide contamination (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). CS coatings usually present compressive residual stresses, allowing building thick coatings/layers. As such, CS can be used not only to build coatings but also to repair/rebuild/refurbish parts as an additive manufacturing process (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). Cold spray repairs have been so far mainly aimed at dimensional restoration while providing corrosion/oxidation/wear protection. The metal powder sprayed for part restoration may or may not be the same metal as the part being restored.</p><p id="Par29">CS is a green/environmentally friendly technology as it does not involve combustible fuels or gases. As a low-temperature process, it consumes limited energy, and the over sprayed expensive raw material can potentially be recycled. Commercial systems are available in both portable and stationary production versions. As such, the portable (hand held gun) system is a versatile tool that is suitable for front line, allowing in situ repairs with minimal surface preparation. Due to its nature, the process allows localized repairs, usually without or very limited masking and without bond coats and flashing (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">Many materials have been successfully sprayed by CS including Al, Cu, Ni, Ti, Ag, Zn, Ta, Nb and their alloys as well as composites such as Cu-W, Al-SiC, Al-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to name a few (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). CS is currently being used in the military, aerospace and energy industries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Current Challenges</title><p id="Par31">Among the challenges that CS faces, a major one is market penetration and diversification. Although many applications have been tailored for military, aerospace and energy industries, CS still lacks a “mass market” penetration as reached by plasma spray and HVOF spray processes and has yet to attract interest in other areas. This can be attributed to the lack of exposure to general markets that present strong potential for CS. Few job shops have CS systems operational and available, but time is required to get new specifications targeted for CS coatings. Particularly, repair approval cycles can take some times and are costly. As such, it is critical to engage industry on a continuing basis to communicate and educate potential users non-familiar with metal spraying about advantages, challenges and ultimately successes with CS.</p><p id="Par32">CS is facing technical challenge the fact that there are only a few commercially available powders that are specifically designed for this process. As such, the vast majority of coatings and repairs produced by CS are not using optimal feedstock powders (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). Current efforts aim for process and feedstock specifications to ensure enhanced performance by tailored feedstock powders with respect to phase contents and purity, both influencing the needed deformability. Specifications also aim for tuning powder size distributions, as smaller and larger particles may not be able to impact on the substrate with sufficient velocity to induce plastic deformation and  bonding.</p><p id="Par33">Over the last few years, CS has been seen as a potential additive manufacturing (AM) process that could complement powder bed AM processes. Simple AM parts have been produced by cold spray, but the ones reported have been limited to small sizes (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>). The transition of CS use beyond coatings and dimensional restorations into complex additive manufacturing applications presents several technical challenges as CS faces a number of commercial barriers as other AM methods. The major advantages of CS as an AM process compared to laser-based processes are mainly the minimal heat input of the process and the substantially larger deposition rates that can be achieved. These advantages potentially allow the process to be used without the requirement of an inert environment. With respect to the use of post-processing heat treatments, needed efforts could be similar to those for laser AM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Advances in Science and Technology to Meet the Challenges</title><p id="Par34">Within the last two decades, CS has developed from a laboratory deposition technique to a reliable process for applications that demand a high coating purity and the preservation of unique feedstock properties. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the layout of a central processing unit (CPU) cooling unit processed by CS (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>). Various manufacturers offer a range of CS equipment, each presenting their own benefits and having their potential niche market and with some successful commercial applications, either as a coating or as a repair/refurbishing process.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Layout for heat sinks as first commercial application in cold spray established in 2003. (a) Layer layout in cross section, (b) assembly of heat sink and cold-sprayed coating and finally soldered plate for heat distribution, (c) the verax P16Cu fan for CPU cooling</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2016_473_Fig3_HTML.jpg" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par35">However, tailoring of existing feedstock powder production methods or the development of new innovative processes to manufacture feedstock powders adapted to CS is of utmost importance for the technology to be able to expand further (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). As such, to be able to develop new markets for CS and strengthen the existing ones, it becomes crucial to have material manufacturers getting involved more closely with the CS community and potential end users to establish strategic partnerships to exchange information/requirement/specification that would lead to enhanced feedstock design tailored for applications. With respect to so far conventional spray materials, CS will increase its share in repair, but will have new markets by new solutions in production technologies as well as in additive manufacturing.</p><p id="Par36">The potential for CS to occupy a niche as an additive manufacturing process is undeniable, but it is in its early stage. In the design stage, AM build methodologies should be adapted to the specifics of CS (e.g., characteristic spot resolution and profile associated with nozzle geometry and gas particle flow dynamics) using tools such as process modeling, build strategy development (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>) and tool path programming with computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM). Although advances at the raw material level (e.g., feedstock optimization and/or tailored powders) as well as in equipment development [e.g., laser assisted spray, in situ machining and diagnostics (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>)] allow a wide range of materials to be sprayed (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>), obtaining bulk equivalent material properties remains a challenge and appropriate post-processing operations must be developed (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). Additional development in areas of non-destructive testing (NDT), automation and process control, as well as ensuring proper implementation of applicable environment, health, and safety (EH&amp;S) measures, is also required to grow from low volume to mass production. From an engineering perspective, the uncertainty in whether AM builds perform similarly to conventional parts requires rigorous qualification procedures and acceptance criteria to be developed.</p><p id="Par37">To discover the full potential of CS, recent efforts involve interdisciplinary approaches involving basic materials science and production technology. In new material developments, functional properties are very well tuned to applications. So far, only a couple of techniques such as CS, minimizing the heat input, can preserve or guarantee the desired materials behavior. The chance to preserve functional powder properties in coatings or massive parts is promising a completely new range of developments and markets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Aerosol Deposition Method</title><p id="Par38"><bold><italic>Jun Akedo and Kentaro Shinoda</italic></bold></p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Current State of the Field</title><p id="Par39">Lately, the aerosol deposition (AD) method has attracted attention as a fabrication technique for depositing ceramic coatings at room temperature. The AD method offers a unique approach for depositing ceramic coatings and involves the acceleration of solid-state submicron ceramic particles (both oxides and non-oxides) in a gas flow to a few hundred meters per second to impact with the substrate under vacuum. This procedure leads to the rapid formation of a dense, uniform and hard ceramic layer at room temperature without the need for additional heating to melt the particles of the starting powder, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The discovery of this phenomenon resulted in the birth of the AD method, and the phenomenon of depositing solid-state particles in this manner became known as room-temperature impact consolidation (RTIC) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>). The AD method is expected to not only reduce the energy consumption and cost, but also the difficulties associated with fabricating thin films or thick coatings using materials with complicated compositions, and the number of processes required to manufacture electronic devices. In addition, the method has led to a substantial improvement in the performance of these materials.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Cross-sectional images of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> powder particles and an AD coating observed by transmission electron microscopy (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2016_473_Fig4_HTML.gif" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par40">In 2007, TOTO commercialized a coating technology based on the AD method for semiconductor fabrication equipment. This coating technology, which employs Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coatings with a hardness on par with that of sapphire and produces coatings that are highly resistant to plasma erosion, has become indispensable for next-generation semiconductor fabrication equipment and improves chip yields dramatically (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Classification of AD Method in Spray Coating Technologies</title><p id="Par41">The AD method specified in this section is a process for the fabrication of ceramic coatings, which are produced by spraying fine solid powder particles under vacuum, by utilizing RTIC. This deposition mechanism is different from conventional thermal spray processes based on the melting and solidification of impacting particles (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Similar processes are known so-called vacuum cold spray or vacuum Kinetic Spray (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>). They can also be considered to be classified as AD methods here in terms of the deposition mechanism (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison of AD method to other spray coating processes based on collision of solid-state particles (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2016_473_Fig5_HTML.gif" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par42">The cold spray (CS) deposition method is well known in the research field of thermal spray technology (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>). This method involves the acceleration of large sized particles with a diameter exceeding 10 µm by a hot carrier gas heated to 300-1000°C and sprayed onto a substrate at atmospheric pressure by using an ultrasonic nozzle known as a Laval nozzle. The CS method is very similar to the AD method in terms of utilizing kinetic energy, but the production of ceramic coatings by this method has not been successful to date.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Apparatus and Procedure of AD Method</title><p id="Par43">The AD method entails spraying fine powder particles onto a substrate under vacuum. The principle of this method is rather simple; hence, the apparatus required for AD is also not so complex. In general, the AD system consists of an aerosol generator, a deposition chamber with a spray nozzle and a substrate holder, an evacuation system and process diagnostic tools if needed. The AD system only requires low vacuum levels; thus, a rotary vacuum pump coupled to a mechanical booster pump suffices to evacuate the chamber to a pressure of about 10 Pa-1 kPa during deposition. The apparatus is easy to scale up because of the simple principle on which it is based and the low vacuum conditions.</p><p id="Par44">Powder particles are mixed with a gas to generate an aerosol. This aerosol is ejected through a nozzle at low pressure and impacted onto a substrate. Sintered, ceramic powders with a particle size range of about 0.08-2 µm are typically used as the deposition particles. After suspension in the carrier gas to form an aerosol, the aerosol is accelerated to several hundreds of meters per second through an orifice with a width less than 1 mm. The formation of layers of an acceptable density and with the desired material properties requires the preferential use of particles with a particular size and morphology (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Current Challenges</title><p id="Par45">Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows a roadmap of the AD method. Applications of the AD method in microdevices, such as microactuators, RF-embedded passive components, high-speed optical modulators, were largely developed during the “Nano Structure Forming for Advanced Ceramic Integration Technology Project” as part of the Japan Nano Technology Program in 2002-2007. These microelectronic device applications were reported elsewhere (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>). The most notable feature of the AD method is that because the process is proceeded at room temperature, almost all kinds of materials can be used as raw powders (films) and substrates including ceramics, metals, polymers, bulk metallic glasses (BMG) and composites with various coating structures, such as single, multi- and gradient layer (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>), which are also good candidates for manufacturing energy-related devices such as dye-sensitized solar cells, all solid-state Li-ion batteries (LIB), solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), thermoelectric generators and heat dissipation circuit board for high power electric modules (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>). Medical applications such as ceramic coatings for dentures and artificial bones have also been studied (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Application load map of AD method</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2016_473_Fig6_HTML.gif" id="MO6"/></fig><fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of hybrid aerosol deposition</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2016_473_Fig7_HTML.gif" id="MO7"/></fig></p><p id="Par46">The deposition conditions of the AD method greatly depend on the properties of the raw materials and starting powder and leave many challenges and opportunities such as increasing the deposition efficiency, reducing the coating cost and obtaining improved coverage of the complicated surface of a three-dimensional object. Presently, the mechanism by which the collision of fine solid-state particles leads to deposition is yet to be elucidated. If the particle size is too large, erosion similar to that caused by grit blasting occurs; however, if the particles are too small, the particle inertia is insufficient to induce RTIC, leading to the formation of a pressed compact instead. Thus, a more detailed understanding of the RTIC process is required (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Advances in Science and Technology to Meet These Challenges</title><p id="Par47"><italic>Technological Advances in Microstructure and Applicable Substrates.</italic> An AD layer is composed of high-density and randomly oriented polycrystalline nanostructures with a crystallite size less than 20 nm. Electron diffraction imaging in transmission electron microscopy revealed neither amorphous layers nor hetero-structures at the boundary between crystal grains. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, clear lattice images with crystal grains sized less than 10 nm across were observed, as well as uniform microstructures at the boundary between the substrate and the deposited layer. For α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layers deposited at room temperature, the layer density was over 95% of the theoretical density and the Vickers hardness was over 1600 HV. Such α-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> layers are appropriate for use as wear-resistant coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>).</p><p id="Par48">Not only dense coatings but also porous coatings can be deposited by the AD method such as TiO<sub>2</sub> porous electrode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSC). In addition, recently, textured coatings were reported (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>). The low deposition temperature makes it possible to deposit ceramic coatings onto a plastic substrate.</p><p id="Par49"><italic>Scientific Understanding of the RTIC Mechanism.</italic> Understanding the RTIC phenomenon is the key to the development of the AD method. Observation of the AD microstructure by electron microscopy was the first approach to reveal the unique microstructure RTIC produces (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). Since the direct observation of this impacting phenomenon is difficult to perform with current techniques, an alternative evaluation technique is required to study RTIC. Particle velocity measurement was conducted utilizing a time-of-light method (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>), revealing that the velocity was of the order of 100-600 m/s, which is lower than that of the CS method, i.e., 400-1000 m/s. Based on the measured velocity, the temperature evolution was estimated by utilizing a finite element method, revealing that the increase in temperature was negligible compared to that of sintering or the melting temperature of ceramics (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>).</p><p id="Par50">The impact phenomena in the AD method were simulated by conducting a compression test of single particles.

This technique confirmed an improvement in the deposition ratio and layer function. Here, in addition to the effect of the pressure loading, the effects of surface activation of the solid particles and thermal heating were considered to be important. Therefore, for the purpose of developing these research results to a more practical level, we propose a hybrid AD (HAD) method to produce a new type of hybrid coating. This method is envisaged to variably change the deposition principle by introducing the thermal effect of the conventional thermal spray process to the AD method such that the HAD method benefits from both of these complimentary technologies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This new technique may lead to new approaches to depositing functionally graded materials to obtain new solutions and to applying coatings to three-dimensional objects.

The modified LPPS system was operated at higher than normal power levels and much lower than normal chamber pressures. Under these conditions, new forms of deposition are possible, and a fundamentally new family of thermal spray process technologies has emerged.</p><p id="Par54">These new process technologies can produce high-quality coatings over comparatively large areas with thicknesses (~1 to &gt;100 µm) that are impractical using traditional thermal spray or vapor deposition processes. Depending upon the specific process, deposition may be in the form of very fine molten droplets, vapor phase deposition, or a mixture of droplet and vapor deposition. Process feedstocks include very fine powder (typically &lt;25 µm), liquid and even gas. Droplet-dominated deposition produces a very fine lamellar microstructure, similar to traditional plasma spray processes. However, due to the very fine powder feedstock, these coatings can be much thinner than conventional plasma spray coatings. The vapor-deposited coatings tend to have columnar microstructures that are similar to coatings produced by physical vapor deposition (PVD) or chemical vapor deposition (CVD). However, deposition rates roughly an order of magnitude higher than those typical of PVD or CVD processes can be readily achieved, e.g., ~5 μm/min as compared to ~0.5 μm/min. Finally, unlike traditional plasma spray, direct line-of-sight is not always required for the vapor deposition processes. Gas flow in a VLPPS chamber can distribute vapor to non-line-of-sight locations where it can deposit to form a coating.</p><p id="Par55">The terminology for this versatile family of emerging coating technologies currently varies somewhat among different authors.

However, stresses within the coating caused by extreme operating temperatures and repeated thermal cycling limit the durability of the coatings in service. TBC coatings applied using EB-PVD have a specific columnar structure that is more strain tolerant at these high temperatures and stresses. The drawbacks of conventional PVD processes are the high investment costs and the low deposition rates. The advantage of the PS-PVD process is that it can apply these columnar TBCs at a significantly higher deposition rate, and it can coat complex geometries with non-line-of-sight surfaces in one coating run. Another benefit of PS-PVD is that the coatings produced out of the vapor phase do not close the cooling holes of the engine components as it would be the case in conventional plasma spraying from splats (Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>a). However, in order to use efficiently the large dimension of the plasma jet and to be competitive toward EB-PVD, it is essential to coat several parts simultaneously in the same run and make use of a rotary multiple part holder as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>b) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>).<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Coating surface around a cooling hole in as-sprayed condition (a), supersonic plasma jet of the PS-PVD process, penetrating the multiple part tooling holding 3 NGVs with additional heat shields for optimum heat distribution on the parts (b)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2016_473_Fig10_HTML.jpg" id="MO10"/></fig></p><p id="Par65">PS-PVD coatings exhibit outstanding endurance in furnace cycle testing and burner rig testing, exceeding that of EB-PVD coatings of a factor 1.3-2.7 (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>). Thermal conductivity measurements also indicate that PS-PVD coatings have a very low, stable thermal conductivity between 0.8 and 1.5 W/m K. While the erosion resistance of PS-PVD coatings is significantly lower than those produced using EB-PVD, it is comparable and even 4-5 times higher than the erosion resistance of APS TBCs with a ceramic top coat porosity of 15% (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>).</p><p id="Par66">The challenge of PS-PVD is the acceptance level from the OEMs. Thus, it has also to solve new issues such as CMAS (calcium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon oxides) which becomes more and more a problem for the coating life time due to the increased gas temperature in the engines (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>).

Because the plasma jet expanding at lower pressure is much broader and the molten powder in form of droplets is accelerated and spread on a larger spray pattern, many passes of the plasma jet over the substrate are necessary to build the first micron of layer. This has a positive effect by reducing the internal stresses of the coating and being less affected by the surface roughness of the substrate. The jet expansion at lower pressure also makes that the spray distance has less effect on the coating thickness distribution compared to APS. It is therefore not limited to produce such dense layers only on flat surfaces.</p><p id="Par68">These types of layers are used as functional coatings, such as thin and dense electrolyte coatings in applications like solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>a) and ion transport membranes (ITM) for gas separation applications (Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>b). In both cases, the choice of material specifically designed for PS-TF will allow the mixed transport of ions and/or electrons and the process will produce gas tight layers on either flat metallic porous substrates, as well as tubular ceramic supports.

They also found that the properties of the highly expanded jet at very low pressures (~200 Pa) are relatively uniform over a large volume. They attributed this to the low density of the surrounding chamber gas and laminar jet flow (Reynolds number ~100) resulting in weak interactions between the jet and the surrounding chamber atmosphere.

It means that, in the same plasma jet from a conventional spray torch, ethanol droplets will be fragmented very fast and then vaporized, while it will take at least twice that distance to water drops to be fragmented. Both plasma jet lengths are about the same as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>.<fig id="Fig16"><label>Fig. 16</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Suspensions behavior in a PTF4 type torch plasma jet: (a) ethanol based, (b) water based (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11666_2016_473_Fig16_HTML.gif" id="MO16"/></fig></p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par94">In both cases for spray distances <italic>z</italic> &gt; 4 cm, molten particle velocities correspond to St &lt; 1, but spraying at <italic>z</italic> &lt; 4 cm generates heat fluxes up to 30 MW/m<sup>2</sup> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>).

Different types of industrial HVOF spray torches have been used, like TopGun or Diamond Jet Hybride. To adapt a torch to a liquid feedstock, the powder injector is replaced by an appropriate injection system. More recent developments work with modifications of the combustion chamber geometry to count for the specific combustion conditions due to the presence of a liquid solvent (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>). Suspensions modify the combustion process that depends on the overall thermal power level of the torch, the type of solvent and the suspension feed rate. Thus, the combustion chamber geometry and barrel length should fit to the type of solid particles (particle size, melting temperature) and the type of solvent (water or alcohol). Fuel gases with higher combustion temperatures are necessary to provide enough energy for solvent evaporation and particle melting. Unsaturated hydrocarbons like ethylene and propylene are preferentially used for this purpose. In HVOF flame combustion, the Knudsen effect is negligible; thus, heat and impulse transfer to spray particles is much more effective than in SPS. Coating formation and microstructure depend on many process steps inside the torch: The way the liquid is injected into the combustion chamber (with or without atomization), the suspension fragmentation inside the combustion chamber, the type of solvent, the mass fraction and primary size distribution of solid particles. Simulations suggest that in some cases evaporation of solvent does not occur in the combustion chamber itself but near the expansion barrel entrance (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>). Velocities at typical spray distances (80-120 cm) of the HVSFS process are in the range of 700-1100 m/s, and these values are significantly higher compared to those achieved by standard SPS processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Current Challenges and Advances in Science and Technology to Meet These Challenges</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par96"><italic>Suspensions and solutions preparation</italic> As pointed out by Toma et al.

From an industrial point of view, water is preferred as an “easy to handle” solvent. However, for high melting temperature oxides, the use of organic solvents can be advantageous, but mostly with low concentrated suspension. Another issue is the relatively narrow window of parameters, which can be used to produce these coatings with desired properties.

To achieve control of the droplet diameters formed during atomization, which in turn has a direct influence on the melting process of powder particles, a controlled atomization during the injection can be advantageous. Moreover, the use of two-fluid nozzle demands a supplementary cooling system (water cooled or gas cooled). Resulting coating properties like its microhardness, porosity level and pore size and surface roughness depend on a multitude of parameters within the suspension spray process: Most important are: solvent type, particle size distribution, type of injection, combustion chamber and nozzle geometry, fuel gas type, absolute gas flow parameters and lambda value (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>).

The complexity of events determining the final delivered particle size is greater in the SPPS process compared to the SPS process because the chemical reactions present in the SPPS process can produce exothermic and endothermic events and changes in physical properties including the formations of gels and intermediate solid states.

Soluble forms of metal ions in use are typically inorganic salts such as nitrates, chlorides and sulfates, but in rare cases organic salts, e.g., isopropoxides, acetates and propionates, are also utilized. Once a suitable solution involving one or more components is found, the compositional ratios can be rapidly varied by simply mixing the salts in different proportions. In comparison, fabricating different compositional ratios for powder spray typically involve creating the solid with different compositions and then creating a flowable powder suitable for thermal spray often by spray drying followed by heat treatment. Creating sprayable powder for each new composition is time-consuming. With solution spray, exploring a large number of coating compositions can be achieved in a single spray day, which provides a huge advantage of composition screening for a specific technical application.

In the best cases, for example for YSZ, the weight fraction of equivalent oxide in the solution is around 22%. This means that for a given amount of ceramic there is 5× more materials injected into the torch to process a given amount of powder compared to powder injection, and in the case of an aqueous solution, the single largest energy contribution needed to create the melted oxide from the solution goes into the evaporation of water. Even with the chemical energy from combined oxidizer-reducer precursors, the deposition rate is generally 2× or more, lower than with powder spray.

As mentioned in the introduction, the sequence of physical states that a solution precursor undergoes affects the final delivered particle size which is a system-specific process. In some cases, finding a high-molarity affordable precursor is a challenge. For titania, we used a rather expensive precursor consisting of titanium isopropoxide and ethanol in which the equivalent weight fraction of oxide in the precursor is only 10% (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>). In other cases, unexpected differences in behavior arise from related precursors are seen. We have found the zirconium acetate, yttrium nitrate precursor, used for YSZ to be much better behaved than the yttrium nitrate, aluminum acetate precursor, in spite of the similarities. Also like powder spray in some not very frequently occurring cases, there can be selective loss of one element relative to another, there is very modest greater loss of the aluminum precursor relative to the yttrium one when making YAG, while in magnesia-yttria composites we have observed up to 85% loss of the magnesium relative to the yttrium (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>). Magnesium loss is also known to also occur in powder spray. It is then a characteristic of this process that within a given composition one can rapidly vary the component ratios but with each new composition come new challenges in finding a suitable precursor and getting it to work. It is often necessary to add components to the precursor to increase viscosity, for example poly vinyl alcohol, or add fuel to an oxidizing precursor like adding urea or ammonium acetate to the precursor to make it more energetic.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par135">Lack of good particle diagnostics for solution spray</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par136">The droplet injected in solution spray typically has a mean size of about 20 microns; however, the melted ceramic form in which the coating is made of is generally in the size range of low single digit micron or even smaller.

The lower deposition rate may advance with higher molarity precursors. Such precursors often come with high viscosity and special technology to deal with as this is necessary for a high-pressure liquid delivery system. Better energetics for the precursor has shown some promises for improving deposition rates as well. We note, however, that the energy needed to be added at the correct point in the process, producing extra heat in the plum far down stream that is still below the melting point of the materials in questions, may be more harm than good as it can create over heating of the substrate without the full benefit on melt state desired. Recent experiments show that alcohol generally burns significantly downstream from its injection point (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>). The challenge of the shorter standoff distance has seen some improvement using more stable, high energy torches as well as more energetic precursors; however, there is much yet to be understood. If the reason why suspension spray distances are larger can be determined, then insight may lead to further improvement in the solution precursor plasma spray. A better understanding of this process will be greatly aided by the development of viable particle diagnostics that can provide particle temperatures and velocities. As with all coating processes, the ideal process depends on a combination of cost and performance factors and the three strongest cases for the use of solution spray can at this time be made for making TBC with stress-relieving cracks, making thermographic coatings and most significantly for the rapid exploration and optimization of new compositions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec45"><title>Plasma Sources Development and Modeling</title><p id="Par138"><bold><italic>P.

This development resulted from both industrial-scale integration of the technology working in air, controlled atmosphere or soft vacuum (recently down to pressures of 0.1 kPa) and research with process modeling and measurements of plasma, particles in-flight and coating characterization.</p><sec id="Sec46"><title>Arc Plasma Torch Modeling</title><p id="Par140">Modeling is a powerful tool for the development of plasma sources in the thermal spray industry. It allows for the prediction of the flow, temperature and concentration field in the discharge and the associated electromagnetic fields. It allows also for the prediction of the thermal load on the electrodes and the plasma confinement environment. With the rapid development of computing power, modeling has evolved rapidly over the past decade allowing for its use on a regular basis in source or process developments. Model validation has generally lagged behind due to the experimental challenges meeting under the harsh environmental conditions near the arc. While a wide range of diagnostics tools are available, considerable more effort needs to be devoted to the validation of model predictions against reliable experimental data.</p><p id="Par141">Arc phenomena in arc plasma torches are strongly linked to working conditions and flow fields. Unfortunately, measurements inside the torch are rather limited and most understanding has been obtained from models. Plasma torch models can be loosely divided among detailed (e.g., multidimensional) and reduced (e.g., lumped), each aimed to different aspects of process modeling.</p><p id="Par142">Detailed models are required for the exploration of plasma dynamics and for equipment or processes design. These models are often time dependent and three dimension in order to capture the complex arc dynamics and plasma gas flow interactions (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>). The use of models that depart from the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) assumption in favor of non-LTE (NLTE, such as two temperature) descriptions has demonstrated to produce better agreement with experimental observations (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>), particularly of the frequency and amplitude of voltage fluctuations. The use of NLTE models requires the calculation of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and transport properties, which can constitute a significant computational expense (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>). Moreover, non-local chemical equilibrium (NLCE) models should be adopted when molecular gases or gas mixtures are used (e.g., (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>). NLCE models require determining kinetic coefficients of forward and reverse reactions, which can be highly computationally expensive. To simplify calculations, it is possible to perform stationary kinetic calculations neglecting diffusion and convection or using pseudo-equilibrium approximations (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>). The results in all of these cases, while rather interesting, need further validation against experimental data for general conclusions to be drawn.</p><p> A more adequate description of plasma-electrode interaction phenomena from what is typically found in arc plasma torch models can be achieved by including the electrodes within the computational domain (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>), which is especially relevant for describing heat transfer to the electrodes as well as electrode erosion. Fluid flow models for plasma spraying need to account for plasma-environment mixing (e.g., cold flow entrainment) and the occurrence of spatial-temporal turbulent phenomena. Traditionally, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models, which describe time-averaged flow characteristics (e.g., k-ε model), have been widely used for plasma spray modeling. Nevertheless, these models often require several empirically determined model constants and therefore provide limited predictive capabilities.</p><p> Furthermore, these models have often been formulated for conditions not appropriate for the description of plasma flows, such as constant properties and incompressibility. The dynamic flow conditions found in plasma spraying are more adequately described by so-called large Eddy simulation (LES) techniques, which use simpler or fewer modeling assumptions (e.g., such as the universality of energy dissipation by the smallest flow features), but often require significantly larger computational resources (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>). Including turbulence effect on Lorentz force and Joule heating terms should be considered. In spite of many sophisticated turbulent models for the plasma flow, this effect on electromagnetic fields is ignored. It may turn out that the effect is not important; however, it is important to demonstrate this in future work.</p><p id="Par143">Reduced models, which only provide a limited amount of fidelity, are more appropriate than detailed models for process optimization or real-time monitoring and control. Reduced models can be obtained from simplifications of detailed models (e.g., reduced dimensionality, geometric complexity, steady state) combined with empirical understanding. An example of such model reduction approach is the of the Helmholtz resonator concept to correlate pressure fluctuations inside the torch with the obtained voltage fluctuations (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>). Another approach consists on using model order reduction methods, which condense the original set of equations from the detailed model into a smaller set that is simpler to solve. Alternatively, purely algorithmic approaches, which do not rely on the physical/mathematical description of the process, can be used. Examples of these are methods-based characterization/estimation such as neural networks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title>Challenges for the Improvement in DC Plasma Torches</title><p id="Par144">Traditional DC plasma torches used for spray coating applications are in the category of non-transferred arcs and include a thermionic (hot) cathode and a ring anode. The cathode material is normally thoriated tungsten. Plasma gases used include argon and nitrogen with hydrogen or helium to enhance the thermal conductivity. If cathode attachment in such torches is rather stationary, it is not the case at the anode (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>). The arc current is controlled and maintained constant, and thus, voltage varies between the minimum <italic>V</italic><sub>min</sub> and maximum values <italic>V</italic><sub>Max</sub> (Δ<italic>V</italic> = <italic>V</italic><sub>Max</sub> − <italic>V</italic><sub>min</sub>) with plasma gases composition and flow rate. One of the important issues that affect particle heating is the fluctuation of the arc voltage especially with gases containing diatomic species (restrike mode). The voltage fluctuation, and thus power dissipated, can reach Δ<italic>V</italic>/<italic>V</italic><sub>m=</sub>1, <italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub> being the mean voltage. This phenomenon is related to the arc attachment at the anode and the existence of different resonant modes with the possibility of their coupling (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>). Minimizing the amplitude of such fluctuations will improve the consistency of particle heating and results in better control of the deposition process.</p><p id="Par145">A number of different designs have recently been developed, and some of these have been commercialized (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>). A CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> torch with highly structured graphite cathode was recently developed (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>). Due to the nature of the plasma gases, arc voltage is rather high. This allows the torch to be operated at low currents resulting in long electrode life. In the case of this design, a balance between graphite sublimation and deposition of carbon ions on the cathode is achieved which makes for a long cathode life. Carbon is deposited in the form of carbon nanotubes (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>). The advantage of these gases for spraying is their large thermal conductivity at higher temperatures (~7000 K) and their large enthalpy, resulting in more powder to be heated, hence higher productivity. With thermal efficiency of these torches, up to 85% and low-temperature fluctuation heating of the powders is very good. An important advantage of high enthalpy plasma gases is that locally they do not easily cool down because of the injected materials.</p><p id="Par146">Another high enthalpy torch is the liquid-stabilized DC plasma torch developed by Hrabovsky et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>). The reported maximum plasma power was 160 kW, current of up to 500 A, with an exit centerline plasma velocity of up to 7 km/s and a plasma temperature of up to 22,000 K. While the main application of the torch has been in biomass gasification, this torch has also been employed in high throughput (i.e., up to 100 kg/h of metal powder at 160 kW plasma power) plasma spray coating applications.</p><p id="Par147">Achieving torches working with high enthalpy is particularly important for the case of suspension plasma spray (SPS) and solution precursor plasma spraying (SPPS) where evaporation of the solvent is energy intensive. Recently the current limitations of the technology (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>) and interaction of the liquid drops with the plasma and their evaporation were reviewed (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>).</p><p id="Par148">DC torches with cascaded neutrodes offer numerous advantages over ordinary guns.

In this gun, the voltage fluctuation is reported to be only ±3 V. In Delta Gun, the anode roots are fixed, and thus, the position of the powder injections ports may be fixed.

The torch comprises three DC plasma torches where plasma jets created by each torch enter a nozzle forming a single plasma jet. Material is then injected into the center of this jet. This central injection results in high deposition rates and completes melting of the injected powders. Central injection is particularly attractive in SPPS and SPS. Interaction of the three plasma jets plus the powder carrier jet generates a high degree of turbulence and a higher pressure where these jets meet. This condition may cause some smaller size particles to travel upstream within the torches and toward the cathode. Additionally, because of turbulent dispersion, some finer particles, which are more affected by turbulent dispersion, may be deposited on the nozzle walls.</p></sec><sec id="Sec48"><title>RF Induction Plasma Torch Developments</title><p id="Par152">Among the wide range of plasma torches used in thermal spray applications, induction plasmas have been recognized as being a valuable tool for niche applications.

The majority of present-day thermal spray applications are in the field of protective coatings, where the principle function of the overlay coating is to protect the underlying substrate from heat, contact damage (e.g., wear) or the surrounding operational environment (corrosion) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>). Thermal barrier coatings for protection of hot section superalloys in energy and propulsion gas turbines are the most widely recognized oxide systems. In most of these situations, the coatings can at best be classified as “passive materials” and typically do not contribute to physical or chemical functional response other than providing a barrier function. As such, the applications of thermal spray in truly functional systems, that is, where the deposited materials must provide an electronic or sensory function, are to date limited in scale and scope. However, new opportunities are now emerging in advanced functional surfaces, including dielectrics, electrical conductors, bioactive materials and solid oxide fuel cells. In these new applications, thermal spray offers advantages for manufacture of deposits over large area substrates and for the creation of complex conformal functional devices and systems. Perhaps the most significant current functional application of thermal spray lies in the manufacture of solid oxide fuel cells, involving layered material architecture of high-temperature oxides with metals (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>). Other potential applications are electronic sensors, direct writing technologies, energy-related applications such as thermoelectric generators (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>). Environmental barrier functions may also be considered as applications of functional oxides, because they require a function to response to invading material in addition to traditional passive protection in advanced turbine systems (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec51"><title>Current Challenges</title><p id="Par169">Functional oxides are usually provided in the following forms: bulk sintered compacts, thin films, thick coatings and their multilayers.

The application of process diagnostics and control for deposition of functional oxides with keeping deterioration of in-flight particles minimized during processing is generally the first approach.

In this method, in-flight particle state parameters such as particle velocity and temperature are introduced to interpret process conditions. A relationship between process input variables and coating properties is interpreted via in-flight particle state parameters.

It has been shown that ice accretion affects the wind turbine blades by decreasing performance, safety and durability. On wind turbines, ice accretion has been found to produce mechanical and electrical failures, errors in the measurement of temperature, humidity, wind velocity, overproduction, and power losses of up to 50%. It is, therefore, imperative that solutions are developed to mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects of ice accumulation on structures used in wind turbines in order to increase overall safety, ensure integrity of the turbine components and improve overall performance of the wind turbine in cold environments. Similar concerns have been expressed in the aerospace industry to protect aircraft wings and engine nacelles.</p><p id="Par190">Active anti-icing systems, to prevent the initial accretion of ice on the structures, have been developed (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">188</xref>), and some include the use of electrical heating wires embedded within the structure (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">189</xref>), indirect heating with warm air inside the structure and heat conduction to the surface, and microwave heating (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">190</xref>). These methodologies have inherent problems, which include positioning of the heating wires in the blade to avoid potential structural issues, the generation of high dynamic loads and the creation of localized “hot spots” on the surface, which could lead to high-temperature degradation of the structure. Additionally, microwave heating has never been successfully implemented.

More recently, the application of thermal spray processes to fabricate coatings on fiber-reinforced polymer composite (FRPC) structures has been initiated. FRPCs are usually selected for a wide variety of applications in the aerospace and energy industries due to their large strength and stiffness to weight ratio, flexible manufacturing processes and cost (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">192</xref>); however, their thermal properties typically do not allow them to conduct heat rapidly. To that end, Rooks (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">193</xref>) proposed the use of plasma spraying in the fabrication of resistive heater elements for ice protection of the leading edge portion of the main rotor blade of a military helicopter. Lopera-Valle and McDonald (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref>) investigated the possible application of flame-sprayed nickel chromium aluminum yttrium (NiCrAlY) and nichrome (Ni-20Cr) coatings deposited onto FRPC parts for de-icing applications. It was found that the electrical resistance of NiCrAlY and Ni-20Cr coatings was between 3.2 and 3.6 ohms. Electrical current was applied to the coatings to increase the surface temperature by resistive (Joule) heating. The surface temperature profiles of the coatings were measured under free and forced convection conditions at different ambient temperatures, ranging from −25 to 23°C. It was found that at ambient air temperatures below 0°C, the surface temperature of the coating and in some cases that of the FRPC remained above 0°C for both the forced and free convection conditions. In addition, there was a nearly homogeneous temperature distribution over the coating surface. This suggested that flame-sprayed coatings may be used as heating elements to mitigate ice accretion on polymer-based structures, without the presence of areas of localized high temperatures. An existing implementation in industry is in the de-icing system integrated into the Boeing 787 Dreamliner carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composite wing based on a proprietary thermal spray deposition technique developed by GKN Aerospace (Redditch, U.K.). This application comprises thermal sprayed metal coatings deposited onto a fiber-reinforced polymer ply to create a resistive heater mat, which is embedded into the aircraft wings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec59"><title>Coatings as Cathodes for Hydrogen Production</title><p id="Par192">In recent years, hydrogen has received wide attention for use as a renewable energy carrier due to the increasing concerns about depletion of conventional energy resources, greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. Although alkaline water electrolysis is considered as one of the most promising techniques for producing high-purity hydrogen, the high costs of the electrolyzers and the high energy consumption of this process have limited its application for large-scale hydrogen production. Several methods have been used to improve the energy efficiency of the electrolysis process by reducing the hydrogen evolution overpotentials, such as using electrocatalysts with high intrinsic activities and large specific surface areas (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">195</xref>). In this regard, Raney nickel has been widely investigated as the electrode material due to its superior electrochemical performance for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), owing to its large effective surface area obtained by the leaching process. The active surface area of an electrode can also be enhanced by morphological modification and increasing the surface roughness, which can be controlled by the method which is used for its production.</p><p id="Par193">Conventional methods for fabricating electrodes for the HER include electrodeposition, thermal decomposition, plating and sintering. However, there are considerable drawbacks associated with using some of these methods, including undesired decomposition reactions, limited coating thickness and multiple production steps. Thermal spray is a promising technique that allows deposition of cost-effective coatings at high deposition rates in order to produce efficient electrodes for HER. Several studies have been conducted on using different thermal spray techniques for the development of nickel-based electrode coatings for the HER.</p><p id="Par194">Hall (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">196</xref>) and Birry et al.

Fournier et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">199</xref>) related the high activity of wire arc-sprayed Raney nickel and nickel-titanium electrodes to the increased active surface area and high level of porosity of the coatings.

For this purpose, they engineered the surface morphology of the electrodes by deposition of three-dimensional fin arrays and obtained the highest electrocatalytic activity for the electrode that was deposited using the high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF) spraying process. The high activity of this electrode was related to the increased surface area and surface roughness that was created by the deposition of off-normal impinging particles, as well as lower oxidation of this coating compared to the plasma-sprayed electrodes. Due to the high capability of thermal spray processes to produce highly electrocatalytic active electrodes for the HER, more studies are required in this field to improve the efficiency of water electrolysis process further.</p></sec><sec id="Sec60"><title>Antibacterial Coatings</title><p id="Par195">For centuries, copper has been known as a material that could prevent the growth of weeds, which are wild herbaceous plants, on the hulls of ships. Furthermore, as has been clearly shown, copper surfaces are biocidal to some important pathogens that seriously and adversely affect the health of humans and domesticated animals or livestock. Indeed, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has certified copper and its alloys as anti-bacterial. Therefore, covering surfaces with copper or its alloys should reduce the risk of transmission of harmful bacteria, thereby reducing the number of infections and deaths caused by healthcare-associated infections (HAI). One major reason that copper is not widely used in health care facilities today is due to the difficulties associated with the heavy weight and high cost of manufacturing with copper. Deposition of a thin layer of sprayed metal on polymer composites or wood fixtures is an attractive and economical alternative to using sheet metal. Since some of the thermal spray techniques impart relatively low heat load to the substrate, it is possible to deposit metal coatings on heat sensitive surfaces such as wood and wood composites. Additionally, because of the nature of the spray coating technique, there are few limitations as to the shape of the substrate. Thus, it is expected that the deposition of copper alloys which are non-toxic and ecofriendly on the aforementioned substrates may help to prevent the spread of bacteria, mold, fungi or other pathogens.</p><p id="Par196">Recent studies on wire arc-deposited copper coatings on wood, wood composites and polymers evaluated bioactivity of thermally sprayed copper alloy-coated wood and wood composites (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">203</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">205</xref>).

Most of the knowledge developed for bulk materials can be utilized to explain corrosion and wear of the coatings, although the distinct characteristics of thermal spray microstructures should be taken into account. Accordingly, anti-wear and anti-corrosion performance not only depend on coating materials compositions and on the microstructure of coatings, but are also remarkably affected by operation environments and conditions, which present diverse and complicated material loss mechanisms. Thus, different types of wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant materials and processes have been developed to fulfill the service requirements of diverse applications by taking account of service conditions of individual coatings. The number of different coating technologies/processes and the advancement in powder processing and materials offer new and promising options for improved coating performance. It is becoming increasingly more complicated to select the correct process and material to achieve the optimal coating system. The different types or modes of wear are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. With the exception of adhesion wear, the wear performance of the coatings is lower than that of the bulk material except the spray-fused self-fluxing alloy coatings and those subjected to high-temperature post-spray annealing.

Thus, different types of coating materials with excellent corrosion resistance have been developed for uses in different corrosion environments. It is commonly accepted that porosity in the coatings has a large effect on corrosion performance. Porosity that allows corrosive elements to reach the substrate poses a significant problem and will greatly reduce the corrosion protection of the coating. High-velocity processes such as high-velocity oxygen fuel (HVOF) and detonation (D)-gun yield denser coatings which typically do not fully eliminate the permeation of corrosive solution or gases (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">211</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR212">212</xref>). The penetration of electrolyte solutions to the interface causes corrosion of either the substrate or the coating, which leads to coating spalling. These types of coatings are sealed to fill the pores and greatly improve the corrosion resistance and prevent premature spalling.</p><p id="Par203">Zinc- and aluminum-based alloy coatings, acting as anodic sacrificial coatings applied by wire flame spraying and arc spraying, are cost-effectively and widely used for long-term protection of steel-based structures. With proper sealing, they provide excellent protection against chemical and electrochemical attack. On the other hand, the cathodically protective coatings must act as a fully dense physical barrier. Thus, post-spray remelting of the coating using techniques such as spray-fusing of self-fluxing alloy yields fully dense coating with excellent corrosion protection at a temperature range from ambient up to several 100°C. The increase in service time can offset the high cost of applying the post-spray melting processes.</p><p id="Par204">Nickel (Ni)-based or cobalt (Co)-based alloy coatings, especially metal chrome aluminum yttrium (MCrAlY) alloys, possess excellent high-temperature corrosion resistance against molten salts or oxidation. These coatings, applied by low-pressure plasma spraying (LPPS), HVOF or cold spray (CS), are very dense and have reduced oxidation compared to coatings applied by other methods. The formation of fully dense and adhesive protective oxide scale such as Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>- or Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-based oxide is critical for excellent performance. Pretreatment of the coatings prior to use is carried out to ensure the formation of desirable oxide specially under oxidizing atmosphere. The diffusion treatment, which is normally performed on TBC-coated turbine components at temperatures of 1100-1200°C, also serves the purposes of promoting metallurgical bonding with the substrate and of densifying the coating and is also necessary to restore the correct microstructure of the superalloy substrate after the many technological processes to which a gas turbine part is subjected after casting and/or during repair.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec66"><title>Advances in TS Science and Technology</title><p id="Par205">Thermal spray coatings exhibit distinct microstructure features different from bulk materials and coatings produced by other conventional processes and coating technologies. Besides the porosity, the distinct microstructure features include highly oriented grain structure of small grains down to the nano- and micrometers with lamellae of different sizes and shapes parallel to the substrate surface; variable quality of contact and bonding between lamellae interfaces; cracks; and possible inclusions of partially melted particles. The individual microstructural features can respond very differently to different types of wear. They can also respond very differently to different wear conditions even for the same type of wear. Thus, the individual structural parameters have important implications with regard to the performance of wear-resistant coatings.

Coatings of smaller carbides present better abrasive wear performance at low load (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR215">215</xref>), while WC size is limited by decarburization and can be reduced to about 0.5 μm or even smaller by low-temperature high-velocity processes such as high-velocity air fuel (HVAF) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR216">216</xref>). Moreover, at a high load cracking and delaminating along lamellar interface result in higher material loss with a lower positive effect of carbide size (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213">213</xref>).

However, the powder particles have to be heated to achieve dense microstructures. The heating leads to severe decarburization.

The porous lamellar structural features with limited lamellar bonding degrade the coating performance of most wear and corrosion coatings. The performance of these coatings can be greatly improved by designing self-fluxing alloys for spray-fusing processes. The biggest challenge may be to optimize the thermal spray processes to deposit coatings with comparable or superior wear and corrosion performances to the identical bulk in the as-deposited state. This can be accomplished through design of the coating materials, and regulation of the process controls to that will yield new strategies to fully utilize the microstructural features. Thus, two different strategies toward meeting these challenges are proposed. The first is the deposition of bulk-like dense coating, and the second is the full utilization of porous coating microstructures with the addition of multifunctional constituents to produce the desired smart microstructure and morphology. Moreover, utilizing rapid cooling feature to develop functional amorphous and nanostructured coatings, and rapid reaction kinetics of spray materials with reactive plasma flame to tailoring controlled coatings phase and compositions are also future challenges for high performance.</p><sec id="Sec75"><title>Developing the Database for Coating Life Prediction Toward Producing Coatings that Match the Life of Components</title><p id="Par218">Wear coatings are used to increase the service life of materials either by producing a hard layer or by decreasing the CoF. Wear is a complex phenomenon and is a complicated function of wear condition (operating environment) and coating microstructure. There are a number of variables that can affect the wear rate and type of wear. A complete database for wear should include relationships among the wear type or mode, service conditions, coating materials and microstructure parameters in order to develop effective coatings with a predictable lifetime for cost-effective performance. Therefore, additional fundamental investigations into wear mechanisms and key factors controlling material loss are needed along with the correlation of wear rate with those key factors. New materials, harsher operating environments and greater demands on developing economical coatings with better wear performance are challenges that need to be addressed. The development of a comprehensive database will be a key tool meeting these challenges.</p></sec><sec id="Sec76"><title>Process Development for Full Dense Coating Deposition</title><p id="Par219">Many investigations are working toward producing fully dense coatings by introducing hybrid processes, controlling processing through deposition temperature and particle parameters, and materials design. By increasing deposition temperature over the critical bonding temperature, the experimental investigation produced ceramic coatings with fully bonded lamellae (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR229">229</xref>). It has also been shown that bulk-like metal alloy parts can be produced by performing the deposition under an inert atmosphere. With cold spraying, the laser hybrid cold spray process can produce dense alloy coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR230">230</xref>) and dense bulk-like metal ally coatings can also be produced using the enhancing in situ densifying effects (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228">228</xref>). The first step in the development of fully dense coating is to understand the bonding mechanisms involved in particle/droplet impact with emphasis on the substrate surface-coating layer interface. Once a fully bonded interface layer could be produced, a dense coating could then be developed by optimizing the powder properties and the coating parameters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec77"><title>Smart Wear-Resistant Coatings Developments</title><p id="Par220">The smart adhesive wear-resistant coatings developments depend on how to introduce effectively desirable lubricants into composite coatings by using specially designed composite powders containing a lubricant phase such as: graphite, hBN, nanoceramic particles (such as Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>), MoS<sub>2</sub>, Ag, BaF<sub>2</sub> and CaF<sub>2</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR217">217</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">220</xref>). With liquid lubricant, the design of porous coatings with the proper porosity and geometry is required to hold lubricants for durable performance. It can be introduced into the coating by delivering liquid-containing polymer capsules in the form of feedstocks. The lubricant phase may be developed in situ during thermal spray through oxidation. The lubricant phase evolves in situ during the coating operation in a reactive environment through oxidation. For example, novel powder materials can be designed to produce tribo-chemical reactions by accounting for the reactive species (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR231">231</xref>). Moreover, the increasing strengthening effect of aluminide materials such as iron aluminide-based composite or nickel aluminide composite with increasing operation temperature can be developed for high-temperature abrasive wear in the designed temperature range (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR232">232</xref>). The understanding of the evolution of specific desirable phases during thermal spray and service exposure is essential to producing high-performance coatings. Thus, the relationships between the interaction of powder materials with heat sources during in-flight, deposit composition and microstructure, and tribological behavior can only be developed through a systematic investigation. The challenges are still the development of cost-effective processing and selection of the optimal process and process parameters for the different processes corresponding to different types of materials such as multicomponent composite powder/wire materials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec78"><title>Smart Corrosion-Resistant Coatings</title><p id="Par221">The first approach to address the porous microstructural features of thermal spray coatings to provide effective protection of the substrate is to apply a post-spray sealing that will survive under the desired service conditions which include temperature and environment. Since the corrosion products are usually produced by selective reaction of corrosive materials with certain coating constituents, the proper design of coating materials results in the formation of a coating with a certain pore size distribution where a layer of corrosion products forms and prohibits further infiltration of corrosive substance and arrests the corrosion. Recent investigations show that superhydrophobic surfaces have multiple functionalities such as self-cleaning, anti-frosting and anti-icing, anti-corrosion (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR231">231</xref>). Superhydrophobic coatings can be produced by different thermal spray processes. These coatings possess a nanostructured surface morphology or rough surface modified with certain chemicals. Moreover, it is easy to fabricate coating with a lotus-leaf-like surface of hierarchical nano-/microstructure (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR233">233</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR234">234</xref>).

These are suspension thermal (flame, plasma and HVOF) spraying, precursors liquid feedstock thermal (flame, plasma and HVOF) spraying, plasma spraying-physical vapor deposition (PVD) and so on. Development work is required to find industrial applications for these new processes. To tap the potentials of new processes to produce economical, high-performance corrosion and wear coatings, fundamental investigation is required to expand the tailoring range of coating microstructure. For example, with the PS-PVD process the coating microstructures can be tailored from fully dense to loosely bonded and columnar (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">235</xref>), and using liquid feedstocks with new thermal spray processes, microstructures can be tailored with features that range from nanometers to submicrometers (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR236">236</xref>). The development of different microstructures by those processes leads to progress in the development: thermal spray smart coatings, environmental barrier coatings, multifunctional coatings and enhanced heat transfer coatings that are corrosion resistant. The development of new thermal spray processes and new materials offers the potential for substantial improvement in corrosion- and wear-resistant coatings. Fundamental investigations are needed to realize these improvements.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec125"><title>Thermal Spray Applications</title><sec id="Sec80"><title>Thermal Spray for Biomedical Applications</title><p id="Par223"><bold><italic>C.C.

Passive coatings, consisting of phases that are bioinert under physiological conditions, are not the focus of this roadmap since they are well defined and have secured niche applications.</p><p id="Par237">A comprehensive review of the literature published in 2010-2015 indicates that biomaterial applications mostly revolve around hydroxyapatite coatings and titanium substrates for implant applications (Fig. <xref rid="Fig27" ref-type="fig">27</xref>). The in vitro evaluation of these coatings was predominantly performed using the classical SBF (simulated body fluid) and Hank’s balanced salt (HBS) solutions (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR259">259</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR261">261</xref>). There have been attempts to influence the phase composition of the HA coatings through the feedstock materials, e.g., using spheroidized HA powders, doping with metabolically important elements (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR262">262</xref>) and fine-tuning of thermal spray parameters (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR263">263</xref>).

HA is being widely used as an implant coating and bone gap-filling material due to its compositional similarity to the inorganic phase of bone. It is known that HA in bone is poorly crystallized Ca-deficient carbonated hydroxyapatite (CHA) occurring as nanosized platelets (~45 × 20 × 3 nm<sup>3</sup>). Therefore, to obtain high bioactivity and hence bone bonding, it is reasonable to make both the composition and the microstructure (especially the surface topography) of the HA implant similar to those of natural bone. It is expected that nanosized HA is more desirable for the implant application. Recent research (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR266">266</xref>) suggests that nanosized hydroxyapatite particles may not only induce inflammation, but may also decrease the viability of primary human polymorphonuclear cells (PMNCs), mononuclear cells (MNCs), and human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs). Furthermore, HA fibers “stimulated an elevated ROS (reactive oxygen species) response in both PMNCs and MNCs, and the largest apoptotic behavior for all cell types” (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR266">266</xref>).<fig id="Fig28"><label>Fig. 28</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Evolution of phase content of hydroxyapatite-based coatings as functions of thermal spray variables.

However, the complex crystal structure of HA as well as the high cooling rate and the loss of OH- during the spray process confers the formation of metastable and amorphous phases (ACPs) that are more soluble than the crystalline HA phase. The bonding at the interface between the HA coating and the bony tissue is established through processes of dissolution, precipitation and ion exchange between the surface of the coating and the extracellular fluid (ECF). Partial dissolution of the coating surface (usually the amorphous phase) is needed to provide a supersaturated calcium and phosphorus environment for the subsequent precipitation and bone remodeling process.</p><p id="Par240">A nanosized carbonated hydroxyapatite layer forms at the surface of the coating, exhibiting a structure resembling the inorganic phase of bone.

For example, the responses at the bone-implant interface during the healing process are complex (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR268">268</xref>) and involve, among many factors, (1) transport of cellular materials and proteins, (2) the formation of an interfacial transitional zone and (3) bone deposition and bone growth in opposite directions to fill gap between the natural bone and the implant, respectively.</p><p id="Par243">It is hypothesized that a coating composed mostly of nanosized crystalline HA with specific nanosized amorphous phase distributed among the crystalline phase will provide enhanced bioactivity and osteoblast bonding. The nanocrystals of HA will dissolve preferentially owing to their high surface area and associated surface free energy and will generate nucleation sites for precipitation of carbonated apatite. The dissolution of the nanosized amorphous phase will help to precipitate secondary apatite, but it will not cause the degradation of the whole coating due to its very small size. Instead, the dissolved amorphous region will generate nanoporosity, which may enable bone in-growth into the coatings. Although this is a speculative hypothesis, there is merit in testing the role of nanosized phases and nanoporosity that might evolve from their dissolution since the overall reaction kinetics will be controlled by the integrated microstructure.</p><p id="Par244">To effectively control the composition and the structure of HA coatings, both the starting powders and the process parameters, including any post-spray treatments, need to be strictly controlled. It is important for all particles to melt completely and to ensure that most of them recrystallize to nanosized crystals while some nanosized region remains as amorphous phase. The cooling rate should be optimized to avoid both the formation of large regions of amorphous phase and the decomposition of the HA. The OH- content of the HA should also be considered since the loss of OH- will affect the formation of amorphous phase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec85"><title>Advances in Science and Technology to Meet the Challenges</title><p id="Par245">Advancements have centered around modifying the coating chemistry and design so that beneficial biological interactions can take place on implantation.

In the IC industry, the equipment for dry etching, sputtering and chemical vapor deposition has continuously increased in size to accommodate larger Si wafer size (currently 300 mm). While early dry etch reactors were lined with anodized aluminum (aluminite) or sintered bulk ceramics, thermal sprayed alumina-, zirconia- and yttria-based liners are now widely used. These liners protect the inner chamber walls against erosion and control metal and particle contamination of the electronic devices. The larger chamber dimensions—which are much easier to coat with a spray process—combined with lower overhaul (“wet” cleaning) and refurbishing costs are the main driving forces toward using sprayed coatings. Performance benefits in terms of plasma erosion rate, breakdown voltage and particle counts for yttrium oxide-based linings were reported (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR275">275</xref>).</p><p id="Par263">However, the ever-decreasing feature size of electronic devices imposes size limits on defects and particles below 25 nm, which is not easily met with the typically plasma-sprayed coating. This is particularly critical for memory and logic chip components, where the defect size must be even smaller. To meet this challenge, highly tailored feedstock powders became recently available for further performance gain (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR276">276</xref>).</p><p id="Par264">Thermal sprayed rotary sputter targets, similar to those established in the large area architectural glass industry, are increasingly found in the thin film PV sector, where higher requirements on purity and density must be met. Examples include targets for doped Zn oxide (AZO), Mo and constituents of the CuInGaSe (S) absorber in CIGS technology (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR277">277</xref>). Further, in the display electronics industry, highly dense thermal sprayed silicon and aluminum rotary targets are now widely used for optical and diffusion barrier functionalities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec91"><title>Current Challenges</title><p id="Par265">Several challenges and limitations are present in the use of thermal spray for electronics and sensor applications. These include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par266"><italic>Powder purity and size distribution</italic>. The purity of the final coating is only as good as the starting powders. High-quality starting powders are essential. This is challenging for powder manufacturers because smaller quantities are often required, particularly for exploratory or prototype applications.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par267"><italic>Low coating porosity</italic>. Dense, low porosity coatings are important for low electrical and thermal resistances and for providing erosion and wear resistance. Cracks and pores in the coating can propagate and shift, giving rise to shifts in electrical, thermal and mechanical properties.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par268"><italic>Cost and throughput</italic>. Traditional electronics manufacturing techniques are fast and inexpensive. Thermal spray applications must become faster and less expensive in order to become competitive with these traditional technologies, even if thermal spray provides a benefit.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par269"><italic>Maintaining stoichiometry.</italic> Some applications, such as thermoelectric devices and thermocouples, depend strongly on the final coating composition. Changes in composition between the feedstock and deposited coating can occur during the thermal spray process due to oxidation, preferential vaporization, in-flight chemistry and inclusion of contaminants.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par270"><italic>Repeatability of critical properties</italic>. Traditional electronic manufacturing has excellent process control, with the result that the part-to-part variation is small. Part-to-part variation in sensors and electronic performance made with thermal spray can yield large variations in the final device characteristics. This can require undesirable manual calibration and customization for each sensor.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par271"><italic>Property drift</italic>. Electrical, thermal and mechanical properties of thermal sprayed coatings can drift with time, due to microcracks in the coating and relative motion of the coating splats due to mechanical and/or thermal strain. This can cause sensor calibrations to drift over time, requiring recalibration or periodic verification checks.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par272"><italic>Minimum coating thickness</italic>. The minimum usable thickness of a thermal spray coating is in the range of ~25 μm. If the coating is sprayed much thinner than this, then many of the individual splats will not contact their neighbors, resulting in a significant increase in electrical resistance and property sensitivity to deformation.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par273"><italic>Defect levels</italic>. For IC electronic liners, the coating defects must be ≤10 nm, which implies extremely high coating density and splat fusion.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par274"><italic>Sputtering targets</italic>.

The ability to make high-purity feedstock powders is crucial for many thermal spray electronics applications. Using scrap material from the electronics and medical industries may provide high-quality feedstock for powders.

Combining thermal spray with other additive manufacturing technologies approaches allows combining the advantages of each technique, e.g., for thermoelectric fabrication (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR278">278</xref>). 3D, inkjet and laser sintering, for example, can be readily integrated with thermal spray for such hybrid applications. This also provides the ability to, e.g., seamlessly integrate electronics and sensors during the part fabrication. Such approaches may also improve both cost and throughput.

SPS is a promising emerging spray technology.

Cold spray promises to further improve bonding, density and grain refinement, especially for materials with equilibrium phase constraints. Commercial cold-sprayed rotary targets now exist for CuIn, CuInGa, Zn, ZnSn, ZnAl, Al and, notably, Ag. Cold spray, along with vacuum or inert plasma spraying, also offers the possibility of low oxygen content in the targets, typically a few tens to a few hundred ppm.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par282">In summary, the use of thermal spray for sensing and electronics applications is a rapidly emerging area for thermal spray.

They are applied on internally cooled components such as combustor parts, and transition ducts of stationary and rotation airfoils resulting in a significant reduction in the surface temperature of the structural materials. New TBC materials, especially phase stable materials for high surface temperature (≫1300°C) applications and/or TBC materials with lower thermal conductivity than 8YSZ, are under development and partially already introduced (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR289">289</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR291">291</xref>). Bonding to the substrate and also oxidation and corrosion protection are obtained by application of intermediate bond coat layers directly on the substrate typically made of MCrAlYs (M = Ni, Co).

Depending on the temperature regime, different materials are applied: polymers, mixtures of polymers and metals, and oxidation-resistant metals (e.g., MCrAlYs) in the compressor and, in the turbine, oxidation-resistant metals and, in the hottest parts, porous ceramics (often 8YSZ), also in combination with polymers to create porosity (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig33" ref-type="fig">33</xref>). Lower temperature compressor applications use solid lubricants in the metal matrix (Ni, NiCr) such as hexagonal boron nitride, graphite and bentonite for improved properties between blade (titanium based or Inconel) and abradable. In some cases, tip coatings are used on blades to cut ceramic abradables (cubic BN in a MCrAlY matrix).

This is due mainly to the corrosive nature of the fluids that are transported and the low corrosion resistance of carbon steel. Carbon steel is the material of choice in the OGI because of its ability to withstand high pressures and the relatively low cost to purchase and install the material in comparison with other highly alloyed materials (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR296">296</xref>). Additionally, some extraction processes in the petrochemical industry may involve the processing of multiphase solid-liquid mixtures. These mixtures contain hard-face erodant particles such as sand, which may lead to severe wear in addition to corrosion. The combination of wear and corrosion can substantially reduce the lifetime of equipment, parts and pipelines (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR297">297</xref>). The corrosion and wear of components in the OGI are not limited to transport pipelines; corrosion and wear of drill bits, pump casing and impellers, valves, gas turbines, boilers and compressors have also been reported (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>).</p><p id="Par312">Thermal spray processes are one of the methods that are used for fabrication of protective wear-corrosion-resistant coatings on components in the OGI (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR299">299</xref>). The economic benefits of the use of thermally sprayed protective coatings in the OGI are significant. In a case study conducted by Syncrude Canada Ltd. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR300">300</xref>), it was stated that the deposition of tungsten carbide-cobalt (WC-Co)-based coatings on pump impellers can improve the longevity of the impellers by up to six times more than when no coating is used. It was suggested that more than $280,000 per pump could be regained in cost savings from operations and maintenance (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR300">300</xref>). This study presents a brief review of the thermal spray processes that are frequently employed in the OGI and surveys the typical materials that are used to provide combined corrosion-erosion resistance. Future trends and developments of this technology that are targeted specifically in the OGI will be explored in the following sections.</p><p id="Par313"><italic>Coating Materials for the Oil and Gas Industry.</italic> The choice of coating material for application in the OGI depends on the purpose of the coating. For conditions where only corrosion is of concern, sacrificial coatings with typical thicknesses of 50-500 µm that serve the purpose of cathodic protection for the substrate can be fabricated (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR301">301</xref>). In this case, from the two dissimilar metals that are in contact in a conductive solution, the more anodic metal will be corroded (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR301">301</xref>). Aluminum (Al) and zinc (Zn) are more anodic than low carbon steel and can be used for cathodic protection of low carbon steel. Even though the arc- or flame-sprayed Al and Zn coatings are porous, they are sacrificial and are corroded before there is attack of the substrate (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR301">301</xref>). The protection of steel structures, tanks and pipes are examples of applications in which these coatings are utilized in the OGI (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>).</p><p id="Par314">In many sectors of the OGI, especially in oil sands processing, the combined effect of wear and corrosion is responsible for surface degradation. Thus, coating materials resistant to both corrosion and wear are of interest (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR299">299</xref>). WC-based metal matrix composite (MMC) coatings have been extensively used to provide protection in many industries including the OGI due to their excellent resistance to sliding, abrasive and erosive wear (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR302">302</xref>). In particular, the WC-Co material combination is a MMC material that is commonly used in areas where great resistance to wear is required (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR303">303</xref>). Thermal sprayed WC-Co coatings have a hardness of 900-1330 HV<sub>0.3</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR302">302</xref>) and the wear rates can be as low as 3.9 × 10<sup>−6</sup> mm<sup>3</sup>/Nm under ASTM Standard G65 testing (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR304">304</xref>). The WC hard phase material provides resistance against wear, and the cobalt (Co) metal acts as a ductile matrix to provide physical support for the WC particles and increase the overall toughness of the coating. Due to the possibility of decarburization of WC at high temperatures, the thermal spray process can significantly affect the final hardness and wear resistance of the deposited coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR302">302</xref>). Al-Mutairi et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR303">303</xref>) showed that high-velocity oxy-fuel (HVOF)-sprayed WC-12Co coatings had higher hardness (1066 HV<sub>0.5</sub>) compared to that of plasma-sprayed WC-12Co coatings (826 HV<sub>0.5</sub>). Decarburization of WC as a result of the high temperature of the plasma spraying process was reported as one of the possible reasons for the reduction in hardness (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR303">303</xref>).</p><p id="Par315">In applications where simultaneous resistance to corrosion and wear is needed, the addition of Cr to the WC-Co MMC may be effective at enhancing the corrosion resistance of the coating in high-temperature applications, such as in boilers. In addition, Cr improves the bonding between the matrix and the WC reinforcing particles and WC-Co-Cr can potentially be more wear-resistant than WC-Co coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>). Consequently, in corrosive environments in which there is severe wear of the components, fabrication of WC-Co-Cr composition as a protective coating is preferred to use of WC-Co (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR302">302</xref>). WC-10Co-4Cr is one of the coating materials that has been used often in the OGI and has a hardness of 1021-1326 HV<sub>0.3</sub> (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR302">302</xref>). While the addition of Cr improves the corrosion resistance of WC-Co MMC coatings in high-temperature erosive environments, the addition of nickel (Ni) to the composite is suggested for use in low-temperature applications, such as in pipes and gas valves in order to increase the resistance of WC-Co MMC coatings to corrosion (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR295">295</xref>).</p><p id="Par316">Chromium carbide-nickel chromium (Cr<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-NiCr)-based MMC coatings are other types of coating materials that have been employed in the OGI to protect carbon steel pipes from erosive-corrosive environments (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR299">299</xref>). Similar to WC-based coatings, decarburization of Cr<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> during the thermal spray deposition process can occur, given the high process temperatures (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR296">296</xref>). Although the addition of NiCr alloy to Cr<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> to produce Cr<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-NiCr coatings improves resistance to corrosive media compared to WC-based coatings, Cr<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-NiCr has lower resistance to wear compared to WC-based coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>). Li. et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR305">305</xref>) showed that the dry abrasion wear rates of plasma-sprayed Cr<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-25NiCr MMC coatings were more than two times higher than those of WC-17Co coatings.</p><p id="Par317">The blend of self-fluxing alloys with WC-based phases is another feedstock material that can be used in the OGI for deposition of wear-resistant coatings. The self-fluxing coating material fabricated by thermal spray processes allows for a post-thermal treatment to reduce the oxide content and pores within the coating. Self-fluxing alloys contain boron (B) and silicon (Si) to suppress the melting point of the alloy (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR306">306</xref>) in order to protect the carbide content of the coating from decarburization during reheating and melting of the coating. The B and Si within the coating also work as deoxidizers to reduce the oxide content within the coating. Borosilicate (B<sub>2</sub>O<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>·SiO<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>) will be formed during the post-thermal treatment melting process, and it diffuses toward the coating surface as slag that can be removed later by machining (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>). As a result of the diffusion process and formation of new metallurgical bonds, the volume of the coating could decrease by as much as 20 vol.%, with the elimination of most of the pores (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>). An example of fabrication of such powder blends was discussed in a study by McDonald and Fisher (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR299">299</xref>) in which a flame spraying process was employed to deposit a powder blend of WC-12Co with a self-fluxing Ni alloy (14Ni + 3.5Cr + 0.8B + 0.8Fe + 0.8Si + 0.1C). It was shown that the post-treatment fusing process homogenized the coating by reducing the coating porosity and redistributed the hard phase particles in the coating.</p><p id="Par318"><italic>Thermal Spray Processes in the Oil and Gas Industry.</italic> In the preceding section, the most widely used powder materials for fabrication of coatings on the components used in the OGI was discussed. Several spraying processes are available for fabrication of the coatings that are used in the OGI, namely wire arc spraying, flame spraying, plasma spraying, detonation gun and HVOF spraying. A brief overview of the principles that govern these spraying processes, their current applications in the OGI, technical challenges and possible solutions to meet these challenges are discussed in the following section.</p><p id="Par319">Wire arc thermal spray is a process in which the heat that is generated by an electric arc discharge between the feedstock wires melts the wires to form droplets. After formation of the droplets, they are accelerated toward the substrate in a gas stream for deposition. The wire arc spraying process has positive cost benefits that originate from its high spraying rate, low production cost and capability for on-site fabrication of coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>). Coatings deposited by the wire arc spraying process tend to have high oxide content (approximately 20 vol.%) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>) and high porosity (10-20 vol.%) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR307">307</xref>). Due to the porous nature of the fabricated coatings, this process is not the ideal option for the deposition of protective coatings for severe environments. The porosity in the coating will not prevent penetration of corrosive media through the coating, resulting in attack of the coating itself and the underlying substrate. On the other hand, the high deposition rate of this process is beneficial for deposition of cathodic protective coatings in which the coating can be porous with minimal adverse effect on the performance of the coating (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR301">301</xref>). The high porosity of the coating does not affect performance of the coating when they are used as cathodic protective coatings because only the metal that is more anodic in conductive corrosive solutions will be corroded and the more cathodic metal will be unaffected. However, the larger number of pores may increase the corrosion rate and negatively affect the longevity of the coating. Deposition of Al and Zn coatings for cathodic protection of offshore oil drilling platforms and underground pipes is one of the most important applications of the arc spraying process in the OGI, where the high deposition rate (3-15 kg/h for Al and 10-33 kg/h for Zn) justifies employing this process (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>) and where the economic benefits outweigh the deficiencies in performance.</p><p id="Par320">Flame spraying is another thermal spray process in which a heat source is used to melt and accelerate powder particles to impact on a substrate and form a coating. The heat source is a flame that is generated by the combustion of oxygen and a fuel gas. The maximum temperature of the flame is approximately 3350 K, and the velocity of the impacting particles is usually below 100 m/s (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR307">307</xref>). The flame spraying process is used widely in the OGI because it is simple to operate, requires less energy than other high-temperature thermal spray processes—approximately 40 kW of power is produced for flow rates of 20 SLM for most fuels and 30 SLM for oxygen (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>)—and allows for on-site fabrication of coatings. However, the coatings that are fabricated by flame spraying are porous (approximately 10-20 vol.% (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR307">307</xref>) and post-fabrication fusing of the deposited coatings is usually required to reduce the porosity of the coating. McDonald and Fisher (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR299">299</xref>) stated that WC-12Co powder material can be blended with self-fluxing Ni prior to deposition by the flame spraying process. The oxy-acetylene torch may be used after deposition to melt the coating and cause it to fuse. This spray-and-fuse process reduces coating porosity and redistributes the particles in the coating in order to improve homogenization of the coating. Fusing can also be accomplished by using a furnace, a laser, an electron beam or induction heating (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR299">299</xref>). The heating and subsequent cooling should be conducted uniformly at low rates to avoid the generation of significant temperature gradients and prevent the coating from cracking (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>). Additionally, the temperature and duration of the fusion process should be chosen based on the chemical composition of the coating to minimize the possible decarburization of the carbide content in the coating.</p><p id="Par321">In plasma spraying, an ionized gas jet melts and accelerates the feedstock powder to allow for deposition onto the substrate. Due to the temperature of the ionized gas jet, which can be as high as 14,000 K (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR307">307</xref>), this process is generally selected for deposition of refractory materials or materials with high melting points such as ceramics. The porosity of plasma-sprayed coatings is within the range of 4-10.8 vol.% (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR303">303</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR305">305</xref>). Zhang et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR305">305</xref>) reported porosities as high as 10.8 vol.% for plasma-sprayed WC-17Co and Cr<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-25NiCr coatings. This porosity is sufficiently high to allow for penetration of corrosive media into and through the coating to attack the underlying substrate. In addition, the temperature of the jet in the plasma spraying process can induce changes in the chemical composition of some of the sprayed materials such as those based on WC. Decarburization of WC results in the formation of W<sub>2</sub>C, tungsten (W), and possible dissolution of W and carbon (C) in the coating. These phases can embrittle the coating, thus lowering the abrasion resistance. Al-Mutairi et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR303">303</xref>) have showed that the hardness of coatings of WC-Co feedstock deposited by the plasma spraying process (826 HV<sub>0.5</sub>) was lower than that of HVOF-sprayed coatings (1066 HV<sub>0.5</sub>) due to the high temperature of plasma spraying process and the resulting decarburization of the feedstock material. In addition, Zavareh et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR297">297</xref>) reported on the decarburization of Cr<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> after plasma spraying of Cr<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-25NiCr coatings. Consequently, due to the high porosity values and possible decarburization of the carbide feedstock materials in plasma spraying, this process has not been widely utilized for the deposition of typical wear-corrosion-resistant feedstock materials (WC-Co, WC-Co-Cr, and Cr<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-NiCr) in the OGI.</p><p id="Par322">Decarburization of the carbide within the coating can be reduced by the adjustment of the plasma spraying process parameters to decrease the plasma plume temperature. Given that in some circumstances, limitations may exist on modifying the plasma spraying parameters, an inert gas such as nitrogen can be injected into the plasma jet through a shroud attached on the nozzle torch (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>). The inert gas surrounding the nozzle jet not only can protect the powder particles from oxidation, but it cools the plume to reduce the possibility of decarburization of the sprayed carbide powder blends such as WC-Co (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>). Although the use of a shroud and injection of an inert gas has proved to be effective in reducing the level of decarburization, the required high flow rates of the injected gas for this process can be a limiting factor for the use of this process in the OGI.</p><p id="Par323">HVOF spraying is a process in which a flame heat source is produced by the combustion of pressurized fuel gases such as propylene, acetylene, propane, or hydrogen or liquid fuels such as kerosene with oxygen. The flame temperature may be as high as 3700 K, and due to the flow of the combusting gas through a converging-diverging nozzle, supersonic flows with the gas velocity of approximately 2000 m/s can be attained (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR307">307</xref>). This spraying process is widely used in the OGI for the deposition of wear-resistant coatings, such as WC-Co-based and Cr<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-NiCr materials (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR295">295</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR296">296</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR299">299</xref>). There are noticeable improvements in the properties of coatings that are deposited by way of HVOF spraying when compared to coatings fabricated by plasma spraying. This is due to the relatively lower flame temperature and higher velocity of the impacting particles in HVOF spraying (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR297">297</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR303">303</xref>). The high kinetic energy of the sprayed powder particles will compensate for the lower thermal energy of the impacting droplets, leading to the fabrication of dense coatings, with porosity less than 1% (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR296">296</xref>). HVOF spraying usually produces MMC coatings with WC content in excess of 80 wt.%, hardness of 800-1300 HV<sub>0.3</sub> and wear rates that are on the order of 4 × 10<sup>−6</sup> to 20 × 10<sup>−6</sup> mm<sup>3</sup>/N m after exposure to ASTM Standard G65 testing (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR302">302</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR304">304</xref>). Despite the advantages of the HVOF spraying process, changes in chemical composition, decarburization and possible oxidation of the sprayed powder, as a result of the high temperature of the flame, can occur. These changes reduce the ductility of the coating and, therefore, adversely affect the performance and longevity of the coatings and overlay when they are exposed to highly erosive environments that are typical of the OGI (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR299">299</xref>). The HVOF spray process carries higher operating and fixed costs than the plasma and flame spraying processes. HVOF spraying requires higher power and thus requires high fuel flow rates (60-120 SLM) and high oxygen flow rates (280-600 SLM) (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>).</p><p id="Par324">The possibility of oxidation and decarburization of the sprayed powder material due to the high temperatures of the HVOF process can be considered as one of the main challenges for the use of this process in the OGI. The adverse effects of the oxidation and decarburization may be mitigated by the correct choice of fuel-to-oxygen ratio to avoid an excess of oxygen in the flame and also to avoid overheating of the powder material. In addition to the proper choice of fuel-to-oxygen ratio, the use of shrouds has been shown to be effective in reducing the amount of oxygen in the deposited coating and decarburization of carbides such as WC-Co (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>).</p><p id="Par325">Difficulties associated with thermal spray deposition of protective coatings on components used in the OGI that are located in confined areas can limit the use of this technology in the OGI. The inner surface of pipes and vessels with small diameter or inside the components far from the entrance are typically confined areas in the OGI. In these areas, it may not be possible to fit the thermal spray gun assembly inside the component or meet the minimum required standoff distance between the nozzle exit and the substrate. To overcome such problems, the use of newly developed spraying torches that are slimmer and allow for insertion in small diameter long pipes can be considered as solutions for thermal spray deposition of protective coatings in confined areas. On the other hand, the spraying processes that can be performed at shorter standoff distances would allow for thermal deposition onto areas with even smaller dimensions. Thermal spray processes such as right-angled cold gas dynamic spraying that has a small spraying gun and required standoff distance of usually less than 10 mm can be considered as an appropriate method for thermal spray deposition in components of the OGI with limited space. Details about the cold spraying technology are discussed in section <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">2.1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec101"><title>Future Trends and Emerging Applications of Thermal Spray Technology in the Oil and Gas Industry</title><p id="Par326">HVOF spraying is currently one of the dominant thermal spray processes in the OGI. However, thermal spray equipment with lower temperature that can mitigate the adverse effects of temperature during the HVOF spraying process is of interest. High-velocity air flow (HVAF) spraying is a thermal spray process that is very similar to HVOF spraying. HVAF spraying differs from HVOF spraying in that it utilizes compressed air instead of pure oxygen as the oxidizer of the fuel (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR308">308</xref>). Thus, this process is financially attractive, and given that air contains approximately 21 vol.% oxygen to react with the fuel gas, the remaining volume of the air would cool the flame. For that reason, the HVAF spray flame temperature is lower than that of HVOF spraying, heating the particles less, and mitigating the occurrence of oxidation and decarburization when WC-based coatings are fabricated. Jacobs et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR308">308</xref>) showed that in contrast to HVOF spraying, no phase transformation occurred in HVAF-sprayed WC-Co-Cr coatings. A pin-on-disk testing apparatus was used to collect wear data, which showed that the wear resistance of HVAF-sprayed WC-Co-Cr coatings was seven times higher than those fabricated by HVOF spraying (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR308">308</xref>). Thus, the HVAF spray process may be considered as a well-suited alternative to HVOF spraying for the OGI.</p><p id="Par327">Cold gas dynamic spraying (“cold spraying” hereafter) is a thermal spray process in which powder particles are accelerated by gases such as air, nitrogen or helium to high velocities (up to 1500 m/s) through a convergent-divergent nozzle (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>). Unlike typical high-temperature spraying processes, the powder particles are not melted, and the coating is formed primarily by way of plastic deformation of the particles upon impact (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR307">307</xref>). As a result of the low process temperature, changes in chemical composition of the feedstock powder due to decarburization and oxidation reactions are minimal. The high velocity of the particles at impact results in coatings that are very dense, with porosities less than 1 vol.% in most cases (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR298">298</xref>). The fabrication of coatings without melting the powder particles and by using plastic deformation restricts the powder material to metals or alloys, since cermets and ceramics do not deform plastically. Recent studies, however, have explored the use of a low-pressure cold spray system (pressure below 1 MPa) that was based on air as the working fluid to deposit WC-based MMC coatings for potential applications in the OGI. Melendez et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR309">309</xref>) showed that by using a low-cost, low-pressure cold spraying unit, WC-Ni MMC coatings with WC content of nearly 70 wt.%, porosity of 0.3 vol.%, hardness of about 550 HV<sub>0.3</sub>, and wear rate, as calculated from ASTM Standard G65 testing data, of 20 × 10<sup>−6</sup> mm<sup>3</sup>/N m can be fabricated. The fact that the wear rate was in the range that is typically observed for HVOF-sprayed WC-based coatings (4 × 10<sup>−6</sup>-20 × 10<sup>−6</sup> mm<sup>3</sup>/N m) suggests that there is potential for the low-pressure cold spraying process in the fabrication of coatings for use in the OGI. Short standoff distances (around 5-10 mm) and the relatively small size of the nozzle of the cold spray systems are other advantages of this technology when compared to HVOF and flame spraying. These features may allow for deposition onto small components with complex geometries.</p><p id="Par328">Thermal spray of nanostructured, rather than conventional micron-sized, powder particles has been the subject of research studies that are aimed at developing denser coatings with higher resistance to wear. Al-Mutairi et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR303">303</xref>) have shown that HVOF-sprayed nanostructured WC-12Co coatings were slightly denser than conventional micron-sized HVOF-sprayed powder particles, with a 0.2 vol.% reduction in porosity. The hardness of the nanostructured coatings (1367 HV<sub>0.5</sub>) was higher than those that were fabricated from micron-sized powder particles (1066 HV<sub>0.5</sub>). This was due to the more uniform distribution of WC reinforcing particles within the metal matrix. Additionally, Fisher et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR310">310</xref>) reported a slight improvement in wear resistance of HVOF-sprayed WC-10Co-4Cr coatings when nanostructured powder feedstock was used (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR310">310</xref>). Although the use of nanostructured feedstock powder can slightly improve the wear resistance of the protective coatings, further research is required to determine whether the benefits of using nanostructured feedstock powder to fabricate coatings for the OGI will outweigh the higher costs of the powder.</p><p id="Par329">Studies have been conducted to explore the possibility of depositing harder materials such as titanium carbide (TiC) and boron carbide (B<sub>4</sub>C) as reinforcing particles in MMC coatings. The focus of the studies has been on the use of high-temperature thermal spray processes. Guilemany et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR311">311</xref>) deposited titanium carbide (TiC)-Ni-Ti MMC coatings by plasma spraying as protective coatings for applications in the OGI (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR311">311</xref>). The results showed that the corrosion rate of TiC-based MMC coatings (0.04 mm/year) in air-saturated sea water at 20°C was an order of magnitude lower than that of WC-12Co coating (0.4 mm/year). Despite the improved corrosion resistance of TiC-Ni-Ti coating, further research is required to evaluate the wear resistance of TiC-based coatings for possible application in sectors of the OGI in which abrasion or erosion is a concern.</p><p id="Par330">The uniform distribution of reinforcing particles with shorter mean free path between the particles in the MMC coatings has been shown to increase the hardness and decrease the wear rates of the coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR309">309</xref>). The improved performance of the coatings has been attributed to increased toughness and greater load sharing between the reinforcing particles, in the coatings (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR312">312</xref>). Post-processing techniques, such as friction stir processing (FSP), can be employed to redistribute the reinforcing particles in MMC coatings in order to achieve a more uniform distribution with shorter mean free path (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR312">312</xref>). Morisada et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR313">313</xref>) studied the effect of FSP on the modification of properties of HVOF-sprayed WC-CrC-Ni coatings. The hardness of the FSPed coatings (2000 HV<sub>0.3</sub>) was 1.5 times higher than that of as-sprayed WC-CrC-Ni coatings. Ashrafizadeh et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR314">314</xref>) studied the effect of FSP on the wear resistance of cold-sprayed WC-Co-Ni MMC coatings. Successful dispersion of the WC particles and a reduction of 0.25% in the wear rate of the coatings after FSP were reported (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR314">314</xref>). Although this post-treatment process can improve the microstructure and wear resistance of MMC coatings, future research on the application of FSP to HVOF- and HVAF-sprayed coatings that are tailored for the OGI will be required.</p><p id="Par331">The use of thermal sprayed coatings in the OGI is not limited to the deposition of protective coatings. Thermal spray technology can also be used for the fabrication of functional or smart coatings that will find application in other sectors of the OGI in which fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) pipes are used. FRP pipes have low electrical and thermal conductivity, and therefore, conventional methods that rely on electron or heat transfer through the pipes for damage detection and heating of these pipes are not feasible. Thermal spray techniques can be employed for metallization of the surface of polymer-based structures to introduce new methods of damage detection and heating of these structures (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR315">315</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR316">316</xref>). Gonzalez et al. (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR315">315</xref>) deposited conductive Al-based coatings on FRP pipes by flame spraying. The integrity of the polymer-based structure was monitored and was based on changes in the electrical resistance of the deposited coating as a result of localized degradation of the deposited coating, which was caused by degradation of the underlying FRP pipes (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR315">315</xref>). Lopera-Valle and McDonald (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR317">317</xref>) showed that flame-sprayed nickel chromium aluminum yttrium (NiCrAlY) and nichrome (Ni-20Cr) coatings with electrical resistances of 3.2-3.6 Ω that were deposited on FRP composite structures can be employed for resistive (Joule) heating. Temperature distributions that were nearly homogeneous and devoid of areas of localized high temperatures over the coating surfaces were achieved. The results suggest that thermal sprayed coatings can be utilized as heating elements on polymer-based structures. Although some progress in the field of metallization of polymer-based structures has been reported in several studies (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR215">215</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR317">317</xref>), future work on the use of the coatings for damage detection and heating of pipes under field conditions typical of the OGI will be needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec102"><title>Thermal Spray Coatings in Alternative Energy Applications</title><p id="Par332"><bold><italic>M.

While thermal spray technology seems to be inadequate for the direct production of the solar cells due to its particular as-sprayed microstructure and the possibility of impurities, it is used extensively to produce sputtering targets for physical vapor deposition (PVD). For example, anti-reflection and passivation layers, made of Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> and which are necessary to improve the efficiency and stability of PV cells, can be produced by the use of PVD sputtering technologies (with thermally sprayed silicon targets) instead of using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition.

Thermal spray methods have been attempted to produce these cells (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR335">335</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR336">336</xref>); however, their performance at present is not as good as those from wet chemical methods. Key issues are the manufacture of thin, high-density or hermetic membranes, and the manufacture of the porous electrodes with high specific surface areas. Newer processes such as suspension/solution plasma spraying and low-pressure plasma spray hybrid processes provide a certain amount of improvement.</p><p id="Par343">Even though the manufacture of complete SOFCs appears to be difficult at the present time, there are single functional layers for metal-substrate-supported cells that currently are thermally sprayed successfully. The interconnect plates, which separate the individual cells within a stack, are typically made of high-chromium-containing steels. These steels form conductive chromia-containing oxide scales, which are essential for the performance of the stack. Chromia species evaporate from these scales, especially in water vapor environments, and tend to poison the cathode. Currently, a widely applied strategy to avoid this degradation mechanism is the application of chromium evaporation barrier layers. These often are applied by APS and made of conductive oxides such as La-Sr-Mn perovskites or Mn-Co-Fe spinels (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR337">337</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR338">338</xref>). In another type of SOFC stack design, dense, electrically insulating coatings (e.g., of MgO-MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) are sprayed either by APS or HVOF to create hermetically sealed electrical isolations between the interconnects (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR339">339</xref>). Because all interconnect plates in practically all types of SOFCs must be coated, this appears to be an attractive application for thermal spray if the commercialization of SOFCs is to be achieved.</p></sec><sec id="Sec155"><title>Nuclear Energy</title><p id="Par344">The nuclear power industry consists primarily of large (&gt;700 MW electric) nuclear fission power plants using the steam Rankine cycle to generate electricity. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR340">340</xref>), in 2013, there were more than 400 nuclear plants operating worldwide producing approximately 15% of the world’s electricity. Like any other electricity-generating power plant using a heat source to produce steam to drive a turbine, nuclear power plants benefit from thermal spray coatings for corrosion and erosion minimization and dimensional restoration of worn parts. Advantages of thermal spray are especially important to decrease personnel exposure to radioactivity in nuclear power plants by decreasing the frequency of maintenance tasks and repairing rather than replacing components.</p><p id="Par345">Nuclear fission reactor components use a number of coatings applied by thermal spray. For example, zirconium plasma-sprayed coatings are applied to high neutron flux test reactor fuel to prevent chemical reactions between the uranium fuel and the aluminum cladding. B<sub>4</sub>C and Gd<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coatings (containing neutron absorbers such as boron and gadolinium, respectively) are useful for controlling the rate of nuclear reactions in the fuel. Thermally sprayed coatings of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Er<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> have been used to spray parts which come in contact with highly reactive molten uranium and plutonium alloys during fuel fabrication processing. Thermally sprayed Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> coatings can provide corrosion protection and electrical insulation to nuclear fuel waste reprocessing plant equipment which are subjected to acids, electric fields, high radioactivity and thermal shocks. Thermal spray coatings of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub>, and MgAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> have been investigated for providing corrosion resistance to the spent fuel rod long-term storage containers, which are designed for a useful life of 10,000 years in an aqueous environment subject to corrosion.</p><p id="Par346">Unlike the nuclear fission discussed above, nuclear fusion as a power source is yet to be realized. However, it has significant advantages over the fission technology such as its inherent safety, fuel abundance and reduced radioactive waste. These huge plus points are driving research efforts for the realization of fusion technology for commercial power generation. Thermal spray coatings find several application opportunities in support of this technology. Plasma-facing components, electrical insulation and permeation barriers are a few examples of applications where thermal spray technology is being investigated.</p><p id="Par347">Highly dense and conductive coatings of refractive materials such as tungsten can be applied on plasma-facing components (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR341">341</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR343">343</xref>) that are exposed to plasma having temperatures of millions of degrees. Their objective is to protect construction materials from particle irradiation and heat flux from the plasma. Plasma-sprayed alumina with excellent dielectric and mechanical properties has been successfully applied to provide electric insulation to various components of the reactor vacuum vessel from their supports to avoid high circulating currents as well as for various in-vessel diagnostic and auxiliary equipments. Tritium permeation barrier coatings are required for the components of the breeding blanket (where tritium is produced), as well as for the plasma-facing components. Moreover, for liquid breeder concepts where the coatings will be in contact with flowing Li-containing liquids, high corrosion resistance and electric insulation are required as well (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR344">344</xref>). For such a demanding application, various ceramic materials, mostly oxides and nitrides, have been explored, using a variety of techniques.

However, the thermal processing of municipal solid wastes is a very low profit operation so the cost of applying such coatings is of paramount importance in future applications. It is therefore necessary to compare the total economic cost of using such coatings on a total annualized basis, i.e., the cost of coating materials and application minus the savings of longer superheater life, which includes reduced boiler downtime. Sharobem (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR347">347</xref>) made such a comparison of some coatings vs a reference steel that is used for superheater tubes (SA 213 T22). Generally, the annualized cost is defined as the payment of owning and operating an asset over its entire lifetime. However, due to the highly competitive nature of the WTE industry, this information is not readily available. Therefore, Sharobem (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR347">347</xref>) assumed that the annualized cost factor was equal to the cost of materials plus installation divided by the “life factor”; the latter was defined as the wastage rate of an alloy or coating divided by the wastage rate of the baseline steel.

In addition, these processes have limitations concerning geometry, size of the products and substrate materials. In contrast, thermal spray has the unique ability that at the completion of the fast spray procedure, the product is in the desired final state and in most cases no or nearly no further processing is needed. As sintering can be avoided, the danger of material interdiffusion or other negative alterations can be reduced. Furthermore, thermal spray allows, in principle, for a near net shape production of multilayered structures with constant or controlled functionally graded composition of material and porosity with relatively low constraints concerning size and geometry (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR364">364</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec118"><title>Thermoelectric Generators (TEG)</title><p id="Par366">Thermoelectric generators are solid-state devices that convert heat directly into electricity.

In the frame of different projects, namely HYSOLAR, DLR’s developed vacuum plasma-sprayed (VPS) electrodes were tested as laboratory-sized electrodes leading to an efficiency of over 80% of the test electrolyzers (percentage of electrical energy converted into the chemical energy of the produced hydrogen), and the suitability for intermittent operation could be demonstrated. Also large electrodes proved positively in technical electrolyzers (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR373">373</xref>).</p><p id="Par371">Several challenges, however, remain to be addressed, which include beneath others:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par372">Optimization of the spray material and the well-bonded electrode layer structure.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par373">Investigation of degradation mechanisms.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par374">Industrialization of production of large sized electrodes, suited for renewable energy sources.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec120"><title>Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Water Electrolyzer (PEM-WE)</title><p id="Par375">Polymer electrolyte membrane water electrolysis (PEM-WE) has emerged as one of the most promising technologies for large-scale and efficient hydrogen production from surplus power. It offers distinct advantages over AWEs including ecological cleanness due to use of only deionized water instead of aqueous solutions, smaller footprint and mass, lower gas crossover and higher purity of produced hydrogen gas, and expected reduced operating costs (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR374">374</xref>). Thermal spray has limited applicability to the electrochemical active components of PEM-WEs, i.e., membrane electrode assembly (MEA), but has been showing promising results for the components gas diffusion layer (GDL) and bipolar plates (BPP). Due to highly corrosive environment in PEM-WEs, both GDL and BPP are made of titanium. The use of Ti material and its machining make the costs of these components very high as suggested in recent EU studies (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR375">375</xref>) that GCL and BPP correspond to around 2/3 of total costs of PEM-WEs (noble metal catalysts attribute to less than 10%). The cost of GDL and BPP is further enhanced by the fact that additional coating on top of Ti is needed as Ti exhibits passivation during operation leading to high resistance. In the recent work, DLR has published promising results of their patented approach in which stainless steel BPP are used protected by dense coatings of Ti/Au and Ti/Pt produced by thermal spray or combination of thermal spray and PVD (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR376">376</xref>). Similarly, stainless steel meshes-based GDL were introduced with thermally sprayed highly porous Ti coating along with secondary materials to limit passivation. These promising results open the possibility of further addressing the pending challenges including feedstock powder development, optimizing spray methods for either fully dense or controlled porous layers, large-scale production, etc.</p></sec><sec id="Sec121"><title>High-Temperature Solid Oxide Cells</title><sec id="Sec122"><title>Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs)</title><p id="Par376">High-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are not subjected to the “Carnot limitation” and convert directly chemical energy into electricity with high efficiencies reaching 60% in stand-alone operation and above 80% if waste heat can be used. SOFCs have reforming properties and can be fueled by hydrocarbons. Due to these characteristics, SOFCs are gaining interest for stationary applications for combined heat and power supply and as electricity source in automotive as on-board power generators called “auxiliary power units” (APU). Operating typically between 650 and 800°C, SOFCs consist of three main components: the cathode, (i) the air electrode, where air-oxygen is reduced to negatively charged oxygen ions (O<sup>2−</sup>), (ii) the dense electrolyte, which should only be “permeable” for such ions and (iii) the anode, the fuel electrode, where these ions react with the fuel (H<sub>2</sub> or/and CO) releasing electrons, which return to the cathode side via an external load, generating thereby a usable voltage/electrical power. Further products at the anode side are steam and CO<sub>2</sub>. The generated voltage value of such a cell in operation is typically around 0.7 V; therefore, several cells have to be arranged in series (stacked) to get a usable voltage and power, where so-called metal interconnectors establish the electrical contact between adjacent cells.</p><p id="Par377">Thermal spray has been used to produce all the electrochemical active components which are composed of (i) perovskites for the cathodes, (ii) yttria-stabilized zirconia for the electrolytes and (iii) a mixture (cermet) of yttria-stabilized zirconia and nickel for the anodes (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR377">377</xref>). Producing electrodes using thermal spray good control of the microstructure is required to have high conductivity, high active surface area and excellent permeability for flow of gases. Conventional thermal spray with agglomerated feedstock and suspension plasma spraying have shown potential toward achieving those characteristics, but further development is needed. Probably the biggest challenge lies with the electrolyte, which should exhibit a low resistivity for the oxygen ion diffusion and impermeability for electrons and gases (in particular hydrogen). This can be achieved either by having a suitable material or making the electrolyte as thin as possible (in sintered cells it is typically below 10 µm). These two demands of low thickness and high gas tightness pose the main challenge for the production of cells by thermal spray. Until now, “very high-velocity plasma spraying,” HVOF, suspension plasma or suspension HVOF spraying have been unable to offer a quality matching to that by sintering. Improved processes and new ones like “suspension and solution plasma spraying” allowing for the use of very fine powders or even to produce the layers in a plasma chemical way both could open, hopefully, a potential for thin electrolytes of required density or of other high-quality cell components (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR378">378</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR379">379</xref>). Besides these active components, technical cells have also further components which can be produced by thermal spray including Cr- protection layer on interconnects, solderable insulating layers for sealing of interconnect plates between adjacent cells in a stacks, diffusion barrier layers to prevent interdiffusion between the components. Several groups including DLR have shown feasibility to produce all or some of these components by thermal spray; quality and performance need improvement to be competitive to other production technologies (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR380">380</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR381">381</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec123"><title>Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC)</title><p id="Par378">About 30 years ago the German company Dornier was around with their project named “Hot-Elly” to produce hydrogen with high-temperature electrolysis. The electrolyzers consisted of tubes of series connected small cell rings. The idea of this approach was to reduce the required electricity demand for electrolysis by feeding directly high-temperature steam, because this energy form is not burdened by efficiency constraints as it is with the electrical share. This project was abandoned already about 20 years ago, but the gained technological knowledge was helpful and important for following work on SOFCs, because the SOFC process represents the inversion of the SOEC process; therefore, materials and material processing are almost similar, with exception that the requirements and operating conditions are even harder with SOECs compared to SOFCs. The new thinking about energy supply and the need for better and more efficient use of energy were the reason why activities on SOECs were started again, basing to large extent on recent experience with SOFCs and their production (Ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR379">379</xref>). Therefore, concerning thermal spray almost all is valid, here, which was discussed above with SOFCs.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><italic>ASM Handbook</italic>, Volume 5A: <italic>Thermal Spray Technology</italic>, R.
