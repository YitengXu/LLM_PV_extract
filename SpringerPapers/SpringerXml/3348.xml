In this paper, we demonstrate that this method can access electrons dynamics in PbS quantum dots over a wide time window spanning from pico- to microseconds in a single experiment carried out at the synchrotron facility BESSY II. The method is sensitive to small changes in core level positions. Fast measurements at low pump fluences are enabled by the use of a pump laser at a lower repetition frequency than the repetition frequency of the X-ray pulses used to probe the core level electrons: Through the use of a time-resolved spectrometer, time-dependent analysis of data from all synchrotron pulses is possible. Furthermore, by picosecond control of the pump laser arrival at the sample relative to the X-ray pulses, a time-resolution limited only by the length of the X-ray pulses is achieved. Using this method, we studied the charge dynamics in thin film samples of PbS quantum dots on n-type MgZnO substrates through time-resolved measurements of the Pb 5d core level. We found a time-resolved core level shift, which we could assign to electron injection and charge accumulation at the MgZnO/PbS quantum dots interface. This assignment was confirmed through the measurement of PbS films with different thicknesses. Our results therefore give insight into the magnitude of the photovoltage generated specifically at the MgZnO/PbS interface and into the timescale of charge transport and electron injection, as well as into the timescale of charge recombination at this interface. It is a unique feature of our method that the timescale of both these processes can be accessed in a single experiment and investigated for a specific interface.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">2014-6463</award-id><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">2018-04125</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johansson</surname><given-names>Fredrik O.

It is particularly interesting to implement such techniques for the study of any type of device that relies on fast charge transport and charge transfer across interfaces, such as, for example, solar cells, transistors and light emitting diodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Understanding the charge transfer and charge dynamics in such materials is of great fundamental interest as well as essential for further improvement in real device applications. There have been many reports of ultrafast spectroscopy trying to reveal the details of charge carrier generation dynamics, electron–hole separation etc. Most of these studies included infrared, visible and UV laser pulses for triggering and probing by measuring fluorescence or absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, these methods generally only probe the valence states of materials, which are very often distributed over several different atomic sites. With the use of X-rays as probe pulses, it is possible to access element-specific information. Time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (TRPES) using an ultraviolet, visible or near-infrared pump laser can be used to study the electron dynamics through a particular core level of the sample relating to a specific element and chemical state of the sample. By carrying out measurements at different time delays between the arrival of the laser (pump) and X-ray (probe) pulses on the sample, it becomes possible to monitor changes in core level peak positions and intensities over time and follow the kinetics of the processes causing these changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Most frequently, this technique has been used so far to study photo-induced voltages between a sample surface and its bulk, i.e. to monitor the surface photovoltage (SPV) within the space charge region of semiconductor interfaces. The SPV effect arises, when the electrons and holes move away from/towards the surface (depending on the type of semiconductor) after excitation across the bandgap. This creates a small electric field which reduces the initial band bending and shifts the valence band maximum together with the core levels in the system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Such shifts can be followed by photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) through the shifts of the core level binding energies (E<sub>B</sub>). However, a photo-induced voltage and related shift in the core level positions can also be caused by charge separation across an interface in a heterostructured sample. The timescales of such charge separation can be very different (longer) than the timescales in which the SPV effect is typically observed. Valuable information can therefore be gained in a measurement, where a wide time window is accessible. This can be achieved by carrying out time-resolved PES measurements at synchrotron radiation facilities, if an external pump laser is synchronized to the X-ray pulses generated by the synchrotron. The available time window is then limited by the pulse length of the X-rays and the accuracy of controlling the pump-probe delay for fast timescales and by the pump laser repetition rate for slow timescales. Furthermore, a time-resolved detection scheme is needed to assign electrons to specific X-ray pulses. Here, we present such TRPES measurements on lead sulphide quantum dot samples accessing a time window spanning six orders of magnitude, where we used the LowDosePES end-station at the synchrotron BESSY II. This was made possible through three factors: (1) The use of BESSY II in single bunch mode operation; (2) the use of an angle-resolved time-of-flight (ArTOF) analyzer for electron detection, which gave both time resolution and high transmission for electron detection and (3) a synchronized external pump laser operated at a much lower repetition frequency than the synchrotron.</p><p id="Par4">The quantum dots (QDs) studied here are of interest among chemists and physicists, mainly because of the possibility of tuning the bandgap, but also for the high absorption coefficients, and the possibility of multiple-exciton generation in QD materials. Furthermore, QDs can be synthesized and processed from solution, enabling easy variations in the synthesis and therefore properties and making them economically accessible. In solar cells, QDs can be used in different architectures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Our description here refers in particular to QD solar cells using a thin film of PbS quantum dots as the absorbing material. During past years, significant achievements were obtained regarding the stability and power conversion efficiency of solar cells based on this active material, due to immense research of their surface chemistry, charge dynamics, and energy band engineering. In particular, the solar cell performance has been improved through developments in surface passivation by different ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, cell architecture changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and modifications of the electron transporting layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In a typical solar cell architecture, an n-type metal oxide such as TiO<sub>2</sub> or ZnO on a conductive glass substrate is used as the bottom layer for the solar cell structure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This is followed by an n-type PbS quantum dots layer with halide ligands of a typical thickness of a few hundreds of nanometers followed by a thinner p-type PbS QD layer (typically with ethanedithiol (EDT) as the ligand) and a gold back contact. Further improvement to the cell performance is still achieved through an optimization of the ligand exchange for the n-type PbS QD layer. The highest reported efficiencies of PbS QD solar cells are now over 12%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, for quantum dots films prepared using the solution phase ligand exchange method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In these solar cells, most light is absorbed in the thick n-type PbS QD layer and electrons have to be collected in the n-type metal oxide and holes in the p-type PbS QD layer. Charges can move from quantum dot to quantum dot through a hopping mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. This charge transport has to be faster than the recombination of charges within the quantum dot layer and at contacts for efficient solar cells. Charge transport and charge recombination in complete solar cells are typically studied through charge mobility and photovoltage decay measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In the measurements by TRPES presented here, we are able to study the charge transport and charge recombination between the metal oxide contact and the quantum dot absorber layer specifically within one measurement. This method is therefore complimentary to experiments carried out on complete devices. Using the quantum dot system as an example, we show how to carry out measurements and how to process the large amounts of data generated to obtain kinetic information at timescales covering six orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the advantages and flexibility of carrying out time-resolved measurements at a synchrotron: the high repetition frequency of the X-ray probe pulses reduces measurement times, while the variable repetition frequency of the laser pulses allows an optimized match to the time scales of the studied processes.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Architecture of QD samples used in photoelectron spectroscopy (left).

In the case of laser illumination, the delay time between the laser pulse and the first X-ray was set to 100 ps, but the spectrum was obtained from all 120 X-ray pulses, which hit the sample (in between two laser pulses), and therefore gives an average spectrum during laser illumination. For both spectra, the ArTOF spectrometer was used in fixed mode with a center kinetic energy of 65 eV and the total measurement time was 180 s. A shift to higher binding energies is observed upon laser illumination. This shift can be explained through charge separation between the PbS quantum dots and the MgZnO substrate. In the dark, the Fermi level of the quantum dots and that of the substrate align (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Upon illumination with the 515 nm laser, electron–hole pairs are generated in the quantum dot film. Some of the excited electrons will be injected into the n-type MgZnO substrate leading to a splitting of the quasi-Fermi levels between the MgZnO and the PbS QD layer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). For any injected electron, a hole remains in the PbS QD layer leading to a positive charging of the quantum dot layer. At steady state this leads to shift of all core levels of the PbS QD layer to higher binding energies, shown here for the Pb 5d level, i.e. to the generation of a photovoltage. In this model, the magnitude of the shift therefore depends on the number of injected electrons as well as on potential changes in band alignment at the interface, which accompany electron injection. Previously, a change in the band bending at the interface has been used to explain a time-resolved voltage change in the interface of a mono-layer of quantum dots with a ZnO single crystal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In our measurements, we cannot directly observe the interface between the MgZnO and the quantum dots and can therefore not directly observe changes in band bending either.

Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows two examples of this. Panels (a) and (b) show the fit position averaged over the two spin–orbit-split peaks from two delay scans carried out on two different spots of the same sample with the same laser pulse energy.

Each color in the graph (in total 15 colours going from blue to red) represents the results of the analysis of a separate trigger time map at a different laser delay (i.e. one panel in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Due to the logarithmic time-axis, the data points from different delay times are seen as clearly separated for the first X-ray pulse. However, for the later X-ray pulses, the data points collapse on top of each other, as the difference in delay time becomes small compared to the trigger time difference between the laser pulse and the X-ray pulses. We also calculated an average binding energy position (Ē<sub>B</sub>) for each trigger time map by evaluating the average of all E<sub>B</sub> positions for the trigger time map. The Ē<sub>B</sub> can give a good indication of overall variations between consecutive measurements, which extend beyond variations due to a change in delay time. The Ē<sub>B</sub> parameters for each trigger time map, as well as a baseline value calculated from the last 15% of the data points in a map (a time region, where there is only insignificant time-resolved change in the binding energy positions) are displayed on the right in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>.

This indicates that the variations observed in the data presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b are related to the absolute peak positions but do not influence the kinetic traces as much. In this case the fit parameters obtained for later X-ray pulses can be averaged to improve the overall signal-to-noise ratio of the data.

As the number of injected electrons increases, the rate of recombination will increase and the maximum number of charges and highest photovoltage will be observed at the delay time, where G = R (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Following this maximum, the number of charges will decrease due to recombination and the kinetic traces will begin to mostly reflect the rate of recombination (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>b).</p><p id="Par21">A higher laser pulse energy will increase the number of photons absorbed by the quantum dot film and therefore a higher number of charges are generated within the quantum dot film leading to more charge separation to the substrate and therefore to a higher photovoltage (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This is in agreement with our observation of complete solar cells based on the same substrate and quantum dot type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. If the recombination rate depends primarily on the charge concentration (Eq. <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>), then the rate of recombination increases with the laser pulse energy, leading to this rate surpassing the generation rate at earlier delay times (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, when the amount of charges (and therefore the photovoltage) has decreased to the same amount, the rate of recombination will be the same independent of the initial laser pulse energy. This is observed from delay times of approximately 1 μs onwards here (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>b). When discussing the different film thicknesses, it becomes important to consider the sample geometry: Samples are illuminated from the quantum dot side of the samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) with a 45° angle between the laser and the sample surface. Light is therefore absorbed more strongly close to the top surface of the 250 nm quantum dot film (the penetration depth is estimated from the absorption spectrum to be about 76 nm for the 250 nm thick film) and charges are therefore mostly generated away from the MgZnO substrate. An increase in the film thickness therefore leads to a direct increase in how far charges have to travel before reaching the substrate and therefore to a change in <italic>n</italic><sub>I</sub> and <italic>G</italic> as a function of time (Eq. <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>). A slower rise was observed for the thicker film compared to the thinner one showing that <italic>G</italic> depends on the film thickness and therefore on the charge transport time to the substrate. On the other hand, the decay in the photovoltage depends on the rate of recombination between electrons in the MgZnO and holes in the quantum dots. This process can depend on several factors including charge trapping in the MgZnO and the rate of hole diffusion to the MgZnO interface and can therefore show complex kinetics. By increasing the thickness of the PbS QD film, the volume over which the holes can spread increases, which could lead to a reduction in the recombination rate through a decrease of <italic>p</italic><sub>I</sub> according to Eq. <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">(2)</xref>.</p><p id="Par22">When comparing our results to previous studies, one notes that there are few studies on PbS quantum dots, which investigate such a wide time range in a single measurement. A previous TRPES study focused on a PbS monolayer on ZnO with a time resolution of 150 ns, but used a continuous wave laser for excitation instead of a pulsed laser<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Both the difference in experimental set-up and in the sample lay-out means that the kinetics observed in their study cannot be directly compared to those observed in ours. A continuous wave laser means that the rise time of the photovoltage will correspond to the time it takes to reach an equilibrium between charge separation and recombination and not directly to the charge separation time. In their system charge transport between quantum dots is not expected to play a significant role, while in our case the rise time of the photovoltage clearly depends on the quantum dot film thickness. We note however that the photo-induced binding energy shift observed here is significantly larger (&gt; 100 meV) than that observed in this previous study (&lt; 30 meV).</p><p id="Par23">Recombination dynamics of thin film quantum dot samples are often investigated via photovoltage decay measurements on complete solar cells and focus on the microsecond to millisecond timescales<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Typical voltage decay times for systems similar to ours (a thick PbS quantum dot layer with a MgZnO electron extraction layer, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) show recombination times ranging from tens of microseconds to milliseconds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>, which is a significant difference to the recombination times ranging from hundreds of nanosecond to tens of microseconds observed here. This difference can have two main reasons: In the complete solar cell, further interfaces at which charge separation can occur are introduced – namely to a p-type quantum dot layer and from that to a metal contact. This can change the overall recombination time, and photovoltage decay measurements are not specific to particular interfaces in the solar cell. In contrast, our TRPES measurements focus on the interface between MgZnO and the PbS quantum dot layer. Furthermore, the difference observed in the binding energy of a sample fully in the dark (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) and at long delay times suggests that not all charges recombine fully within the timescale of our measurement. In contrast, in time-resolved photovoltage measurements fast components of the voltage decay cannot always be resolved within the time resolution of the experiments. Our measurements therefore focus on the faster component of the voltage decay occurring at the MgZnO/PbS interface in absence of a hole selective interface.</p><p id="Par24">Laser-based time-resolved studies have often focused on ultrafast processes in PbS quantum dot systems either through investigating the dynamics of transient absorption or time-resolved photoluminescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. In this way, the charge injection from PbS quantum dots to ZnO or MgZnO substrates has been studied and was found to occur on ultrafast timescales including sub-picosecond<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. However, it should be noted that such studies have often been carried out on systems, where a mono-layer of the quantum dots is adsorbed to the metal oxide and charge transport through a quantum layer is not necessary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. This suggests that the photovoltage rise times observed here are mostly limited by the charge transport through the quantum dot layer and not by the injection into the substrate itself.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par25">In summary, we have shown that the set-up at the LowDosePES station at Bessy II can be used for time-resolved core level photoelectron spectroscopy with time scales spanning six orders of magnitude. The charge dynamics in PbS quantum dot films of relevance for solar cells could be investigated following the binding energy shifts in the Pb 5d core level induced by the visible pump laser. In particular, this type of measurement bridges the timescales investigated in ultrafast laser measurements and those in transient photovoltage measurements on complete solar cell devices and should in the future allow for a simultaneous investigation of charge separation and charge recombination processes. Such measurements were made possible through the combination of a highly efficient spectrometer, an X-ray photon energy optimized for high photoemission cross section and a pump laser with a variable frequency. By reducing the pump laser frequency, we were able to measure the dynamics of relevance to our system by analyzing all single-bunch X-ray pulses incident on the sample in between two successive laser pulses. The extra information available through the large number of X-ray pulses incident on the sample after one laser pulse also allows to assess sample stability during a delay scan measurement, where the arrival times of the laser at the sample is varied with picosecond precision in relation to the X-ray arrival time. The method presented is highly sensitive to even small core level shifts and good data quality was achieved with relatively short measurement times. Only moderate pump fluences were needed to be able to detect a time-resolved signal, which means that measurements with relevance to real systems can be carried out and damage of samples by the pump laser can be avoided.</p><p id="Par26">The laser-induced binding energy shifts measure the build-up of a photovoltage in the sample, which we assign to charge separation with electron transfer to the substrate, accumulation and a subsequent recombination at the interface. The process is relatively slow compared to the build-up of a surface photovoltage, which is most commonly studied by time-resolved core level spectroscopy. Our interpretation is confirmed by the laser power and film thickness dependences of the observed kinetics. The measured photovoltage is specific to the interface studied (PbS/MgZnO in this case) and, in the future, the other interfaces in the solar cell such as the junction between n-type quantum dots with halide ligands and p-type quantum dots with ethanedithiol ligands could be investigated through targeted sample design.</p><p id="Par27">By choosing the Pb 5d core level for analysis, we specifically investigated the energetics of the PbS quantum dots in this case. With the range of photon energies available at a synchrotron, core levels of other materials can also be studied, and this selectivity could be used in combination with sample design to investigate charge transfer between different materials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Experimental methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par28">All reagents and solvents for the synthesis of the materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

The mixture is first degassed with nitrogen flow for 1 h and later heated to 100 °C and kept under nitrogen atmosphere for 2 h. Simultaneously, the hexamethyldisilathiane ((TMS)<sub>2</sub>S, synthetic grade, 0.356 g) solution in ODE (10 ml) was prepared in a glovebox. When taken out of the glovebox, the argon above the solution in the vial was carefully removed under fume hood with a syringe, leaving a mild vacuum condition inside the vial, which could then be moved into the oven and kept at 80 °C for another 2 h. After 2 h of stirring at 100 °C, the temperature of the reaction mixture was lowered to 90 °C and the (TMS)<sub>2</sub>S was quickly injected, giving rise to an instantaneous reaction. The heating source is removed 2–3 min after the injection, letting the PbS-OA particles cool down to room temperature. The newly formed PbS-OA were then cleaned in 2 washing steps with acetone and toluene, then dried under vacuum and finally dispersed in octane so that the concentration was between 80 and 40 mg/ml. The particles synthesized in this way have a diameter of about 3 nm with an optical energy gap of 1.3 eV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>PES sample fabrication</title><p id="Par30">The substrate used for sample fabrication was ITO-coated glass (1.1 mm ITO, ~ 12 Ω/sq), sequentially cleaned with diluted RBS-25 concentrate, acetone, and ethanol respectively in the ultrasonic bath and dried with air flow. Additionally, the clean ITO was treated with UV-ozone for 20 min directly before deposition of MgZnO nanoparticles. The MgZnO nanoparticles were filtered through a 0.2 µm filter and spin-coated on ITO-substrates at 3000 rpm for 30 s, followed by annealing at 200 °C for 30 min and 300 °C for another 30 min under fume hood. The PbS QD films were prepared according to a previously reported method with small modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. The starting concentrated PbS QD solution in octane was diluted to 10 mg/ml before being mixed with previously prepared ligand solution in 1:1 volume ratio. The ligand solution contained 0.1 M PbI<sub>2</sub>, 0.02 M PbBr<sub>2</sub> and 0.04 M ammonium acetate in dimethylformamide (DMF). As soon as the solutions are in contact, they are mixed vigorously for 5 min (at room temperature). During this process the PbS QD are removed from octane to DMF phase and the ligand exchange is complete. The octane-OA phase is removed with the pipette and the QD are washed in fresh octane in order to remove the OA residues. After two washing steps, toluene is added to precipitate the QD, after which the QD are centrifuged and dried under vacuum for approx. 1 h and dispersed in butylamine so that the concentration is 200 mg/ml. This final solution is referred to as PbS QD ink. Next,1/4 of the ink was spin coated on top of the MgZnO layer at 1800 rpm for 30 s and immediately annealed at 70 °C for 10 min. This procedure gives 250 ± 10 nm thick samples. The 200 mg/ml solution was diluted with butylamine in 1:4 volume ratio to obtain a 50 mg/ml QD solution resulting in film thicknesses of 50 ± 10 nm. At this point the samples for PES are stored in darkness, in a desiccator before measurement. For the PES measurement the sample is mounted on a sample plate using a carbon tape and it is grounded by applying silver paint over the edge of the sample, connecting the surface of the sample with the sample plate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Material characterization</title><p id="Par31">UV–Vis measurements were carried out with a double beam and monochromator Lambda 750 UV–Vis–NIR spectrophotometer with pre-aligned tungsten-halogen and deuterium source, and photomultiplier R955 and Peltier-cooled PbS as detectors.

The beamline settings selected were 360 l/mm grating and cff = 1.6, the pressure in the analysis chamber was about 10<sup>−9</sup> mbar and the sample was at ambient temperature. The analyser used for the detection of electrons was an angular-resolved time-of-flight spectrometer (ARTOF) with an acceptance cone of ± 15° for high photoelectron transmission. The raw data from the spectrometer was converted into intensity-versus-energy spectra using the IGOR ARTOF loader and analysis package available at the end-station.</p><p id="Par33">The laser system installed at the beamline (Tangerine model from the company Amplitude Systèmes) was used at its second harmonic (515 nm), with a pulse length of about 350 fs, and a repetition frequency of 10.4 kHz for time-resolved PES measurements. For the spatial alignment of the X-rays and the laser spot on the sample, an yttrium–aluminum-garnet (YAG) crystal installed on the manipulator was used. An image of the laser on the crystal was recorded using a microscope camera and analysed in IGOR. The laser spot is an ellipse due to the 45° angle incidence and its size was analyzed through Gaussian fitting of the intensity profiles in the vertical and horizontal directions. The standard deviation of this Gaussian was 0.14 mm for the vertical axis and 0.25 mm for the horizontal axis. Thus, it was estimated that 68% of the laser power are incident in an area about 0.11 mm<sup>2</sup>. The power of the laser was adjusted by changing the efficiency of the external acousto-optic modulator of the laser system and was measured using a thermopile-based power sensor right before the in-vacuum laser incoupling optics. Two laser powers were used for measurements: 0.16 mW and 0.045 mW. These powers correspond to energies of 15.4 nJ and 4.3 nJ per pulse and the estimated laser fluences at the sample are: 9.5 μJ cm<sup>−2</sup> and 2.7 μJ cm<sup>−2</sup> per pulse.

Prior to each laser exposure, the sample was quickly analysed by an overview spectrum at multiple spots at the same photon energy as with the laser illumination confirming that different sample spots showed similar spectra. Measurements with the laser were carried out using a multiscan function developed by the beamline scientists to set up a sequence of several consecutive measurements in a fixed mode with the kinetic energy window centred on the core level of interest (Pb 5d in this study) and with the correct time-alignment of the laser and X-ray pulses. The temporal overlap between the laser and X-ray pulses was established by measuring the arrival times of the X-ray and laser photons using the ArTOF for photon detection. The laser delay was continuously electronically adjusted with respect to the X-rays.</p><p id="Par35">Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) was carried out at the HAXPES end-station at the GALAXIES beamline of the SOLEIL French synchrotron facility (Paris)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> where the photon energy covers the 2.3–12 keV range.
