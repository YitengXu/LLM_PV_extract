These hybrid hydrogels were prepared by in situ UV-assisted aniline polymerization during hydrogel network formation in a controlled interfacial reaction. They were then tested as flexible quasi-solid electrolytes with a counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells. This electrolyte-counter electrode system was prepared on top of a titanium dioxide layer deposited on a transparent and conductive anode electrode (ITO). Three different nanostructured Gel–PANI hybrid hydrogels were fabricated by employing different PANI concentrations and used for constructing electrolyte–counter electrode systems that displayed conductivities between 0.003 S/cm and 0.02 S/cm. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) that had the configuration ITO/TiO<sub>2</sub>/Gel–PANI/ITO were prepared and tested using natural dye extracted from <italic>Myrciaria cauliflora</italic>. The energy conversion efficiency was evaluated under AM1.5 (100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) light irradiation and was found to reach values above 2.0%. The device’s energy conversion efficiency was found to be higher than those of others with the same natural dye. The process proved to be fast and facile, and it utilized an inexpensive natural dye.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Solar

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Massive use of mobile devices and the spread of wearable technologies lead to constant searches for mobile power sources or sources incorporated into the devices. In this sense, flexible and low-cost solar cells can be widely employed due to the vast presence of energy radiated by the sun.</p><p id="Par3">Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC), which are composed of a nanocrystalline semiconductor oxide film electrode, dye sensitizers, electrolytes, a counter electrode and a transparent conducting substrate, have the potential to develop low-cost photovoltaic (PV) devices. Like plants that are effective in capturing energy over a wide range of light conditions, they work in lower light levels than do traditional PV. Thus, the outdoor environments of hospitals, airports, bus/train station windows and surfaces have become low cost energy sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Typically, dye-derived nanocrystalline titania (TiO<sub>2</sub>) films have been used as photoanode, platinum-coated substrate as a counter electrode, and between them exists an electrolyte solution of I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>/I<sup>−</sup> in an organic solvent, forming sandwiched solar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. To reduce the tri-iodide ions of the liquid electrolyte, the counter electrode must have high electrocatalytic activity. In addition to platinum coating on transparent conductive oxide substrate, carbon is usually used. Nevertheless, the high cost of platinum has triggered its replacement by other cheaper materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Conductive polymers, such as polyaniline (PANI), have been investigated as an alternative due to their properties including high conductivity, good stability, catalytic activity and low cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Long-term operation of liquid electrolytes is usually restricted due to their sealing issues and volatility of the organic solvent. The development of quasi-solid-state electrolytes, such as gel structures, constitutes another approach to avoid the problems of liquid electrolytes. Conductive polymers such as PANI, polypyrrole, polythiophene, polyphenylene vinylene and polyacetylene are potential candidates for quasi-solid-state electrolytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">DSSCs based on natural sensitizers (NDSSC) have become a topic of significant research because of their urgency and importance in the energy conversion field. Moreover, they offer advantages over more conventional approaches, such as easier fabrication, lower-cost and being constituted by nontoxic materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Anthocyanins are a viable alternative to red dyes from natural sources. They are soluble in water, which facilitates their incorporation into aqueous systems and may replace artificial red colorants such as Ponceau 4R, erythrosine and Bordeaux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">A good source of anthocyanin pigments is the fruit of the jabuticabeira. The jabuticaba (<italic>Myrciaria cauliflora</italic>) is a native Brazilian plant that is located mainly in several states of the southeastern region of the country [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As plants that are effective in capturing energy in a wide range of lighting conditions, dye-sensitized solar cells operate at lower light levels than traditional silicon solar cells.</p><p id="Par9">The aim of this work was to develop a quasi-solid electrolyte with inside counter electrode based on an ionic hydrogel and PANI produced in one step over an ITO conductive glass substrate coated with TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, which were sensitized using natural dye from <italic>Myrciaria cauliflora</italic> as a photoactive electrode.

In Gel:PANI 2 samples with the lowest percentages of aniline and ammonium persulfate, it can be clearly observed that the employed synthesis conditions led to a controlled growth of the PANI particles to yield needle-like structures with mean diameter of 70 nm and length of 100-200 nm, as revealed by I-AFM imaging. This special nanostructured morphology is a result of the PANI polymerization confined in a 2D environment, which is represented by the interfacial region in which both viscous solutions interact.

When hydrogel samples (with no PANI) were used in the DSSCs, a loss of efficiency higher than 50% was noted. Otherwise, a loss of efficiency of less than 30% was observed for DSSCs with hydrogels with PANI (such as Gel:PANI 6), as an indication that the quasi-solid electrolytes with PANI were more mechanically stable and were able to restrict the degradation of the dye.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>DSSCs efficiency as a function of time</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42452_2019_1657_Fig10_HTML.png" id="MO14"/></fig></p><p id="Par52">The possibility of having both energy conversion and storage in DSSC containing cations such as Li<sup>+</sup> has been discussed recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

SEM and conductive AFM images showed that the morphology of the PANI phase within the hydrogels shifted from needle-like to fiber-, ribbon- and sheet-like morphologies when higher concentrations of PANI were used. FTIR, DSC and UV–Vis results indicated that a strong interaction between PANI and the hydrogel chains and a secondary doping of PANI by the acrylic acid moieties were promoted. Nanoindentation measurements demonstrated that PANI was able to enhance the elastic moduli of both wet and dry hydrogels. Moreover, the electrical conductivity of the hydrogels was significantly improved by the incorporation of PANI with low percolation thresholds. Natural dye-sensitized solar cells were fabricated by using the developed hydrogel containing PANI as a quasi-solid electrolyte with inside counter electrode and the shell of <italic>Myrciaria cauliflora</italic> (jabuticaba) as a dye. Solar cell efficiencies above 2% were measured, which indicated that hydrogels containing PANI can act as quasi-solid electrolytes, as well as that counter electrodes can enhance diffusion and reduction of iodine ions. Therefore, hydrogels with nanostructured PANI were shown to be good candidates for quasi-solid electrolytes that can also act as counter electrodes for flexible solar cells, such as those based on natural dye sensitizers.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the financial support from CNPq, Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível
