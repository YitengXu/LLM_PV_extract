In this study, we present a new strategy for controlling the distance between quantum dots (QDs) based on one-dimensional spatial confinement in a polymer nanofiber template. This reliable technique allows for the isolation of QDs at a sufficient distance in a thin film and retains their monomeric character, with distinct spectra from aggregates (~30-nm shift) and monoexponential photoluminescence decay, indicating the suppression of inter-dot interactions. We successfully developed light-harvesting devices by incorporating QDs in nanofibers as an auxiliary light harvester, improving the performance of these devices from 5.9 to 7.4%. This strategy offers a viable path of controlling the arrangements of various functional moieties in solid-state devices.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ResearchSummary"><title>Quantum dots: wired for catching rays</title><p id="Par2">By packing quantum dots evenly in polymer nanofibres, a Korean team has found a way to boost the performance of artificial light harvesters. The high-intensity optical properties of quantum dots make them ideal for devices such as lasers and photosensors, but such effects are lost when the tiny dots aggregate together. To prevent unwanted clustering, Dongho Kim from Yonsei University in Seoul and co-workers used electrospinning techniques to embed quantum dots into poly(methyl methacrylate) nanofibres. Electron microscopy images and spectroscopic measurements showed this approach isolated the dots retaining their monomeric characteristics and that their separations were determined by the nanofibre diameter— a result that supports using this strategy to manipulate other moieties into useful spatial arrangements. Incorporating the hybrid material in a dye-sensitized solar cell revealed that the dots raised the light-harvesting efficiency from 5.9% to 7.4%.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs3" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par3">Confining quantum dots (QDs) into one-dimensional polymer nanostructures, we develop an inter-dot spacing control technique by which we can effectively isolate QDs in the solid-state film. The resultant isolated QDs in this nanostructure have clear monomeric features caused by attenuation of several problematic interactions, such as self-quenching. By incorporating isolated QD as an auxiliary light harvester, we can improve the performance of light-harvesting devices due to its additional absorption and efficient energy transfer.

control the spatial distribution of functional moieties in devices and prevent the formation of aggregates, both for fundamental research and the potential technological applications. In solid-state films in particular, it has been challenging to increase film thickness while keeping functional moieties in the monomeric state.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we demonstrate a general strategy for controlling the distance between functional moieties based on one-dimensional spatial confinement in a polymeric nanofiber template. One key observation, shown both experimentally and computationally, is that as the radius of a nanofiber template becomes smaller, the distance between moieties increases, thus leading to substantial isolation of each dot. QDs were chosen as a representative functional moiety because they can be easily observed by electron microscopy and because they have a high quantum yield, excellent photostability and long intrinsic lifetime that is distinguishable from their inter-dot energy transfer time (50 ps–2 ns).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> We have fabricated isolated QDs (iQDs) by confining QDs in a narrow polymer nanofiber, and the resulting structure was studied with a confocal luminescence microscope, transmission electron microscope and scanning electron microscope. By systematically elucidating the optical characteristics of this material, such as its photoluminescence spectrum and its decay profile, we discovered that iQDs have distinct photoluminescence spectra and lifetimes compared with typical two-dimensional QD aggregates. These results represent the monomeric properties of iQDs in solid-state nanofiber films. Moreover, we evaluated the potential of using spatial control technique in various devices and, as a brief example, tested the applicability of iQD as an auxiliary light harvester to improve the performance of Förster resonant energy transfer (FRET)-based light-harvesting devices (over 25%).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fabrication of fiber-embedded iQDs</title><p id="Par6">First, 1.0–2.0 g poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA; Mn=990 000, 99% hydrolyzed) was dispersed in 10 ml of chloroform with vigorous stirring for ~2 h, followed by the addition of 1 ml of CdSe solution (toluene). The resulting homogeneous solution (0.24–1 or 1–5 wt% CdSe for the single-molecule spectroscopic study or the ensemble spectroscopic study, respectively) was used for electrospinning. A needle with a Cu rod inserted to connect the high-voltage supply was filled with the CdSe/chloroform solution. An Al sheet connected to the ground was used as the receiver. The distance between the burette tip and receiver was fixed at 10 cm, and the high-voltage supply was fixed at 13 kV. The spinning rate was controlled at ~20 μl m<sup>–1</sup> using a syringe infusion pump (KDS200, KD Scientific, Holliston, MA, USA). The films were cast by electrospinning the composite solution onto a 1.5-mm-thick quartz crystal plate or thoroughly cleaned microscope cover slips to ensemble spectroscopy or single-molecule spectroscopy, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Device fabrication</title><p id="Par7">To prepare the working electrode of the dye-sensitized solar cell, a fluorine-doped SnO<sub>2</sub> (FTO)-conducting glass substrate (TEC 8, Pilkington, Tokyo, Japan) was first washed with a detergent solution in a sonicator bath for 10 min and then rinsed with deionized water and ethanol. The clean FTO glass substrates were then coated with the hierarchically structured nanobeads composed of anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and nanofibers enveloping CdSe QD obtained via the simultaneous electrospray and electrospinning method. To obtain a uniform thickness over a large area, the nozzle and the substrate were placed on a motion control system regulated by a microprocessor. The thickness of the active layer was measured and found to be 7–8 μm using an Alpha-step 200 surface profiler (Tencor, Milpitas, CA, USA). The working electrode was immersed into 0.1 <sc>M</sc> aqueous TiCl<sub>4</sub>, followed by washing with deionized water and ethanol, and then sintered at 200 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the working electrodes were immersed in solutions of β-(4-ethynylbenzoic acid)-substituted zinc porphyrin (ZnEP1, 0.2 m<sc>M</sc> in ethanol) and allowed to stand overnight (15–20 h).</p><p id="Par8">To prepare the counter electrode, the FTO plates were drilled and washed first with deionized water and then 0.1 <sc>M</sc> hydrochloric acid in ethanol with sonication for 10 min.

The dye-adsorbed TiO<sub>2</sub> films and the platinum counter electrodes were assembled into sealed sandwich-type cells by heating with a hot-melt film (Surlyn 1702, 25 μm thickness, Dupont, Wilmington, DE, USA) used as a spacer between the electrodes.

Steady-state photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a photoluminescence spectrometer (FluoroMate FS-2, SCINCO, Seoul, Korea). Time-resolved photoluminescence was detected using a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique to measure spontaneous photoluminescence decay. The excitation light source was a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser (MaiTai BB, Spectra-Physics, Santa Clara, CA, USA), which provides ultrashort pulses (80 fs at full-width half-maximum) with a high repetition rate (80 MHz). This high repetition rate may be slowed to 1 MHz–800 kHz using a homemade pulse picker. The pulse-picked output pulse was frequency-doubled by a 1-mm-thick BBO crystal (EKSMA, Vilnius, Lithuania). The photoluminescence was collected by a microchannel plate photomultiplier (R3809U-51, Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu, Japan) with a thermoelectric cooler (C4878, Hamamatsu) connected to a TCSPC board (SPC-130, Becker&amp;Hickl GmbH (Berlin, Germany)). The overall instrumental response function was ~25 ps (full-width half-maximum). A pump pulse vertically polarized by a Glan-laser polarizer was used to irradiate the samples, and a sheet polarizer, set at an angle complementary to the magic angle (54.7°), was placed in the photoluminescence collection path to obtain polarization-independent photoluminescence decays.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Single-molecule spectroscopic measurement</title><p id="Par10">Single-molecule photoluminescence was detected with a confocal microscope (TE2000-U, Nikon) equipped with a sample scanning stage (XE-120, Park Systems, Suwon, Korea) at room temperature under ambient conditions. The sample was excited by circularly polarized light from a picosecond-pulsed diode laser (LDH-F-C-470, Picoquant (Berlin, Germany), 470 nm, 10 MHz repetition rate, 70 ps pulse width) from a Berek compensator (5540, New Focus, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The laser beam was directed into the microscope by passing through a laser line filter (z470/10x, Chroma Technology, Bellows Falls, VT, USA) and collimating lens and was focused onto the sample via an oil immersion objective lens (Plan Fluor, 1.3 NA, 100 × , Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), yielding an irradiation power of 200 W cm<sup>−2</sup> at the sample. Photoluminescence was collected using the same objective, passed through a dichroic mirror (470dcxru, Chroma Technology), filtered with a notch filter (HNPF-470.0–1.0, Kaiser Optical Systems, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) as well as band-pass filters (HQ488 lp and ET542 lp, Chroma Technology), and focused on an avalanche photodiode (SPCM-AQR-16-FC, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA). After an individual molecule was positioned in the focus of the laser, the photoluminescence signal detected by the avalanche photodiode was registered by a TCSPC PC card (SPC 830, Becker &amp; Hickl) operated in the first-in-first-out regime, in which the arrival time after the beginning of the acquisition and the time lag with respect to the excitation pulse were stored for each detected photon. The full-width half-maximum of the overall instrumental response function was ~500–600 ps. These data were processed using BIFL data analyzer software (Scientific Software Technologies Center, Minsk, Belarus) to obtain the fluorescence intensity trajectory (FITs) with a user-defined binning time, and the time-resolved photoluminescence decayed using photons belonging to a user-defined region in the trajectories.</p><p id="Par11">Separated iQDs were imaged using a wide-field photoluminescence microscope consisting of an inverted optical microscope (IX71, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an oil immersion objective (1.4 NA, × 100, Plan Fluorite, Olympus) and a highly sensitive, cooled, 512 × 512 pixels EMCCD camera (iXon Ultra, Andor Technology, Belfast, UK). The samples were excited with 445 nm light from a CW Cube laser (Coherent, Cube, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The collimated, circularly polarized laser beam was sent to the epi-photoluminescence microscope after it was passed through a laser line filter (FF01-445/20-25, Semrock, Lake Forest, IL, USA), collimating lens and a dichroic mirror (Di02-R442, Chroma Technology). The image reached the charge-coupled device (CCD) camera after spectral filtering with a notch filter (HNPF-445.0AR-1.0, Kaiser optical system) and a band pass filter (BLP01–458R, Semrock and ET542 lp, Chroma Technology).
