The analysis, using a case study of the Dutch renewable energy support for illustration, reveals that a target based on primary energy would have led to a ranking in which renewable electricity options would predominantly have been considered cheaper for realizing the target. As a primary energy-based target is more closely linked to overarching objectives of the EU Renewable Energy Directive, such as climate change and energy security, this implies that the least cost realization of the current final energy-based target does not necessarily lead to the least cost mix for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions or avoiding fossil primary energy. The Dutch case study also shows that the budget allocation in favour of renewable heat and gas options was not only a direct consequence of the final energy-based target but also because of the limited annual budget available for support in the analysed period. With the increase of the support budget since 2013, the budget allocation between the renewable energy categories has become more balanced. Lessons for policy design are provided by highlighting the importance of side-effects which are often insufficiently recognized in the design stage of targets. In the case of the EU renewable energy target, the choice for a final energy-based target did, on the one hand, not consider the consequences for least cost target achievement (negative side-effect), but on the other provided an incentive to pay more attention to renewable heat (positive side-effect).</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Renewable

targets, which are often referred to as the 20/20/20 targets (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2008a</xref>), including a binding 20 % reduction of GHG emissions compared to 1990, indicative 20 % energy savings and a binding share of 20 % renewable energy in total final energy consumption in 2020. The latter target is the main objective of Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (hereafter: 2009 RES Directive).</p><p id="Par3">In the 2007, Renewable Energy Roadmap (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>), a 20 % renewable energy target in gross inland consumption (i.e. <italic>primary</italic> energy) by 2020 was considered feasible and desirable. However, in the 2009 RES Directive, a 20 % renewable energy target in gross <italic>final</italic> energy consumption was set. The reason for the European Commission to change the metric from primary to final energy will be discussed later in this paper. Our research interest concerns the impact such change in metrics may have. Expressing the implementation potential of a renewable energy technology in petajoule (PJ), primary or final energy will generally result in different outcomes. If the total investment costs for realizing the implementation potential do not change (i.e. are not affected by changing the metrics), the cost-effectiveness, defined by Vedung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>) as the effect of a policy program or instrument in physical terms (e.g. PJ) divided by its costs, will change. In that case, the text of the 2009 RES Directive, stating in recital 9 that renewable energy is “… <italic>to be introduced in a cost-effective way</italic>” (European Parliament and Council <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>, L140/17), leaves room for questions: a cost-effective introduction of the EU renewable energy target would mean the implementation of that mix of least cost renewable energy technologies which are needed to meet the target, but how this least cost mix looks like would be unclear as depending on the physical term used in the equation (PJ primary or final energy). This leads to the objective of this paper: to analyse the impact of the use of different metrics/physical terms in the EU renewable energy target definition and to identify lessons for policy design.</p><p id="Par4">In the following section, some relevant definitions used in the analysis are provided. Then, the paper continues by exploring the background of Europe’s 2020 renewable energy target in three steps, focusing on (1) the reason for the EU for having a renewable energy target, (2) the considerations behind Europe’s choice for having a target based on <italic>final</italic> energy and (3) a positive side-effect of having a final energy-based target. In the next step, the paper elaborates on a case study for the Netherlands, providing some background information on renewable energy in the Netherlands, explaining the Dutch support scheme for renewable energy, analysing the technology preference in the scheme, and analysing the actual budget allocation in the support scheme. The paper ends with a discussion and conclusion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Definitions</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Energy</title><p id="Par5">For the right interpretation of energy policy targets, it is important to understand how energy is dealt with in statistics. Good guidance is offered by the Energy Statistics Manual of the IEA and Eurostat (2005).</p><p id="Par6">In physics, a basic distinction is made between primary energy (coal, oil, natural gas, uranium, wind, solar, hydro, etc.) and secondary energy (electricity, heat, transport fuels, mechanical energy). Secondary energy is not reported in statistics. Statistics do report primary energy which is referred to as <italic>gross inland consumption</italic> and defined as primary production (coal mining e.g.) plus imports, recovered products and stock change, less exports and fuel supply to maritime bunkers. Gross inland consumption can also be defined as the sum of gross <italic>final energy consumption</italic> plus the conversion losses for producing heat and electricity in the energy branch.</p><p id="Par7">Final energy consumption can also be found in statistics, both as gross and net. <italic>Gross</italic> final energy consumption is the net final energy consumption plus the self-consumption by the energy branch for producing electricity and heat production plus the distribution and transmission losses. <italic>Net</italic> final energy consumption is the energy commodities delivered for energy purposes to the energy demand sectors (industry, transport, households, services, etc.).</p><p id="Par8">Final energy consumption is often confused with secondary energy. This confusion can be clarified with two examples:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par9">Heat produced by an individual household or industrial boiler is secondary energy (the product of converting primary energy) but not final energy: In statistics it is <italic>not</italic> heat from the boiler which is reported but the delivery of the boiler fuel (e.g. natural gas) to the end user.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10">District heat is also secondary energy (again, the product of converting primary energy). However, district heat from a central boiler or a CHP plant is also considered final energy as it is the district heat which is delivered/sold to the end-user (and not the fuel for producing the district heat).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par11">The definitions provided above imply that in some cases there is no or hardly any difference between primary energy and final energy. An example is natural gas delivered to end-users which is both primary and final energy. Another example is crude oil and transport fuels, where the difference between primary and final energy is small when the conversion process is very efficient (&gt;95 %).</p><p id="Par12">Big differences come into play when considering electricity production which, depending on the fuel, type of technology and age of the power plant, includes massive conversion losses. The conversion efficiency for modern large-scale fossil fuel-based electricity production typically range between 40 and 50 % (for natural gas even a bit higher) which means that the difference between primary and final energy is a factor 2–2.5, and that 50–60 % of the energy content of the primary energy is lost.</p><p id="Par13">For solar, wind and hydro power, one single default efficiency applies. Eurostat and IEA use the “Physical Energy Content Method” for reporting renewable energy statistics (IEA and Eurostat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>). In this method, primary energy is defined as the first commodity which can be converted to secondary energy (heat, electricity, etc.). For hydro, wind and solar power, the first usable commodity is the electricity produced, which means that 1 unit of primary energy converts to 1 unit of electricity. This implies a conversion efficiency of 100 % (Harmsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">The reader should note that also another approach for dealing with wind, solar and hydro power is widely applied. This is the so-called substitution method. In this method 1 unit of wind electricity is considered to substitute 1 unit of fossil-based electricity, which means that 1 unit of wind electricity avoids the use of 2–2.5 units of fossil primary energy (depending on the conversion efficiency assumed in the calculation). Although the substitution method is not any longer the dominant method used in statistics, the method is still valuable in discussions on e.g. energy security in which renewable energy production is looked at in terms of avoided fossil primary energy.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Cost-effectiveness</title><p id="Par16">In renewable energy literature, cost-effectiveness is used for comparing policy instruments (e.g. Kleβmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref>; Haas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2011</xref>; Toke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>; Palmer and Burtraw <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2005</xref>) or for comparing the specific costs of renewable energy technologies (Blarke and Lund <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>; Del Rio and Cerda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>). Sometimes, cost-effectiveness is also referred to as cost-efficiency (see e.g. Kleβmann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2011</xref>). Vedung’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>) definition of cost-effectiveness is the effect of a policy instrument in physical terms divided by its costs (in a monetary unit). Cost-effectiveness is distinguished from cost-benefit which is the value (in a monetary unit) of the effect of a program (or policy instrument) divided by its costs (in a monetary unit). “Efficiency” is used a synonym by Vedung for both cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit.</p><p id="Par17">In this paper, Vedung’s definition of cost-effectiveness is adopted and used for comparing renewable energy technologies <italic>in</italic> a specific support scheme, where the most cost-effective technology is the one needing the least support. When taking the inverse of Vedung’s equation, the numerator deals with the support costs (the surplus production costs of a technology compared to the fossil energy based alternative).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> For the denominator, different choices can be made regarding the physical term used for expressing the effect of a policy instrument. In case of the EU renewable target, the denominator could be the unit of renewable energy produced (cost-effectiveness = support costs per kilowatt hour renewable energy produced). Alternatively, when e.g. two more overarching objectives of the 2009 RES Directive are taken upfront, i.e. improving energy security or mitigating climate change, the denominator becomes the unit of fossil energy or CO<sub>2</sub> emission avoided (cost-effectiveness = support costs per kilowatt hour of fossil energy avoided <italic>or</italic> ton of CO<sub>2</sub> avoided).</p><p id="Par19">Knowing which renewable energy technology shows the biggest payoff per euro of support (the most cost-effective technology) allows for a preference ranking which can be used by governments in the allocation of budget. The reader should note that “biggest pay-off per euro of support” can be looked at differently:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par20">From a short-term perspective.

Those factors also have an important part to play in promoting the security of energy supply, promoting technological development and innovation and providing opportunities for employment and regional development, especially in rural and isolated areas</italic>.” This means that climate change mitigation and improvement of security of supply are (among others) considered overarching objectives of the Directive.</p><p id="Par23">It should be noted that at the time of designing the EU Climate and Energy Package it was projected that the 20 % GHG reduction target could be achieved without a binding renewable energy target (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008b</xref>). Still, a legally binding renewable energy target was introduced. The European Commission felt the urgency of strengthening and expansion of the EU regulatory framework as the (indicative) 12 % renewable energy target for 2010 (set in 1997) would not be met (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>). The growth of the renewable energy sector (not so much needed for achieving the 2020 GHG target but crucial for mitigating climate change beyond 2020) was hampered by administrative problems, opaque and discriminating rules for grid access and lack of information.</p><p id="Par24">Before 2009, the EU had a Renewable <italic>Electricity</italic> Directive (with a target for 2010) and a Biofuels Directive, but lacked a directive covering renewable heat. As a consequence, in most Member States, the growth of renewable heat was limited (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>) and most support was given to renewable electricity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Why does Europe have a renewable energy target based on final energy?</title><p id="Par25">As mentioned in the introduction of this paper in the 2007 Renewable Energy Roadmap (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>), a 20 % renewable energy target in gross inland consumption (i.e. <italic>primary</italic> energy) was formulated, whereas in the 2009 RES Directive, a 20 % renewable energy target in gross <italic>final</italic> energy consumption was set. The argument for making this change from primary to final can be found in the impact assessment of the Climate and Energy Package (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2008b</xref>). This document points at the expected penalization of so-called non-thermal renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power in case a renewable energy target based on primary energy should be chosen.

The choice for a final energy-based target could also have been assessed by comparing its consequences for renewable electricity at the one side and renewable heat at the other. A <italic>final</italic> renewable energy target implies that 1 unit of renewable electricity provides the same amount of renewable energy as 1 unit of renewable heat, whereas a <italic>primary</italic> renewable energy target would mean that the contribution of 1 unit of <italic>biomass</italic> electricity would be 2–2.5 times more than the contribution of 1 unit of renewable heat. This implies that the choice of a <italic>final</italic> renewable energy target offers an incentive to renewable heat compared to <italic>biomass</italic> electricity. <italic>Biomass</italic> is given in italics since the implication is not a general relation between renewable electricity and other renewable energy sources. Since the primary conversion factor of wind, solar and hydro power used in statistics is 100 % (see “<xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Energy</xref>”section), the difference between wind, solar and hydro power on the one hand, and renewable heat on the other regarding the contribution to a final or primary renewable energy target is much smaller (since renewable heat conversion efficiencies are also high).</p><p id="Par28">So, the choice for a target based on primary energy would mean that the contribution of 1 unit of wind and solar power to the renewable energy target is smaller than the contribution of 1 unit of biomass electricity. The choice for a target based on final energy would guarantee a level playing field for renewable electricity (each unit of electricity, whether biomass or wind, provides the same contribution to the target) but would also make renewable heat more attractive compared to biomass electricity (a unit of heat provides the same contribution to the target as a unit of electricity). The latter—though not explicitly mentioned as an argument for setting a renewable energy target based on final energy by the European Commission—supports one of the objectives of the 2009 RES Directive, i.e. to make growth of renewable heat more attractive to Member States. As the European Commission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>, p3) puts it: “<italic>Renewable heating is increasingly being used as a cost-efficient and secure alternative to fossil fuels in Member States in district heating and at local level</italic>.”</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Case study Netherlands</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Context</title><p id="Par29">Like the other EU Member States, the Netherlands have to contribute to the 2020 EU renewable energy target.

The choice of the European Commission to not base the target on primary energy (which was practised before) was made to ensure a level playing field between wind and biomass electricity in the renewable energy statistics. A target based on primary energy would mean that the same amount of wind or biomass electricity results in a bigger share of biomass in renewable energy output since biomass-to-electricity conversion efficiencies are around 40 % (1 kWh electricity = 2.5 kWh primary energy) whereas wind is considered 100 % efficient in statistics (1 kWh electricity = 1 kWh primary energy).</p><p id="Par78">With the implementation of the (binding) renewable energy target based on final energy in the Netherlands, the Dutch support scheme for renewable energy (SDE+) ranked renewable heat and gas options predominantly higher than renewable electricity options, meaning that renewable heat and gas were considered the cheapest for realizing the target. In line with that, in the period 2011–2014, most of the SDE+ support has been allocated to renewable heat and gas projects. This became an issue since (1) new renewable electricity projects were supported from the same budget as renewable heat and gas projects and (2) the annual budget was limited, especially in 2011 and 2012. Budget cuts in renewable support (despite a gap towards the target) are not uncommon and took also place in Spain where the support scheme for solar PV was stopped in January 2012 as support costs exploded from 215 million in 2007 to 2.8 billion in 2009 (Del Rio and Cerda <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>). Such a large burden for consumers (who pay via a surcharge on their electricity bill) was considered economically unsustainable, socially unacceptable and politically unfeasible. These arguments were also used in the Netherlands to limit the annual support budget.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Lessons for policy design</title><p id="Par79">In their study on policy interaction, Oikonomou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>, p.177) state that “given the complex policy environment, various objectives are pursued in terms of environmental and energy effectiveness, alongside with economic efficiency”. A complementary insight is given by Meadows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>, p.85) stating that “when a subsystem’s goals dominate at the expense of the total system’s goals, the resulting behaviour is called suboptimization.” McDonnell and Grub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1991</xref>, p.10) posit that “…policy design is often hampered by analysts’ and policymakers’ inability to diagnose a problem correctly.” Merton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1936</xref>) listed five sources for so-called unintended or unanticipated consequences of purposive social action which may also be reflected in many policy designs: ignorance, error, imperious immediacy of interest (intended ignorance), basic values and self-defeating prediction.</p><p id="Par80">The 2009 RES Directive and its translation into Dutch national policies offer a good example of these quotes from scientific literature: linking to the quote of Oikonomou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>), it is important to realize that the EU renewable energy target is not a goal in itself. On the contrary: renewable energy is considered by the European Commission a means to combat climate change, to improve security of energy supply, to promote technological development and innovation and to provide opportunities for employment and regional development. The objective of the Dutch renewable support scheme SDE+ is, however, to meet the renewable target in a least cost way, without a focus on dynamic efficiency and the overarching objectives of the Directive.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn15">15</xref> In terms of Meadows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2008</xref>), it can be stated that the goal of the Dutch government (“subsystem”) to achieve its 2020 target as cheap as possible giving priority to today’s lowest cost technologies is not in line with the goals of the European Union (“system”) aiming at long-term objectives, with suboptimization as a consequence. Whether the Dutch government diagnosed the problem incorrectly (cf. McDonnell and Grub <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1991</xref>), resulting in the unanticipated consequences (cf. Merton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1936</xref>) as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> offers an interesting question: was it ignorance, intended ignorance or simply an error?</p><p id="Par82">Regarding lessons for policy design, for the EU, one explicit argument (more pronounced role of wind in the renewable energy share) and one implicit argument (incentive for increasing the contribution of renewable heat) can be identified to justify the choice for a renewable energy target based on final energy. Although the arguments are well understood, it may be questioned whether these are strong enough to justify a target that is less connected to two important overarching objectives of EU policy (combat climate change and improve energy security) than a target based on primary energy. As the figures in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> show, the contribution of wind, hydro and solar power is lower in terms of primary energy but not extremely lower than in terms of final energy. Maybe the European Commission would have come to a similar conclusion if the design of the renewable energy target would have been evaluated against a wider set of criteria than looking on the share of wind in renewable energy statistics alone, even wider than climate change and energy security but looking at all objectives of the 2009 RES Directive. These lessons for policy design may be relevant for the renewable energy policy beyond 2020.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Four anonymous reviewers are gratefully thanked for their useful and constructive feedback.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Blarke</surname><given-names>MB</given-names></name><name><surname>Lund</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">The effectiveness of storage and relocation options in renewable energy systems</article-title><source>Renewable Energy</source><year>2008</year><volume>33</volume><fpage>1499</fpage><lpage>1507</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.renene.2007.09.001</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Buck te, S., Keulen van, K., Bosselaar, L., Gerlagh, T.
