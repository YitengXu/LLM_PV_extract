Free-field photovoltaic plants are characterised by significant land use and material flows. Although country-level data on installed power is available, information about the spatial distribution of PV plants is rare. When the first photovoltaic systems will reach their end-of-life on a large scale in 2035, economic, technological and ecological challenges will arise.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The study explores the market development of photovoltaic power in the EU countries from 2008 to 2017 by preparing statistical data and Google mapping of free-field PV plants. Different approaches to assessing the land use of free-field PV systems compared to other energy systems are investigated. A comprehensive literature review addresses key issues of PV module waste treatment, hazardous constituents and their leakage in case of module breakage as well as financial issues of decommissioning and recycling and re-use of used modules.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Most of the European PV electrical energy is generated by approximately 17,000 widely distributed free-field plants predominantly installed in lowlands. A local in-depth study shows that roof-top plants contribute less than 5% to the total PV energy generation in an area without extensive expansion to industrial buildings. Small amounts of hazardous substances that are typically present in PV modules are unlikely to affect the environment during normal operation of the system, but the question of leakage from broken end-of-life modules is not sufficiently clarified. While in the EU, the recycling and disposal costs are covered by producer fees and expected raw material profits; the financing of the decommissioning of thousands of PV free-field plants is still an open issue.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The land use of free-field PV systems should be analysed in more detail. Concerning hazardous substances, there seems to be an emerging consensus in literature that the leaching behaviour of metals from broken PV module pieces is inadequately simulated by current waste characterisation protocols. It is recommended to pay greater attention to financing the decommissioning of free-field commercial and industrial scale PV systems.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Photovoltaic</kwd><kwd>PV</kwd><kwd>Market</kwd><kwd>Free-field</kwd><kwd>Ground-based</kwd><kwd>Renewable energy</kwd><kwd>Europe</kwd><kwd>E-waste</kwd><kwd>Leakage</kwd><kwd>Decommissioning</kwd><kwd>End-of-life</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>30</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/13705_2020_Article_263.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Sustainable Development</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Policy, Economics and Management</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Policy, Economics and Management</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par69">The European 2009 Renewables Directive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] obliges member states to reach together a share of 20% of energy from renewable sources by 2020. In 2018, a recast of the Renewables Directive was published by the European Commission, which foresees a binding target of 32% of renewable energy sources by 2030. Austria has a mandatory renewable energy target of 34% of the national gross final energy consumption by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par70">Besides wind energy, hydropower, and geothermal energy, free-field PV energy systems are based on a high level of direct land consumption during the energy generation stage, which characterises the renewable energy market. The land occupation of free-field PV systems in Western Styria, Austria, is 0.0192 m<sup>2</sup>a/kWh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A further significant part of land consumption as energy resource is caused by biomass in terms of the cultivation of corn for biogas, rapeseed for biofuel, or poplars in short-rotation forestry for block heat and power stations. The land occupation for biomass is in the range of 0.3 m<sup>2</sup>a/kWh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. An earlier study compared the direct land use of renewable and fossil energy systems. Biogas shows a land transformation of 0.0125 m<sup>2</sup>/kWh, hydroelectric reservoir 0.0041 m<sup>2</sup>/kWh, photovoltaic in Germany 0.0007 m<sup>2</sup>/kWh, and coal between 0.00014 m<sup>2</sup>/kWh and 0.00089 m<sup>2</sup>/kWh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The calculation method of the latter study underestimates the problem of land consumption.</p><p id="Par71">Since the EU Renewables Directive entered into force, a considerable number of free-field PV solar parks using different technologies, scales and locations were built all over Europe over the last years. According to the current Photovoltaic Barometer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], in total, 106.6 GW<sub>p</sub> photovoltaic power was installed, and 114 TWh photovoltaic electrical energy was generated in the EU28 in 2017.

Residential scale is defined with an installed power ≤ 10 kW<sub>p</sub>, commercial scale between 10 and 250 kW<sub>p</sub>, industrial scale &gt; 250 kW<sub>p</sub> and utility scale &gt; 1 MW<sub>p</sub>. Residential scale represents roof-top plants, and utility scale is defined as built on the ground. Commercial and industrial scales are not defined, and they can represent in practice both roof-top and free-field plants.

Belgium has a share of residential cumulative installed power of 62%.

Since 2012, the waste management of PV modules is covered by the recast of the European WEEE–Directive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which regulates the waste management and treatment of electrical and electronic products. In 2016, 12.3 million tonnes electronic waste (e-waste) was generated in Europe including Russia. Thereof, only 35% were documented to be collected and recycled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The predicted lifetime of PV modules is more than 25 years. In 2050, a total amount of 9.5 million tonnes end-of-life PV modules is expected in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Best practice treatment and recycling of photovoltaic panels including heavy metals are still under development, and an economically viable waste management of all PV module technologies cannot yet be assessed.</p><p id="Par74">Besides recovery and recycling of the collected modules, the deconstruction and collection logistics and their financial efforts for small-scale roof-top plants with 5 kW<sub>p</sub> or large-scale solar fields with 100 MW<sub>p</sub> are very different.

All REACH and REACH Candidate substances carry immediate obligation for suppliers of the substance such as supplying a safety data sheet and communicating on safe use. Further ECHA has to be notified if a product contains a SVHC above a concentration of 0.1% (w/w).

While the RoHS Directive, which excludes PV modules that are installed by professionals for permanent energy generation, defines the maximum concentration values of the regulated hazardous substances in ‘homogeneous materials’ that cannot be disjointed by mechanical actions, the REACH Regulation makes no further distinction in the material composition and disassembility or disjointability of the product. Since PV modules have a large glass fraction of the front cover and for some technologies front and back cover, the content of hazardous substances in the thin active layer may remain under the limit value of 0.1% of the total mass, although the PV module laminate is not a homogeneous material. The REACH Regulation requires the registration of articles if a product contains more than 0.1% (w/w) of a hazardous substance and the substance is ‘intended to be released under normal or reasonable foreseeable conditions of use’.

Whether the broken module is classified as hazardous or non-hazardous waste is determined by the concentration of metals during a standardised test procedure designed to simulate such leaching behaviour. There is a broad scientific discussion about the leakage behaviour of damaged PV modules in general and the suitability of standard test procedures, which is briefly summarised here [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par123">The first studies by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] on leakage from CdTe and CIS modules were already carried out in the 1990s where worst-case metal concentrations from accidentally damaged thin-film modules were estimated. Weekly amounts of rainwater were exposed to crushed 0.5 m<sup>2</sup> modules. Metal concentrations in these leachates showed higher aquatic toxicity for CdTe than for CIS modules, but both had a toxicity comparable to that of industrial wastewater. These concentrations were further used to estimate concentrations in two hypothetical scenarios: (a) water collected from a roof-top containing one broken module and (b) soil underneath a broken module resting on the ground for 1 year. Estimated zinc and cadmium concentrations in roof-top water from the CIS module were approximately two orders of magnitude below the German drinking water standard, and the selenium concentration was one order of magnitude lower. Cadmium from the CdTe modules was of the same order of magnitude as the drinking water standard. Leaving a broken module on soil for 1 year was estimated to increase soil concentrations by the same order of magnitude as the natural ranges of metals concentrations present in soil in most cases. With the exception of molybdenum, the increases were well below tolerable soil levels. The same author notes that the amount of metals released from accidentally damaged modules during their use can be expected to be orders of magnitude lower than the metals contained in waste modules after their use. Regulatory leaching tests for waste characterisation (German, Swiss, and the USA) showed that a CIS module only exceeded the zinc limit of the Swiss test, while a CdTe failed all three tests due to cadmium release.</p><p id="Par124">In 2010, a Norwegian study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] also investigated the leaching behaviour of CdTe modules. Their literature search revealed little on the human toxicity and nothing on the ecotoxicity of CdTe, but leaching tests showed higher mobilisation of tellurium than cadmium at a pH of 9.6, since cadmium is re-precipitated. Cadmium concentrations in leachate exceeded the limits for inert waste landfills, and the authors expected Cd to also exceed the limits for ordinary landfills at lower pH values. The study concludes that there is not currently enough documentation to assess the fate and toxicity during the use and disposal of CdTe modules. The authors recommend leachate tests, particularly at lower pH values.</p><p id="Par125">A 2013 study by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] analysed long-term leaching of metals and metalloids from damaged CIGS and organic PV (OPV) modules into different model waters and calculated environmental concentrations for several scenarios. While metals released by OPV were of little toxicological concern and far below conservative drinking water standards, roof-top acidic runoff from CIGS modules exhibited significant toxicity: leached cadmium concentrations from cadmium sulphide in the window layer would considerably exceed the acute toxicity concentrations for <italic>Daphnia magna</italic> (daphnia or water fleas are sensitive to pollutants in the water), and the calculated selenium and molybdenum concentrations were in the range for teratogenic effects. Both cadmium and lead leaching were mainly governed by the pH of the leaching solvent but not as much by the size of module pieces. Long-term experiments over a period of several weeks were considered by the authors to be most realistic, calling into question the results from current short-duration regulatory leaching protocols. The authors conclude by noting the high amount of lead from solder in c-Si modules that is of concern due to the dominant market share of this PV technology.</p><p id="Par126">An earlier fate and exposure study by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] was limited to cadmium from CdTe modules.

These workers calculated concentrations at exposure points of air, soil and groundwater both for on-site workers and off-site residents with conservative assumptions (except for a neutral groundwater pH; when assuming a more acidic pH, the rainwater pH might have increased the estimated groundwater concentrations). Exposure to air and soil was found to be orders of magnitude below both Californian and German screening levels, while groundwater equilibrium concentrations were below both screening levels and background concentrations.

The authors found that lead concentrations from mc-Si cells and modules exceeded the regulatory limit but only when measured for longer periods than specified by the standard tests. Leaching from CIGS modules exhibited similarly slow leaching of copper and selenium to eventually exceed regulatory limits. The authors attributed the slower leaching kinetics to the layering of the material. They concluded that the tested methods may not be valid for characterizing PV waste in landfills, and additional testing is needed to accomplish that.</p><p id="Par128">A 2015 US study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] investigated the behaviour of ground solid CdTe and CdSe in aqueous solutions simulating landfill leachate under two standard waste leaching test used by the USA and the California Environmental Protection Agencies.

The authors also investigated the effect of different redox and pH combinations on the leachability and determined that acidic and aerobic conditions markedly increased the dissolution of both CdTe and CdSe, in keeping with thermodynamic predictions.

Two small (5 × 5 cm<sup>2</sup>) squares from the same module material were immersed in a buffered aqueous solution, at pH values of 3, 7 and 11, respectively. This was repeated for the other module materials, each experiment in triplicate. After 360 days, they found significant leaching in the acidic and oxidizing solutions. In particular, 1.4% (by mass) of the lead in the c-Si modules, and 62% of the cadmium in the CdTe modules is leached out in the pH = 3 solution. These amounts exceed the WHO standards for drinking water concentrations of the respective metals. The leached amounts after 1 day were at least 2 orders of magnitude lower, leading the authors to challenge the meaningfulness of short-term leaching tests. These results are questioned by Sinha and Wade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] who argue—among other points—that the use of citrate as a buffering agent and its chelating action may have led to higher metals concentrations than would be found in acidic rainwater. In a commentary, the authors of the original study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] have replied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] that the type of counter ion used will not change the high sensitivity to the leachate pH.</p><p id="Par130">The same research group investigated metals leached from milled (&lt; 0.2 mm) PV modules as a function of time and of the pH of the leachate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].

The authors note that—in addition to presenting equivocal results—both sources are laboratory studies and may not reflect the operating conditions in the field. Consequently, the authors analysed soil samples for bioavailable metal concentrations in the field, from an operational 750-kW c-Si PV installation that had been in operation for 5 years prior to sampling. They sampled three transects, one 30.48 m away and two directly underneath the PV panels. Neither cadmium nor lead soil concentrations were different between the transects, but selenium, strontium and barium increased markedly underneath the panels, while copper and zinc even decreased significantly. Selenium in particular approached the US regulatory risk threshold. However, selenium is not used in c-Si modules, and the authors suggest cement from panel foundations as a more likely source.

The question of land use and land competition is discussed for different assessment methods for land transformation and land occupation. Likewise, a comprehensive literature review addresses key issues of hazardous constituents and their leakage in the case of module breakage, as well as end-of-life issues ranging from requirements for PV module waste treatment to financial issues concerning decommissioning of end-of-life PV systems and to module recycling technologies and module re-use.</p><p id="Par157">Our investigation shows that there are approximately 17,000 free-field PV plants on the commercial, industrial and utility scale installed all over Europe reflecting trends in the available national statistical data. At the end of 2017, the cumulative installed PV power in the EU28 was 115 GW<sub>p</sub>. The construction boom of PV plants had its peak in 2011. In countries with a large number of free-field plants, it is not clear to what extent roof-top plants account for energy production. A case study inventory of a Central European region shows a small share of about 5% based on mainly residential and few commercial scale roof-top PV plants. A survey of satellite images showed that Italy has a relatively high level of installed PV plants on large flat roofs, but their share in total energy production could not be estimated. However, the literature review and satellite image survey give the impression that the potential energy production share of roof-top systems is overestimated and that a significant increase of PV energy could only be achieved with a continuing rapid expansion of larger free-field systems.</p><p id="Par158">It is recommended to conduct a broader scientific debate on land sealing and land competition as well as more detailed analyses of the land occupation of energy systems in different regions. Currently, free-field PV plants are predominantly installed in lowlands and on arable land and forest areas according to the satellite images and topographic maps. In some regions, the density of PV plants appears to be very high. The common calculation method based on one-time land transformation is insufficient to reflect the annual land competition for infrastructure and settlements, food and feed production, energy production, chemical and textile raw materials and the preservation of natural habitats. Furthermore, to properly compare the land use of energy systems, secondary effects have to be considered such as recovery time of the transformed land into the original state and impacts on the water balance in the case of fossil energy sources on the one hand and land damages by extracting lithium for storage batteries for volatile renewable energy sources, on the other. These questions call for trans-regional and global spatial energy planning.</p><p id="Par159">Most PV modules contain a small but non-negligible amount of hazardous substances. They are unlikely to affect the environment during normal operation of the system, since the substances are chemically bound and encapsulated against environmental influences. Literature provides average data concerning the type and amount of hazardous substances in PV modules, and there are PV technologies available that operate without hazardous substances. However, detailed material composition data of specific module technologies and their spatial distribution are not available, especially as technologies changed continually over the years. A mandatory and publicly accessible declaration of the material composition of PV modules would be necessary for a more complete environmental life cycle assessment.</p><p id="Par160">In the case of end-of-life module breakage, the lamination and protective encapsulation is destroyed, and hazardous constituents could be leached into the environment. There seems to be an emerging consensus in the literature that the leaching behaviour of metals from PV module pieces of various sizes is inadequately described in the current waste characterisation protocols that typically last 1 day. Measurements over weeks and months reveal significant losses of lead from c-Si modules and cadmium from CdTe modules in the range of tens of mass percent, but only if the leaching solution is acidic with pH values of 3–5; neutral pH appears to cause little leaching of these metals. Results of subsequent fate and toxicity modelling are less conclusive—they vary with the element and the module technology studied and also with the assumed scenarios (dilution and pH of leaching solvent). Only one study was found that sampled the soil underneath an operating PV plant that had begun operations 5 years earlier, with results that underline the need for more research into measured impacts of real PV plants in the field.</p><p id="Par161">The end-of-life management of photovoltaic systems will face major challenges when the first large scale free-field plants reach the end of their lifetime in about 15 years. Even though the waste treatment requirements and financing of PV module recycling and disposal in the European Union is regulated by the WEEE Directive, some major legal, financial and technological questions are still open. One key issue is the classification of PV modules as hazardous or non-hazardous waste, since there is a small amount of hazardous substances included dependent on the module technology. The classification depends on the country-specific limit values for hazardous substances and the leakage behaviour of the respective toxic metals.</p><p id="Par162">The second key issue is the financing of the decommissioning of PV plants, which is not covered by the WEEE Directive. In the literature, there are several positive and negative scenarios about costs and proceeds of decommissioning and recycling, particularly for large scale PV plants. The aim is to finance the entire waste treatment from the proceeds of the recycled raw materials and the mandatory producer fees. The valuable materials are steel, copper, silver and aluminium. However, the content and salvage value of copper seems to be overestimated. In the case of silicon-based PV modules, there are major research efforts to produce profitable secondary silicon with a lower carbon footprint than virgin silicon material but with a comparable purity. Other scenarios include the re-use and export of PV modules which is theoretically legal, since assemblies from electric power generations are not covered by the Basel Convention. In any case, it must be ensured that inoperable free-field PV plants of all scales do not remain on-site for decades due to a lack of financial means for decommissioning.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the TU Wien Bibliothek for financial support through its Open Access Funding Program.
