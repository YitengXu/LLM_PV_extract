These microenvironments are characterized by spatial differences in oxygen tension, pH, nutrient availability, and immune system accessibility. In addition, tumor microenvironments exhibit a variable distribution of specific cells strongly implicated in tumor transition towards malignancy such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This heterogeneity further complicates our understanding of tumor biology and disease progression, and challenges therapeutic interventions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In vivo high-resolution imaging has been a fundamental tool for spatially resolving tumor morphology, physiology, or biochemical composition, thereby allowing to unravel underlying driving forces of tumor biology. Intravital microscopy of the tumor microenvironment is broadly employed in oncological research but suffers from a limited field-of-view and penetration depth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Radiological methods, such as positron emission tomography (PET) can image tumor pathophysiology at much larger scales but exhibit limited spatial resolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, X-ray, computer tomography (CT), or ultrasonography enable high-resolution visualization of morphology and functional tumor parameters, but detailed sensing of pathophysiological parameters over time is challenging due to the limited sensitivity afforded. Moreover, techniques such as PET or MRI require large infrastructure out of the reach of many research institutions.</p><p id="Par4">Multispectral optoacoustic (OA) tomography (MSOT) combines optical contrast with ultrasound resolution enabling high-resolution real time in vivo imaging well-beyond the 1 mm penetration depth typical of microscopy methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is emerging as a particularly interesting alternative imaging method in cancer research. However, in label-free mode, it only records a limited number of factors of tumor pathophysiology, e.g., angiogenesis. Therefore, several agents have been considered for extending the optoacoustic capacity, including nanoparticles and targeted chromophores which however are only transient and do not allow longitudinal studies (reviewed in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>). Transgenic expression of labels has also been considered for  OA imaging, in particular fluorescent proteins as well as the pigments melanin, violacein, or an indigo dye produced by enzymatic cleavage of X-gal (reviewed in ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>). Major challenges of these genetically encoded labels are the absorbance in the visible part of the spectrum hampering their detection deep in tissues due to strong absorbance of blood at those wavelengths. In contrast, the absorption spectrum of melanin extends to the near-infrared region (NIR) however lacks distinct peaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> making it difficult to separate its OA signal from background noise. Moreover, synthesis of melanin in mammalian cell lines for longitudinal studies is often precluded by long-term toxic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Here, we propose an alternative OA reporter based on a bacterial system. Bacteria have been considered for visualization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> together with therapeutic purposes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> like release of anti-tumorigenic payloads, acting as a vector for delivering transgenes into mammalian recipient cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> or directly hampering tumor cell proliferation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, no study has attempted to use bacteria for in vivo monitoring of pathophysiological processes. Here, we consider facultative phototrophic purple bacteria that are intrinsically rich in bacteriochlorophyll <italic>a</italic> (BChl <italic>a</italic>), which exhibits several favorable characteristics as OA labels: two clearly defined spectral bands in the near-infrared range (<italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> of 800 and ~860 nm) with high molar absorptivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> which are red-shifted compared to all genetically encoded labels reported for OA so far, suggesting a unique potential for clear differentiation of bacterial signal from endogenous absorbers prevalent in tissue such as blood hemoglobin and lipids. Compared to free BChl <italic>a</italic> that absorbs primarily at ~770 nm in solution, the peak signature in phototrophic bacteria is heavily shaped by the BChl <italic>a</italic> being embedded in the membrane-bound photosynthetic machinery. This spectral tunability can basically be applied for reporter approaches. Since a recent work has reported the targeting of <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> to various solid tumors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, purple non-sulfur bacteria of the genus <italic>Rhodobacter</italic>, which have been extensively used as model organisms to study the regulation and function of anoxygenic photosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, may be particularly suited for developing MSOT compatible reporters applicable for in vivo tumor studies.</p><p id="Par6">However, different factors and microenvironmental conditions are likely to influence the fate of <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> and hence the BChl <italic>a</italic>-derived OA signal. Those are, for example, the initial pigment levels before injection which can be affected by individual strain characteristics and cultivation conditions, as well as components of the bacterial cell envelope including lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and capsular or exopolysaccharides (EPS) that might further affect the interaction between the bacterial cell and the microenvironment inside the tumor. Therefore, we investigate the suitability of different <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> species for optoacoustic signal generation, explore their fate after intratumoral injection and the potential of their distinct spectral signature to carry any additional information from the tumor microenvironment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>BChl <italic>a</italic> production in different purple bacterial strains</title><p id="Par7">Bacteria used for tumor imaging are required to tolerate the temperature of their respective host. Phototrophic purple non-sulfur bacteria, however, generally prefer growth temperatures of 30 °C and below. Furthermore, in these bacteria efficient photopigment synthesis, which is essential for sensitive OA detection, is generally favored by lowered oxygen accessibility and high nutrient availability. To identify the optimal strain/cultivation combination for MSOT applications, we first analyzed the viability, pigment production, and corresponding absorption properties of different photosynthetic bacteria at 37 °C under anaerobic and microaerobic conditions in various media and light regimes (see Methods section and legend of Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> for details on growth conditions).</p><p id="Par8">In addition to <italic>Rba. sphaeroides</italic> ATH 2.4.1, which could successfully be used for tumor targeting and visualization by detecting BChl <italic>a</italic>-dependent fluorescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, we analyzed the non-sulfur purple bacteria strains <italic>Rba</italic>. <italic>capsulatus</italic> SB1003 and B10S as well as the SB1003 mutant strain Δ<italic>crtJ</italic> carrying a deletion within the repressor gene involved in O<sub>2</sub>-mediated inhibition of BChl <italic>a</italic> biosynthesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Furthermore, we analyzed <italic>Rhodospirillium centenum</italic> ATCC 43720. In contrast to the representatives of the genus <italic>Rhodobacter</italic>, <italic>Rsp. centenum</italic> is less well-characterized but is capable of growing at elevated temperatures up to 42 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">Surprisingly, with exception of <italic>Rba. capsulatus</italic> B10S and <italic>Rsp. centenum,</italic> the chosen strains showed substantial growth at 37 °C under all tested anaerobic and microaerobic conditions. Phototrophic growth in the mixed medium (i.e., a composition of minimal and complex media) under anaerobic conditions and in the presence of infrared (IR) light illumination resulted in highest BChl <italic>a</italic> absorption per cell (all results of the comparative cultivation assay are shown in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Under these conditions, the wild-type SB1003 and Δ<italic>crtJ</italic> strains of <italic>Rba. capsulatus</italic> exhibited the highest BChl <italic>a</italic> absorption with a ratio OD<sub>860/660</sub> of 2.15 to 2.48. In agreement with earlier studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> we observed that increased O<sub>2</sub> availability resulted in reduction of photopigment synthesis for all <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> strains. Thus, in contrast to <italic>Rsp. centenum</italic>, which consistently exhibited a low pigment-to-cell ratio under all tested cultivation conditions, the <italic>Rba. capsulatus</italic> strains SB1003 and Δ<italic>crtJ</italic> as well as <italic>Rba. sphaeroides</italic> showed robust growth at 37 °C together with high BChl <italic>a</italic> production favorable for usage in OA experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title><italic>Rba.</italic> absorption spectra and in vitro OA characterization</title><p id="Par10">Next, we grew <italic>Rba. capsulatus</italic> SB1003, its Δ<italic>crtJ</italic> variant, and <italic>Rba</italic>. <italic>sphaeroides</italic> under the optimal conditions for photopigment formation, i.e. in the absence of oxygen, in mixed medium and with IR illumination at 37 °C, in order to achieve optimal signal intensities for subsequent OA analyses. In all cases, characteristic peaks of cellular BChl <italic>a</italic> were observed at around 800/850 nm (<italic>Rba. sphaeroides</italic>) and 800/860 nm (<italic>Rba. capsulatus</italic>) (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1A</xref>, for convenience we name the 850/860 nm peak exclusively 860 nm throughout the manuscript), and in vitro OA spectra of the bacteria recorded with MSOT were consistent with their corresponding optical absorption spectra (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1B</xref>). In general, the OA signal of a pigment normalized by its corresponding absorbance is a measure of the OA signal generation efficiency (photoacoustic signal generation efficiency, PGE). PGEs normalized to that of a reference solution of methylene blue, yielding 2.52 in the case of <italic>Rba. sphaeroides</italic>, 2.18 in the case of <italic>Rba. capsulatus</italic> SB1003 and 3.04 in the case of the Δ<italic>crtJ</italic> variant are comparable to the PGE of the well-established OA label melanin (3.36). In comparison to blood, the raw OA signal at 850 nm of ~2.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells in the imaging volume (5 µl) equals that of fully oxygenated sheep’s blood. This is one order of magnitude less cells than would be needed with melanin producing bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>OA characterization of <italic>Rba.</italic> in 4T1 mouse allografts</title><p id="Par11">Next, we examined the behavior and optoacoustic performance of these three strains after injection directly into 4T1 mouse mammary gland breast tumors grafted onto the backs of BALB/c nude mice. Our goal was to assess how good <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> can be detected in the tumor using OA and if the spectral features facilitate unmixing of the signal from endogenous absorbers in vivo providing a high signal to noise visualization. In addition, we examined whether bacterial proliferation could be optoacoustically resolved within the tumor. Therefore, bacteria (1 × 10<sup>8</sup> cfu) grown under ideal conditions for BChl <italic>a</italic> production were injected into the tumors (n = 3 per strain, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> for information on all mice imaged in this study), followed by consecutive days of examination using MSOT.

None, of the bacterial strains significantly altered tumor growth or mouse body weight suggesting the bacteria exhibit no immediate anti-tumorigenic effects or systemic toxicity (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). This observation could be further corroborated by the in vitro cell metabolic activity assay (MTT assay for colorimetric assessment of cellular NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductase activities). Here, heat-denatured <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> cells showed no negative effects on growth and viability of 4T1 cells (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">To identify <italic>Rhodobacter</italic>-specific signals, OA data were collected before and at different timepoints after injection into the tumor and subsequently reconstructed using a model-based algorithm. Averaged OA spectra of the tumor region clearly show the characteristic 800-nm and 860-nm peaks as the spectral signature of the injected bacteria, along with predominant spectral features reflecting tumor physiology, such as the slope and peak at 760 nm, which indicates the presence of deoxyhemoglobin (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Interestingly, in tumors, with all bacterial strains the two-peak signature of the averaged OA spectra disappeared over time; in the two <italic>Rba. capsulatus</italic> strains, the peak at 860 nm was additionally blue-shifted to ~850 nm (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4A–I</xref>). To examine this phenomenon more closely, we unmixed the OA data now using an adaptive match filter and the 850-nm peak (<italic>Rba. sphaeroides</italic>) and 860-nm peaks (<italic>Rba. capsulatus</italic> SB1003 and Δ<italic>crtJ</italic>) as target spectra (see Methods section). This strategy allowed bacterial chlorophyll to be more faithfully detected even at later timepoints (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–c</xref>) with only a low fraction of possible false positives in the PBS control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). Spectral analysis of only the unmixed pixels makes the abovementioned changes in the spectral signature even more apparent, pointing clearly to a temporal change in light absorption at 800 nm in the overall bacterial spectra (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f–h</xref>). Furthermore, the unmixed results show relatively constant overall OA intensity over time with only a slight initial increase (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–d</xref>). The data suggest no strong growth of the bacteria inside the tumor. After the last timepoint the animals were sacrificed, tumors cryo-sectioned and preserved for histological analysis (see below).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Characterization of the OA signal and spectra of phototrophic bacteria injected into tumors. <bold>a</bold>–<bold>e</bold> OA signal of phototrophic bacteria <italic>Rba. capsulatus</italic> SB1003 (SB1003), mutant Δ<italic>crtJ</italic> (ΔcrtJ), and <italic>Rba. sphaeroides</italic> (<italic>Rba.</italic> sp.) injected into 4T1 and CT26.WT tumors.

Therefore, the spectral shift could be employed to develop a reporting strategy suitable for analyzing dynamic processes in tumors. Consequently, this observation has led us to further explore the reasons for this spectral shift. First, we could rule out alterations in endogenous background absorbers because the spectra of the entire tumor in the PBS-injected control animal showed no substantial changes between 800 and 860 nm (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4O</xref>). Moreover, simulating convoluted spectra of the 800 and 860 nm signature spectra together with spectra of the major natural absorbers occurring in tumors (e.g., oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin or lipids) suggest that the spectral change we observed for bacterial BChl <italic>a</italic> inside the tumor over time cannot result from such a convolution, although, tumor heterogeneity implies that such global spectral interpretations should be treated with caution (see Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Potential confounders of the spectral signature). Selective photobleaching of the 800-nm peak could also be excluded since continuously recorded OA spectra of <italic>Rba. capsulatus</italic> SB1003 in an in vitro phantom showed no changes in the peak ratio (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Furthermore, a second in vivo experiment, where MSOT was conducted only at the first and last timepoint to avoid induction of photobleaching effects via repeated BChl <italic>a</italic> excitation, showed the same spectral changes as observed for the initial experiment with repetitive MSOT measurements (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). As a next step we studied whether the spectral changes could be due to metabolic changes in the bacteria resulting in a reconfiguration of the photosynthetic machinery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. To this end, we performed cultivation experiments, where <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> growth conditions were changed in an attempt to partially reflect conditions inside solid tumors (i.e., absence of light, presence of hydrogen peroxide, acidification, and availability of nutrients) to induce potential microbial processes that might be responsible for the tumor-induced shift of BChl <italic>a</italic> absorption. However, none of the tested conditions were able to induce similar spectral effects that have been observed in vivo (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). In addition, we injected <italic>Rba. capsulatus</italic> SB1003 that have been inactivated by cell lysis (French press) into mice bearing 4T1 tumors (<italic>n</italic> = 3). We likewise observed a similar spectral change, however, at a much faster rate than utilizing intact cells (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref> for ROI spectra and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref> for maximum intensity projections). This suggests that neither an adaptation process of live <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> cells in response to the tumor environment nor the process of cell lysis solely caused the observed spectral changes. Subsequently, we analyzed if degradation of the photosynthetic membrane—a process that might be initiated when <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> cells are inactivated by the immune system—could be causative for the spectral changes. Therefore, we first recorded the spectral signature of <italic>Rba. capsulatus</italic> SB1003 cell extracts where the photosystem was denatured by prolonged incubation at 95° in comparison to native (French press) extracts (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). While the native cell extracts showed the 800 nm/860 nm signature as observed for intact cells indicating undamaged membranes and photosynthetic complexes, the heat-denatured samples displayed a distinct 770 nm absorbance indicative of free BChl <italic>a</italic>. Ultimately, we analyzed the possibility of phagocytotic uptake of <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> by macrophages which are not only commonly involved in host–pathogen defense, but are also prevalent in tumors. To this end we co-incubated <italic>Rba. capsulatus</italic> SB1003 cells together with Ana-1 macrophages or 4T1 tumor cells. Subsequently, the OA spectra of both the mammalian cells and their corresponding supernatants were recorded separately (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). We could not observe any spectral information from 4T1 cells indicating no or only marginal uptake of <italic>Rhodobacter</italic>. In contrast, a strong <italic>Rhodobacter</italic>-mediated MSOT signal was detected in Ana-1 macrophages 24 h and up to 144 h after onset of co-cultivation showing a spectral shift similar to the one observed in the tumor experiments and hence indicating that uptake of bacteria by macrophages is responsible for the spectral conversion. MSOT spectra of the cell culture media provide mirror images after 24 h with the classical two peaked spectral signature of live <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> remaining in the media of 4T1 cells while signal of free-living <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> cells is no longer detectable in media of macrophages. Indeed, microscopic analysis of the cells revealed that the bacteria are found inside Ana-1 cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Regarding the intracellular fate of <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> taken up by macrophages we found signals of lysosomal marker lamp-1 and signals indicating ingested <italic>Rhodobacter</italic> but, surprisingly, observed no significant colocalization (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Addition of <italic>Rba</italic>. <italic>capsulatus</italic> SB1003 to Ana-1 macrophages and 4T1 tumor cells in vitro.

Remarkably, we found reproducible (<italic>n</italic> = 3) spatiotemporal variation of the spectral pattern depending on the strain, the tumor model and the localization within the tumor at different times after injection. We believe that the basis for this shift is the phagocytosis and disintegration of the bacteria by macrophages and subsequent aggregation of the released BChl <italic>a</italic>. Our results clearly link the change of the spectral signature to macrophage activity in different regions of the tissue, which is an important contribution to understanding the tumor microenvironment and the spatially and temporally diverse plasticity, activity and overall functionality of macrophages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, especially, since M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are critical for shaping this microenvironment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.
