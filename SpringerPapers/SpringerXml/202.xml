intrinsically related to many crucial aspects of human life and inadequacy in its supplies has always been a constraint to human and economic development. Of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Goal 7 is mainly focussed on ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> In past few years, demand for energy has dramatically increased mainly due to our reliance on technology, high living standards and ever growing population. To close the gaps of energy supplies by 2030, we need to check the use of fossil fuels as source of energy and urgently scale up production and use of renewable sources of energy to prevent long term planetary scale consequences, the most severe product of which is climate change.</p><p id="Par2">The first and foremost target of SDG 7 i.e. target 7.1 is to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services by 2030<sup><underline>1</underline></sup><sub><underline>.</underline></sub> According to the latest ‘Sustainable Development Goals Report 2022’, the rate of electricity access has increased from 83% in 2010 to 91% in 2020, worldwide, and those who lived without electricity reduced from 1.2 billion to 733 million. However, the report further adds that the rate of progress has slowed down in recent past and the complexities have increased mainly due to outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic<sup><underline>2</underline></sup>. Referencing to the context, the annual electricity access rates grew by 0.5% points in 2018–2020 in comparison to 0.8% points in 2010–2018. In 2020, 77% of the world population without electricity lived in sub-Saharan Africa. Hence, this region needs to be the focus of national and international organizations to achieve the target by 2030. Report suggests that only 92% of the global population will gain electricity access by 2030, leaving 670 million people behind.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref></p><p id="Par3">On the other hand, World health Organization (WHO) (2022) states that one third of world’s population (or 2.4 billion people) are still devoid of clean cooking and rely on polluting fuels, which impact their health. The report also claims that one third of the global population will keep using polluted cooking fuels in 2030, with majority living in sub-Saharan Africa.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> Use of inefficient and polluting fuels including wood, coal, charcoal, dung and crop waste generates huge levels of household air pollution (HAP). This can be a major health concern and can contribute to serious diseases and even deaths, particularly in women and children living in low and middle income countries (Stoner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>). A report by WHO on Household Air Pollution (2022) estimated that HAP caused 3.2 million deaths per year in 2020, which included over 237,000 deaths of children under 5 years. Not only this, ambient air pollution and household air pollution when combined is responsible for 6.7 million premature deaths per year. HAP exposure leads to non-communicable diseases, which include ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> Additionally, the unprocessed biomass solid fuels used for domestic cooking are also major cause of air pollution causing up to 50 times more pollution than cooking gas. These fuels release many toxic pollutants in environment including carbon monoxide (CO), suspended particulate matter (SPM), hydrocarbons (HCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Of these, black carbon is of major concern, which is second strongest contributor to the global warming after emissions generated by carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) (Ravindra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2019</xref>). Furthermore, coal, which is a major contributor of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, is also a huge source of electricity generation in present times creating a challenge in transitioning to low carbon energy systems. Demand for coal is strong and plays key role in fuelling economic development in emerging markets. World Coal Association reports that currently, coal power plants generate 37% of global electricity and estimates from International Energy Agency (IEA) suggest that even by 2040, coal will produce 22% of world’s electricity, maintaining its hold as the single largest source of electricity in the world.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref> Coal, oil and gas being the main drivers of global warming, phasing out coal has been one of the main objectives of 26<sup>th</sup> Conference of the Parties (COP 26) to translate the goal of ‘securing global net zero by mid-century and keeping 1.5°C within reach’ into action.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn6">6</xref> However, many countries expressed their disagreement and the final pact went from ‘phase out’ to ‘phase down’ giving setback to the sustainability goals (Arora and Mishra <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2021</xref>). Recently held COP27 in Egypt also did not show any signs of progress in this regard, and the draft suggests to accelerate the measures towards ‘phase down’ of unabated coal power and phase out and rationalize inefficient fossil fuel subsidies.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn7">7</xref> Hence, intensified efforts are needed in order to make electricity accessible and adoption of clean cooking solutions particularly in low and middle income countries to boost their growth at multiple levels.</p><p id="Par4">Target 7.2 is to increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix by 2030<sup><underline>1</underline></sup>. Ever since the industrial revolution, energy mix of most of the countries relied on fossil fuels (coal, oil and natural gas) boosting economies for over 150 years, and currently also supplying about 80% of world’s energy. Fossil fuels were formed millions of years ago from carbon rich animals and plant remains and hence when they are burned, the stored carbon and green-house gases (GHGs) are released into atmosphere.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn8">8</xref> Report by Our World in Data on ‘renewable energy’ shows that energy generated by burning of fossil fuels produces three-quarters of GHG emissions.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn9">9</xref> The unprecedented increase in GHGs emissions is causing global warming and extreme weather events, harming overall health of our planet and its sustainability. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report claims that to limit the pace of global warming, we need to make transitions in the energy sector. This calls for a significant reduction in fossil fuels, ubiquitous electrification, improved energy efficiency and use of alternative fuels like hydrogen.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn10">10</xref> The report explains that right policies, infrastructure and technology to facilitate changes in our daily lives can result in 40–70% reduction in GHGs emission by 2050. Another report by Tyndall Centre at The University of Manchester commissioned by International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) (2022) states that to limit the global warming up to 1.5°C, oil and natural gas must be phased out by 2034 for rich countries and by 2050 for poor.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn11">11</xref> Hence, we need to make changes in the way we produce and consume energy. For this, it is important that a transition is made towards renewable sources of energy as they are cheaper, reliable and more efficient for everyday use. Some mainstream renewable technologies including hydropower, wind energy, solar energy, biomass energy, biofuels and geothermal energy are already contributing towards safety and sustainability of our planet (Gielen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>). The deployment of renewables is not only needful for climate change objectives but also to meet the global demands for energy. As per the estimates shown in Sustainable Development Goals Report 2022’ for Goal 7, the share of renewables in total energy consumption attained 17.7% in 2019 i.e. 1.6% higher than 2010, while total renewable energy consumption increased by a quarter during the same period<sup><underline>2</underline></sup>. In electricity sector, increment in renewables was witnessed from 19.7% in 2010 to 26.2% in 2019. On the other hand, in heat sector, the progress was insignificant with less than 2% gains in 2019 compared to 2010. In case of transport, renewable energy reached 3.6% in 2019, which was a jump up from 2.6% in 2010<sup><underline>2</underline></sup>. Report further added that traditional uses of biomass remained stagnant and represented more than a third of total renewable energy use in 2019<sup><underline>2</underline></sup>. On the other hand, Our World in Data estimates show that worldwide, hydropower occupies the largest modern renewable resource occupying 4274 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 2021, followed by wind and solar power with 1596 TWh and 846 TWh respectively<sup><underline>9</underline></sup>. In case of electricity mix, renewables accounted for one-quarter of electricity generation in 2021. Furthermore, total biofuel production worldwide was estimated to be 1084 TWh, where North America showed highest production with 412 TWh followed by South and Central America (273 TWh), Asia Pacific (210 TWh) and Europe (187 TWh) in 2021<sup><underline>9</underline></sup>. The above data shows that boosting renewable energy is of utmost importance in order to decarbonize our energy systems in coming future and meeting the global demands.</p><p id="Par5">Target 7.3 aims at doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency by 2030<sup><underline>1</underline></sup>. Improving annual energy efficiency at a fast rate has become imperative to mitigate the adverse impacts caused by climate change that will otherwise undermine the energy security and overall global goals. Tracking the SDG 7: The Energy Progress Report (2022),’ published by the International Energy Agency (IEA), the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the UN Statistics Division (UNSD), the World Bank, and WHO reveals that Target 7.3 aims to improve primary energy intensity to 2.6 in 2010–30 versus 1990–2010. But from 2010 to 2019, annual energy efficiency improvement globally has attained the value of 1.9% which is below the target.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn12">12</xref> For early 2020, substantial decrease in intensity improvement was witnessed due to COVID-19 pandemic. According to Sustainable Development Goals Report (2022), global primary energy intensity [ratio of total energy supply to gross domestic product (GDP)] has improved from 5.6 megajoules per US dollar (2017 purchasing power parity) in 2010 to 4.7 in 2019, with an average improvement rate of 1.9% annually. However, the report states that in order to actually meet the targets of Goal 7, improvement in average annual energy intensity will need to reach 3.2% by 2030. Eastern and South-Eastern Asia is the only region that has achieved the targets with an annual improvement of 2.7% in 2010–2019, strongly pushed by economic growth<sup><underline>2</underline></sup>. In fact, in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the world will need to scale up the rate of energy efficiency to 4% for the rest of the decade<sup><underline>12</underline></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Among the last two targets, 7A focuses on enhancing international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, promote investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology by 2030; Target 7B is to expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island nations and landlocked developing countries by 2030<sup><underline>1</underline></sup>. Both targets rely on international financial flows, for promoting access to research, technology and investments in clean energy as well as to expand or upgrade energy services for developing countries. However, despite the urgent needs of sustainable development and climate change crisis around the world, developing nations showed a decrease in financial flow for clean energy for the second consecutive year. The amount was reduced to $10.9 billion in 2019, down by approximately 24% from previous year. Recent pandemic further worsened the situation in 2020<sup><underline>2</underline>, <underline>12</underline></sup>. The reduction was mainly concentrated in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, where international monetary flows fell off by 66.2%; in Latin America and the Caribbean decreased by 29.8%, and Central and Southern Asia where flows dropped by 24.5%. Oceana was the only region with an exception, where international flow grew by 72%<sup><underline>12</underline></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In addition to all aforementioned constraints, the energy crisis arising from Russia-Ukraine conflict coupled with COVID-19 pandemic is a setback to targets of Goal 7, resulting in soaring energy prices and uncertainty in global oil and gas markets impacting economies around the globe.</p><p id="Par8">In order to make renewable energy and its technology available for all and to achieve climate goals, swift actions are required. With only eight years left to achieve universal access to affordable and sustainable energy for all, there is need to plan the implementation of the pacts discussed in UN Climate Change Conference (COPs). As marked in the last two summits (COP 26 and 27), emission of GHGs has to be brought down by using new technologies and renewable energy sources, and by making countries equipped for climate action by catalysing the flow of finance for clean and green technologies.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn13">13</xref> Full-fledged industrial decarbonization, right from smartphones to aircrafts, is required to achieve climate stabilization and reaching net zero GHGs emissions. Countries must amalgamate multitude approaches to meet the energy needs in a sustainable way. Emerging and breakthrough technologies like marine energy, hydrogen power, grid batteries, cellulosic ethanol and concentrated solar photovoltaic is the new future to cut down world’s carbon footprint and are attracting the research communities (Hussain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2017</xref>;  Woolston and Ong <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2022</xref>). A study by Rissman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>) reported that new advancing technologies specific to top-emitting industries including cement, iron, steel, chemicals and plastics have to come up quick and fast. Some successes in this direction include cement admixtures, alternative green chemistries and zero-carbon steel-making. Marine ecosystems are also being viewed as potential sources of novel bio-energy systems. Apart from the unlimited algal biomass, cutting edge technologies for energy conversion e.g. bio-solar cells and photosynthetic microbes as source of energy and hydrogen, can prove to be very important in future (Zhu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2022</xref>). Novel biotechnologies such as bio-electrochemical cells (BEC) have lately gained attention regarding generation of clean energy. However, the challenges which have to be overcome regarding the use of ‘microbial factories’ is the production of energy in adequate amounts and at affordable price. Cynaobacteria have been employed as major biofuel producers. Recent studies have mapped the presence of polar cynaobacteria and linked it to bioenergy conservation. The concepts and mechanisms of microbes are currently being harnessed to design modern cost effective and eco-friendly energy generating cells. The pigments produced by extremophilic bacteria have been evaluated in efficiently trapping solar energy, and have found their application as dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) (Silva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2019</xref>). Bacterial pigments are capable of generating electricity and their application in energy cells increases the efficiency of the system. Further research, characterizing novel pigments from microbes habituating in extreme environment can embark the application of biotechnology in generation of renewable sources sustainably in the near future.</p><p id="Par9">Renewable hydrogen can play an important role in alleviating carbon emissions from both light and heavy industries. Rapid scale up of renewable hydrogen, investments in hydrogen-based research and development (R&amp;D) and infrastructure for its adoption will be needed to decarbonize industries in line with Paris Agreement (Rissman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>). To swiftly utilize these novel technologies at large scale, accelerated advancement in R&amp;D, cutting on costs, reformed policy frameworks and business models, and enhanced international cooperation driven by governments, communities and organizations are required. The actual progress will come with support of investors and funding agencies as well as informed policy makers. People living in low-income countries are looking for cheaper alternatives. In this regard, strong market mechanisms should be developed to offer clean and affordable energy options to poor and marginalized populations. Domestic and local bankers must come forward and work in line to support the green technologies involved in providing clean energy. Renewable Energy and Jobs: Annual Report (2022) has confirmed that despite multiple crises, growth in renewable energy job has hit 12.7 million in 2021, up from 12 million in 2020. Almost two-thirds of all jobs are in Asia, and China alone holds 42% of the global total, followed by Eurpean Union (EU) and Brazil with 10% each, while USA and India account for 7% each.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn14">14</xref> Among all renewables, the fastest growing is solar photovoltaic with 4.3 million jobs in 2021 accounting for more than a third of all renewable energy workforce. Next is wind power with 1.3 million jobs in 2021, followed by 2.4 million jobs in hydropower, and biofuels accounting for 2.4 million jobs<sup><underline>14</underline></sup>. United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is also working with different partners to improve energy access and strengthen business related to energy efficiency in developing and emerging economies, making these nations gain economic and environmental profits to reduce poverty.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn15">15</xref></p><p id="Par10">Setting up consistent policy reform agenda and strong national level targets for electrification, clean cooking and energy access by governments will help small enterprises and private sectors to operate easily. Local organizations must engage in innovative and regenerative solutions through educational and hands-on learning experiences to encourage the use of renewables in everyday life, which in turn will help to combat climate crisis. Moreover, integrated planning is important to promote decentralized energy systems alongside electricity grid improvements. This will help in balancing the shift towards clean energy and also in providing off-grid energy to rural people, helping in economic development of rural areas.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn16">16</xref> Energy policies supporting low carbon transition still require considerable efforts and resources to uplift. Furthermore, attention should be paid to aging infrastructures including power generating equipment, which are another major cause for negative impact on energy generation. Subsidies on renewables must be given for large scale and small scale deployments. Limits on emissions should be mandated to reduce pollution from GHGs emissions. Carbon taxes must be levied on consumers to pay for energy based on the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> produced. This will create awareness among people to shift towards products with lower carbon emissions.</p><p id="Par11">Access to clean and modern energy is an important target in the 2030 Agenda for SDGs, because without energy access, it will not be possible to mitigate poverty, end hunger, boost education, improve health, increase water supply and industrialization, and combat climate change. Resources are exhausting quickly thus creating a challenge for future, which can turn into ‘an era of energy crises’ for upcoming generations. For this a momentum towards a decarbonized energy generation and movement towards green and sustainable economy is required.
