carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) with PbS quantum dots (QDs), leading to the formation of a
novel class of SWCNTs/PbS-QDs nanohybrids (NHs), without resorting to any ligand
engineering and/or surface functionalization. The number of laser ablation pulses
(N<sub>Lp</sub>) was used to control the average size of the PbS-QDs and their
coverage on the SWCNTs’ surface. Photoconductive (PC) devices fabricated
from these SWCNTs/PbS-QDs NHs have shown a significantly enhanced photoresponse,
which is found to be PbS-QD size dependent. Wavelength-resolved photocurrent
measurements revealed a strong photoconductivity of the NHs in the UV-visible
region, which is shown to be due to multiple exciton generation (MEG) in the
PbS-QDs. For the 6.5 nm-diameter PbS-QDs (with a bandgap
(Eg) = 0.86 eV), the MEG contribution of the NHs
based PC devices was shown to lead to a normalized internal quantum efficiency in
excess of 300% for photon energies ≥4.5Eg. While the lowest MEG
threshold in our NHs based PC devices is found to be of ~2.5Eg, the MEG
efficiency reaches values as high as
0.9 ± 0.1.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep20083.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep20083" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep20083</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The prospect of exploiting multiple exciton generation (MEG), expanding thus efficient
solar light photoconversion over the UV to near infrared (NIR) spectral range, has led
to an ever increasing interest in quantum dots (such as PbSe and PbS) as light
harvesters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The MEG is the process in which, upon the
absorption of a single high-energy photon, at least two electron-holes pairs (excitons)
can be generated. The efficiency of this process and its contribution to the performance
of optoelectronic devices rely on the capability to separate electron-hole pairs and
their subsequent efficient collection. The main factor that hinders taking advantage of
MEG in colloidal quantum dots (QDs) is the poor inter-QD conductivity due to the
presence of ligands on their surface. The mainstream approach to overcome this issue is
to proceed with the so-called ligand exchange processing where long capping insulating
ligands are replaced by shorter ones. This ligand exchange has been shown to improve
photocharge mobility, leading thereby to higher efficiency photovoltaic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Indeed, occurrence of MEG has been recently evidenced in this type
of QDs involving PbX (X = Se, S) and CdSe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Colloidal PbS-QDs photoconductors with high internal
photoconductive gain, measured under a large external bias, have been demonstrated to
exhibit MEG in the UV region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Very recently, successive treatments of
PbSe-QDs film with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) and hydrazine, in order to increase the film
conductivity, have shown external quantum efficiency (EQE) surpassing 100% that was
attributed to the MEG process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Despite these important advances, the
issues caused by the low electronic coupling between colloidal QDs have been identified
as a limiting factor for the improvement that MEG can contribute in the power conversion
efficiency (PCE) of solar cells.</p><p>A very promising approach to exploit MEG is the hybridization of QDs with one or two
dimensional nanostructures (including carbon nanotubes, nanowires or graphene), to form
the so-called nanohybrids (NHs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In those NH systems, the
QDs are used as light absorbers and charge generators whereas the other component
(<italic>e.g.</italic> carbon nanotubes) acts as efficient charge conveyors. Moreover, the key
advantages of using carbon nanotubes lie in their unparalleled charge carrier mobility,
extremely highly aspect ratio and high optical transparency when formed into thin
films. All these characteristics are highly desirable for efficient photocharges
transport in the NHs. Conventional chemical approaches for combining single-wall carbon
nanotubes (SWCNTs) and colloidal QDs face problems such as a poor control over QDs
diameter, low surface coverage of SWCNTs and inefficient charge transfer between QDs and
SWCNTs due to the presence of ligands. Ligand-free attachment of semiconductor QDs to
SWCNTs would indeed solve the issue of charge transfer; however, only a few works have
tackled this challenging issue. In fact, using an ultrasonication based process,
ligand-free attachment of CdSe QDs to multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) has been
achieved<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, this approach cannot be used for SWCNTs because
of the damage induced by such a vigorous ultrasonication treatment, which ends in
shortening the SWCNTs and thus lowering their conductivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.
Non-chemical approaches that rely on the direct physical deposition of QDs, such as
pulsed laser deposition (PLD) or atomic layer deposition, entirely circumvent the need
of using ligands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. As we have recently demonstrated, PLD
offers an interesting synthesis route of NHs by directly growing PbS-QDs onto
SWCNTs’ surfaces with a direct atomic contact between both constituents,
overcoming the ligand exchange process and the difficulty of QD size control<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p>In this work, we report on the use of the PLD technique for the synthesis of
SWCNTs/PbS-QDs NHs with controllable PbS-QDs size and their subsequent integration into
photoconductive (PC) devices. The NHs based PC devices were found to exhibit a
photoconduction response spanning from the NIR region to the UV. More interestingly, the
quantum efficiency spectra of the NH-based devices are found to exhibit an intense peak
in the UV region, whose intensity depends on the size of the PbS-QDs. The strong UV
photoresponse of the SWCNTs/PbS-QDs NH devices is demonstrated to originate from the MEG
process taking place in the PbS-QDs. This is the first experimental evidence of the
occurrence of MEG in the NHs based photoconductive devices where the PbS-QDs are grown
by a physical PLD approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussions</title><p>We have synthesized PbS-QDs with different sizes by
varying the number of laser pulses (N<sub>Lp</sub>) from 20 to 1000. Crystalline
quality and QDs size were directly assessed through transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> shows a typical TEM
image of the PbS-QDs directly grown on carbon-filmed TEM grid with
N<sub>Lp</sub> = 100. The PbS-QDs are seen to be well
isolated with a relatively uniform size distribution centered around
4.2 nm. The inset of <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> shows the high
resolution TEM image of an individual PbS-QD. It reveals the high degree of
crystallinity of the QDs and the absence of any apparent stacking faults. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> shows the XRD spectra of a SWCNTs film spray-coated onto
Si substrate together with typical XRD spectra of PbS-QDs (at
N<sub>Lp</sub> = 1000) directly deposited on both SWCNTs and
bare-Si substrates. The XRD spectra of the PbS-QDs on both substrates reveal its
cubic phase with an fcc rocksalt structure (JCPDS 47-2123). The increased intensity
of 2θ = 26<sup>o</sup> peak in the
PbS-QD/SWCNTs spectrum is due to the contribution from the graphite peak positioned
at 26.5<sup>o</sup>. The latter is clearly seen to be present in the XRD
spectrum of SWCNTs, confirming their graphite-like crystalline structure.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TEM and XRD measurements.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) TEM image of isolated PbS-QDs PLD-deposited directly on a TEM grid

characteristics of SWCNTs, Raman spectroscopy has been carried out by using a
514 nm laser as an excitation source. The typical Raman spectra before
and after the PLD deposition of PbS-QDs on the SWCNTs are presented in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>. This figure shows the typical fingerprint of SWCNTs
consisting of the radial breathing mode (RBM) band (at
173.52 cm<sup>−1</sup>), the D-band (at
1349 cm<sup>−1</sup>) and the G-band (at
1592 cm<sup>−1</sup>). The similarity between the
two spectra suggests that the presence of PbS-QDs on the surface of the SWCNTs does
not seem to affect the SWCNTs electronic structure. The only noticeable change is
the small widening of the RBM band and its shifting towards seemingly smaller
nanotube diameters. This is thought to reflect the actual coating of the SWCNTs by
PbS-QDs, limiting somehow their radial breathing. Finally, the low intensity ratio
(∼0.1) of the D/G bands is indicative of the high degree of purity and
good crystalline quality (no amorphous and/or disordered carbon) of our SWCNTs.
After having clearly established the high-crystalline quality of the PbS-QDs and
confirmed the preservation of structural properties of the SWCNTs (through the
above-presented TEM, XRD and Raman spectroscopy characterizations), the efficiency
of the PLD process to achieve conformal decoration of SWCNTs by PbS-QDs was made
clear through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations. As an illustration,<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> shows a typical SEM image of the NHs (achieved at
N<sub>Lp</sub> = 500) where the SWCNTs’
surface is seen to be fully and conformally covered by the PbS-QDs.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Raman spectra and SEM observation.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Raman spectra of the SWCNTs film and of the SWCNTs/PbS-QDs (at

SWCNTs were synthesized. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(a–f)</xref> show the TEM
images of NHs synthesized with increasing N<sub>Lp</sub> values from 20 to 1000. At
N<sub>Lp</sub> = 20, isolated PbS-QDs are seen to attach
at places on the surface of the SWCNTs bundle. The size and number of the PbS-QDs
continue to increase until N<sub>Lp</sub> = 500 where a full
coverage of the SWCNTs’ surface is reached. In the histogram of <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(g)</xref>, we show the size distribution of the QDs at different
N<sub>Lp</sub> values as measured from TEM images. At low N<sub>Lp</sub> values
(&lt;100), isolated QDs attached on the SWCNTs with small diameters (varying
from 2 to 5.3 nm) can be easily distinguished. For higher N<sub>Lp</sub>
values (≥200), the PbS-QDs grow more slowly in size and tend to saturate
at a diameter of ∼10 nm at
N<sub>Lp</sub> = 1000. For
N<sub>Lp</sub> &lt; 200, close observation of the QDs on
the SWCNTs reveals their spherical shape, which evolves into a cubic one when the
QDs grow enough (increasing N<sub>Lp</sub>) to impede their neighbor’s
growth. The curves in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(h)</xref> summarize the concomitant
variations of the QDs size and associated surface coverage of the
SWCNTs’ surface as a function of N<sub>Lp</sub>. It is worth recalling
here that the PbS-QDs grow onto the surface of the SWCNTs. Indeed, the ablated
species from the PbS target “land” onto the surface of
SWCNTs, nucleate and start to grow as nanoparticles (or QDs). Some PbS-QDs embryos
can also form in the plasma gas phase and be deposited directly on the substrate
where they continue to grow from other “landing” ablated
species. As the number of ablation laser pulses (N<sub>LP</sub>) is increased, not
only the size of these QDs grows but also their density on the surface of nanotubes
increases (as shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(h)</xref>). At high N<sub>LP</sub>
values (≥500), a complete coverage of the SWCNTs by the PbS-QDs layer is
reached (the SWCNTs are sort of wrapped into a PbS-QDs outer layer; as shown in<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2</xref>(b) and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>(e)). As the SWCNTs
are laterally lying down onto the quartz substrate, the PbS-QDs grow on their
surface, which is their most exposed part to the laser ablation flux. Consequently,
the chances to have some QDs possibly growing inside the tubes are very low to not
to say nil. As a matter of fact, we have never seen any PbS-QD inside the SWCNTs
despite the countless TEM observations.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TEM imaging and size distributions of the PLD deposited PbS-QDs.</p><p>(<bold>a–f</bold>) TEM images of SWCNTs/PbS-QDs nanohybrids made with

and a pure PbS-QDs (N<sub>Lp</sub> = 1000) film directly

here are representative of 3 to 5 devices, for a given N<sub>LP</sub> condition, and
their PC response is found to be quite reproducible within an experimental error

to note that no photocurrent has been detected from the devices made only with the

form a continuous film of ~30 nm thick (assuming an average
deposition rate of 0.03 nm/laser pulse) consisting of PbS-QDs with an
average diameter of ~10 nm. These PbS-QDs films are
sufficiently resistive to hinder any charge flow through the devices at the applied
voltages. On the other hand, the PC devices made solely by SWCNTs (without any
PbS-QDs decoration), were also found to generate only a very weak photocurrent
(<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). In contrast, the association of the PbS-QDs
with the SWCNTs to form the NHs has led to PC devices exhibiting a strong
photocurrent, which is ~90 times larger than that produced from the
SWCNTs device at a bias of 10 V. This demonstrates the complementary and
synergistic roles played by both PbS-QDs and SWCNTs components of the NHs (i.e.; the
photons are absorbed by the QDs and the generated photocharges are rapidly conveyed
by the underlying high mobility SWCNTs).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photocurrent measurements.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Typical I<sub>ph</sub>-V curves of the PbS-QDs alone, the SWCNTs

N<sub>Lp</sub>, the photocurrent continuously increases with the laser power

photocurrent is much higher at low laser power densities than for higher ones
(≥100 mW.cm<sup>−2</sup>), for which the
curve slopes of <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref> are less steep. This suggests that
photocharges recombination may occur in the entangled SWCNTs network particularly
under high illumination conditions. In fact, at low power density deep trap states
are available, allowing longer lifetime of electrons and lower recombination. In
contrast, at high power densities, the deep trap states are filled, only short-lived
trap states (shallow traps) are available, increasing thereby the recombination
which affects the efficiency of production of photocurrent. Such a less efficient
generation of photocurrent at high light intensities has been also observed by
Konstantatos <italic>et al</italic>. and attributed to the recombination that increases with
the laser power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, for a given laser illumination condition, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig.
4b</xref> shows that the photocurrent increases with N<sub>Lp</sub> suggesting
that the absorption of the photons by the PbS-QDs is driving the photocurrent
generation process. In fact, the photons absorption in the PbS-QDs leads to the
creation of excitons of which photocharges are rapidly transferred to the underlying
SWCNTs. This has been inferred from the strong quenching of the photoluminescence
(PL) of the PbS-QDs once associated with SWCNTs to form the nanohybrids (as we have
demonstrated in a previous paper<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>). By using work function values of
~4.7 eV for PbS-QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and
~5.1 eV for SWCNTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and assuming an
average bandgap energy value of ~0.9 eV for both PbS-NPs and
SWCNTs, the band diagram (depicted in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref> of ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>) confirms an energetically favorable charge transfer from
PbS-QDs to SWCNTs. It is important to note that the average E<sub>g</sub> value of
0.9 eV for PbS-QDs is quite realistic as it falls well within the
E<sub>g</sub> values (i.e.; 0.6–1.2 eV) of the PbS-QDs
investigated in the present work. On the other hand, the E<sub>g</sub> of SWCNTs is
known to be inversely proportional to their diameter and the 0.9 eV
value for ~1.3 nm diameter SWCNTs is quite representative
for our SWCNTs (both Raman and HR-TEM observations have shown a predominance of
SWCNTs with diameters in the (1.25–1.30) nm range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. This energetically favored charge transfer mechanism of the
photocharges from PbS-QDs to SWCNTs along with the direct atomic contact between
PbS-QDs and SWCNTs (through the formation of C-S bonds, as revealed by XPS
analyses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>) are at the origin of the fastest photoresponse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> exhibited by our NHs.</p><p>On the other hand, the bandgap (E<sub>g</sub>) values of the PbS-QDs were derived
from their associated PL emission spectra (as the one illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1</xref> in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supporting information</xref> for
~4.2 nm-diameter PbS-QDs) for the different N<sub>Lp</sub>
values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In a previous work, we have established a direct
relation between the size of PLD PbS-QDs and their PL-determined bandgap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, in accordance with the theoretical model of Wang <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The use of PL spectra to determine the E<sub>g</sub> values of our
PbS-QDs is quite convenient as their excitonic absorption peak can be hardly
pinpointed form their UV-Vis spectra mainly because of the very nature of our
PbS-QDs films. Indeed, unlike colloidal suspensions where the probed volume contains
sufficient PbS-QDs to yield a significant absorption and thereby enable an easy
observation of the excitonic absorption peaks, the probed amount of PbS-QDs in our
PLD-deposited films is very tiny. For example, the very thin film of PbS-QDs
deposited with N<sub>Lp</sub> = 100 onto a quartz substrate,
would have an equivalent thickness of only ~3 nm (assuming
the average PLD deposition rate of ~0.03 nm/ablation pulse).
In fact, this film is rather discontinuous and consists of sparse PbS-QDs having a
diameter of ~4.2 nm. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1</xref> in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supporting
information</xref> section shows both the absorbance and PL spectra of the
~4.2 nm-diam. PbS-QDs film deposited onto a quartz
substrate.</p><p>To investigate the effect of N<sub>Lp</sub> on the photoresponse of the devices,
spectrally resolved EQE spectra of the NHs based devices, which characterize the
number of photogenerated electrons per incident photon at every wavelength (as
explained in the Methods section), were systematically measured over all the UV to
NIR range. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> shows the EQE spectra of the NHs devices
made with increasing N<sub>Lp</sub> values from 100 to 1500. First, it is worth
noting that the EQE photoresponse spectra of the SWCNTs/PbS-QDs nanohybrids are
quite similar to the UV-Vis absorption spectra of either PbS-QDs alone or those of
the SWCNTs/PbS-QDs nanohybrids (Figs S2 and S3 in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supporting information</xref>). In particular, the higher
absorption of the PbS-QDs at UV frequencies translated into an EQE peak around
260 nm for the NHs based PC devices. This confirms that the photon
absorption in the NHs is occurring mainly through the PbS-QDs. However, the EQE
decrease observed for wavelengths shorter than 240 nm is rather
intriguing, as one would expect the EQE to remain constant at its high value, in
accordance with the absorption spectra of the SWCNTs/PbS-QDs. The physical reasons
for such EQE decrease at shorter UV wavelengths remain unclear at the moment and one
has to consider the EQE variation in the (200–240 nm) with
caution. Nonetheless, for very short wavelengths, some stray light can lead to an
overestimation of the light intensity coming from the EQE system’s
monochromator, which would in turn decrease the calculated value of EQE. Also, one
might speculate about the high absorption of the CNTs at shorter UV frequencies that
could lead to a decrease of the photons available to PbS-QDs. Finally, an enhanced
interfacial recombination of carriers at such high photon energies may also
contribute to a drop in EQE, as this has been invoked in the case PbSe-QDs based
solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>EQE and IQE spectra.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Photoconductive EQE spectra, measured at a biasing voltage of 10V,

devices exhibit a photoresponse peak in the
(~250–270) nm UV range, depending on their
N<sub>Lp</sub> value. The height of this UV-response peak is found to depend on
the N<sub>Lp</sub>, and, more interestingly, its intensity increases by steps for
certain N<sub>Lp</sub> values (gray arrows in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>).
Indeed, despite the differences in the PbS-QDs decoration conditions of the SWCNTs,
NHs based devices made with N<sub>Lp</sub> = 200 and 500
both produce a similar amount of photocurrent which is significantly higher than
that produced by N<sub>Lp</sub> = 100. Likewise, the devices
made with N<sub>Lp</sub> = 800, 1000 and 1500 produce almost
the same photocurrent intensity (at 260 nm) which is more than twice
higher than that of the N<sub>Lp</sub> = 200–500
group. This clearly shows that the photocurrent generation does not increase
linearly with N<sub>Lp</sub> but seems to be rather increasing by steps following
some thresholds. To further investigate the origin of the presence of the 3
different EQE intensity plateaus in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref> (i.e.; for
N<sub>Lp</sub> = 100, for
N<sub>Lp</sub> = 200–500, and
N<sub>Lp</sub> = 800–1500), the EQE spectra of
the different NHs were divided by their respective optical absorption (A) spectra
(shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">figure S3</xref> in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supporting information</xref>). The resulting internal
quantum efficiency (IQE) spectra, account for the number of photoelectrons generated
by the devices per absorbed photon (rather than per incident one), at every
wavelength. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref> shows the obtained IQE values, as a
function of the incident photon energy, for the SWCNTs/PbS-QDs based PC devices made
with different N<sub>Lp</sub> values. Accessing the IQE spectra is highly relevant
to single out the photogeneration process due solely to photons absorption while
getting rid of other contributions (mainly incident photons loss through
reflections). By examining the IQE spectra of <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, it
appears that for all the devices, IQE remains more or less insensitive to
hν in a sort of “flat” regime (at low photon
energies) up to a certain threshold and then prominently rises for higher photon
energies. (As an example, for NHs devices made with
N<sub>Lp</sub> = 500
(E<sub>g</sub> ~ 0.7 eV), even if
there is a sort of bump around 2 eV, the IQE is seen to really take-off
for photon energies &gt;3.1 eV.) The averaged value around which the
IQE fluctuates in the “flat” part of the spectra (low photon
energies range) was found to be device dependent. To be able to compare all the
devices (with different PbS-QD sizes), we have considered this
“flat” part of every IQE spectrum as a sort of baseline.
Thus, by dividing each IQE spectrum with its corresponding baseline value (i.e.
averaged IQE values in the “flat” part of the IQE spectrum
corresponding to low photon energies), we have defined what we refer to as a
normalized IQE (NIQE) spectrum (as detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">figure S4</xref> and associated explanation in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supporting information</xref>). These NIQE spectra permit
to single out the relative rise of the IQE of each device with respect to its
associated baseline. Moreover, reporting these NIQE curves against the
hν/Eg ratio enables direct comparison of different sizes of PbS-QDs with
different bandgaps on the same plot. The NIQE spectra of our NHs based PC devices
were plotted and compared with the rather scarce literature results available for
either colloidal PbS-QDs and bulk PbS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Interestingly, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref> shows a sort of a universal behavior where all the
devices exhibited the same steep increase (with the same slope, as it will be
discussed hereafter) in their NIQE after a certain photon energy threshold. The
threshold value at which the photocurrent generation rise takes off is found to
shift to higher photon energies as the PbS-QDs grow in size. Such a behavior along
with the surprisingly higher IQE response at higher photon energies strongly
suggests the occurrence of MEG in our NHs based PC devices. The occurrence of a
photoconductive gain would have been a possible explanation for the photocurrent
enhancement, as this has been invoked in the case of colloidal PbS-QDs, where
photosensitization was associated with the presence of oxide species on the
QDs’ surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Such photosensitization process
involves preferential trapping of charge carriers in the PbS-QDs. If such
photosensitization would be present in our PbS-QDs, it should not be depending on
different photon energy thresholds for different QD sizes (as seen in the NIQE
spectra of <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>). In sum, our results are more in line with
the occurrence of MEG for at least the two following reasons: (i) the existence of a
photon energy threshold beyond which the MEG occurs and (ii) higher NIQE values were
exhibited by smaller PbS-QDs (as seen in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>) because of
higher quantum confinement. Both facts are typical of the occurrence of MEG
effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. In fact, the energy value (which is QD
size dependent) beyond which the NIQE starts to increase linearly has been defined
as the MEG threshold in previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. For example, the NHs
made with PbS-QDs at N<sub>Lp</sub> = 200 (their
E<sub>g</sub> = 0.86 eV) are seen to yield a
NIQE of ∼300% at
hν = 4.5E<sub>g</sub> while the NHs made
with PbS-QDs at N<sub>Lp</sub> = 500 reach only 150%,
showing thereby that the MEG occurring in our NHs based PC devices is more efficient
as the QDs size decreases (higher quantum confinement). These results are in
agreement with the work of Midgett <italic>et al</italic>., where the MEG of both PbS and PbSe
QDs was investigated as a function of size and composition of the QDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Here, for all the QDs and beyond their MEG threshold, the NIQE increases almost
linearly with the same slope. Indeed, by using the same model as Semonin <italic>et
al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, we have found that the MEG efficiency
(η<sub>MEG</sub>) in our NHs based PC devices, calculated from the
slope of the linear fit (dash line in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>) <inline-formula id="IEq1"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep20083_IEq1_HTML.gif"/></inline-formula>, is of
∼0.9 ± 0.1. This value is higher
than the highest value (of 0.42) reported by Midgett <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>,
for 4.2 nm QDs, indicating that the MEG from our PLD grown PbS-QDs is
highly efficient. There are very few reports on MEG that have shown a
η<sub>MEG</sub> value as high as 0.9. For example, very highly
efficient carrier multiplication of η<sub>MEG</sub> ranging from 0.55 to
1 has been reported by Aerts <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> in PbS nanosheets with
thicknesses from 7 to 4 nm. Moreover, it is important to note that this
efficient MEG occurring in our PbS-QDs could not be evidenced from photocurrent
measurements without their association with the SWCNTs to form the NHs. At this
point, it is worth recalling that MEG has been also observed in CNTs but more
particularly for some specific chiralities and in some cases at relatively low
temperatures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. In the present work, our SWCNTs consist of a
random mixture of different chiralities and the PC/EQE measurements were performed
at room temperature, lowering thereby the chances to see any carrier multiplication
contribution from the SWCNTs. As a matter of fact, the I-V curves (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>) of the devices made solely with SWCNTs have shown a negligible
photocurrent (~90 times lower than that yielded by SWCNTs/PbS-QDs
nanohybrid based devices), ruling out the possibility of any contribution of SWCNTs
to the carrier multiplication exhibited by the nanohybrids. On the other hand, the
presence of SWCNTs (or other highly conductive network of nanowires) is definitely
essential to collect and transport the photocharges. Indeed, PbS being very
resistive, typical PbS-QDs photodetectors employ intricate electronics and high
voltages to measure photocurrent. For example, an electric field as high as 2
V/μm has been applied by Sukhovatkin <italic>et al</italic>. in order to be able
to demonstrate MEG from their colloidal PbS-QDs based photoconductive device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Here, we show that the presence of SWCNTs has made it possible to
measure wavelength resolved EQE spectra at a very low bias (0.002 V/μm
in our case versus 2 V/μm in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>).
Finally, the efficient collection of photocurrent in the NHs is favored because of
the direct contact (without ligands or organic molecules) between the PbS-QDs and
the SWCNTs, allowing a fast charge transfer.</p><p>In summary, the PLD technique was successfully used to achieve SWCNTs/PbS-QDs NHs
made from the controlled decoration of SWCNTs by physically grown PbS-QDs. The size
dependent bandgap of the PbS-QDs was varied and its effect on the optoelectronic
response of the NHs investigated. We were thus able to show that the SWCNTs/PbS-QDs
NHs exhibit strong UV-visible photoconductive response, which is found to be
modulated by the size of the PbS-QDs. This strong enhancement of the
photoconductance of the NHs devices is demonstrated to originate from MEG in our
PbS-QDs. This is the first demonstration of MEG occurrence in photoconductive
devices made of physically (PLD) processed SWCNTs/PbS-QDs NHs, where neither ligand
engineering nor surface functionalization were used to attach the QDs to the
nanotubes. The direct atomic contact between the QDs and the nanotubes together with
the unique charge transport ability of the SWCNTs are key factors to reveal MEG in
these NHs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Synthesis and characterization of PbS-QDs and SWCNTs/PbS-QDs
