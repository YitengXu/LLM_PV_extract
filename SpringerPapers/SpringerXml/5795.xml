First, its configuration and the simulated unit cell are discussed, and its fabrication method is explained. In this proposed structure, poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is used instead of glass. It is shown that the use of PDMS dramatically reduces the reflection from the cell surface. Furthermore, the light absorption is found to be greatly increased due to the light trapping and plasmonic enhancement of the electric field in the active layer. Then, three different structures, are compared with the main proposed structure in terms of absorption, considering the imperfect fabrication conditions and the characteristics of the built PSC. The findings show that in the worst fabrication conditions considered structure (FCCS), short-circuit current density (J<sub>sc</sub>) is 22.28 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is 27% higher than that of the planar structure with a value of 17.51 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. As a result, the efficiencies of these FCCSs are significant as well. In the main proposed structure, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is observed to be improved by 32%, from 13.86% for the planar structure to 18.29%.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>18698</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>19</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2020_Article_75630.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In recent years, organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received much attention and have made exceptional progress in terms of energy conversion efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.

In recent years, the use of nanostructures with different dimensions and shapes in the construction of various types of solar cells resulted in high efficiencies with less volume of absorbing material and generally more complex cell structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The use of nanostructures causes the cell to be lighter, more flexible and less bulky, in addition to enabling improvements in efficiency. Nanostructures enhance cell performance through the mechanism of light trapping in the absorbing medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, improving carrier extraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, or concentrating the electromagnetic field in the active layer using various configurations, especially plasmonic structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.
</p><p id="Par4">In light trapping structures, due to a shift in the direction of light path within the active layer, its interaction time with this layer increases, which increases the optical absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In these structures, by scattering the light to the off-normal directions, in addition to prolonging its pathlength in the active layer, the probability of reflection of each interface increases due to its angular movement. Therefore, light passes through the absorbing layer via multiple paths, which increases likelihood of absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Depending on the wavelength of the incoming wave, and the dimensions and formation of the nanostructure, different light trapping mechanisms may occur within the solar cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In plasmonic structures, plasmonic resonance occurs at the interface of metallic and non-metallic mediums by the collective excitation of the metal surface electrons gemerated by the electromagnetic waves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Depending on the dimensions of the metal nanostructures (MNS) used in the main structure, the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) would happen in one of two mechanisms - near-field or far-field. If the size of the MNS were small (&lt;50 nm), the SPR has mainly near-field effects and causes the electromagnetic field to concentrate in the vicinity of the MNS. But if the size of these nanostructures were larger (&gt;50 nm), the SPR is mostly of the far-field scattering type and the plasmonic structure acts as a back or forward scatterer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. In 2015, Carretero-Palacios et al. analyzed the effect of the size and concentration of Au nanoparticles (NPs) embedded within the perovskite film on its absorption and have demonstrated that in such a configuration, the absorption is maximized when near-field and far-field effects of SPR are balanced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.

This is due to the valuable properties of silicon, such as precisely shaping capability, compatibility with technologies used in the fabrication technologies of the integrated circuits, broad availability, and suitable electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties.

First, conventional planar PSC is simulated to verify the applicability of the modeling method used in this research. The obtained electrical outputs are set as references for the proposed structure. The optical losses of planar structure, which cause energy loss in this cell and reduction of its efficiency are investigated. The light trapping structure of the PSC based on a silicon substrate is presented, in which a PDMS layer is used as a cell protector instead of glass to reduce light reflection. The fabrication method of such a cell, based on an etched crystalline silicon substrate, is explained in this paper, and the simulation model used in this research is also discussed. The optical properties of this structure are compared with those of the planar structure considering the electric field profiles and the geometric path of light inside the cell. The effect of decreasing the density of hole transport material on the PSC performance according to the occurred plasmonic resonance is investigated. Then, three possible shapes of the structure concerning the deposition limitations and fabrication conditions are considered and compared with the ideal structure to estimate its efficiency after construction. Finally, the electrical properties of the main structure and three structures in which fabrication conditions were considered are investigated and compared.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par8">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a shows the typical planar architecture of a perovskite solar cell. This structure comprises five layers located on a flat glass substrate. These layers are ITO (indium doped thin oxide), TiO<sub>2</sub> (titanium dioxide), Perovskite (methylammonium lead iodide), CuSCN (copper thiocyanate) and Au with the thicknesses of 50, 50, 200, 600, and 100 nm, respectively.

This spectrum shows that not all of the energy of the incoming light is absorbed in the active layer, and a considerable amount of the energy is dissipated. According to calculations, 20% of light is lost due to parasitic absorption of the other layers and 13% to reflection. Since the carrier recombination during transportation in the cell is insignificant due to the low thickness of the perovskite and high diffusion length of carriers, it does not limit the output current. Therefore, the low J<sub>sc</sub> in the planar PSC is due to the limited light absorption in the perovskite layer. Thus, to increase the current density and output power corresponding to it, the amount of energy loss in the cell must be reduced. For this reason, the light trapping structure is used to facilitate the entry of light into the cell by reducing the reflection, and to confine light to the absorbing layer by reducing the parasitic losses of the inactive layers.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Presentation of the proposed nanostructured perovskite solar cell</title><p id="Par11">Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a shows our proposed structure for a perovskite solar cell.

PDMS in addition to being a transparent material with nearly no absorption in the visible and near-infrared spectral range, enhances the physical resistance of the cell and reduces reflection from the surface due to its suitable refractive index. Furthermore, a cell with this structure is more flexible than the conventional planar structure because of the absence of a thick layer of glass.

Using this method, one can make three-dimensional shapes depending on the crystalline orientation of silicon and the type of etchant with the advantages of low cost, high etching speed, and a high degree of selectivity. Since the &lt;100&gt; plane of the crystalline silicon etches more rapidly and at a higher rate than the &lt;111&gt;, by etching the silicon crystal (100), angular shapes can be produced. This angle, which is 54.7 degrees, is the angle between the &lt;100&gt; and the &lt;111&gt; planes and is caused by the fact that the etching is much slower in the &lt;111&gt; plane.

In order to achieve desired high efficiency, we can utilize fabrication methods used to assemble inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSC).

In order to control the thickness and morphology of the deposited layers, especially perovskite, in addition to the preceding mentioned methods, various techniques, including thermal vacuum deposition, solvent solvent extraction (SSE), ultra-sonic spray-coating, etc. have been proposed by researchers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. In these suggested deposition methods, the intention is to obtain stable, uniform and smooth films with a desired thickness.

Unlike in the planar architecture, in which, the direction of light in the PSC is normal to the cell surface, in this structure, due to the deformation of the configuration, the path of light changes on passing through each layer. In the conventional planar structure, assuming vertical illumination of light to the surface of the cell, the direction of light at the boundary of two layers does not change. But due to differences in the refractive indices of the two media, part of the impact light reflects, and the rest of it goes to the next layer without changing direction. But in this configuration, according to the Snell’s law, due to the angular incident of light at the interface of two media with different refractive indices, the direction of light changes at each layer, and its path is no longer perpendicular to the cell surface.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A schematic of light path inside a PSC with the proposed structure.

If the incoming light is closer to the middle of the studied unit cell, according to the state 1, the light path does not change after entering the PSC from the external medium (air). However, at the PDMS/ITO interface, because of the larger refractive index of ITO, it converges slightly to the middle of the cell. At the TiO<sub>2</sub> interface, due to the high angle of impact, light is reflected, and consequently, approaches the center. Therefore, it reaches the interface of the perovskite at an almost perpendicular angle and thus penetrates it. The direction of light does not change much on passing through HTL. As it collides with the Au back-contact, due to the SPR effect, which will be discussed further in the electric field review section, it scatters back into the absorbing layer. Again, due to the approaching impact angle to the total reflection angle at the interface of perovskite and CuSCN, it returns to the active layer. Thus, light is trapped inside the absorbing layer and moves further inside this layer. This increases the probability of the perovskite absorption and carrier generation inside it. State 2 shows the geometrical light path when it is away from the center of the unit cell. In this case, light moves in a similar path to that of a planar structure, and its direction does not shift much until it reaches the Au back-contact. When it hits the metal surface, due to the angular impact and the scattering effect of surface plasmon resonance, it scatters to the sides of the cell. Therefore, light returns to the absorbing layer at a nonvertical angle. Like state 1, in the perovskite/HTL interface, due to the high impact angle, light is reflected and is trapped in the active layer. Therefore, in both cases, the light that enters the cell is trapped inside the absorbing layer, until it is absorbed.</p><p id="Par19">Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b,c show the profiles of the normalized electric field at wavelength of 800 nm for a planar PSC and the presented structure. At this wavelength, the energy of photons is lower than that of the shorter wavelengths of the perovskite absorption spectrum, and therefore light moves longer before being absorbed. Thus, the electric field profile at 800 nm, in contrast to the lower wavelengths in which light is not trapped completely inside the active layer, is compatible with the light trapping mechanism of the nanostructure. Accordingly, at this wavelength, the comparison of the electric field profiles is accomplished. As expected, in the planar structure, the electric field intensity along the width of the PSC is constant. This indicates that the direction of light in this structure is unaltered and it always moves perpendicular to the cell surface. Also, within the perovskite and near its boundary with the HTL, the electric field intensity is higher than in the middle of the layer. This proves that part of the light reflects into the perovskite from this boundary and enhances the electric field in this area, and part of it enters the lower layer of CuSCN and causes parasitic losses.</p><p id="Par20">One can see that in the proposed structure, the intensity of the electric field in ITO is higher than that of the planar structure, indicating more light entering the cell due to the use of PDMS and the specific configuration of the PSC. This is because PDMS has a closer refractive index to the outer environment of the PSC (air), and the adaptation of the refractive indices of these two adjacent media, reduces the reflection from the cell surface. Unlike the planar structure, in this structure, due to the non-vertical movements of the light, the profile of the electric field is changed completely, and it is no longer constant across the width of the cell. According to this profile, the electric field intensity inside the absorbing medium and in certain areas of it is increased, which shows that light is trapped inside this layer. Part of this trapped light within the perovskite is located in the lower portion of the triangular section, which is the result of the first investigated state in the preceding section, and part of it in the upper portion and belongs to the second state, which is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a as dotted circles. Due to the specific shape of this structure, the approach of the metal contact to the absorbing layer reduces the parasitic losses and causes the light to return and trap in the active layer through the SPR enhancement of the metallic back-contact.

Consequently, the occurred SPR has no near-field effects, and it mainly has far-field effects and acts as a scatterer. Since the incident light is scattered in the longest wavelength of the studied spectrum, in shorter wavelengths, to the extent that light impacts the back-contact of Au, it scatters as well. Hence, one can say that the MNS acts only as a back scatterer and reflects most of the light (except for the part that is absorbed in the metal surface) to the first medium, at an angle equal to the incident angle according to Fresnel’s law. Overall, one can conclude that such a structure improved light entry, reduced parasitic losses, and trapped light in the cell.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The normalized reflectance and (<bold>b</bold>) absorption spectra of the planar and proposed structures.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2020_75630_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par21">Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a,b illustrate the reflectance of the PSC and the absorption of its active layer for the planar and proposed structures. It is seen that the light reflectance has decreased almost in the whole spectrum in the proposed structure. As mentioned, the use of PDMS instead of glass on the cell surface reduces the reflection of the incident light due to its suitable refractive index. This is because, as mentioned earlier, its refractive index is lower than that of its underlying layer (ITO) and is closer to the external environment (air) with a refractive index of one. Therefore light better penetrates the structure. On the other hand, the non-planar structure causes the non-vertical movement of photons inside the PSC. Therefore, the light that enters the cell deviates from the cell’s perpendicular direction, and if it reflects internally at the interface of two layers and returns to the cell surface, it reaches it at an angle closer to the total reflection angle. Therefore, it is less likely to leave the cell, which leads to decreased reflection. However, in two parts of the wavelength range, there is a slight increase in the reflectance due to the change in the configuration of the cell, but it is small compared to the whole wavelength range and does not have much effect.</p><p id="Par22">Due to the reduction of reflectance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), and the trapping of light inside the cell, especially within the absorbing layer, according to the profile of the electric field (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c), there is a significant increase in the perovskite absorption (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b).

Therefore, to accurately compare these two structures in equal conditions of used materials, or in other words, to study the effect of reducing the thickness of HTL on the performance of the proposed cell, the output parameters of this cell with the ordinary volume of HTL (400 nm) must also be studied. However, as discussed in the structural analysis section, in practice, the deposition of a layer with this thickness on a textured substrate with such dimensions, destroys its angular formation and flattens the cell surface. Therefore, instead of examining the proposed structure with an ordinary thickness of HTL (400 nm), and comparing it with the main one (50 nm thick HTL), we study the planar structure with a thin HTL (the thickness that used in the proposed structure, which is 50nm) and compare it with the proposed structure. In such a case, the properties of the two structures are the same in terms of the materials used, and the comparison is reasonable.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The normalized absorption spectrum for a conventional planar structure, the planar structure with a thin HTL (50 nm), and the proposed structure.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2020_75630_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par24">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, reducing the thickness of the HTL in the planar structure increases the absorption only in the red part of the spectrum. Because, at shorter wavelengths, light is absorbed before it reaches the HTL. Therefore, the changes in the thickness of this layer do not affect this part of the spectrum. However, at higher wavelengths (the red light), the low energy of photons prevents them from being fully absorbed in the top layers. They thus enter the lower layer of CuSCN. In a conventional planar structure, the light that enters HTL is parasitically lost in this layer before reaching the back-contact of Au. But in the planar structure with thin HTL, reducing the thickness of this layer reduces light loss in this layer to a large extent. Therefore, at these wavelengths, the incoming light collides with the metallic back-contact and is scattered due to the SPR effect. In this planar structure, similar to the proposed structure, due to the large dimensions of the structure (assuming the smooth surface as a fragment of a circle with an infinite radius), the SPR has no near-field effects and only has far-field scattering effects, which causes light to return to the absorbing layer. As a result, decreasing the HTL thickness increases the absorption in the planar structure. However, the light absorption in this structure is still much lower than that of the proposed structure. Therefore, one can conclude that the high absorption of the proposed structure, while affected by the reduction of the thickness of this layer, is mainly due to the light trapping mechanism and the use of PDMS on the cell surface.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Fabrication considerations of the proposed nanostructure of a PSC</title><p id="Par25">In the fabrication process, materials are not deposited with a perfectly smooth surface and uniform thickness throughout the cell, and depending on the type of fabrication process and the deposition conditions, they form differently.

In the first range, because of the higher energy of the photons, they are absorbed in the upper part of PSC and have no interaction with the lower layers of the perovskite. Therefore, the changes are due to the deformation of the ITO layer and the slight changes in the light path in each structure. In the second range of changes, the energy of the photons is low, so they penetrate more into the cell before being absorbed. As a result, the changes are due to the deformation of the metal contact, and the decrease in light trapping. Since in each structure, the curvature of the triangular part is reduced, the probability of light escaping from the cell, and being scattered by SPR towards the cell surface is increased as well. There is, thus, a slight decrease in the absorption of each FCCS in this range.

As a result, the electric field inside the absorbing layer becomes distributed, and the extraction of generated carriers becomes easy due to their proximity to the interfaces of both carrier transport layers. According to the figure, planar PSC is more efficient in collecting the carrier than the proposed structure and its FCCSs. It can be attributed to the distribution of the electric field inside the solar cell. As seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b,c, unlike the planar structure, in the proposed architecture, the distribution of the electric field in the active layer is not uniform. Consequently, the photo-generated carriers are in the specific sites of the active layer, and due to the angular configuration of the proposed structure, they must travel a longer path to reach the charge extraction layers. In other words, because of the light trapping mechanism of this PSC, the effective interface of the absorbing layer with the carrier transport layers at a constant unit cell width is reduced, making carrier collection difficult. On the other hand, collection efficiency improves to some extent by reducing the curvature of the triangular part in FCCSs. According to Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>a, among the proposed structure and its fabrication considered PSCs, the third FCCS has the best collecting characteristic. Again, this result can be attributed to the effective interface of layers and the carrier transport path. By reducing the curvature of the angular part of the cell, due to the proximity of their generated sites to the interfaces of the transport layers, the extraction of the produced carriers is facilitated. The fluctuating trends of the collection efficiency spectrum in the proposed structure and its FCCSs are also due to differences in the distribution of the electric field at each wavelength.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The normalized collection efficiency spectra, and (<bold>b</bold>) the current-voltage characteristics for the planar PSC, the proposed structure, and the three FCCSs.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2020_75630_Fig9_HTML.png" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par29">Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>b shows the characteristics of the current density in terms of voltage for a planar PSC, the proposed structure, and three FCCSs of a proposed PSC.

This indicates that if the proposed structure is fabricated, it would exhibit high effieincy even though it may not be identical to the design proposed structure. According to the Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, the J<sub>sc</sub> of the proposed structure is 22.45 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is increased by 28% compared to the planar structure. The V<sub>oc</sub> is also increased and reaches a value of 0.98 volts. The J<sub>sc</sub> of the FCCSs are also almost equal to the main nanostructured PSC, and in the worst case, has a value of 22.28 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for the second FCCS.

First, the light loss factors in the planar architecture of a PSC have been analyzed, and a nanostructured solar cell on a textured silicon substrate has been presented to reduce these losses. The results have shown that the use of PDMS instead of glass in the proposed structure reduces the reflection loss of the cell. Furthermore, the perovskite absorption due to the light trapping in the active layer, and the far-field scattering enhancement of SPR have been found to increase dramatically. The effects of reducing the HTL thickness on the perovskite absorption have been investigated, and the mechanism of SPR on the surface of the metallic back-contact has been determined. The possible formation of the presented PSC according to the fabrication process has also been considered, and the optical absorption in these nanostructures has been compared with that of the main structure. The perovskite absorption in these structures have been found to be not very different from the main structure, and the PSCs have shown significant efficiencies. In the final part of the research, the current-voltage characteristics of the main proposed structure and three FCCSs have been investigated. The findings have revealed that due to the increased absorption almost in the entire spectrum, and the improvement of carriers’ transportation, J<sub>sc</sub> and V<sub>oc</sub> increase significantly. As a result, the power conversion efficiency of the PSC was seen to increase from 13.86% to 18.29%. Based on the calculations, the PCE in the most different case of the FCCS compared to the main structure has been shown to have a value of 18.04%, which has still a notable efficiency improvement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par32">Since a solar cell is a photovoltaic device, its optical and electrical physics must be studied simultaneously.
