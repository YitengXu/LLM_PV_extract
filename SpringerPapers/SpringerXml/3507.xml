However, their temporal resolution has been limited by the storage-ring timing patterns and X-ray pulse width at synchrotron sources. Here we demonstrate that dynamic X-ray optics based on micro-electro-mechanical-system resonators can manipulate hard X-ray pulses on time scales down to 300 ps, comparable to the X-ray pulse width from typical synchrotron sources. This is achieved by timing the resonators with the storage ring to diffract X-ray pulses through the narrow Bragg peak of the single-crystalline material. Angular velocities exceeding 10<sup>7</sup> degrees s<sup>−1</sup> are reached while maintaining the maximum linear velocity well below the sonic speed and material breakdown limit. As the time scale of the devices shortens, the devices promise to spatially disperse the temporal width of X-rays, thus generating a temporal resolution below the pulse-width limit.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">It is desirable to improve spatiotemporal control of light generated by synchrotron user facilities or table-top X-ray sources.

Spatiotemporal X-ray probes with similar time resolution and spatial resolution—from picometers to mesoscopic scales—are essential to meeting this challenge. While X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) with a femtosecond pulse width are extremely effective in probing dynamics on ultrashort time scales, synchrotron-based X-ray sources are well suited for revealing the spatiotemporal evolution of mesoscopic details in materials. However, temporal resolution at synchrotron sources is generally limited by the X-ray pulse duration in the range of 10–100 s of picoseconds. Accessing shorter time scales, for example a few picoseconds, requires complex and costly modification of the storage ring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> at the expense of other source characteristics such as intensity and brightness.</p><p id="Par4">On the other hand, photonic devices based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technology have been implemented in a wide range of applications and scientific research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The ability to manipulate light dynamically in a compact package is highly desirable in many scientific and technological applications. In addition, favorable scaling laws for miniaturization result in capabilities not possible with macro-scale devices.

A thin, single-crystal silicon MEMS can diffract or transmit X-rays just by a change in its orientation relative to the incident X-ray beam (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). When the Bragg condition is fulfilled, the diffractive beam intensity as a function of the incident angle, <italic>θ</italic>, can be described by a rocking curve, illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, around the Bragg angle, <italic>θ</italic><sub>B</sub>. As the MEMS crystal rapidly oscillates in the vicinity of <italic>θ</italic><sub>B</sub>, a diffractive time window (DTW, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>) opens during that time period. There are three schemes for utilization of MEMS devices: First, when the DTW is wider than the individual synchrotron X-ray pulses, but narrower than the pulse interval, the MEMS device can be employed as an X-ray pulse-picking chopper, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>. Second, if the DTW is narrower than the X-ray pulse width (as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>), the MEMS device will generate X-ray pulses shorter than the incident pulses, which enables time-resolved experiments to be performed with a temporal resolution higher than that given by the incident pulse duration. Parenthetically,  this scheme also applies to continuous X-ray beams such as lab sources. Third, when the DTW is comparable to or slightly narrower than the width of the X-ray pulse (as seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>), an X-ray streaking theme can be envisioned, completely in the optical domain, without sacrificing the detection efficiency, a problem suffered by other photonic devices such as X-ray streak cameras<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The conversion from X-ray pulse in the time domain to a streaked signal in the spatial domain is illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>, where a high-resolution, position-sensitive detector accomplishes the conversion. This could lead to information in the single-pulse duration with sub-pulse temporal resolution. To make possible the applications of MEMS devices as dynamic X-ray optics, the MEMS DTW has to be sufficiently narrow. A high-frequency device is essential for pulse-picking, while a minimum DTW is more critical for pulse-slicing and streaking applications.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Manipulation of hard X-ray pulses using a microelectromechanical-system (MEMS)-based oscillator. <bold>a</bold> Schematic of a rapidly oscillating single-crystal micromirror in a torsional MEMS device that diffracts monochromatic X-rays at its Bragg angle. <bold>b</bold> Static crystal rocking curve around Bragg angle <italic>θ</italic><sub>B</sub> with a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of Δ<italic>θ</italic><sub>B</sub>, typically several milli-degrees. <bold>c</bold> Around the instance that the single-crystal element rotates through the Bragg angle, the crystal rocking curve converts to a temporally dispersed diffractive time window (DTW) with a FWHM of Δ<italic>t</italic><sub>w</sub>. <bold>d</bold> When the DTW width is much wider than the X-ray pulse, but narrower than the pulse-to-pulse spacing, the MEMS can be utilized as an ultrafast pulse-picking device. <bold>e</bold> When the DTW is narrower than the X-ray pulse, the device creates X-ray pulses shorter than the incident pulse width in a form of pulse slicing in the time domain. <bold>f</bold> Dispersion/streaking of the X-ray pulse is possible, when the MEMS DTW is close to the incoming pulse width. <bold>g</bold> In the dispersion/streaking mode using a position-sensitive detector (PSD), the  oscillating MEMS converts the X-ray pulse in the time domain to a spatially dispersed signal that contains time-resolved, sub-pulse information</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2019_9077_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par7">Since MEMS devices are based on single-crystal silicon (see Methods), X-ray diffraction occurs at the Bragg angle, <italic>θ</italic><sub>B</sub>, at which the incident X-rays satisfy the Bragg condition.

Since MEMS resonators with a quality factor (Q) exceeding 10<sup>3</sup> have an extremely narrow resonance bandwidth, it is virtually impossible for an as-fabricated MEMS device to have a resonant frequency that coincides with the storage-ring frequency. An asynchronous device cannot be an effective X-ray optics at a light source that produces periodic pulses. In order to tune the frequency of the MEMS devices to be commensurate with the frequency of the synchrotron ring, we developed a highly precise frequency trimming process based on focused ion beam (FIB) techniques (see Methods and Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The tuning process started with an as-fabricated MEMS with a resonance frequency of 65.8 kHz, about 2 kHz lower than the desired frequency of 67.889 kHz (one-fourth of the Advanced Photon Source [APS] operation frequency of P0 = 271.555 kHz).</p><p id="Par9">As can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, the MEMS device we used is a torsional oscillating silicon crystal that is 25 µm in thickness and 250 × 250 µm in area, actuated with in-plane comb-drive actuators. The sinusoidal oscillation of the silicon crystal is excited by a square-wave voltage signal with a frequency twice that of the resonant frequency of MEMS devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> at 135.777 kHz, or P0/2. Tuning the resonance frequency of the device was performed using the FIB tool to remove mass from the oscillating crystal, thus reducing its moment of inertia and increasing its resonance frequency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Removal of a 5 × 5 × 25-µm<sup>3</sup> volume of the crystal results in an 80-Hz increase in the driving frequency of applied excitation voltage. The tuning curves (shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> as a function of the driving frequency) have the characteristic waveform of a nonlinear resonator, with a sharp edge on the low-frequency side. The peak frequency of the tuning curves showed linear shifts with respect to removed volume at the outer edges of the silicon crystal (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). With careful calculations and control of the FIB micromachining, the frequency response of the device (at a 45-V driving voltage) was shifted to the range from 135.75 to 135.81 kHz, which overlaps with the desired frequency of 135.777 kHz or P0/2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Hence, after the tuning process, this group of MEMS are denoted as P0/2 devices. We also note here that the method of FIB fine-tuning, together with the design flexibility of MEMS devices, allows us to deploy them at different synchrotron facilities worldwide (see Methods).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Tuning the resonance frequency of a MEMS oscillator using focused ion beam (FIB). <bold>a</bold><bold>b</bold> Scanning electron microscopy images of the MEMS device as fabricated and after multiple rounds of FIB micromachining, respectively.

At all pressures, the relationship is simply linear in the measured range, but the 6.6-kPa data have a slope almost twice as much as the 100-kPa case.

The detail is described in Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> and we give only a brief account of the method here. When the MEMS resting angle (<italic>θ</italic><sub>0</sub>) with respect to the X-ray beam is set to the Bragg angle (<italic>θ</italic><sub>B</sub>), the diffracted pulse happens at time Δ<italic>τ</italic> = 0 (zero phase difference). If this angle is set to be slightly different from <italic>θ</italic><sub>B</sub>, the MEMS will diffract an X-ray pulse when the MEMS rotates to Δ<italic>θ</italic> = <italic>θ</italic><sub>0</sub> − <italic>θ</italic><sub>B</sub> and the pulse coincidentally strikes the MEMS at the time instance (Δ<italic>τ</italic> ≠ 0, or a non-zero phase difference). A fit of Δ<italic>θ</italic> vs Δ<italic>τ</italic> results in an accurate oscillation profile and amplitude even if only a small segment of data around Δ<italic>τ</italic> = 0 is collected. Since the device is frequency-matched to the storage-ring or the incoming X-ray pulses, the coincidence-mode only works efficiently when the X-rays are densely populated in the time domain, so the 324-bunch mode of the APS was used. As the MEMS amplitude increases, its DTW width decreases and the probability of coincidence between the MEMS device’s diffractive window and the incoming X-ray pulses decreases as well.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research is supported by the Accelerator and Detector Research (ADR) Program of the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science-Basic Energy Sciences.
