Previous experimental studies of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> optoelectronic devices, such as photodetectors and solar cells, are normally based on polycrystalline films. In this work, a high-performance planar-type photodetector fabricated on the (100) facet of a MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal is proposed. We demonstrate that MAPbI<sub>3</sub> photodetector based on single crystal can perform much better than that on polycrystalline-film counterpart. The low trap density of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal accounts for the higher carrier mobility and longer carrier diffusion length, resulted in a significant performance increasement of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> photodetector. Compared with similar planar-type photodetectors based on MAPbI<sub>3</sub> polycrystalline film, our MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal photodetector showed excellent performance with good stability and durability, broader response spectrum to near-infrared region, about 10<sup>2</sup> times higher responsivity and EQE and approximately 10<sup>3</sup> times faster response speed. These results may pave the way for exploiting high-performance perovskites photodetectors based on single crystal.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>13</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep16563.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>21</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep16563" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep16563</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Photodetectors which can convert light signals into electrical ones instantaneously have sparked wide interests because of their important applications, such as video imaging, optical communication, environmental monitoring and biomedical sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The recent discovery of solution-processed organometallic halide perovskites (MAPbX<sub>3</sub>, X = I, Br, Cl) provides promising routes for fabricating optoelectronic devices with low cost and high performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Among these organometallic halide perovskites, methylammonium lead triiodide (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) has been the spotlight owing to its appropriate direct band gap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, large absorption coefficient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, long-range balanced electron- and hole-transport lengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and high charge carrier mobilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Park and Graetzel reported the strong photocurrent multiplications of the MaPbI<sub>3</sub> which enables its application as a photodetector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Until now, several significant efforts to fabricate novel high-performance MAPbI<sub>3</sub> photodetectors, such as perovskite-graphene hybrid photodetector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, perovskite nanowires-based photodetectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and highly stable perovskite photodetector<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, etc. have been made. The performances of several recently reported pure MAPbI<sub>3</sub> based photodetectors are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>. It can be seen that photodetectors based on organometallic halide perovskite MAPbI<sub>3</sub> demonstrate the advantages of high-responsivity, high quantum efficiency and fast response speed at low driving voltage.</p><p>In general, these MAPbI<sub>3</sub>-based photodetectors can be classified into two structural types: planar-type and vertical-type. Xie <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> reported the first MAPbI<sub>3</sub> photodetector, which is a typical planar-type one. The MAPbI<sub>3</sub> polycrystalline film photodetector (MPFP) was found sensitive to a broadband response spectrum ranging from the ultraviolet light to entire visible light, showing a high photo-responsivity (R) of 3.49 A W<sup>−1</sup>, 0.0367 A W<sup>−1</sup> and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.19 × 10<sup>3</sup>%, 5.84% at 365 nm and 780 nm under a bias voltage of 3 V, respectively. Dong <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> demonstrated a vertical-type highly efficient photodetector based likewise on MAPbI<sub>3</sub> polycrystalline film, showing a broadband response spectrum that ranges from the 300 nm (UV) to 800 nm (NIR). The gain of their MAPbI<sub>3</sub> photodetectors was influenced by the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> layer thickness and achived the maximum when the thickness was between 360 and 410 nm. A very high responsivity of 242 A W<sup>−1</sup> at low bias (−1 V) was attained by this vertical-type photodetector. Compared with the planar-type photodetectors, the elaborate vertical-type devices require more patterning steps for fabrication. On account of the inevitable non-radiative defects iccured by these steps at the edges of the layers, the device performance will be detrimentally affected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, as a matter of fact, the vertical-type MPFPs could perform much better than the planar-type ones, demonstrating higher gain and quicker response. The reason, on the one hand, lies in the fact that the electrode spacing plays an important role in making these differences. As for planar-type MPFPs, the spacing is typically tens of micrometers long, while that of the vertical-type MPFPs is usually tens to hundreds of nanometers long. The lenghth of the former is influenced by the bridging-gap on the substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and that of the latter is determined by the film thickness. As a result, the electrons and holes in the planar-type devices have to move much longer than those in the vertical-type ones to the electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. On the other hand, numerous defects and extensive disorders in MAPbI<sub>3</sub> polycrystalline film antagonize the charge migration process. All the problems mentioned above hinder the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> photodetectors from ultilizing intrinsic properties to achieve the optimal performance, especially for planar-type devices.</p><p>To improve the performance of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> photodetectors, it is necessary to reduce the defect density by increasing the crystalline quality of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> film, or perhaps more directly, to fabricate photodetectors based on single crystals MAPbI<sub>3</sub>. Recently, single crystals of perovskites MAPbI<sub>3</sub> have shown remarkably low trap density and excellent charge transport properties. Shi <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> observed low trap-state density on the order of 10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>10</sup> per cubic centimeter and long charge carrier diffusion lengths exceeding 10 micrometers in MAPbX<sub>3</sub> single crystals. Dong <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> reported that the diffusion lengths in MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystals could exceed 175 μm under 1 sun illumination and exceed 3 mm under weak light for both electrons and holes, which far exceeds the value measured from polycrystalline MAPbI<sub>3</sub> films (typically smaller than 1 μm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. These results potentially suggest that the optoelectronic device based on single-crystalline perovskite could perform much better than that on the polycrystalline counterpart. Thus, remarkable performance improvement is expected in the planar-type perovskite photodetector regardless of the ten-micron-long electrode spacing. Additionally, degradation of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> has always been a notorious drawback for their real application in optoelectronic devices. The MAPbI<sub>3</sub> polycrystalline film device without modification usually wears off very quickly when exposed to ambient air<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Many efforts have been made to enhance the durability of perovskite polycrystalline film devices, such as the smart and simple way of spin-coating with a CYTOP layer on perovskite film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal may provide better stability, since it averts the prejudicial effects of grain boundaries and a large number of surface defects in polycrystalline film.</p><p>In this work we propose a planar-type photodetector fabricated on the (100) facet of an MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal. We demonstrate that MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal photodetector (MSCP) can perform much better than the devices based on polycrystalline film. Although it was fabricated as the simplest device without elaborate eletrode decoration, the MSCP demonstrated high responsivity of 953 A W<sup>−1</sup> and EQE of 2.22 × 10<sup>5</sup>% at 1 V applied voltage when illuminated with the weakest detectable 532 nm light of 2.12 nW cm<sup>−2</sup>. When exposed to a relative strong light at 1 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>, compared with the similar planar-type photodetector based on polycrystalline (R: 0.0197 A W<sup>−1</sup>, EQE: 4.59%), the MSCP showed about 100 times higher responsivity of 2.55 A W<sup>−1</sup> and EQE of 5.95 × 10<sup>2</sup>%. Additionally, the MSCP showed excellent performance with good stability and durability, broader response spectrum to near-infrared region and approximately three orders of magnitude faster response speed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Centimeter-sized MAPbI<sub>3</sub> bulk single crystals were grown via a bottom-seeded solution growth (BSSG) method. Seed crystals were first prepared according to Poglitsch and Weber’s method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. It was found that MAPbI<sub>3</sub> was quite easy to crystallize during the seeded growth process. Some deposits appeared in the bottom of the flask and tended to adhere to the surface of the growing seed during the cooling process. The formation of many nucleuses obviously antagonizes the growth of large bulk single crystal of MAPbI<sub>3</sub>. To eliminate such a negative effect, a platinum wire was utilized to fix and prop the seed crystal up to separate the seed crystal from contacting the bottom of the flask. A clean bulk single crystal was obtained after lowering the temperature of the growth solution from 373 K to 330 K over the course of 15 days. A MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal with the dimension of 12 mm × 12 mm × 7 mm is shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> with the oriented natural facets labelled. X-ray single crystal structural analyses were performed at room temperature and the space group was confirmed as I4/mcm (140), which was consistent with the report in 1987<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. For MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal, three-dimensional Pb-I links form the integral structural framework and the MA<sup>+</sup> ion is in a cage made by four PbI<sub>6</sub> octahedra. Details of structural description is presented in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supplementary material</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1–2</xref>). A comparison of XRD patterns of the rhombic and the parallelogram natural crystallographic facets of a MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal is presented in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>, where the calculated polycrystalline XRD pattern was provided as a reference. The inset in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> shows the detail when 2 theta is around 20 degree. The obvious difference between the two patterns is a direct guidance to identify the rhombic and the parallelogram natural crystallographic facets as (100) and (112) facets, respectively. Sharp and symmetric peak pattern of each facet indicates the good quality of the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal. As presented in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, the structural drawing of (100) facet of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystal suggests the modeled transporting tunnel for photo-generated electrons and holes. Optical properties were measured on a (100)-cut MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal plate with 1 mm in thickness (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). It was found that the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal presents a broad band absorption extending to 840 nm (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), implying potentiality of applying this material in near-infrared optoelectronic devices. For the semiconductor material, the optical absorption is closely related to the energy gap between the conduction and the valence band. Through first principle computation and experimental study, MAPbI<sub>3</sub> exhibits the optical features of a semiconductor with direct band gap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref> shows the transmission spectrum of as-prepared MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal plate at room temperature. The transmission intensity maintains high from 887 nm to 1200 nm and gradually decreases below 887 nm with a cut-off wavelength of 813 nm. As presented in the inset of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>, the optical band gap of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal was deduced through extrapolation method and calculated to be 1.48 eV, which is consistent with Tao and co-workers’ report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, but lower than 1.5 ~ 1.6 eV as reported previously in thin polycrystalline film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Remarkably, optical absorption characterization based on a single crystal clarifies the lower but more accurate band gap evaluation for MAPbI<sub>3</sub> material, eliminating the impacts of other factors such as grain boundaries, substrates and scaffolds. To conclude, MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal possesses a broader absorption band. Therefore, it is more advantageous to act as light-harvester or photodetector than polycrystalline film. In addition, Raman vibrational spectrum of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal in the low-frequency region at room temperature was collected and assigned (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Characterization of as-grown MAPbI<sub>3</sub> bulk single crystal.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Photograph of a MAPbI<sub>3</sub> bulk single crystal grown through the BSSG method.

To study the photo-electric convertibility of our device, I ∼ V curves under different illumination power were measured by using a 532 nm laser as the light source with the power densities varying from 0.11 to 3.22 mW cm<sup>−2</sup> (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). All measurements were performed in air at room temperature. The dark current was plotted as a reference, which was as low as 11 nA at 4 V bias. When exposed to light, the photocurrent increased dramatically. The I-V curves show a nonlinear and asymmetrical behavior, indicating that a Schottky contact between MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal and Au electrodes was formed. It is observed that the rising rate of photocurrent increases first and then decreases, implying that it may undergo a saturation effect of photocurrent with bias voltage increasing. This phenomenon may arise from the built-in electric fields effect.

Considering that the value of responsivity and EQE strongly depends on the applied voltage, light power and device structure, identical interdigitated Au-film electrodes was deposited on the surface of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> thin-film, structurally the same as MSCPs on (100) crystal facet, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figure S8</xref>. Furthermore, the irradiance power-dependent photoresponse characteristics, such as R and EQE values for both MSCP and MPFP were evaluated at a fixed 1 V bias, as shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>. One can see that both the R and EQE decreased as the irradiance increased, thus the highest values for R and EQE could be measured at the lowest detectable irradiance power. It is worth pointing out that for each device of MSCP and MPFP, the irradiance power densities were intentionally selected ranging from the lowest detectable value to about 10<sup>2</sup> mW cm<sup>−2</sup>. The MSCP was found to achieve better detection thresholds than MPFP. The lowest detectable irradiance power density was evaluated to be 2.12 nW cm<sup>−2</sup> for the former, under which the highest R value of 953 A W<sup>−1</sup> and and EQE of 2.22 × 10<sup>5</sup>% were ahieved. Below 120 nW cm<sup>−2</sup>, the photocurrent signal of MPFP could no longer be observed as it was covered by the noise and dark current. Therefore the highest R and EQE values for MPFP at 1 V voltage were calculated to be 0.28 A W<sup>−1</sup> and 64.64%, respectively. Moreover, under illumination with the same irradiance power density of 1 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>, the R values for MSCP and MPFP were estimated to be 2.55 A W<sup>−1</sup> and 0.0197 A W<sup>−1</sup>, while the corresponding EQE values were calculated to be 5.95 × 10<sup>2</sup>% and 4.59%, respectively. Clearly the results demonstrated that the responsivity and EQE for MSCP are more than two orders of magnitude higher than those of MPFP.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A comparison of irradiance power-dependent photoresponse characteristics, responsivity R (<bold>a</bold>) and external quantum efficiency EQE (<bold>b</bold>), for as-fabricated MSCP and MPFP.

Moreover, linear dynamic range (LDR, typically quoted in dB), another figure-of-merit for photodetectors, was evaluated for MSCP. As depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figure S10</xref>, under illumination at 532 nm, the LDR for our MSCP was calculated to be 76 dB.</p><p>Next, the spectral photoresponse was measured with a 300 W Xe lamp equipped with a manual monochromator. The MSCP shows a broadband detection characteristic from 275 nm to 790 nm, with a high R of around 10 A W<sup>−1</sup> and EQE of over 10<sup>3</sup>% even at a relatively low bias voltage of 1 V (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The corresponding irradiance power density (<italic>P</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>) at each measured wavelength were depicted in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figure S11</xref>. It is notable that the R and EQE of our MSCPs sustained high till the near-infrared wavelength of 790 nm, while that of MPFPs decreased sharply from 725 to 800 nm. These results indicate that MSCP possesses a broader spectral detectivity than MPFP. It should be noted that the characterization of R and EQE over 790 nm are not successful due to the limitation of the monochromator used. Nevertheless, a broadband detection cut-off towards 840 nm is expected, considering the absorption characteristics of the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). The MSCP presented a maximum EQE value of 1.55 × 10<sup>4</sup>% at 5 V with 375 nm 3 × 10<sup>−3</sup> mW cm<sup>−2</sup> irradiance and the corresponding responsivity was calculated to be 47.1 A W<sup>−1</sup>.

A peak photocurrent of 7.6 μA was achieved at 3 V bias, exhibiting a good photocurrent on/off ratio of 224. A fast response speed to light switch is much desired for the purpose of photodetector application. To further demonstrate the response speed of the MSCP, the high speed features of the device were measured by an optical chopper of 500 Hz under 0.79 mW cm<sup>−2</sup> illumination using a 532 nm laser (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>). Defined as the time taken from the initial photocurrent to 90% increase and decrease, the rise and decay times for our MSCP were calculated. The rise time was 74 μs after triggering and the decay time was 58 μs after irradiation terminated. Similarly, as a comparison, by utilizing a optical chopper of 33 Hz the rise and decay times for MPFP were measured to be 52 and 36 ms (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>), which were comparable to the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

Besides, it still kept a high photocurrent of 2.65 μA that only fell by 6% after 40 days’ storage, meaningfully revealing a good durability of the natural MSCP device without any modification. However, it’s also worth mentioning that kept in test situations (atmosphere with a relative humidity of about 45 per cent), the MPFP device wore off within a few days while the MSCP still worked for a much longer time.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Time-dependent photocurrent response of MSCP.</p><p>Photocurrent decay and rise at different voltages of 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 V with on-and-off light (532 nm, 1.75 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep16563_Fig5_HTML.jpg"/></fig><fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A comparison of transient photocurrent characteristics for as-fabricated MSCP and MPFP.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Transient photocurrent response for the MSCP with on-and-off light with a switching frequency of 500 Hz.

In the current study, we first revealed the much higher performance, based on single crystal, of the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> photodetector. It is crucial to understand the nature of the high-performance of the as-fabricated MSCP. It undergoes various photophysical processes and dynamic interplays in bare MAPbI<sub>3</sub> as the photoexcitation is triggered, such as absorption, generation of electron-hole pairs, charge transfer and recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Firstly, the specific crystal structure and electronic structure of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> provide appropriate chance for harvesting light while ensuring high efficiency. Bulk single crystal may play a better role in absorbing photons because it is much thicker than a thin-film. Once exposed to the illumination with a larger photoenergy than the band gap, MAPbI<sub>3</sub> absorbs photons to generate a large number of electron-hole pairs [hν → e<sup>−</sup> + h<sup>+</sup>]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. An applied voltage bias provides the local electric field for both MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal and its polycrystalline film counterpart, leading to separate the photogenerated electrons and holes and decrease the electron-hole recombination rates, which is of great importance for the high gain of the photodetector. After excitons dissociation, the electrons would migrate to the conduction band of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> and further to the cathode, while the holes would flow to the valence band and further to the anode. During the carrier migration process, the resistance of the transporting tunnels made a difference between in MAPbI<sub>3</sub> polycrystalline film and in MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal. For the former, numerous defects and extensive disorders impede the carrier migration and hinder the MAPbI<sub>3</sub> photodetectors from achieving the optimal performance. As to the latter, the low trap density, which was dramatically reduced by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, reasonably give rise to the higher carrier mobility and much longer carrier diffusion length. As a result, significant performance improvements were eventually acheived for the MSCP.</p><p>In summary, centimeter-sized MAPbI<sub>3</sub> bulk single crystals were successfully grown via the BSSG method. Optical characterization demonstrated excellent absorption in the visible region with an absorption cut-off edge towards 840 nm, which was broader than that of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> polycrystalline film. A planar-type photodetector was fabricated on the (100) facet of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystal for the first time. The lowest detectable irradiance power density for MSCP was evaluated to be 2.12 nW cm<sup>−2</sup>, under which the highest R value of 953 A W<sup>−1</sup> and and EQE of 2.22 × 10<sup>5</sup>% were ahieved. When exposed under 1 mW cm<sup>−2</sup> illumination of 532 nm, the R values for MSCP and MPFP were estimated to be 2.55 A W<sup>−1</sup> and 0.0197 A W<sup>−1</sup>, while the corresponding EQE values were calculated to be 5.95 × 10<sup>2</sup>% and 4.59%, respectively, demonstrating more than two orders of magnitude higher responsivity and EQE for MSCP. The transient photocurrent measurement showed MSCP had a very fast photoresponse rate. The rise time was 74 μs and the fall time was 58 μs, around three orders of magnitude faster than those measured in MPFP (52 ms for rise time and 36 ms for fall time in this work or about hundred ms according to the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>). After 40 days’ storage in a desiccator at room temperature without any modification, the MSCP device still kept a high photocurrent value of 2.65 μA that only fell by 6%. In addition, further enhancements of photodetector performance could be expected by improving the interface between the perovskites and electrodes. These results pave the way for exploiting high-performance perovskites photodetectors based on single crystal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Single Crystal Growth</title><p>Seed crystals were prepared according to Poglitsch and Weber’s method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. 5g lead(II) acetate trihydrate (99.5%, Sinoreagent) was dissolved in 20 ml hydroiodic acid (57 wt.% aqueous solution, ACROS ORGANICS) through an ultrasound treatment. 1.33 ml methylamine (40% w/w aqueous solution, Aladdin) was dissolved in 4 ml hydroiodic acid solution. The two solutions were heated to 373 K respectively. They were kept at that temperature for 2 hours and then they mixed. Small angular black crystals about 3 mm in size were obtained by cooling down the solution from 373 K gradually to 330 K for 5 days. These small crystals were drawn out of the solution above 320 K and served as seed crystals for the subsequent bulk single crystal growth.
