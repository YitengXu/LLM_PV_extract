As the most abundant and renewable energy source, solar energy can be utilized in the form of electricity through photovoltaics (PV) that are made of semiconductor materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Along with the development of PV materials, the energy conversion efficiency is approaching the theoretical level of 33.7%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, the toxicity and hard-to-recycle characteristic of PV materials raise concerns on environmental compatibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Biophotovoltaics (BPV) uses biological photosynthetic materials to convert solar energy into electricity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. BPV mainly comprises single species of photosynthetic microorganisms, such as cyanobacteria or eukaryotic microalgae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This means BPV is more environmentally compatible and potentially more cost-effective over semiconductor-based PV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. It is worth noting that BPV is also a carbon neutral energy production manner as no net carbon dioxide emission occurs during a BPV process. In addition, BPV systems can potentially operate continuously throughout day and night, as the organic compounds accumulated during the day through photosynthesis can be converted to electricity during the night<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the photocurrent generated in a BPV system can be used to drive the hydrogen fuel production at the cathode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Therefore, BPV offers a biological alternative for solar energy utilization.</p><p id="Par4">The BPV process can be divided into two stages, charging and discharging. During the charging stage, the solar photons are first absorbed by the photosystem and the excited electrons generated are stored in high-energy intermediates such as plastoquinol (PQH<sub>2</sub>), NADPH, or organic compounds resulted from carbon fixation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The captured electrons are then exported from the cell interior to the external electrical circuit, thus producing a current, which is the discharging stage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Hence, both photosynthetic capacity and exoelectrogenic activity are required for a BPV system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Conventional BPV systems were mainly developed by immobilizing photosynthetic cells to the anodes for direct extracellular electron transport (EET)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, or using exogenously added artificial electron mediators for indirect EET<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. However, the electron exchange processes between cells and electrodes are often hindered by the extremely weak capacity of EET in cyanobacteria or eukaryotic microalgae, and the poor knowledge of endogenous EET mechanism impedes its engineering for improvement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Most power outputs of the mediator-less BPV systems described to date have not exceeded a few mW·m<sup>−2</sup>, which is three orders of magnitude lower than the predicted theoretical maximum power output (7 W·m<sup>−2</sup>) of a BPV system working in ambient light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Although the addition of artificial mediators can facilitate electron transfer from photosynthetic cells to the anodes, these mediators do not selectively and maximally accept electrons from the photosynthetic electron transfer chain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, exogenous mediators are potentially toxic to cells and their addition also increases the cost of BPV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Therefore, the current BPV systems are far from practical applications.</p><p id="Par5">An efficient BPV system needs to be equipped with a highly efficient EET component. The common approach is to introduce an EET pathway into photosynthetic microorganisms, e.g., cyanobacteria, by genetic engineering. To date, no successful attempts have been reported, presumably due to the difficulty in membrane protein expression and translocation, and the poor efficiency in accurately assembling the multiple heme-containing proteins involved in EET pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Therefore, it is difficult to incorporate the exoelectrogenic activity into a photosynthetic microorganism. Based on the principle of division of labor, we put forward a general design in which the photosynthetic (or charging) and the exoelectrogenic (or discharging) processes of BPV were assigned to two different microorganisms, with the one responsible for the charging process, and another one responsible for the discharging process. Meanwhile, a highly efficient energy carrier for guiding electron transfer between the two microorganisms is necessary. Such a system may better guide electron delivery from the photosynthetic microorganism to the exoelectrogenic microorganism, thus creating a constrained electron flow from light to the energy carrier, then to electricity.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, a synthetic two-species microbial consortium is designed and constructed for electricity production from light based on the aforementioned concept. The microbial consortium consists of an engineered cyanobacterium and an engineered <italic>Shewanella</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> UTEX 2973, a fast growing cyanobacterium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, is selected as the charging unit. <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> MR-1, a model metal-reducing microorganism capable of converting organic compounds into electricity using its efficient EET capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, is selected as the discharging unit. <sc>d</sc>-lactate is selected as the energy carrier in this consortium-style BPV system, because <sc>d</sc>-lactate is the most favorable carbon source and energy provider of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> MR-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and can be produced from light and CO<sub>2</sub> by engineered cyanobacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The constructed <sc>d</sc>-lactate mediated cyanobacteria-<italic>Shewanella</italic> microbial consortium can produce relatively high-power electricity from light for over 40 days. Our study shows that redirecting the electron flow in a photosynthetic-exoelectrogenic microbial consortium can circumvent the weak exoelectrogenic activity of cyanobacteria, thus improve the efficiency and longevity of BPV.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic diagram of the BPV system based on a two-species microbial consortium with constrained electron flow.

M9 medium (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) supplemented with lactate was used as anodic electrolyte in the mono-culture of strain MR-1. We first experimentally confirmed that there was no cathodic limitation in our setups—increasing the concentration of cathodic electron acceptor, ferricyanide, over 50 mM has little effect on current density, nor does enlarging the size of cathode (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a, b</xref>). The decrease of current density in the later period was mainly due to the gradual consumption of lactate and the decrease of biofilm stability.</p><p id="Par8">To investigate the current production of strain MR-1 on two lactate isomers, 15 mM <sc>d</sc>-lactate, <sc>l</sc>-lactate, or <sc>dl</sc>-lactate were used as electron donors, respectively. The results showed that strain MR-1 can produce current on either isomer, whereby the current density on <sc>d</sc>-lactate was slightly higher than on <sc>l</sc>-lactate (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>). This was consistent with previous reports that strain MR-1 possesses <sc>d</sc>- and <sc>l</sc>-lactate dehydrogenases responsible for oxidizing lactate to pyruvate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, and it preferentially utilizes <sc>d</sc>-lactate for growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The maximum current density positively correlated with the concentration of <sc>d</sc>-lactate and reached saturation at a <sc>d</sc>-lactate concentration of 5 mM, and an evident current could be detected at a <sc>d</sc>-lactate concentration as low as 1 mM (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2b, c</xref>).

First, developing a suitable medium that satisfies the need of all members of a microbial consortium is necessary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We initially chose the cyanobacterial medium BG11 (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) as the candidate. However, strain MR-1 did not produce a current in BG11 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4a</xref>). We identified that buffer salts (Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) from M9 are essential to current production for strain MR-1 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5a</xref>). Buffer salts likely act on maintaining the pH and osmotic pressure, however there was still no current produced in BG11 upon addition of buffer salts (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5a</xref>). We further identified that two components from BG11, sodium nitrate and ammonium ferric citrate, severely inhibited the current production (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5b</xref>). Sodium nitrate and ammonium ferric citrate probably act as the competitive electron acceptors of strain MR-1. Further experiments confirmed that once sodium nitrate and ammonium ferric citrate were removed from BG11, and buffer salts were added simultaneously, a normal current was produced (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5c</xref>). For cyanobacteria, the removal of ammonium ferric citrate and the addition of buffer salts did not cause obvious growth defect (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6a</xref>). However, sodium nitrate is the sole nitrogen source in BG11 and could not be removed. Therefore, we determined to use a nitrate reductase (NapA) mutant (<italic>S. oneidensis-</italic>Δ<italic>napA</italic>), which lost the ability to reduce nitrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The <italic>napA</italic> deletion did not cause significant growth defect (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6b</xref>), but it relieved the nitrate inhibition (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5d</xref>). Thus, a modified medium suitable for two species was established, which was named MBG11 (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">We attempted to construct microbial consortium using MBG11. Unfortunately, the consortium did not produce a current under light (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4b</xref>). One possibility was that the electrons released from <italic>S. oneidensis</italic>-Δ<italic>napA</italic> would be snatched by oxygen evolved during photosynthesis. We indeed found the dissolved oxygen (DO) of the co-cultures under light was much higher than that in the dark (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7a</xref>). Moreover, the strain <italic>S. oneidensis</italic>-Δ<italic>napA</italic> is sensitive to light and cell death occurred after illumination for 24 h (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7b</xref>). Light-induced damage was also reflected in increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7c, d</xref>). To overcome these problems, we came up with the idea of developing the spatial-temporal separation organization for constructing the cyanobacteria-<italic>Shewanella</italic> consortium (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In temporal separation organization, the charging process (photosynthetic production of <sc>d</sc>-lactate) and discharging process were implemented sequentially under light and dark conditions, respectively, which enabled discharging to proceed in the oxygen-free and illumination-free environment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>).

For a synthetic microbial consortium, the robustness can be evaluated by its resistance to environmental fluctuations and susceptibility to perturbations caused by the variation of inoculated cell density. When the concentration of buffer salts was changed from 1/5 to 1/20 of those in M9, the CLS microbial consortium exhibited similarly high current densities (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Furthermore, after gradually reducing the inoculated cell density of strain <italic>S. oneidensis-</italic>Δ<italic>napA</italic> from an OD<sub>600</sub> of 2.0 to 0.01, the CLS microbial consortium maintained functional stability with the average current density remaining at 280 mA·m<sup>−2</sup> for at least 120 h (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>).

A typical redox peak of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> biofilm starting from around −0.4 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) appeared in the CV curves and the CLS microbial consortium produced the highest catalytic current (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). Polarization curves, obtained from linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), were used to characterize the internal resistance and maximum current density of the corresponding systems. The results showed that the dropping slope of the polarization curve obtained from the CLS microbial consortium was the smallest in comparison with the other systems, indicating less internal resistance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). Moreover, the maximum current density of the CLS microbial consortium was close to 1400 mA·m<sup>−2</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). This significant increase on current density at low voltages can be explained from two aspects. On one hand, the electron donor was adequate in the CLS microbial consortium and the cyanobacteria surrounding the biofilm of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> could produce more <sc>d</sc>-lactate. Thus, the typical diffusion limitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> of electron donor might not exist in the CLS microbial consortium even at low voltages.

Therefore, we speculated the electron transfer process in the CLS microbial consortium would change from the typical diffusional controlled mode to the kinetic controlled mode at low voltages, which would lead to a significant increase on current density. Power curves, derived from the polarization curves, showed the highest power density of 150 mW·m<sup>−2</sup> for the CLS microbial consortium (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>).

Perhaps this is because the cyanobacterial cells were no longer producing <sc>d</sc>-lactate, which could be ascribed to the deficiency of minimal nutrients.</p><p id="Par19">To test this hypothesis, we developed a spatially temporally separated CLS microbial consortium through replenishing the minimal nutrient for cyanobacteria in the dual-chamber device (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14f</xref>).

The cyanobacterial culture was then delivered into the anodic chamber which containing <italic>S. oneidensis-</italic>Δ<italic>napA</italic>, at the same flow rate, for building the microbial consortium and producing current. Meanwhile, the anodic electrolyte was also flowed out from the anodic chamber at the same flow rate. The charging process occurred in the cyanobacterial bottle and the discharging process occurred in the anodic chamber, which constitute a spatial-temporal separation setup.

Interestingly, the current production was gradually restored and the current density was maintained at a high level of ~380 mA·m<sup>−2</sup> for over 20 days, stably (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). It is likely that when LB addition decreased from 5 to 1%, the steady state of biofilm of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> was disturbed and the biofilm needed to be reconstructed so as to reach a newly established steady state. This process lasted for seven days, and the profile is similar to that of the process at the initial stage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, 0–3rd days), during which the current density increased continuously along with the gradual formation of the biofilm. A further experiment confirmed that 1% LB addition, rather than 5 or 0%, could maintain the cell density of <italic>S. oneidensis</italic> at a stable level, thereby stabilizing the current production at a higher level (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12a, b</xref>). The results showed when LB addition was 5%, the current density first increased then started to continuously decline, whereas when LB addition was 1%, the current density continuously increased (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12a</xref>). This feature can help us to better understand the continuous increase of current density during the 13–20th days in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> when the LB addition was decreased from 5 to 1%.

The selection of a specific energy carrier for this consortium, <sc>d</sc>-lactate, effectively enhanced the electron flow from photosynthetic microorganism to exoelectrogenic microorganism, and ultimately the electrons were collected by electrode for current production.

We also confirmed that a common electron mediator, potassium ferricyanide, is sensitive to white light and would be decomposed to Fe(OH)<sub>3</sub> and KCN, once exposed to full spectrum fluorescent lamps (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Under the same illumination condition, the cyanobacterial cells died after 3 days when grown with ferricyanide even at a low concentration of 1 mM, which probably due to the toxicity of the decomposed product KCN of ferricyanide (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13b</xref>). Previous BPV studies did not specifically describe this phenomenon, which is probably due to the short operating time under illumination conditions, or the use of monochromatic light which is less energetic compared with the one used in our study. Some other reports also mentioned the exogenous electron mediators used in BPV are harmful for microorganisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par23">The lifespan is equally important to the power density of a BPV system. However, the long-term operation was omitted in most BPV systems (Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">1</xref>). To date, only a few systems could maintain more than 10 days at an extremely low power density (&lt;0.2 mW·m<sup>−2</sup>). A miniaturized biological solar cell was developed via creating a 3-D conductive anode and configuring with gas-permeable microfluidic system. This allowed the current production sustain for about 20 days with a light/dark cycle (average power density was about 120 mW·m<sup>−2</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Our system could maintain a more steady current production for over 40 days at a power density of 135 mW·m<sup>−2</sup>, on average. This high longevity was achieved through the continuous supply of inorganic nutrients, which ensured the continuous production of energy carrier, <sc>d</sc>-lactate, from photons. Two types of BPV were developed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. They either relied on suspending photosynthetic cells in solution supplemented with artificial mediators, or relied on immobilizing cells to the anodes. Neither of these conditions is beneficial for the growth and metabolism of photosynthetic microorganisms, which might prevent its long-term operation. In our system, the photosynthetic microorganism was cultured in a suitable medium, in a planktonic form, without addition of potentially toxic artificial mediator. The photosynthetic microorganism may well in an active status, which might be one of the key reasons contributed to the observed longevity. In addition, different from the previously observed long-term current production achieved in a microscale device (90 μL) which relied on biofilm formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, our system is based on a large suspension (140 mL) of microorganisms. The fact that such a steady and longevous current production was achieved in a 100-mL scale system demonstrates BPV has the potential to stably supply electricity in a larger scale and a wider space.</p><p id="Par24">The interactions between members of microbial consortia rely on chemical communication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Therefore, engineering chemical communication becomes particularly important for designing a synthetic microbial consortium. In this study, <sc>d</sc>-lactate was rationally chosen as an efficient energy carrier, which is responsible for chemical communication and unidirectional energy transfer between cyanobacteria and <italic>Shewanella</italic>. The engineered strain <italic>Syn</italic>2973-<italic>omcS</italic>-<italic>ldh</italic>, which was selected as the light-harvesting microorganism, produced a relatively high yield of <sc>d</sc>-lactate. According to the calculation of energy allocation, 10.3% of total fixed light energy was shunted into <sc>d</sc>-lactate used for current production (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>)<sc>. d</sc>-lactate can easily be metabolized to form NADH by <italic>S. oneidensis</italic>, and the released electrons can be transferred outward into the anode with a high efficiency of about 70% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Hence, a constrained electron flow (photons → NADPH/ATP → <sc>d</sc>-lactate → NADH → electricity) was established in our system. This constrained electron flow dramatically improved the performance of two-species BPV relative to a low power output in the <sc>d</sc>-lactate-free system (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Therefore, the defined microbial species and constrained electron flow jointly contribute to the efficient and longevous power output of this photosynthetic-exoelectrogenic microbial consortium. Compared with single species of cyanobacteria with low EET efficiency, more electrons generated through water photolysis were ultimately exported from photosynthetic cells to the anode in the CLS microbial consortium (Figs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Based on relatively clear electron flow towards anode, our system holds the potential for further improvement on power density and longevity. From the perspective of microbial community engineering, developing a programmed regulatory circuit for microorganisms to control their behaviors, for instance, charging in the day and discharging only in the night, provide opportunities for tighter control between the members of microbial consortium for intelligent power output<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Electron flow comparison of two different types of BPV.
