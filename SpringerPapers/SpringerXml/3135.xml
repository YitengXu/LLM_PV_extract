paper investigates the potential for consumer-facing innovations to contribute emission reductions for limiting warming to 1.5 °C. First, we show that global integrated assessment models which characterise transformation pathways consistent with 1.5 °C mitigation are limited in their ability to analyse the emergence of novelty in energy end-use. Second, we introduce concepts of disruptive innovation which can be usefully applied to the challenge of 1.5 °C mitigation. Disruptive <italic>low-carbon</italic> innovations offer novel value propositions to consumers and can transform markets for energy-related goods and services while reducing emissions. Third, we identify 99 potentially disruptive low-carbon innovations relating to mobility, food, buildings and cities, and energy supply and distribution. Examples at the fringes of current markets include car clubs, mobility-as-a-service, prefabricated high-efficiency retrofits, internet of things, and urban farming. Each of these offers an alternative to mainstream consumer practices. Fourth, we assess the potential emission reductions from subsets of these disruptive low-carbon innovations using two methods: a survey eliciting experts’ perceptions and a quantitative scaling-up of evidence from early-adopting niches to matched segments of the UK population. We conclude that disruptive low-carbon innovations which appeal to consumers can help efforts to limit warming to 1.5 °C.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Transformation pathways for 1.5 °C mitigation</title><p id="Par4">The Paris Agreement on climate change stated an objective of ‘Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C’ (Article 2). The Paris Agreement was ratified and came into force in November 2016. To limit warming to 1.5 °C, global greenhouse gas emissions must reduce to net zero around mid-century, with residual emissions thereafter being more than offset by sinks or negative emission technologies (Rogelj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2015</xref>). This requires a very rapid and pervasive transformation of the global energy system.</p><p id="Par5">Transformation pathways to achieve the 2 °C target or the more stringent 1.5 °C ambition of the Paris Agreement are quantified in detail by global integrated assessment models. Process-based integrated assessment models (hereafter ‘IAMs’) represent in some detail the key biophysical and socioeconomic processes in economic, energy, agricultural, forestry and other systems, as well as the impact of resulting emissions on the climate system (Sathaye and Shukla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2013</xref>). Global IAMs are commonly run over the remaining 80+ years of the twenty-first century to quantify cumulative long-term emissions and resulting warming outcomes. Consequently, IAMs provide a unique analytical bridge between global mean temperature rise, cumulative emission budgets, and detailed representations of energy-system transformation. In this way, they enable technology, cost and policy assessments of transformation pathways consistent with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.</p><p id="Par6">The Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) synthesised evidence from 116 transformation pathways for limiting warming to 2 °C quantified by over 10 global IAMs (Clarke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2014</xref>). Several ‘robust’ features of these pathways were consistently identified by the IAMs as integral to a 2 °C future: (1) The energy supply rapidly decarbonises, including large-scale deployment of biomass with carbon capture and storage (bioCCS) as a negative emission technology; (2) energy end-use rapidly and pervasively electrifies, and economies continue to become ever-more efficient; and (3) delaying concerted global action increases costs and increases the difficulty of meeting the 2 °C target.</p><p id="Par7">Two global IAM studies published recently have generated transformation pathways consistent with the even more restrictive 1.5 °C emissions budget (Rogelj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2015</xref>; Luderer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2016</xref>). Additional insights on 1.5 °C mitigation beyond the robust findings on 2 °C mitigation can be summarised as: ‘harder and faster’. Particular emphasis is placed on energy end-use: ‘Demand-side emissions account for most of the additional mitigation efforts for reaching the 1.5°C limit relative to 2°C pathways ... [because] in 2°C scenarios, freely emitting fossil installations are already almost fully eliminated from the power system by mid-century’ (p19–20, Luderer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">Reducing demand-side emissions combines four effects: (1) improving conversion efficiencies of end-use technologies, (2) reducing losses from passive systems (particularly heat loss in buildings), (iii) reducing activity levels (e.g. passenger-kilometres of mobility, m<sup>2</sup> of heated floorspace), and (4) changing the structure or mix of activities towards less energy-intensive alternatives (e.g. from driving private vehicles to cycling and walking).</p><p id="Par9">Global IAMs privilege mitigation from technical efficiency improvements (Table 17.11 in Riahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2012</xref>; p29 in Luderer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2016</xref>). Explicit representation of end-use technologies and their passive systems in IAMs is generally quite coarse—and necessarily so for parsimonious and tractable models trying to capture the entire global energy system. End-use technologies are smaller in scale, orders of magnitude larger in number, more dispersed, and highly heterogeneous compared with the pits, pipelines and power plants of the energy supply (Wilson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2012</xref>). Many end-use technologies are also consumer goods with a variety of attributes over which end-user preferences vary (Mundaca et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2010</xref>). Energy efficiency may be traded off against style, speed, safety, size and status. These ‘behavioural’ characteristics of end-use technology adoption pose problems for modellers needing reduced form and context-independent expressions of cause and effect. Consequently, changes in energy end-use in global IAMs tend to be captured at the aggregated sectoral level as a function of changing incomes and prices (Bauer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">As a result, IAMs are neither designed to explore nor are useful for exploring the emergence of <italic>novelty</italic> in energy end-use. A backward look to 1930 tells us that it is not science fiction to imagine that portfolios of mitigation options in 2100 may look very different from those available today. Yet, peering through an IAM lens into a distant 2100 world in which warming has been limited to 1.5 °C, we see short-distance mobility is still by car, buildings still need heating and cooling, and food is still grown extensively using land. Consequently, scenario modelling tells us more about the preoccupations, beliefs and uncertainties of the present than about the possibilities of the future (Kramer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">Transformation pathways consistent with 1.5 to 2 °C mitigation rely heavily on the widespread diffusion of technologies which are currently available and already deployed in the market at scale (upper half of Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). These are ready substitutes for existing carbon-emitting or inefficient technologies: wind and solar power for unabated fossil power; electric and biofuel vehicles for the internal combustion engine; and energy-efficient buildings, appliances, lights and industrial processes for inefficient current practices. The striking anomaly is bioCCS, a pre-commercial mitigation option whose negative emissions are necessary to offset hard-to-decarbonise activity in industrial, agricultural and international freight sectors (UNEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2017</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Commercial maturity of mitigation options in global IAMs and disruptive low-carbon innovations.

Coloured bands in lower half of figure show commercial maturity of potentially disruptive consumer-facing low-carbon innovations (see text for details). Left-to-right scale at top of figure overlays the technology readiness level (TRL) framework used to assess the commercial maturity of new technologies (EC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017</xref>) onto a simple staged model of the technology lifecycle from basic research to diffusion (Wilson and Grubler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2014</xref>).

Before presenting our methods and findings, we first explain our use of ‘disruptive low-carbon innovation’ (DLCI) as an analytical framework for identifying consumer-facing innovations with the potential to reduce emissions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Analytical framework: disruptive low-carbon innovations (DLCIs)</title><p id="Par17">‘Disruptive innovation’ provides a useful framing for how consumers can reshape the way firms and markets provide goods and services. The term originates in Clayton Christensen’s 1997 book, ‘The Innovator’s Dilemma’ (Christensen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1997</xref>). This has since been described as one of the top six most influential business books ever written (The Economist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2011</xref>). According to Christensen, disruptive innovations are remarkable for being uncompetitive on conventional attributes of price, reliability and performance valued by mainstream consumers. Rather, they offer potential adopters a wholly new set of attributes. If successful, they effectively create a new market with a new set of demands and preferences. In the process, they disrupt the business models of incumbent firms. Christensen uses the microcomputer disrupting the mainframe computing industry in the late 1970s as a canonical example. Mainframe users valued processing speed, storage capacity, cost per MB, reliability. Microcomputers performed poorly on all these attributes. But, the novelty of the microcomputer’s portability, versatility and low unit cost enfranchised a whole new market segment—individuals, households and small firms (Christensen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1997</xref>). The resulting transformative effect is history.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref></p><p id="Par19">There are many other elements of Christensen’s disruptive innovation theory and its subsequent interpretation and application (Christensen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1997</xref>; Govindarajan and Kopalle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2006</xref>; Lambert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2014</xref>). In this article, we are interested specifically in the emphasis placed on novel attributes offering distinctive value propositions to consumers. These value propositions typically combine both technological and business model innovations, and encompass both low-end and high-end goods and services as well as both low-tech and high-tech sources of novelty (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Characteristics of disruptive low-carbon innovations. ✔✔ = strongly emphasised; ✔ = emphasised; – = not emphasised.

Disruptive <italic>low-carbon</italic> innovations (DLCIs) therefore combine an emphasis on private benefits for consumers (novel attributes and value) with social benefits or public goods (lower emissions) (Wilson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2018</xref>). This public-goods characteristic is an important distinction from usual applications of disruptive innovation. It points to the supporting role of public policy or other mechanisms for incentivising low-carbon innovation among private firms. It also shifts the object of disruption from incumbent firms and markets to the high-carbon practices and their associated service providers in mainstream markets (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par22">In sum, for the purposes of this article, disruptive low-carbon innovations (DLCIs) are defined as follows:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par23"><italic>Technological and business model innovations which offer novel value propositions to consumers and which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions if adopted at scale.</italic></p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p id="Par24">We use three main methods to answer our two research questions.

Exponential cost reductions show few signs of saturating in small-scale, low unit cost, modular technologies from PV panels and batteries to chips and sensors (Farmer and Lafond <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2016</xref>). Digital-enabling of peer-to-peer and other sharing-economy platforms are raising ‘usership’ as an alternative to single-purpose ownership (Frenken <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017</xref>). Traditionally centralised energy infrastructures and utility service providers are being eroded away at the edges (Fares and Webber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>). Transportation and electricity systems are also converging as electrons and bits are entering the historical realm of hydrocarbons (Freeman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2017</xref>). Passive energy consumers are diversifying into multifarious roles of producer, citizen, activist, designer, community member and advocate (Schot et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2016</xref>). These trends towards more digital, granular, use-based models of energy-service provision are opening up new value propositions for consumers with potential benefits for emission reductions.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Mobility</title><p id="Par55">Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows the consumer-facing DLCIs identified as relating to mobility, grouped into four broad types: <italic>alternative fuel or vehicle technologies</italic> displacing the internal combustion engine (ICE), <italic>alternative forms of auto-mobility</italic> displacing private car ownership and use, <italic>alternatives to auto-mobility</italic> displacing car use, and <italic>reduced demand for mobility</italic>.

It summarises only those identified in the literature survey which are consistent with our definition of DLCIs in offering novel value propositions to consumers. Some consumer-facing innovations are excluded because either they are not novel or they compete on already-valued mainstream attributes including price, efficiency and reliability (e.g. fuel-efficient cars). There are also a whole host of non-consumer-facing strategies which rely more directly on regulation (e.g. fuel taxes), infrastructure (e.g. cycle highways) or planning (e.g. car-free communities). Some of these are captured in Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">SI</xref>-1 (online Supporting Information).</p><p id="Par57">The impact of potential DLCIs on energy end-use and so emissions depends on the emission profile of the incumbent good or service being displaced. Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> links each potential DLCI with the higher-carbon incumbent which currently dominates mainstream consumption. This is indicative only; what DLCIs actually displace will vary by context and adopter segment. As an example, alternative forms of auto-mobility may displace private car ownership and use, or may substitute for public transport and active modes (Sprei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2018</xref>). Displacement of incumbents is therefore set against a dynamic and variegated background of changing technologies, users and markets, which are themselves potentially shaped by disruptive innovation (McDowall <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2018</xref>; Tyfield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par58">Each potential DLCI identified varies in the novel attributes of potential appeal to consumers. Some are goods with high investment costs; others are use-based services.

So too do <italic>alternatives to auto-mobility</italic> such as mobility-as-a-service. These potential DLCIs offer novel value propositions based around service consumption (or usership), pay-per-use, choice variety, flexibility and freedom from maintenance and care responsibilities (Prettenhaler and Steininger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1999</xref>). In contrast <italic>alternative vehicle technologies</italic> sustain the incumbent model of auto-mobility but with lower emissions. Apart from being cleaner, the novel attributes for consumers are less clear. As an example, biofuel vehicles are a broadly like-for-like substitute for ICE vehicles in terms of their driving, maintenance and functional characteristics (Ribeiro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2012</xref>). However, both biofuel, fuel cell and electric vehicles—while reinforcing prevailing norms on private car ownership and use—offer low or zero emission alternatives to ICEs, while also being consistent with green identity and associated status signalling (Axsen and Kurani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Food</title><p id="Par59">Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> shows the consumer-facing DLCIs related to food identified by the literature search, together with the mainstream higher-carbon practice they typically displace (which determines their potential impact on emissions).

First, many innovations considered by experts to be highly disruptive are either dependent on technological advances (e.g. internet of things, smart grids, vertical farming) or do not appear to offer novel attributes valued by end users (e.g. artificially-lit greenhouse agriculture, large-scale grid storage). Potential DLCIs for buildings in particular are strongly technological (and weakest in terms of business model innovation). One interpretation is that changes in energy end-use are most strongly constrained in buildings and cities by long-lived existing infrastructures.</p><p id="Par80">Second, various highly-scored potential DLCIs appear dependent on behavioural change, without a clear link to technological or business model innovation. This is most strongly the case for food (e.g. reduced food waste, reduced meat in diet). However, as noted earlier, digital technologies are opening up opportunities for new business models to facilitate innovation in this area.</p><p id="Par81">Third, potential emission reductions are contingent on the innovations being adopted at scale in the market, so should implicitly account for both the size of potential market demand and the incumbent good or service being displaced. The relative scorings of potential DLCIs in the Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> plots seem more influenced by proximity to market and current market size than longer-term transformative potentials. As an example, autonomous vehicles are scored much lower in potential emission impact than electric vehicles even though autonomous vehicle studies generally assume electrification (Arbib and Seba <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2017</xref>). However, it is not possible to infer reliably the extent to which respondents were accounting for displaced goods or services when scoring particular DLCIs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Quantification of emission-reduction potentials</title><p id="Par82">Results from the expert survey are consistent with the literature in identifying emission-reduction potentials from DLCIs. Quantitative estimates of the magnitude of these emission reductions need to account for both market growth potential and the displacement of higher-carbon incumbents. We developed and applied a standardised methodology to quantify potential emission reductions from a sample of DLCIs using the UK as a case study. We relied to the extent possible on actual observations of energy or emission reductions among early adopters. We then scaled up this evidence base to the UK population based on matched sample characteristics.</p><p id="Par83">Taking urban farming as an example, we identified a community farm in Sutton (an urban district in London) as an early adopter. A detailed lifecycle analysis quantified emission reductions from the farm’s produce at 34 tCO<sub>2</sub>e per hectare per year, accounting for both displaced high-input agriculture and avoided food miles (Kulak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2013</xref>). Two hundred ninety-five urban districts in the UK have equivalent or lower population density to Sutton (ONS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2015</xref>) so could potentially site comparable community farms. Assuming similar types and quantities of annual produce, this yields potential emission reductions of 2.1 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e per year from scaling-up Sutton’s precedent to the UK as a whole.

The main assumption is that the DLCIs scale up from existing early-adopting niches to the UK as a whole, but only within the population segments matched to early adopters. This is a conservative assumption. There is strong evidence from diffusion research that later-adopting population segments are initially risk averse but become more attracted to innovations as they learn from the experience of early adopters (Rogers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2003</xref>).

Disruptive <italic>low-carbon</italic> innovations (DLCIs) represent an underexplored dimension of 1.5 °C mitigation pathways which require ever-greater emphasis on demand-side emission reductions (Rogelj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2015</xref>; Luderer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par93">This paper presents an initial analysis of consumer-facing DLCIs and their potential to reduce emissions.

Some of these DLCIs are built on business model innovations (e.g. car clubs, energy service companies); others rely on technological breakthroughs (e.g. cultured meat, autonomous vehicles). Many potential DLCIs combine traditional energy-using hardware with digital platforms or controls (e.g. peer-to-peer electricity trading from domestic PV with battery storage).</p><p id="Par95">In general, the DLCIs identified are more distributed, accessible, small-scale, shareable, and extendable or replicable at low marginal cost relative to the incumbents they displace. In other words, DLCIs tend to offer user-scaled alternatives to large-scale, infrastructure-dependent, centrally provided goods and services. In a low-carbon context, this points towards a ‘granular’ distributed energy transformation involving end-users in multiple domains and services from heating and eating to moving and making.</p><p id="Par96">The appeal of DLCIs to consumers is centred around novel attributes. The attractiveness of these attributes will help determine the speed of diffusion into niche and then mainstream markets. Consumer preferences are likely to vary strongly between adopter segments, whereas early adopters may be price-insensitive and attracted to new functionality, identity signalling or status distinctions, and more mainstream consumers are typically concerned with price, reliability and compatibility (Rogers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2003</xref>). Diffusion out of early-adopting niches is far from certain.</p><p id="Par97">Yet, this diffusion is a determinant of the relevance of DLCIs for 1.5 °C mitigation. We asked (Q2): what is the magnitude of potential emission reductions from the widespread adoption of low-carbon innovations by consumers?</p><p id="Par98">Actual emission reductions from DLCI adoption depend on what is being displaced. As by definition, DLCIs are not yet mainstream, and careful in situ studies of early-adopting niches are needed to quantify changes in behaviour, energy use and resulting emissions. These should account for both the socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics of the adopters, contextual conditions shaping adoption (e.g. policies, infrastructures, incentives), as well as any observed rebound effects. As examples, car sharing may substitute for car ownership and use, or may complement it as a flexible ‘second car’ option; mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) may move people onto public transit by weaving seamless intermodal connections or may result in taxis substituting for active travel modes for the final legs of journeys (Sprei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par99">In the absence of robust evidence from market behaviour, we drew on expert perceptions, innovation-specific quantifications, and literature review to characterise emission-reduction potentials. These potentials are contingent on DLCIs displacing carbon-intensive modes of energy-service provision ranging from private car ownership and use, large-scale food production and distribution, inefficient building design and performance, and centralised energy-supply networks.</p><p id="Par100">As well as directly reducing emissions by displacing higher-carbon practices, DLCIs also have an indirect effect. Disruptive innovations are typically brought to market by new entrants who challenge mainstream service providers. The political economic power and vested interests of incumbent firms, particularly those with interests in fossil fuels, are considered a major source of stability or ‘carbon lock-in’ in current systems (Unruh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2000</xref>; Seto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2016</xref>). Consumers attracted to DLCIs can undermine the business models on which this stability rests. This is already evident in the ‘edge-of-the-grid’ threats to conventional energy utilities from decentralised energy resources (Wainstein and Bumpus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2016</xref>). Incumbent firms may of course co-opt or adapt to disruptive threats. But, these defensive responses presage wider system transformation. This is an important area for further research. Whether it is appropriate or relevant to view this transformative potential through the lens of discrete innovations is open to debate. This debate is clearly evidenced by 10 contrasting perspectives on ‘Disruptive Innovation and Energy Transformation’ in a recent Special Issue (Geels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>; Wilson and Tyfield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par101">Limiting warming to 1.5 °C requires concerted innovation throughout the global system of producing, distributing and using energy (Grubler and Wilson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2014</xref>). Consumers and consumption are commonly framed as part of the problem. Consumption is energy (and material) intensive and expands in lockstep with income (Sorrell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2015</xref>). Consumers are addicted and profligate (Costanza et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>). Yet, consumption also has transformative potential. Disruptive innovation is a lens through which to examine this transformative potential of novel goods and services. Disruptive low-carbon innovations (DLCIs) combine business models and technologies to create appealing value propositions for consumers. This can engage consumers in efforts to reduce emissions. DLCIs are therefore an important lens through which to examine 1.5 °C mitigation. They focus attention on consumers as possible agents of transformative change both directly by displacing carbon-intensive goods and services, and indirectly by dislodging incumbent firms.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by ERC Starting Grant no. 678799 for the SILCI project (Social Influence and Disruptive Low Carbon Innovation).

This has since been challenged by a ‘Silicon Valley’ argument that disruption can and does <italic>also</italic> come from above (Arbib and Seba <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2017</xref>). High-end and typically high-tech products with more capabilities and functionality than mainstream alternatives appeal initially to a price-insensitive or technophile market niche (Seba <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2014</xref>). But, exponentially declining costs and exponentially improving performance mean that these high-end products rapidly outcompete incumbents and move mainstream. It is important to note that including high-tech products blurs the distinction between Christensen’s emphasis on <italic>disruptive</italic> innovations whose challenge is primarily one of finding markets and users, and the more familiar dichotomy in the innovation literature between <italic>radical</italic> and <italic>incremental</italic> innovations which describes the extent of technological advancement or breakthrough (Wilson and Grubler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2014</xref>).</p></fn></fn-group></back></article></records><facets><facet name="subject"><facet-value count="1">Energy</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Energy Efficiency</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Energy Policy, Economics and Management</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Environment, general</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Environmental Economics</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Renewable and Green Energy</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Sustainable Development</facet-value></facet><facet name="keyword"><facet-value count="1">Consumers</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Energy end-use</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Innovation</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Mitigation</facet-value></facet><facet name="pub"><facet-value count="1">Energy Efficiency</facet-value></facet><facet name="year"><facet-value count="1">2019</facet-value></facet><facet name="country"><facet-value count="1">Austria</facet-value><facet-value count="1">United Kingdom</facet-value></facet><facet name="type"><facet-value count="1">Journal</facet-value></facet></facets></response>
