After the synthesis of QDs, separating QDs from unreacted impurities in large scale is one of the biggest issues to achieve scalable and high performance optoelectronic applications. Thus far, however, continuous purification method, which is essential for mass production, has rarely been reported. In this study, we developed a new continuous purification process that is suitable to the mass production of high-quality QDs. As-synthesized QDs are driven by electrophoresis in a flow channel and captured by porous electrodes and finally separated from the unreacted impurities. Nuclear magnetic resonance and ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared absorption spectroscopic data clearly showed that the impurities were efficiently removed from QDs with the purification yield, defined as the ratio of the mass of purified QDs to that of QDs in the crude solution, up to 87%. Also, we could successfully predict the purification yield depending on purification conditions with a simple theoretical model. The proposed large-scale purification process could be an important cornerstone for the mass production and industrial use of high-quality QDs.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>7223</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>27</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep43581.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep43581" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep43581</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have gained immense attention because of their potentials in many applications such as displays, lighting, bio-imaging, photocatalysis, and photovoltaics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. QDs are typically synthesized in solution with a large number of hydrocarbons that allows high-temperature crystal growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. After the synthesis, unreacted precursors, excess amounts of surfactants, and reaction media need to be effectively removed from the QDs since such impurities likely to degrade the performance of QD-based optoelectronic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. For the purification of QDs, the precipitation–dissolution method which is followed by centrifugation is the most commonly used technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Relatively polar solvents such as alcohol and acetone are added as non-solvents to form QD aggregates by decreasing solubility of QDs. Resulting QD aggregates are usually collected by centrifugation and finally redispersed in target organic solvents. The precipitation and redispersion processes are repeated several times until the impurities are sufficiently removed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This conventional technique requires expensive centrifuges and large amounts of solvents; it is also not scalable or controllable. Moreover, the efficiency of this technique depends on the precursor and the size and morphology of the QDs which is very complicated to establish a theoretical model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Recently, the large-scale synthesis of QDs has been presented owing to their various usage in the industry. It has been reported that the continuous synthesis process could be scaled up<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, without developing continuous large scale purification together, mass production of QDs still remains challenging. Electrophoretic deposition (EPD) method has been used to assemble the nanocrystals on various substrates and it was demonstrated that the method can be used for solar cell applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Using EPD, Bass <italic>et al</italic>. developed a quick and efficient technique for purification of QDs but it was still a batch-type process which is not suitable for mass purification<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. To improve this method, our group presented a continuous QD purification process based on microfluidics and electrophoresis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The fluid flow is perpendicular to electrical field limiting the purification yield due to the lack of retention time of QDs exposed to the electric field.</p><p id="Par3">In this work, we developed a new continuous purification process that is adaptable to the mass production of high-quality QDs. In this process, the as-synthesized QD dispersion solution is infused into a flow channel with porous electrodes. When an electric field is applied between adjacent electrodes, the QDs are collected on the porous electrodes while unreacted impurities pass through the electrodes. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis and ultraviolet/visible/near-infrared (UV/Vis/NIR) absorption spectroscopy clearly revealed that impurities in collected QDs are dramatically reduced. The purification yield of our process was calculated based on the intensity change of the first exciton peak in the absorption spectrum. To describe the purification process, we built a simplified analytical model for the movement of QDs driven by fluid flow and electrophoresis. Finally, we estimated the surface area of porous electrodes required for the purification of specified amounts of QDs and discuss the scalability of the proposed process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Electrophoretic QD purification device with porous electrodes</title><p id="Par4">Electrophoresis is the method used to manipulate micro- or nano-sized particles using an electric field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The electrophoretic behavior of particles is relatively well understood and highly controllable. Here, we used a flow channel system with porous electrodes to capture QDs from a QD dispersion solution passing through the system by using electrophoresis, as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. The dashed lines represent the electric field between the electrodes with positive (red color) and negative (gray color) electric potential and the blue arrow indicates the flow direction. As shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, the flow direction is parallel to the electric field, in contrast to our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. To design the new system, a particle-tracing simulation was performed, which showed that QDs can be more effectively captured by the electrodes when the flow direction is parallel to the electric field (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM63">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM63">S2</xref>). Moreover, in the new process, the captured QDs can be thoroughly washed to remove impurities whereas our previous work did not include a washing step.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic diagram of the purification system with polytetrafluoroethylene unit layer, O-ring, and porous nickel electrodes.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep43581_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par5">The proposed electrophoretic purification device is operated in three steps. First, when the electric field is applied between the electrodes, the QDs migrate toward the electrodes and adhere onto their surfaces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM63">Figure S3</xref>). Then, a non-solvent solution (acetone and ethanol) flows through the channel to wash out impurities and induces aggregation of the nanoparticles on the electrode surface. Finally, the fresh solvent (toluene) is applied to redisperse the nanoparticles after removing the impurities.</p><p id="Par6">To conduct the purification experiment, CdSe and PbS QDs were prepared following previously reported methods (see Materials and Methods for details). The crude QD solution contained the primary solvent (octadecene) and contaminants, such as excess oleic acid (OA), leftover precursors (cadmium oleate), and reaction byproducts. The crude solution was mixed with toluene to improve its stability and with non-solvent (acetone and ethanol) to enhance its electrophoretic mobility. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref> shows the as-prepared solution and three other solutions, the waste solution, washing solution, and purified QD solution, after the purification process. The waste solution included impurities and QDs that did not adhere onto the electrode surfaces and the as-prepared solution was flown through the channel upon the application of the electric field. The washing solution was a mixture of acetone and ethanol used to wash the adsorbed QDs. The purified QD solution was the nonpolar solvent containing the purified QDs.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Solution images, <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra, emission and absorbance of QDs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Photographs of materials (as-prepared QDs, waste, washing solution, and electropurified QDs) (<bold>B</bold>) <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectra of crude and electropurified CdSe.

As shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B,C</xref>, the electropurified QDs contained surface-bound OA (triangles) nearly without impurities, in contrast to the QD crude solution, which included a large amount of impurities, including octadecene (asterisks) and free and metal-ligand complexes (sphere). For a comparison with electrophoretic purification, the chemical components of conventionally purified QDs were also measured using NMR. These measurements revealed that the precipitation–redispersion process needed to be repeated at least twice to remove all the impurities (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM63">Figure S4</xref>). Moreover, 50 mL of non-solvent were typically required to purify 5 mL of QD solution (see Materials and Methods for details), which is approximately 10 times higher than the quantity required in the electrophoretic purification method. We note that QD charging effect, which has been known to significantly quench the PL of QDs, was almost negligible for electropurified QDs, showing higher relative PL compared to conventionally purified QDs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM63">Figure S5</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. We also checked if redox reaction occurs due to the electric field in the course of the electrophoretic purification by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The XPS spectra show that there is not any sign on the formation of oxidized species for electropurified QDs regardless of the applied voltage (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM63">Figure S6</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">A comparison was performed between the electropurified QDs and the conventionally purified QDs using CdSe and PbS nanoparticles. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2E</xref> show the absorption (solid lines) and emission (dotted lines) spectra of electropurified and conventionally purified CdSe and PbS QDs. The positions of the first exciton peaks in the absorption and emission spectra were nearly identical: 572 nm for the absorption and 581 nm for the emission in the case of CdSe and 917 nm for the absorption and 1023 nm for the emission in the case of PbS. This agreement in the first exciton peak positions indicates there was no significant variation in the optical properties of the purified QDs regardless of the purification method. UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectroscopy also confirmed the good purification results for CdSe and PbS QDs. The detailed results are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM63">Supporting Information</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM63">Figure S7</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">To calculate the purification yield of the electrophoretic purification, we used UV/Vis/NIR absorption spectra acquired before and after the purification (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). The purification yield was defined as the ratio of the mass of purified QDs to that of QDs in the crude solution. The QD concentration was calculated using the absorbance of the first exciton peak in the absorption spectra divided by the extinction coefficient of the QDs and the optical path length considered in the measurement, according to the Beer-Lambert law (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM63">Figure S8</xref>). We obtained the mass of the QDs by multiplying the QD concentration with the total solution volume. Because the extinction coefficient, the path length, and the solution volume were the same for both solutions, the purification yield was equal to the ratio of the first exciton peak of the purified QDs to that of the crude QDs. When the non-solvent content was 70%, the intensity of the first exciton peak of the as-prepared QD solution was approximately 0.828 and that of the purified QD solution was about 0.722, as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>. In this case, the purification yield was calculated to be 87.2%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Purification yield estimation model</title><p id="Par10">To understand the purification process, we built a simple model using the movement of QDs driven by the fluid flow and electrophoresis. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3A</xref> shows a schematic of the simplified porous electrodes that were used for the simulation. A porous electrode with a random pore network was simplified as a planar electrode with an array of circular holes and a 2 mm gap between the electrodes. The hole diameter and distance between the holes were determined based on the pore geometry of the electrode. The radius of the hole (<italic>R</italic>) was 0.5 mm and the length of the electrode (<italic>l</italic>) was 2 mm. In this model, the electric potential of the right electrode was positive and that on the left electrode was negative, similarly with the experiment. Because QDs with negative electrophoretic mobility adhere to the positive electrode, we focused on the movement of QDs near the entrance of the positive electrode. The hole in the positive electrode can be divided into two areas with respect to the movement of QDs. The orange-colored area represents the QD collection zone and QDs in this zone eventually attach onto the electrode; the other area is the QD penetration zone, where QDs pass through the hole without adhering onto the electrode. We assumed that QDs were uniformly distributed over the entrance of the positive electrode hole. The purification yield was calculated by the ratio of cross-sectional area of the QD collection zone to the inlet area, considering that each area is proportional to the amount of QDs; namely, the inlet area is proportional to the number of infused QDs and the cross-sectional area of the QD collection zone to the number of collected QDs.

The absolute value of the electrophoretic mobility of the QDs increases as the non-solvent content increases. Other experimental conditions were maintained stable, with a 500 V electrical potential and a 500 μL/min flow rate. Because the electrophoretic mobility of the nanoparticle directly affects the migration of the QDs in the electric field, more QDs of the as-prepared QD solution tend to adhere onto the electrode as the electrophoretic mobility increases, as shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>. When the non-solvent content is above 60%, the purification yield dramatically increases to over 70%. This dramatic increase in the purification yield indicates the presence of a threshold electrophoretic mobility for the purification process; we refer to this threshold value as critical mobility. We determined that the critical mobility was −7.49 × 10<sup>−9</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/Vs by fitting the experimental data with the analytical results.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Theoretical estimation of purification yields.</title><p>Purification yield determined by the experiments and the analytical model as a function of (<bold>A</bold>) non-solvent content, (<bold>B</bold>) flow rate, and (<bold>C</bold>) electric potential difference.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep43581_Fig4_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par17">When the flow rate of the as-prepared solution increases, the residence time during which the QDs are exposed to the electric field decreases and the shear force at the electrode surface increases.

However, the purification yield almost reaches a plateau when the flow rate is lower than 500 μL/min. This indicates that the effect of the electrophoretic force on the movement of QDs is dominant in the low flow rate regime. The analytical results were in good agreement with the experimental data.</p><p id="Par18">The electric potential difference also affects the purification yield of the QDs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref> shows the purification yield as a function of electrical potential for the same flow rate of as-prepared solution (500 μL/min) and non-solvent content (60%).

When the surface area of the electrode is insufficient for the adhering QDs, not all QDs with sufficient electrophoretic mobility can attach onto the electrodes while the solution flows through the device. The specific surface area of a porous electrode was measured using the Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller method and was used to calculate the actual surface area of the electrode by multiplying with the mass of the electrode. To determine the required electrode surface area for the target amount of purified QDs, experiments were performed with various surface areas (0.044, 0.088, 0.133, and 0.177 m<sup>2</sup>) for a specific amount of injected QDs without changing all the other conditions (non-solvent content 60%, electric potential difference 500 V, and flow rate 500 μL/min). The results show that when the surface area of the electrode is over 0.133 m<sup>2</sup>, the amount of purified QDs reaches a plateau at 4.20 mg and no longer changes (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Therefore, the required surface area for the target amount of purified QDs was simply calculated to be 31.6 m<sup>2</sup>/g.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Estimation for large-scale purification.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electrodes surface area requirement for the purification of a target amount of QDs.

The novelty of this device is that the directions of the electric field and the fluid flow are parallel to effectively capture the QDs on the electrodes. Additionally, the proposed process includes a washing step to improve the quality of the final products without any additional cost. The device was used to purify the crude solutions of two different QDs (CdSe and PbS). Compared with the conventional purification method, the proposed technique achieved comparable purification quality and lower time and solvent consumption. Moreover, a simple analytical model was developed based on the QD travel time to describe the purification process. Both the experimental and theoretical results showed that the non-solvent content in the infused QD dispersion, the electric field strength in the flow channel, and the flow rate of the QD dispersion affect the migration of QDs in the flow channel and the purification yield. As the non-solvent content increases, the electrophoretic mobility of the QDs and the purification yield increase. The purification yield increases as the electric field strength increases or the flow rate decreases and reaches a maximum. We achieved a yield above 80%, which is much higher than that obtained by an earlier continuous process (approximately 60%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. This yield can be further improved by increasing the absolute magnitude of the QD mobility by adding solvents with high dielectric constants. The continuous purification process could be scaled up using relatively simple techniques, such as increasing the number of electrodes and the surface area of electrodes. We estimated that over 1 kg/day of purified QDs can be obtained using 24 electrodes with 25 cm channel diameter. The present work shows a new possibility for the mass production and industrial use of high-quality QDs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Chemicals</title><p id="Par23">All the following chemicals were used as received: cadmium oxide (CdO, 99.99%, Aldrich), lead (II) oxide (PbO, 99.999%, Alfa Aesar), selenium shot (Se, 99.999%, Alfa Aesar), bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide ((TMS)<sub>2</sub>S, synthesis grade, Aldrich), oleic acid (OA, technical grade and 99% from Aldrich and Alfa Aesar, respectively), tetrachloroethylene (TCE, 99%, Aldrich), and 1-octadecene (ODE, technical grade, Aldrich).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Synthesis of CdSe QDs</title><p id="Par24">CdSe QDs were synthesized following a previously reported method with some modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. 0.255 g of CdO, 3.1 mL of OA (technical grade), and 30 mL of ODE were loaded in a three-neck flask and degassed at 100 °C for 1 h.
