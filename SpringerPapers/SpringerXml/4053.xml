Despite its numerous superior properties, the wide development of TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalytic surfaces suffers from important drawbacks. Hence, the high temperature usually required (&gt; 450 °C) for the synthesis of anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> is still a challenge to outreach. In this article, we report the development and optimisation of an ECWR-PECVD process enabling the deposition of anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films at low substrate temperature. Scanning of experimental parameters such as RF power and deposition time was achieved in order to maximise photocatalytic activity. The careful selection of the deposition parameters (RF power, deposition time and plasma gas composition) enabled the synthesis of coatings exhibiting photocatalytic activity comparable to industrial references such as P25 Degussa and Pilkington Activ at a substrate temperature below 200 °C. In addition, to further decrease the substrate temperature, the interest of pulsing the plasma RF source was investigated. Using a duty cycle of 50%, it is thus possible to synthesise photocatalytic anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films at a substrate temperature below 115 °C with a deposition rate around 10 nm/min.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi"

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Mankind is currently going through a lot of crucial issues. To cite some, the access of decontaminated air and water is already a critical point in overpopulated countries. The green and efficient generation of H<sub>2</sub>, tomorrow’s fuel, is becoming urgent. The demand in antimicrobial surfaces in hospitals to dam up the spread of diseases is growing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Many studies have already led to the development of materials fulfilling these properties requirements. Among all of them, TiO<sub>2</sub> stands out from the crowd. As main reasons for this, we can highlight its low price, high availability, chemical stability and non-toxicity for both environment and human beings. Hence, the past century has drawn a lot of attention into this semiconductor that became one of the preferred photocatalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">A great variety of deposition techniques can been used to synthesize the most photocatalytic polymorph of TiO<sub>2</sub>, the so-called anatase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Depending on the process used, characteristics of the obtained TiO<sub>2</sub> layers such as grain size and shape, face orientation, porosity, roughness can vary a lot. Main TiO<sub>2</sub> coatings deposition processes can be divided in two categories namely the wet and dry processes. The former comprises hydrothermal, electrodeposition, anodization, spin-coating, dip-coating and sol–gel methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Although they represent a cost effective way to synthesise titania layers, wet processes either include a high temperature and/or long post process treatment to get a well crystallized material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Dry vacuum processes such as Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD) or Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) also require a step of heating above 200 °C, either during the deposition process or post-deposition (calcination or annealing). This makes them incompatible with the deposition on thermally labile substrates, namely stiff and flexible polymers. For these reasons, up to now, most fundamental and applied studies on TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film deposition synthesis concerned deposition on glass, which allows deposition temperatures up to 400 °C.</p><p id="Par4">The recent development of flexible electronics and solar cells as well as antibacterial films has created a new demand for materials with transparent conducting or photocatalytic properties which can be deposited at a temperature compatible with most of flexible polymers, typically below 80 °C. Wet processes have been reported to efficiently lead to low temperature photocatalytic thin films synthesis. Hence, Xu et al<italic>.</italic> achieved the deposition of an anatase/rutile mixture by the mean of wet chemistry with an overall process temperature not exceeding 80 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the reaction pathway for such coating involved many steps and long post-treatments. Among them, one can cite a TiO<sub>2</sub> seeding by sol–gel, then an immersion in Ti-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 72 h at 80 °C. Finally, the crystallization of TiO<sub>2</sub> was driven by an immersion of the coated PET samples in a 0.05 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution at 80 °C for 120 h. Thus, it exists a strong interest in the development of one-step and dry process that can efficiently lead to the rapid deposition of crystalline anatase thin films at low substrate temperature, compatible with thermally labile substrate. This induced the development of new processes to reach highly photocatalytic crystalline anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> at temperatures far under its thermodynamic crystallisation temperature (250 °C). Only few works focusing on this goal have been published but up to now, the proposed approaches still require long multistep processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup><italic>.</italic> Thus, mass production of highly photocatalytic thin films deposited at low substrate temperature is still one of nowadays burning issues.</p><p id="Par5">Plasma assisted CVD methods have shown their ability for the synthesis of crystalline inorganic thin films at lower substrate temperature than the one allowed with CVD methods. Indeed, the reactive species generated by the plasma such as energetic electrons, ions, radicals or excited neutrals, can bring energy to the on-growing thin film through different mechanisms other than pure thermal energy. Hence, low pressure PECVD is particularly suited for the synthesis of crystalline functional oxides.</p><p id="Par6">In particular, Electron Cyclotron Wave Resonance plasma sources to assist a CVD process have shown excellent results for the growth of TiO<sub>2</sub> anatase thin films. Indeed, highly photocatalytic thin films have been obtained at substrate temperature as low as 200°C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Besides, it has recently been shown that pulsing the plasma power can be a convenient way to limit the substrate heating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, especially for crystalline TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film growth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup><italic>.</italic> By carefully setting up the plasma pulse parameters, Li et al<italic>.</italic> obtained anatase containing TiO<sub>2</sub> layers with good photocatalytic activity while keeping substrate temperature below 120 °C. However, in this Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Radio Frequency (RF) PECVD process, it is worth mentioning that the thickness growth rate caps around 1 nm/min which is not suitable for mass production. In the following work, it is expected that the growth rate of crystalline films could be drastically increased thanks to the high plasma density provided by ECWR plasma source.</p><p id="Par7">In this article, we investigated the possibility of producing, in one-step, crystalline anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> layers with highly efficient photocatalytic yields, below 120 °C. As a safe, stable and inexpensive precursor, the metal–organic titanium (IV) isopropoxide (TTIP) was chosen as titanium precursor. In addition to the optimisation of the main experimental parameters (power, deposition time and gas composition), we especially focus on the pulsing of the Electron Cyclotron Wave Resonance (ECWR) plasma source in order to perform the deposition at low substrate temperature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par8">In the following study, several parameters linked to the chemistry and the plasma process were discussed. For the ease of understanding, we decided to focus only on the influence of specific deposition parameters. The constant parameters linked to the deposition set-up for the results presented in this article are summarized in methods section. As depicted on Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, the injection ring was placed really near the substrate (1.5 cm) in order to foster surface reactions and limit gas phase reactions. The plasma source generates a quasi-neutral plasma beam allegedly homogeneous over 13 cm diameter.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Scheme of the experimental setup of ECWR Plasma process (<bold>a</bold>), TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films obtained with Copra DN 200 CF plasma source for different thickness (<bold>b</bold>) and picture of the source igniting an Ar–O<sub>2</sub> plasma at 500 W (<bold>c</bold>).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2020_78956_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">Therefore, homogeneous samples up to two inches can be coated (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Moreover, tuning some plasma parameters enabled the deposition of crystalline TiO<sub>2</sub> on polyethylene substrates with a good adhesion (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) which will be further discussed in the last part of this manuscript. Before going through the different parameters study, one has to notice that XPS analysis pointed out the similar atomic composition of all the synthesised layers presented in this study. Whatever the experimental conditions, the bulk atomic ratio O/Ti is about 1.8. Considering the preferential sputtering of O over Ti under Ar<sup>+</sup> etching beam this ratio is typical of stoichiometric TiO<sub>2</sub>. In addition, the decomposition of Ti 2p<sub>1/2</sub> and Ti 2p<sub>3/2</sub> peaks exhibits a single contribution at 458.9 and 464.7 eV respectively. These characteristic values reveal the sole presence of Ti<sup>4+</sup> oxidation state in the synthesised films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Finally, all the bulk analysis pointed out C content below 4% irrespective of the plasma conditions.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Influence of the RF power</title><p id="Par10">In this first section, the effect of the continuous RF plasma power on the morphology, composition and crystallinity of the titanium dioxide films and on the substrate temperature increase were investigated. The deposition time was kept at 2 h for this power study (100, 300, 500 W). An Ar flow of 37.5 sccm and an O<sub>2</sub> flow of 12.5 sccm were used so that the gas flow ratio in the Ar–O<sub>2</sub> mixture (plasma source), [O<sub>2</sub>]/([O<sub>2</sub>] + [Ar]) was set to 25%. For all these three deposition conditions, the thickness growth rate of the layers seemed independent of the plasma power and cap around 11 ± 1 nm/min and this for a constant TTiP flowrate calculated around 0.16 sccm.</p><p id="Par11">From these results, we could infer that in these conditions, where the TTiP precursor can be considered as highly diluted in the Ar–O<sub>2</sub> mixture, the plasma density is high enough, even at 100 W, to fully dissociate TTiP, so that the growth rate did not depend on the plasma power. Besides, it is observed that the final temperature of the substrate T<sub>sub max</sub> is directly linked to the RF power and a linear relation can be established between these two parameters. The investigation of the coatings surface by SEM, exhibited different morphologies for the titanium dioxide films synthesised at different P<sub>RF</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>SEM topviews with associated T<sub>sub max</sub> (<bold>a</bold>), Raman scattering spectra (<bold>b</bold>) and Photocatalytic activity (<bold>c</bold>) of TiO<sub>2</sub> deposited at different RF power (2 h CW mode deposition).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2020_78956_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par12">At P<sub>RF</sub> = 100 W, a homogeneous surface morphology composed of one single structure could be observed by SEM and the final deposition temperature reaches 60 °C. Taking into account this very low deposition substrate temperature of the titanium dioxide layer and results already reported in the literature, it is possible to put forward that these layers have developed a fibrous structure along the thickness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Based on measurements carried out on the SEM pictures, the diameter of the top of these fibres was estimated around 50 nm. Regarding the structure analysed by Raman scattering (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) no specific peak was detected and thus, suggesting an amorphous structure. Nevertheless, it is also possible that the crystallites are too small to be detected by Raman<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par13">As the RF power was increased from 100 to 300 W, an increase in the maximum substrate temperature was recorded (T<sub>sub max</sub> = 134 °C). In addition, a second structure on the TiO<sub>2</sub> top surface emerged out from the amorphous fibrous one. This structure presented wide spread “flower-like” microstructures exhibiting sharp edges, partially covering the amorphous phase. These flower-like structures had various sizes, between 300 and 500 nm. The associated Raman analysis shows the appearance of peaks associated to the anatase phase, thus suggesting this flower like structure to be partially crystallised. This could result from a crystal germination mechanism which possibly appeared because of the plasma power increase or/and the higher deposition temperature.</p><p id="Par14">As the plasma power was further increased, an evolution of the surface coating morphology was observed and the substrate temperature increased. At P<sub>RF</sub> = 500 W, the flower-like structure covered the whole film surface made out of highly faceted grain starting to merge to each other and the T<sub>sub max</sub> was slightly up to 200 °C which was consistent with our previous published results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Moreover, the intensity of Raman peaks associated to the anatase phase tremendously increased.</p><p id="Par15">Similarly, great differences on the TiO<sub>2</sub> coatings photocatalytic properties were noticed depending on P<sub>RF</sub>. Thus, the photocatalytic activity of the layers deposited at 100, 300 and 500 W were established.

The photocatalytic efficiency of these three layers deposited at 100, 300 and 500 W seemed independent of their thickness (1297, 1322 and 1340 nm respectively) but rather linked to the density and or the quality (defects, grain size, main facet) of anatase containing crystals directly in contact of Stearic Acid molecules.

Three deposition times were then considered: 30 min, 1 h and 2 h, which lead to film thicknesses of 381, 668 and 1340 nm, respectively. The corresponding maximal substrate temperatures (temperature reached at the end of the deposition process) of 148, 183 and 204 °C respectively were measured. Indeed, as it has been already reported by several authors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, plasma induced an increase of substrate temperature with time until they reach a certain threshold. For these plasma conditions, the threshold was reached after three hours with an equilibrium temperature of 230 °C. By fitting the data with a linear function, the slope gave a thickness growth rate of 10.7 ± 0.4 nm/min which was in agreement with the value given in the previous section. According to the constant growth rate whatever the deposition time, one can conclude that the substrate temperature does not influence the TiO<sub>2</sub> deposition speed. The top view SEM investigations of the films surface provided information about the growth mechanism of the TiO<sub>2</sub> layer as a function of time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

However, if the substrate is not in contact with a highly efficient cooling substrate holder during the deposition, these two process conditions led to an increase of the substrate temperature above 180 °C. This constitutes a major drawback for the deposition on complex substrate shapes or roll-to-roll in line coating processes. Thus, in order to maintain a good photocatalytic property while reducing substrate temperature, one option is to switch from a continuous to a pulsed mode deposition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Influence of pulsed mode</title><p id="Par23">In the following, the plasma power was kept at a constant P<sub>RF</sub> = 500 W during T<sub>on</sub>.

Increasing the duty cycle up to 50%, led to two different structures containing surfaces. However, Raman scattering measurements did not evidence significant anatase peaks.

Indeed, when DC ≤ 50% was applied, TiO<sub>2</sub> layer FQE/e was one order of magnitude lower than the one obtained for DC = 100% (continuous mode). Hence, the thickness normalised yield efficiency (FQE/e) of these layers (DC &lt; 50%) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), was estimated to 2 × 10<sup>–8</sup> and 5 × 10<sup>–8</sup> nm<sup>−1</sup>, for DC = 25% and DC = 50% respectively.</p><p id="Par27">For a pulse frequency of 10 kHz, it can be noticed that the associated deposition rates in pulsed mode with the two different duty cycles were very close and even slightly higher than the rate determined in continuous plasma condition.

The conclusion was that deposition mechanism was continuing even during plasma T<sub>Off</sub>. However in the present study, it appeared that the growth rate of the TiO<sub>2</sub> films obtained in pulse mode was slightly higher than the one under continuous discharge. This phenomena has been shown by other research groups in the case of pulsed PECVD deposition of silicon based films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. They ascribed this behaviour to a better use of the precursor during the deposition, by hampering homogeneous gas phase reactions. Thus, by pulsing the plasma these authors reduced such homogeneous reaction. However, this hypothesis seems very unlikely in our deposition conditions since no dust could be found. In addition, as depicted in the first section, highly diluted plasma condition with a flow rate of TTiP around 0.16 sccm so we assumed that even for 100 W the plasma density was high enough to fully dissociate it. Besides, Charles et al<italic>.</italic> demonstrated that adjusting the length of the discharge and the post-discharge had an influence on film internal stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Thus, by reducing the duty cycle, the ion bombardment could be cut down leading to less dense films. Consequently, the mass deposition rate might remain stable while the thickness growth rate should increase. One more hint to explain this slight difference in growth rate could be found in XPS data related to carbon composition in the bulk.

Ion energy distribution function (IEDF) measurement with a retarding field energy analyser (RFEA) evidenced positive ions with kinetic energy up to 30 eV in the deposition chamber. These energetic charged species when impinging the substrate may induce increased mobility of the adsorbed species on the growing surface.

This allows us to calculate a Formal Quantum Efficiency defined as the number of molecules of SA degraded per photon.<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ1_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">Slope</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">FTIR</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">photon</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>365</mml:mn><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>φ</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

One can hypothesize here that the excellent FQE measured from our as-grown TiO<sub>2</sub> layers could partly be explained by their quite important thickness. On the other hand, samples considered as references in the field of thin films photocatalyst are 15–90 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Thus, a FQE normalized to the film thickness (i.e. FQE/e) can be calculated which could be a simple way to compare the normalized photocatalytic efficiency (SA molecules/photon 365 nm/coating thickness nm) of the films grown independently from thickness effect. Even though we know that Stearic Acid does not penetrate the TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film for more than few tens of nanometer and UV might totally be absorbed after 200 nm in TiO<sub>2</sub>, we consider that FQE/e is a good factor to compare our ECWR plasma deposited films with references obtained with various methods.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the French Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) and Luxembourgish Fonds National de la Recherche (FNR) through the FNR-ANR-INTER project PATIO (ANR-17-CE08-0045-01 and INTER/ANR/16/11565003/PATIO/Choquet).</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>The manuscript was written with contributions from all authors.
