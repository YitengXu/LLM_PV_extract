However, scaling up to high-efficiency carbon-based solar modules hinges on reliable deposition of uniform defect-free perovskite films over large areas, which is an unsettled but urgent issue. In this work, a long-chain gemini surfactant is introduced into perovskite precursor ink to enforce self-assembly into a network structure, considerably enhancing the coverage and smoothness of the perovskite films.

great wave in the past decade owing to their high-performance, solution processability, low cost and potential for mass production with roll-to-roll printing technologies. Within a very short time span, a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.7% has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, high efficiency PSCs are so far mainly achieved by employing precious metals as electrodes, such as Ag and Au [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The problem with such metal electrodes is that ion migration widely known in halide perovskite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] will lead to etching reactions of the migrated halide anions with the metals to form resistive compounds such as AgI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], jeopardizing the cell efficiency and stability. Although the formation of Au-I is much more difficult, Au atoms could diffuse from electrode into perovskite layer to form anti-site defects of Au<sub>Pb</sub> with a deep level, which will become efficient non-radiative recombination centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Carbon-based electrodes represent a green alternative because of their suitable Femi level, hydrophobicity-associated resistance to water and ion-migration, ultralow cost and atmospheric preparation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Thus, carbon-electrode-based PSCs have become one of the most promising competitors in the commercialization of emerging solar cells. However, most efforts have been focused on small-area (&lt; 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup>) PSCs commonly fabricated using the spin-coating method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Scaling-up PSC production has become one of the most pressing challenges in bringing PSCs to the market. Several strategies were proposed for large-area PSCs, such as blade coating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], slot-die coating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], screen printing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and spray deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Among these methods, blade coating has the advantages of simplicity, high-speed and minimal solution loss, meaning that the blade coating technique is potentially suitable for scaling up production of PSCs.</p><p id="Par8">Operationally, the blading process controls over solvent volatilization to tune film crystallization through the blade knife height, blading speed and blading temperature. Unfortunately, such control in blade coating is typically much less effective than that through antisolvent extraction in spin coating in combating the dendritic crystal growth, leading inevitably to the formation of numerous crevices in the resulting films. A possible chimie douse remedy for the blade coating is to rheologically, hydrodynamically and viscoelastically modify the perovskite precursor ink solution, termed pre-PVK ink hereafter, in the hope to balance the slow solvent volatilization and the dendritic crystal growth. Macropscopically, such pre-PVK ink is designed to possess an apt self-levelling property such that the resulting liquid film can uniformly cover the substrate. One the other hand, the microscopic crystallization process will also even out with such ink during the solidification process due to the space confinement imposed by the network structure mediated by some special self-assembling molecules such as surfactants.</p><p id="Par9">In fact, gemini surfactant has already received attention in blade coating technology for perovskite solar modules. Deng et al. reported that small amounts of L-α- phosphatidylcholine (LP) surfactant could dramatically change the fluid drying dynamics and increase the adhesion of ink to the underlying non-wetting PTAA (poly(bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Some other surfactants have also shown positive effects on improving the quality of perovskite films [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. One of the observations about surfactant-assistance crystallization was that the zwitterionic LP is more effective than the non-ionic polyethylene glycol sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60), anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cationic didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, the mechanism of surfactant induced enhancement of perovskite film quality remains to be understood. LP is extracted from soybean or egg yolk with two alkyl chains of unequal lengths, and different product batches cannot guarantee a consistent molecular structure of LP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In order to systematically study the influences of surfactant structure and length on the properties of pre-PVK ink during solidification, we successfully demonstrated the key role of a synthetic gemini surfactant with two equally long alkyl chains in assisting the blade coating of pre-PVK ink. The long alkyl chains are essential to lowering the critical micellar concentration (CMC) to the extent that a very small amount of surfactant additive will dramatically exert a positive influence on the rheological, hydrodynamic and viscoelastic properties of pre-PVK ink for blade-coating without compromising the transport properties perovskite films. Moreover, functionalized ionic moieties have strong capability to passivate the defects in the perovskite at the same time. Consequently, we were able to prepare high-quality 10 cm × 10 cm carbon-based modules with all of the functional layer blade coated in ambient air, and achieved a certificated efficiency of 15.46%. This significant step will promote the pace of real-world applications of all-printable perovskite photovoltaics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par10">Unless stated otherwise, chemicals and solvents were obtained commercially and were used without further purification, including methylammonium iodide (MAI) and formamidine hydroiodide (FAI) (Dyesol, 98.0%), Lead iodide (PbI<sub>2</sub>) (TCI, 99.99%), SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle solution (15% in H<sub>2</sub>O colloidal dispersion, Alfa Aesar), graphene (Chengdu Organic Chemistry Co., Ltd., 98.0%). 1, 2-Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC, C<sub>44</sub>H<sub>88</sub>NO<sub>8</sub>P; DLPC, C<sub>32</sub>H<sub>64</sub>NO<sub>8</sub>P; DHPC, C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>40</sub>NO<sub>8</sub>P) (99.0%), Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT, 98%), N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, anhydrous), Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9%, anhydrous), Guanidine hydrochloride (CH<sub>5</sub>N<sub>3</sub>·HCl, 99%) and chlorobenzene (99.8%, anhydrous) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Let’s first look at the surfactant-free case. Here the liquid pre-PVK film was prepared by blade coating at room temperature and put on a hotplate, and the transformation of the pre-PVK film was observed in real time with the microscope during the annealing process (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c and Video S1 (left), solid particles started to form in the liquid pre-PVK film immediately at 0.00 s. From 0.12 to 1.12 s, the solid particles grew up into radial spherules, concurrently with the appearance of more such solid particles covering a wider area of the view. From 1.12 to 3.18 s, the nucleation and growth of the particles continued and eventually formed different sizes of the radial spherules in contact with each other covering nearly the whole substrate surface but with obvious chinks and gaps between the neighboring spherules.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic diagram illustrating the sample conditions for the optical microscopic (Fig. 1c, d) and XRD (Fig. 1b).<bold> b</bold> XRD patterns of room temperature blade-coated pristine pre-PVK film and DSPC-pre-PVK film annealed at different temperatures for 2 min, in which clover symbol denotes the intermediate phase MA<sub>2</sub>Pb<sub>3</sub>I<sub>8</sub>·2DMSO.

In general, the film is inhomogeneous and noncompact with the spherules stacked on each other. We believe that such radial spherules arise from self-assembly of one-dimensional intermediate crystals under the combined actions of concentration gradients and rheological and hydrodynamic properties of the unsolidified pre-PVK ink. In a previous work, we reported that the growth of one-dimensional (1D) intermediate phases were extremely fast in humid air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. When the solvent volatilized upon temperature rise, the concentration of pre-PVK ink increased and crystal nucleus of intermediate phases began to form. Indeed, the XRD patterns of pre-PVK ink film in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b shows the characteristic peaks of the MA<sub>2</sub>Pb<sub>3</sub>I<sub>8</sub>·2DMSO intermediate phase as the temperature was increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Note that the growth orientations of MA<sub>2</sub>Pb<sub>3</sub>I<sub>8</sub>·2DMSO crystals were not radial early on in the small emerging solid particles (nanoscale) simply because the precursor concentrations and rheological and hydrodynamic properties were relatively homogeneous in the bulk ink. However, when MA<sub>2</sub>Pb<sub>3</sub>I<sub>8</sub>·2DMSO grew into macroscopic solid particles (beyond micron) at 0.00 s as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c, the photographs show that the circumjacent liquid became more and more shadowy due to formation of the tiny solid particles spherically distributed around the central larger solid particles. Thereafter, the central solid particles grew radially, i.e., the 1D MA<sub>2</sub>Pb<sub>3</sub>I<sub>8</sub>·2DMSO fanned out, into the spreading shadows, resulting in more and more obvious bright rings with the increase of cluster size; for instance, at 0.12 s, the largest spherule exhibits the most obvious bright ring encircling it.</p><p id="Par17">The appearance of the multiple-ring pattern after 1.00 s is phenomenologically similar to that from the well-known “coffee ring” effect in the pristine pre-PVK liquid, but the mechanistic details seem to be different. One can imagine, with the growth of 1D MA<sub>2</sub>Pb<sub>3</sub>I<sub>8</sub>·2DMSO, the solvent volatilization rate increased at the spherical edge, setting up a hydrodynamic, rheological and capillary field spherically distributed around the central solid particle. This view on the strong interplay between the central solid particle and the circumference is quite consistent with the growth trails we intercepted, such as radial clusters, multiple-ring pattern, shadowy circumference and bright ring. This inhomogeneous and uncontrollable growth mode heavily undermined the formation of high-quality perovskite films with the pristine pre-PVK liquid. The problem was the hierarchical formation of spherules starting from central solid particles surrounded by 1D arrays of smaller particles in the fluidic solvent. Eventually, upon solvent evaporation, the size-dispersed spherules are loosely stacked on each other forming a perovskite film with numerous wrinkles or cracks and with a poor coverage and coarse morphology, as shown in the photo at 3.18 s (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c) and also in Fig. S1a.</p><p id="Par18">To improve the perovskite crystallization process, we then introduced long-chain surfactants to modulate the rheological and hydrodynamic properties of the precursor solution. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d and Video S1 (right), the transformation process in liquid DSPC-pre-PVK ink to solidified perovskite film was radically different from that in the pristine pre-PVK ink presented above. Although the solid particles were also observable at 0 s, all of those growth trails in pre-PVK ink film such as radial clusters, multiple-ring pattern, shadowy region and bright ring disappeared in the DSPC-pre-PVK ink film. Significantly, the growth process was much more smooth until the substrate was fully covered with a compact perovskite film at 7.24 s, which was much later than that in the pristine pre-PVK ink at 3.18 s. The reason behind it appears to be that adding a small amount of DSPC has dramatically changed the radial growth process of intermediate crystal spherules due to multiple changes in the liquid ink properties, including capillary, rheological, hydrodynamic, transport, nucleation, growth and transformation properties. As a result, liquid-mediated interference among the growing particles and radial spherule formation are suppressed by the surfactants, leading to more independent, uniform and smooth nucleation, growth and transformation of the particles in space and time. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b shows the XRD patterns highlighting the effects of DSPC. First of all, DSPC promoted the uniform nucleation of MA<sub>2</sub>Pb<sub>3</sub>I<sub>8</sub>·2DMSO intermediate phase even at room temperature, perhaps due to the strong interaction between the polar heads of DSPC with the colloidal particles, which will be further proved below by QCM-D analysis. Secondly, after annealing at 120 °C for 2 min, the peak of PbI<sub>2</sub> appeared at 12.7° in the pristine pre-PVK ink but not in DSPC-pre-PVK ink. This indicates that the transformation from MA<sub>2</sub>Pb<sub>3</sub>I<sub>8</sub>·2DMSO to perovskite was much more controllable in the surfactant-containing precursor than in the pristine counterpart. Plausibly, adding DSPC promoted the uniform nucleation of MA<sub>2</sub>Pb<sub>3</sub>I<sub>8</sub>·2DMSO but decelerated the solidification to form perovskite, which can be seen from the lower perovskite peak intensity at 14.1° than in the pristine pre-PVK ink, in agreement with the above-presented in-situ optical microscope observations. In addition, the hydrophobic part of DSPC may have lessened the detrimental effect of water on the solidification process in humid atmosphere, which is known to cause uncontrollable transformation of the intermediate to PbI<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Figure S1b displays the final perovskite morphologies evolved from the DSPC-pre-PVK ink. Clearly seen are the large-size perovskite crystal grains with flat surfaces compactly joined together instead of the fissured spherical clusters arising from the “coffee ring”-like effect as in the perovskite film prepared with the pre-PVK ink.</p><p id="Par19">To study the impacts of surfactant size on the properties of pre-PVK ink relevant to perovskite film formation, saturated phospholipids DHPC(20C), DLPC(32C), DMPC(36C), DPPC(40C), DSPC(44C), and DDOCPC(52C) with different alkyl chain lengths were selected. As shown in Fig. S2, these surfactants have the same polar head and the same two equal-length alkyl chain structure, but different alkyl chain lengths. The most obvious advantage of using these synthetic phospholipids for our study over natural phospholipids is that they have a definite molecular structure and high purity. As can be seen from Fig. S3, when the same mass of the gemini surfactant was added into DMF/DMSO, emulsification occurred in the solutions with DLPC and DSPC but not with DHPC, and moreover, DSPC showed most pronounced emulsification. This clearly demonstrates that the alkyl chain length of surfactant is critical to the lowering of critical micellar concentration (CMC) in DMF/DMSO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The formation of micelles is expected to greatly change the rheological properties and viscoelasticity of the solution, which were then carefully investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a exposes the influences of phospholipids on the viscosity of DMF/DMSO solutions. First, adding DSPC in DMF/DMSO actually decreased the viscosity from 1.68 to 1.05 mPa·s because the hydrophobic alkyl chains are dispersed in DMF/DMSO and as aprotic solvents, the DMF/DMSO cannot mediate strong interactions between micelles. However, the presence of PVK completely changed the picture; adding DSPC greatly increased the viscosity at the shear rate of 17.03 s-1 from 4.26 mPa·s (pre-PVK ink) to 8.68 mPa·s (DSPC-pre-PVK ink). Understandably, colloidal particles in the DSPC-pre-PVK ink have played an important role in increasing the viscosity by strongly interacting with the polar heads of DSPC in the DSPC-pre-PVK ink. Another important feature of the DSPC-pre-PVK ink is shear thinning, which is manifested in Fig. S4. Such a decrease of viscosity with shear rate is ascribable to the partial breakup of the self-assembled structures under shearing and the resulting reduction of attractive interactions between the loosen components. Shear thinning is a common phenomenon for many surfactant systems mainly caused by micelle shape changes under the shear force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In our specific case, at a low shear rate, the colloidal particles and the micelles tend to be interlaced into a reticular structure, but increasing shear rate will weaken the linkages between the self-assembled species, thus decreasing the viscosity. Importantly, the viscosity of pre-PVK ink added with the short-chain gemini surfactants (SCGS) such as DHPC (20C) and DLPC (32C) failed to increase with and was actually independent of the shear rate. Plausibly, the SCGSs did not form micelles in the solvent system to begin with, so they failed to form the kind of reticular structure with the colloidal particles. Therefore, the use of long alkyl chains in surfactants is essential for increasing viscosity of the inks to control perovskite crystallization.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Viscosities of the different solutions measured with a rotary viscosimeter at the shear rate 17.03 s<sup>−1</sup>. <bold>b</bold> Viscosity changes of the different precursor solutions with time under the shear rate of 170 and 1.70 s<sup>−1</sup>. <bold>c</bold> Schematic diagrams illustrating the blade coating processes with the pristine pre-PVK ink (top) and the DSPC pre-PVK ink (bottom).

DSPC has two polar heads (denoted by two blue circles) with affinity interaction with INTs and two hydrophobic tails (denoted by red wavy lines) with repulsion interaction with INTs), and the unique interactions drive the arrangements of DSPC-INTs for the smooth growth to a compact and uniform perovskite film</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40820_2023_1155_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par21">Next, we availed ourselves of quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) to investigate the solidification process of pre-PVK ink. The differences of viscoelasticity between LCGS- and SCGS- pre-PVK inks were measured in real time to expose the influence of the alky chain length of surfactants on the solidification process. As shown in Fig. S5 for the solidification processes from 1 to 2, the solidification time of DHPC-pre-PVK ink (391.1 s) and DLPC-pre-PVK ink (705.1 s) is shorter than that of the pristine pre-PVK ink (1121.3 s), but the solidification of DSPC-pre-PVK ink (3653.9 s) takes much longer. It appears that the same polar heads of these three phospholipids play the role of accelerating solidification by promoting the intermediate phase formation. On the other hand, the increase of alkyl-chain length plays the role of slowing down solidification by increasing the viscosity and the capillary number of DSPC-pre-PVK ink. Understandably, both the increase of viscosity and capillary number (to be defined and discussed below) will degrade fluidity of the unsolidified liquid and limit the local inhomogeneous mass transport due to evaporation, flow and capillarity, thereby attenuating the interplay between the growing central particles and the circumjacent liquid.</p><p id="Par22">Although the SCGS and LCGS are different in their ability to form the reticular structures needed for forming high-quality perovskite films, they both contribute to the favorable viscoelastic evolution during solidification, which is reflected by the changing trend of viscosity versus that of elastic modulus. To unravel it, we converted the data in Fig. S5 to the plots of Δviscosity relative to Δelastic modulus as shown in Fig. S6. The most important observation is that while for the processes from 1 to 2, the ascent rate of Δviscosity relative to Δelastic modulus is generally increased by the surfactants (DHPC, DLPC and DSPC), the descent rate of Δviscosity relative to Δelastic modulus for the processes from 3 to 4 (from unsolidified ink to residual solution) is generally reduced by the surfactants. In other words, by adding the surfactants to the ink, the relative viscosity increase of the solidifying film becomes faster, but the relative viscosity decrease of unsolidified ink becomes slower. Evidently, the solidification process with the surfactants has a higher impact on the viscosity of the solidifying film but a lower impact on the viscosity of unsolidified pre-PVK ink than that without the surfactants. Thus, the gemini surfactants, both SCGS and LCGS, can reduce the viscosity perturbation of unsolidified pre-PVK ink and increase the controllability of crystallization.</p><p id="Par23">One of the film quality indicators is film roughness, which we will relate to the surfactant modulated solidification process of perovskite precursor inks. Figure S7 shows AFM images of the perovskite films fabricated using different surfactants along with roughness analysis. The most important observation is the opposite effect of SCGS on the film roughness to LCGS, and consequently the much higher roughness of the films fabricated with SCGS than that with LCGS. Specifically, with SCGS (DHPC, 22C), the perovskite film roughness increased from <italic>R</italic><sub>q</sub> = 109.0 to 131.0 nm, but with DLPC (32C) of an intermediate chain length and LCGS (DSPC, 44C), it decreased to 66.2 and 45.2 nm, respectively. As we have shown above, SCGS (DHPC, 22C) greatly shifts the start of solidification to an earlier time and reduces the controllability of crystallization, thus causing the roughness increase as observed. In contrat, LCGS (DSPC, 44C) greatly postpones the solidification start time and enhances the controllability of crystallization, thus causing the observed roughness decrease. Meanwhile, DLPC (32C) sits in between the two and has approximately the threshold alkyl chain length to impact on the desirable perovskite crystallization process. To sum up, both of the SCGS and LCGS can reduce the viscosity perturbation of unsolidified pre-PVK ink, but only when their alkyl chains reach a threshold length will the surfactants have a sufficient activity to greatly increase the viscosity and to postpone the solidification time. The surfactant activity of a gemini surfactant is directly reflected by the emulsification phenomenon, as clearly demonstrated in Figs. S3 and S8 for our solvent system. While the DHPC solution is still transparent at 2 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>, emulsification persists for DLPC even when the concentration is lower than 0.01 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>, meaning that the surfactant activity greatly increases with the alkyl chain length.</p><p id="Par24">Since the SnO<sub>2</sub> substrate for blade-coating is hydrophilic, especially after the plasma or ultra-violet ozone cleaning treatments, its interfacial tension with our ink liquids, even the pre-PVK ink liquid, is generally small, making the liquid self-levelling exceedingly well on the substrate during the blade-coating. As reported by Weinstein et al., a liquid coating on a substrate will continue to flow until immobilized by gelling, curing, dewetting or drying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, we need consider particle agglomeration caused by interface tension-driven flow. In our case, since the surface area per unit volume increases as the liquid ink is spread over a substrate, the volatilization of solvent speeds up at the gas–liquid interface near the contact line or the gas–liquid-colloidal particle boundary. This scenario is much more serious for the pristine pre-PVK ink film, giving rise to the interface tension-driven flow carrying the particles as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c. More specifically, the flow and evaporative perturbations during the blading process will induce local solidification and particle aggregation, which in return exacerbates the perturbations, and the vicious circle will result in a rough and inhomogeneous perovskite film. However, the DSPC surfactant can considerably alleviate the evaporative perturbations, liquid flow and particle aggregation by enhancing the viscous force over capillary force, thus permitting the formation of smooth, uniform and high-quality perovskite films. This is because the hydrophilic heads of gemini surfactant have an affinity interaction with the intermediate phase as well as the polar solvent, which drives the self-assembly of the surfactants into an ordered structure with an enhanced viscosity as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c. The real-time viscosity evolution in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b demonstrates the pivotal role of the LCGS in retarding solidification of the liquid inks. Fundamentally, the surfactant activity of LCGS is superior to SCGS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] in that only a very small amount is sufficient to reduce surface tension and optimize perovskite film morphologies without incurring significant adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">To quantify the surfactant effect on the blading process, capillary number (Ca) is perhaps a good metric, which is the dimensionless ratio of viscous force (f<sub><italic>vis</italic></sub>) to surface tension (f<sub><italic>sur</italic></sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ1_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Ca</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mtext>f</mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">vis</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mtext>f</mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">sur</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">μ</mml:mi><mml:mtext>v</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">γ</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Eventually, all of the liquid film, intermediate phase film, and perovskite film are flat and seamless owing to the assistance of DSPC in the blading process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Perovskite Films Blade-Coated with the Long-Chain Gemini Surfactant</title><p id="Par26">In this Section, DSPC as the above-established LCGS is used to form perovskite films for the following study.

Generally observed are strong diffraction signals at 14.08°, 28.40° and 31.86°, which are assigned to (110), (220) and (310) planes of tetragonal perovskite, respectively. Minor diffraction signals at 19.98°, 24.48°, 34.95°, 40.65° and 43.17° are assigned to the (112), (202), (312), (224) and (314) planes, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

As shown in Fig. S10, the annealing temperature was optimized at 150 °C for the highest crystallinity.

In addition, there is a blue shift from pristine perovskite (822 nm) to DSPC-based perovskite (820 nm), suggestive of the suppressed non-radiative recombination by DSPC. TRPL profiles of the corresponding perovskite films are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e and the extracted parameters are summarized in Table S1.

Additionally, adding DSPC significantly reduces the portion of τ<sub>1</sub> (from A<sub>1</sub> = 0.43 for pristine perovskite to A<sub>1</sub> = 0.34 for DSPC-perovskite), further proving the effective suppression of non-radiative recombination in perovskite films, especially at perovskite surfaces and interfaces.</p><p id="Par28">The perovskite films were carefully characterized to better understand the defect passivation effect of DSPC in the perovskite films induced by the interaction between DSPC and the defects. First of all, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to investigate the coordination interaction involving DSPC in the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. S12, the pristine perovskite shows negligible O 1<italic> s</italic> signal, whereas the DSPC-perovskite presents an obvious O 1<italic> s</italic> signal at 532.40 eV, confirming the existence of DSPC in the perovskite film after thermal annealing.

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to investigate the energy band structure of perovskite. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, the Fermi level was determined to be − 4.85 and − 5.05 eV, respectively, for pristine and DSPC-based perovskite films, locating the corresponding valance band maximums (VBMs) at − 5.59 and − 5.63 eV. The narrowed energetic difference between Fermi level and VBM from 1.34 to 1.02 eV indicates the increased hole carrier concentration after the DSPC incorporation (Fig. S13).</p><p id="Par29">The carrier mobility and defect density of perovskite film were estimated from space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement.

For computational convenience, the defect passivation groups (= PO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup> and -NR<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>) were used instead of the whole molecule, which is justified since there is no essential chemical difference between the two in terms of the defect passivation ability of the additive. The bonding structure between the additive and the perovskite crystal surface was obtained from the density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The charge difference and Bader charge analysis show that binding energy of DSPC at I vacancy is high (−5.76 eV), while it is low at A site vacancy (only −1.64 eV), i.e., the MA/FA sites. Charge density distributions of DSPC at I vacancy thereby are clearly shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h, in which high local electron density is marked in yellow, and low electron density is marked in blue. It can be seen that there is a relatively high electron density around the oxygen atom with an average increase of 1.40 e due to the high electronegativity of oxygen, and there is a low electron density around the Pb atom with an average decrease of 1.07 e. Taking DSPC molecule as a whole for the calculation, there is an average gain of 0.63 e. This electron transfer from perovskite to DSPC molecule confirms the formation of chemical bond between the two. Furthermore, in order to investigate the effect of additives on the intragap states, the total density of states (tDOS) for the perovskite without and with DSPC was calculated, and the result is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>i. Clearly, there are intragap states in the pristine perovskite associated with iodine vacancies (V<sub>I</sub>) in the perovskite (see the green line spectrum). To our delight, such intragap states could be eliminated by the DSPC molecule (see the yellow line spectrum), demonstrating its effectiveness for passivating the trap states. Since such intragap states in a semiconductor always serve as non-radiative recombination centers, their reduction will decrease the pernicious non-radiative recombination and improve photovoltaic performance of devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].

Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a shows performance comparisons between the sub-cells in the modules based on the pristine perovskite and the perovskite with the different gemini surfactants with a mask hole set active area of 4.32 cm<sup>2</sup>. Remarkably, an average PCE of 15.80% was achieved for the sub-cells in the DSPC-perovskite based module, which is much higher than that of 11.67% for the pristine-perovskite based module. Figure S17 shows detailed comparisons of the measured photoelectric parameters including <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub>, <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>, and <italic>FF</italic>. As expected, the better photovoltaic performance of the DSPC-perovskite based module is attributed to the much more homogeneous morphology and the longer carrier lifetime of the DSPC-based perovskite film with lower nonradiative recombination. Importantly, a certified efficiency of 15.46% with <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> of 1.131 V and <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> of 22.917 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> was achieved for the fully blade coating prepared carbon based perovskite solar modules with a mask hole area of 4.32 cm<sup>2</sup>, as shown in Fig. S19. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the record efficiency, <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> and <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> for carbon electrode based perovskite solar modules (Table S2). The PV efficiency also increases with the length of alkyl chain. According to our latest laboratory results with another LCGS (DDOCPC, 52C), the PV efficiency has reached 17.05% for the module with HTL and 15.26% for the HTL-free module with an active area of 50 cm<sup>2</sup> (Table S2 and Fig. S21).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Statistic distributions of PCE for the single sub-cell cut from the carbon electrode perovskite solar modules without or with different gemini surfactant doping (active area: 4.32 cm<sup>2</sup>). <bold>b</bold> SEM cross-section images of carbon electrode based perovskite solar modules. <bold>c</bold> IPCE spectra and integrated photocurrent curve of the devices with or without DSPC. <bold>d</bold> Long-term stability of the carbon electrode perovskite solar module with DSPC doping</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40820_2023_1155_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par32">The maximum power point (MPP) tracking profile is shown in Fig. S22 for the HTL-free PSC module under AM 1.5G illumination, and one sees a well stabilized power output in the operating state in ambient air. Clearly, the excellent defect passivation and the great improvement of perovskite film quality with the help of DSPC have effectively promoted the photovoltaic performance and the operational stability of perovskite solar modules. For a more life-like demonstration, Video S2 gives a flavor on the operation of the carbon-based perovskite solar modules under outdoor sunlight. The 30 cm × 30 cm array composed of 9 modules could easily power a household electric fan, further demonstrating the practicability and operation stability of carbon-based perovskite solar modules.</p><p id="Par33">The <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> is determined by the light absorbance and charge transport and collection efficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. While the light absorption of the DSPC-based perovskite is slightly higher than that of the pristine one (Fig. S11c). In order to avoid the influence of the unilluminated sub-cell in the series module, single sub-cell was cut from the module to measure the external quantum efficiency (EQE) in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c. The highest EQE is over 90% and the integrated current density is 22.8 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>, which indicates that the device with DSPC has a good light utilization due to the enhanced charge transport and collection efficiencies and due to the reduced recombination. Furthermore, we tested the long-term stability of the perovskite modules under a humid ambient atmosphere (25 ± 5 °C, 50 ± 5% RH). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d, the devices were very stable, and to our surprise, the PCE actually increased by 1.4% after half a year. We suspect that the high module stability can be largely ascribed to the hydrophobic nature of carbon electrode which can prevent the perovskite layer from moisture penetration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and to the hydrophobic alkyl chains of DSPC molecules intertwined with perovskite which could create a barrier to moisture ingress and realize a sort of in-film encapsulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par34">Utility scale production of perovskite solar modules relies on low-cost printing of high-quality large-area perovskite films. However, we have shown that the pristine pre-PVK ink for blade coating suffers the interface tension-driven flow induced by local evaporation and solidification, leading to uncontrollable crystallization of intermediate phases and the eventual formation of holey and cracky perovskite films. To tackle this problem, we have demonstrated the critical roles of long alkyl chain gemini-surfactants in successfully blade coating uniform, dense and smooth large-area perovskite films. The rheological property and solidification process of the perovskite are greatly modified by the gemini surfactants with polar heads and hydrophobic tails, which mediate an orderly crossed assembly of the colloidal particles and thus greatly increase the viscosity of the pre-PVK ink. The large increase of viscosity pushes up the viscous force against the capillary force, i.e., the capillary number, according to the lubrication approximation theory. The key is a large enhancement of capillary number in the perovskite ink with only a tiny amount of DSPC, which retards the fluidity, decreases the volatilization rate, extends the solidification time, and thus considerably alleviates the influences of uncontrollable solidification during the blade coating process. Consequently, the coverage and smoothness of perovskite films are significantly improved, allowing to achieve high-efficiency perovskite solar modules. The surfactant additive, albeit in a very small amount to not compromise the optoelectronic properties of perovskite, could effectively modulate perovskite crystallization kinetics, optimized energy level alignment, and neutralized charge defects. A record certificated efficiency of 15.46% for the fully blade-coated carbon-based perovskite solar modules was achieved with the assistance of DSPC doping, and the efficiency even increased by 1.4% after 6 months of storage in a humid ambient atmosphere. This work paves the way for pushing the fully printed and highly-efficient and stable perovskite solar modules towards commercialization.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (U2001217, 22261160370 and 21972006), Guangdong- Hong Kong- Macao Joint Innovation Foundation (2021A0505110003), Shenzhen Basic Research (JCYJ20220818101018038 and JCYJ20200109110628172), Guangdong Province Regional Joint Innovation Foundation (2020B1515120039).</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Open access funding provided by Shanghai Jiao Tong University.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par35">The authors declare no interest conflict.
