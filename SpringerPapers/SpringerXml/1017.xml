id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">An energy system is composed of multiple components that interact to produce, convert, and deliver energy for a specific end-use. Energy systems can be analyzed through both an engineering and economic lens. In the USA, the residential, commercial, industrial, and transportation sectors represent end-use sectors. Traditionally, end-users were purely consumers of energy and converted that energy to useful services or products. Over the past decade, particularly in the power sector, end-consumers have also become independent, self-generators. In some instances, distributed power generators (such as homeowners, or commercial or industrial facilities) have become “prosumers”—those that produce and sell power and other services to the power grid—and consumers.</p><p id="Par3"><bold>Figure</bold> <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig"><bold>1</bold></xref> shows the flow, conversion, and end-use of energy in the USA for 2020. Petroleum, natural gas, and coal comprised 79% of energy production,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> with nearly all petroleum use in the transportation sector. Coal is nearly completely used for power generation. Natural gas serves power, industry, and transportation. Renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower serve the electric sector.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Total energy consumption rose to about 101 quads (107 EJ) in 2018 followed by a drop to 93 quads in 2020 due to COVID-19 impacts—a level of consumption reduction unseen since 1949. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) attributes this drop to the COVID-19 pandemic that disrupted all energy consuming sectors, with the transportation sector experiencing the largest (15%) drop.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Estimated US energy consumption in 2020.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup></p><p>Source: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43577_2021_244_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par4">It is noteworthy that more than two-thirds of energy produced in the USA is “rejected.” The bulk of rejected energy typically takes the form of waste heat. For example, many coal power plants have overall plant efficiency of 30–40%, while technologies such as natural gas combined cycle and ultrasupercritical coal gasification are approaching 70% efficiencies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> Much of the US coal fleet is more than 30 years old,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> with relatively low overall efficiencies. Significant energy is also rejected in the transport and industrial sectors.</p><p id="Par5">Electrification offers the opportunity to rethink not only how (via what energy carrier) energy services are provided, but also scale. For example, we don’t need a 1:1 ratio of electricity to replace petroleum for transportation. That ratio is more like 1:5. The whole US transportation industry has a net end-use of 5 quads of energy, while it takes 24.3 quads of mostly petroleum to supply that end-use today. Replacing internal combustion with more efficient electric alternatives means we would only need about 6 quads of electricity to serve the same transportation demand.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Global scaling of low-carbon energy under various scenarios</title><p id="Par6">The United Nation’s dedicated body for assessing climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), released the report “Global Warming of 1.5°C” to identify the risks and offer mitigation options in the face of a rapidly warming world.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> With the exception of “overshoot” scenarios as described by the IPCC, 2050 is the definitive year in which net-zero levels of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions must be met. Achieving net zero by 2050 implies all fossil fuel consumption needs to be replaced with or converted to zero-carbon energy alternatives. If GHG emissions continued past 2050, as in the overshoot scenarios, billions of tons of carbon dioxide would need to be removed from the atmosphere annually, using technology that has not yet been applied on a global scale.</p><p id="Par7">The pathways with no overshoot or limited 1.5°C overshoot (as previously described) require a rapid, worldwide energy system transition that results in emission reductions across all sectors, including infrastructure, transportation, buildings, and industrial systems. These pathways require pronounced system changes, particularly within the next 20 years.</p><p id="Par8">Other features of energy system pathways with no overshoot or limited overshoot (as previously described) include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par9">Faster electrification of energy end-use</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10">Lower energy use to meet energy service demand (through enhanced energy efficiency)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11">Higher share of low-emission energy sources, particularly before 2050</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par12">Greater share (70–85%) of renewable energy-generated electricity in 2050</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par13">Lower shares of gas-generated electricity (8%) and close to zero shares of coal-generated electricity (0–2%)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par14">Higher shares of nuclear- and fossil fuel-generated electricity with carbon dioxide capture and storage</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par15">A more recent analysis by the International Energy Agency (IEA) focused on achieving net-zero energy systems globally, and outlines fundamental transformation of global energy systems.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> While scenarios of pathways to future net-zero energy economies are derived from a set of assumptions and limited by modeling capabilities, they serve as useful benchmarks to inform decision-making and, in particular, needed innovation. The IEA’s path to net‐zero emissions outlined is “narrow but achievable,” and implies that decisions made within the next decade will have profound impact on that path’s trajectory. Per their analysis, and central assumptions, a 40% larger world economy will need to use 7% less energy in 2030, achieved through efficiency measures and significant electrification. Reducing carbon dioxide emissions would be complemented by a 75% drop in fossil fuel-driven methane emissions; deploying renewable energy technologies plays a key role in this systemic transformation as shown in <bold>Figure</bold> <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig"><bold>2</bold></xref>. By 2025, coal would be globally displaced by renewable energy sources (e.g., hydro, wind, solar PV, bioenergy, geothermal) as the dominant electricity provider. By 2030, renewable energy would provide nearly 40% of electricity supply and meet 80% of global electricity demand.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup><fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Anticipated changes in renewable power, electric vehicles, and energy intensity of GDP for the International Energy Agency (IEA) net-zero scenario.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup></p><p>Source: IEA.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43577_2021_244_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Example of an integrated energy system scaling energy vectors and infrastructures at the customer, city, and regional levels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup></p><p>Source: M.

Electric vehicles will comprise more than 60% of global car sales by 2030, with all new sales of internal combustion engine cars ceasing by 2035. Other sectors previously dominated by fossil fuel dependence will also electrify their technologies, including heat pumps in buildings and electric furnaces for steel production. All coal and oil power plants without emissions abatement measures in place will be phased out by 2040.</p><p id="Par17">Today’s hydropower and nuclear energy sectors serve as essential foundations for future transitions; solar and wind sectors see the greatest demand for rapidly scaled integration. Solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind-generated energy will need to be integrated into the global energy system at a rate of 630 GW and 390 GW, respectively, on an annual basis up to 2030—a quadrupled rate of integration than the records set in those sectors in 2020. With these 2030 targets in place, the pathway to 2050 leads to an energy sector based mostly on renewable energy; renewable resources will generate 90% of the world’s electricity. Solar PV and wind comprise nearly 70% of supply combined, leveraging their increased capacities of 20-fold and 11-fold, respectively.</p><p id="Par18">Decarbonizing power may include carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS), advanced nuclear and renewable generation.

Further, advanced synthetic methodologies will be needed to access these next-generation materials, especially given the emphasis on multifunctionality and precise control over material properties at the atomic-, nano-, and mesoscales.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup> More importantly, as power systems evolve to incorporate significantly more variable renewables, the technologies for power-to-chemicals must also evolve to not only efficiently and cost effectively conduct their primary purpose, but also to be a value-added element of the broader energy system.

Looking across the energy economy, strategies based on decarbonized power as the backbone of the energy economy pose fundamental strategic differences from history. Separate sectors, particularly petrochemicals, power, and mobility are becoming increasingly integrated. The forthcoming deeper sector integration implies the need not only for reassessing the historical approaches to materials for energy systems and processes, but also for rethinking our innovation ecosystem. That is, traditionally, fundamental research in materials has been performed by teams independent from the device and process development engineers. Given the time constraints to innovate and scale to commercially viable projects at sufficient scale to achieve deep decarbonization by 2050, creating multidisciplinary teams spanning fundamental science, computational sciences, and engineering, with behavioral scientists and business managers from across multiple sectors, will be increasingly important. These cross-functional teams will hopefully accelerate the time from fundamental innovation to commercial viability and roll out.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Disclaimer</title><p>This work was authored in part by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, operated by Alliance for Sustainable Energy, LLC, for the US Department of Energy (DOE) under Contract No. DE-AC36-08GO28308.
