Body-mounted energy-harvesting devices are critical for expanding the range of activity and functionality of cyborg insects. However, their power outputs are limited to less than 1 mW, which is considerably lower than those required for wireless locomotion control. The area and load of the energy harvesting device considerably impair the mobility of tiny robots. Here, we describe the integration of an ultrasoft organic solar cell module on cyborg insects that preserves their motion abilities. Our quantified system design strategy, developed using a combination of ultrathin film electronics and an adhesive–nonadhesive interleaving structure to perform basic insect motion, successfully achieved the fundamental locomotion of traversing and self-righting. The body-mounted ultrathin organic solar cell module achieves a power output of 17.2 mW. We demonstrate its feasibility by displaying the recharging wireless locomotion control of cyborg insects.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>78</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>29</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41528_2022_Article_207.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Optical and Electronic Materials</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Polymer Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry and Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Cyborgs, which are integrations of machines and organisms, can be used not only to substitute an organism’s defective body parts, but also to realise functions that exceed the organism’s normal capabilities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Advancements in electronics have resulted in the increasing integration of organisms and machines. The miniaturisation and fabrication of low-power consumption semiconducting chips through micro/nanofabrication have resulted in small-organism cyborgs. In particular, cyborg insects with small integrated circuits to control their behaviour have been proposed for applications such as urban search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and inspection of dangerous areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The integration of thin and soft electronics into organisms can improve their ease of use in numerous applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Stretchable electronics enable the integration of devices on three-dimensional curved surfaces with movable joints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The evolution of electronics that can be integrated with organisms has increased the demand for the development of power supply devices with higher power densities. The volume and weight limitations of batteries for untethered robots can be overcome using recharging strategies such as having robots return to designated recharging locations before their batteries run out<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and supplying power to batteries wirelessly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. An energy-harvesting device mounted on a robot can expand its range of activities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. A biofuel cell that generates power from an insect’s body is a promising energy-harvesting device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. To date, 333 μW is the highest output power achieved with enzymatic biofuel cells. Battery charging and circuit driving have been achieved for this power output for walking cockroaches<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Advanced functions, such as the wireless locomotion control of cyborg insects, require energy-harvesting devices that can generate several milliwatts or higher. A solar cell can generate 10 mW cm<sup>–2</sup> or higher power under outdoor sunlight conditions; this technology can generate the highest power output available under outdoor conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. A rigid silicon solar cell mounted on an immovable insect is used to charge lithium–polymer batteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Emergent solar cells, including organic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, perovskite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and quantum dot cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, can achieve high power per weight because of their reduced substrate and passivation thicknesses, which is beneficial for achieving integration in living small insects. Ultrathin organic solar cells having a total thickness of less than 5 μm can achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.8% resulting in a power per weight of 33.8 W g<sup>–1</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">However, achieving a power output of 10 mW or higher using energy harvesters mounted on living movable insects for wireless locomotion control remains challenging. To integrate devices into small animals with limited surface areas and carry loads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, device design and integration strategy of large-area solar cells is required to obtain sufficient power output and simultaneously maintain the basic behavioural abilities of insects. Because the output power of the solar cell is proportional to the area, both the load of the device and the contact between the device and the moving joints considerably impair motion abilities.</p><p id="Par6">In this article, we report a power-rechargeable cyborg insect that uses a mounted ultrasoft organic solar cell module that does not impair the insect’s basic motion abilities, and demonstrate recharging wireless locomotion control with all components integrated on insects. A combination of ultrathin film electronics and an adhesive–nonadhesive interleaving structure on the insect abdomen exhibited a success rate of greater than 80% in self-righting attempts. The effect of film attachment on the basic motion was quantified using an approximated buckling load model. An ultrathin organic solar cell module achieved a power output of 17.2 mW on the curved abdomen of the insect, which charged a lithium polymer battery to operate the wireless locomotion control module.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Structure of the rechargeable cyborg insect</title><p id="Par7"><italic>Gromphadorhina portentosa</italic> (<italic>G. portentosa</italic>, Madagascar hissing cockroach) was used in this study. Electronic components were mounted on the dorsal side of the insect (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). A wireless locomotion control module consisting of wireless communication circuits, stimulation voltage controller circuits, boosting circuits, and a lithium–polymer battery was mounted on the thorax with the support of a three-dimensional (3D)-printed soft backpack that followed the curved surface of the thorax (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). A 4 µm thick organic solar cell module was attached to the abdomen. The power generated by the ultrathin organic solar cell under simulated sunlight (100 mW cm<sup>–2</sup>) was boosted to 4.2 V by using a boosting circuit to charge the battery, and the battery supplied power to the wireless locomotion control module. Locomotion control signals were transferred wirelessly from the external server using Bluetooth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). Stimulation signals were applied to the cerci through wires to wirelessly control locomotion of the insect (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Cerci are paired appendages on the rearmost segments of the abdomen.

The backpack was designed using a precise 3D model of <italic>G. portentosa</italic> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>), and 3D printed with an elastic polymer. The columnar structure at the bottom matches the curved surface shape (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Owing to the soft material and columnar structure, the backpack designed using the design extracted from an individual insect can tolerate the difference in shape existing between individual insects and make good adhesion (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). The adhesion of the backpack attached to the thorax was secured even after a month in the breeding environment, which confirmed that the backpack adhered to the body for the long term. By contrast, the adhesion between rigid components using the conventional adhesion method using beeswax delaminated from the thorax after 30 min in ambient room temperature (approximately 20 °C)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Motion ability of insects with thin films</title><p id="Par9">A design strategy for mounting ultrathin films onto the abdomen was established that did not interfere with the basic motion of insects. Cross-sectional observation of the abdomen revealed that each segment partially overlapped during the deformation of the abdomen (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref> and Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>). The stroke of each segment was up to 2.5 mm. Freedom of movement of the abdomen was realised by using the combined technology of ultrathin polymer films and an adhesive–nonadhesive interleaving structure that allowed film bending (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). After attaching films on the abdomen with a resin adhesive, the adhesive can be naturally removed from the part that overlaps with other segments when deformed, and the film exhibits a hollow structure that selectively adheres only to the part that does not overlap. This adhesive–nonadhesive interleaving structure leaves space for the film to bend upward as the segment moves (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref> and Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>). Similar outward bending was observed with parylene films of various thicknesses by using a 3D model mimicking the abdominal segments (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Fundamental behavioural ability with electronics.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic cross-sectional illustration of abdominal segments with thin films attached using an adhesive-nonadhesive interleaving structure.

The fixed abdomen increased the required time for traversing the obstacles (2.4 s to 4.2 s as median values) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). Whereas the 3 µm thick film with an adhesive–nonadhesive interleaving structure achieved approximately the same time of traversing as that with no film attached (median of 2.2 s). This shows that the fixation of each segment considerably impairs this deformability and limits motion and that the thin-film attachment strategy effectively secures the freedom of movement.</p><p id="Par11">The effectiveness was further verified by evaluating the successful self-righting ability from an upside-down orientation on the ground (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref>). The righting success rate of <italic>G. portentosa</italic> with no films attached was 99%, which is consistent with previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Thin films with various Young’s moduli and thicknesses were attached to the abdomens of <italic>G. portentosa</italic>. When parylene films (Young’s modulus of 4.0 GPa) were attached to the abdomen with an adhesive–nonadhesive interleaving structure, the righting success rates were 96 and 81% for the 5- and 10 µm thick films, respectively. For 15- and 20 µm thick films, the success rates were reduced to 46 and 16%, respectively (Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">3</xref>). A similar tendency was observed when soft polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Young’s modulus of 3.3 MPa) was attached to the abdomen (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref> and Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">4</xref>). By contrast, the righting success rate was 10% when the 2 µm thick parylene film was adhered to the abdomen without the interleaving structure. These results confirm that the combination of sufficiently thin film and the interleaving structure retains the mobility of the insects (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). Additionally, we confirmed the 3 µm thick parylene films with interleaving structure mounted on the insect did not falling off for at least 3 days.</p><p id="Par12">Numerical relations between the abdominal conditions and the success rate of self-righting were detailed using an approximated buckling load model. The deformation of the film because of the stroke of an abdominal segment can be approximated by the buckling of a simple column fixed at both ends<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The buckling load can be obtained from the film thickness and Young’s modulus of the film to be attached (Eqs. (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>–<xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="disp-formula">3</xref>) in Methods, and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). The buckling loads were obtained as a function of the film thickness for both parylene and PDMS films using the given shape parameters of the abdominal segment (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>). The relationship between the buckling load and righting success rate exhibited consistency for both films, which confirmed the validity of the approximation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>). A buckling load of less than 0.05 N ensured a success rate of 80%, whereas further increment caused a sharp decrease in the rate. Thus, the force that abdominal segments of <italic>G. portentosa</italic> can generate range from 0.05 to 0.1 N, which is consistent with values with previously reported forces of legs during righting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. We conducted repeated self-righting attempts for an individual and for multiple individuals. Some individuals showed high success rate for multiple such attempts, whereas others showed 0% or very low success rate, confirming clear individual differences. The large error bars represent a boundary region that depends on the muscle strength of the individual.</p><p id="Par13">The qualitative analysis of self-righting attempts confirmed that fundamental motion was achieved even when flexible electronics were integrated into insects (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>, Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">5</xref>). When a 4 μm thick organic solar cell module was attached to the abdomen of a cockroach, 100% successful self-righting attempts were achieved, which confirmed that the ultrathin organic solar cell module ensured motion of insects. Unlike the adhesion of a thin film onto the abdomen, attaching a thick film (100 µm thick) with the support of the backpack on the thorax has a minor effect on self-righting ability. The success rate was 93% when the thorax had a thick film, whereas the abdomen had no film. When 3 µm thick and 10 µm thick films were attached to the abdomen, the success rates were 80 and 13%, respectively. Thus, the results of the attempts with different conditions confirm that a relatively thick film can be mounted onto the thorax of <italic>G. portentosa</italic> to achieve fundamental motion, whereas the abdomen requires a film with a specific softness and a designed attachment strategy to allow sufficient deformation for motion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Performance of ultrathin organic solar cell module</title><p id="Par14">The ultrathin organic solar cell module achieves a high power output of up to 17.2 mW by maximizing the effective area of the curved surface shape of the abdomen of <italic>G. portentosa</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The abdomen of <italic>G. portentosa</italic> was approximated as a pentagon with an area of 777 mm<sup>2</sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). The module has a three-series connection considering the efficiency of the boosting converter (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). The effective area of the module was 3.96 cm<sup>2</sup>, which corresponded to an aperture ratio of 51% to the abdominal area. Because the insect body has a three-dimensional curved surface, the light intensity that each cell can receive depends on the angle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Based on the side and back shapes of the 3D model, the angles of the dorsal surface of <italic>G. portentosa</italic> with respect to the vertical line were set as <italic>θ</italic> and <italic>δ</italic>, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). The decrease in the light intensity in each region, that is, cos <italic>θ*</italic>cos <italic>δ</italic>, was estimated from both <italic>θ</italic> and <italic>δ</italic> in each region (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>). The module was designed to minimise intensity reduction resulting from the angle dependence of the surface. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref> shows the current–voltage (<italic>I</italic>–<italic>V</italic>) characteristics of the organic solar cell module. The flat ultrathin organic solar cell module exhibits a short current (<italic>I</italic><sub>SC</sub>) of 28.3 mA, an open-circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>) of 1.98 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.564, which resulted in a maximum power output of 31.5 mW, and PCE of 7.96% (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). The module attached on the 3D-printed curved surface model exhibits an <italic>I</italic><sub>SC</sub> of 22.8 mA, an open-circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>) of 1.92 V, and an FF of 0.394, which results in a maximum power output of 17.2 mW. The current decrement on the curved surface was estimated to be 0.78 times that of the flat state, which is in consistent with the actual current value when attached to the 3D surface (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>). The decrease in FF is related to the decrease in the shunt resistance because of the increase in the leakage current during the attachment process (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Large-area organic solar cell module for cyborg insects.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Top view design of organic solar cell module.

The insect’s self-righting attempts succeeded when the attached thin film with an adhesive–nonadhesive interleaving structure was sufficiently soft to avoid disturbing the deformation force of the muscles of the insects.

The fluorinated polymer layer (Novec 1700:7100 = 1:8) was then spin coated (MS-B100, Miksa) on a 50 mm × 50 mm glass at 4000 rpm for 1 min. Next, the fluorinated glass substrate was heated in an inert oven at 80 °C for 10 min. Before spin coating the transparent polyimide precursor, the glass/fluorinated polymer layer was treated with an oxygen plasma for 5 s at 50 W. The precursor was spin coated onto the substrate at 2000 rpm for 1 min to form a film with a thickness of approximately 2.4 μm. The transparent polyimide film was cured by an imidisation reaction at 250 °C for 2 h in an inert oven under a nitrogen atmosphere (DN411I, Yamato Scientific). An indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent electrode with a thickness of 100 nm was deposited on the substrate using a sputtering machine (SIH-1010, ULVAC, Inc.). The ITO electrode was patterned by photolithography, and 3.5 nm-thick Cr and 100 nm-thick Au layers were deposited onto the ITO electrode as supporting wires. PEIE chelated with Zn<sup>2+</sup> (PEI–Zn) was used as the electron transport layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The PEI–Zn precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 70 mg of zinc acetate dihydrate in 1 wt% PEIE 2-methoxyethanol. To form the PEI–Zn film, the precursor solution was spin coated at 3500 rpm for 45 s and subsequently thermally annealed at 180 °C for 30 min in air. PBDTTT-OFT (10 mg) and IEICO-4F (15 mg) in chlorobenzene (970 μL) were heated at 70 °C for 2 h. The additive, 1-chloronaphthalene (30 μL), was added to the solution and stirred at 70 °C for 5 min. The solution was spin coated in ambient air at 1400 rpm for 60 s to form a bulk heterojunction photoactive layer. Unnecessary areas were carefully removed using a cotton swab soaked in chloroform to connect each sub-cell in series. The dried samples were placed in a vacuum evaporator, and a hole-transporting layer of molybdenum oxide (MoO<sub>X</sub>, 7.5 nm) and an Ag anode (100 nm) were sequentially deposited through thermal evaporation at &lt;3 × 10<sup>−4</sup> Pa. Finally, a 1 μm-thick parylene layer was deposited through chemical vapor deposition to form a passivation layer. The solar cell module has three series and two parallel subcells with an effective area of 22 × 3 mm. The total effective area was 396 mm<sup>2</sup>, which corresponded to 51% of the aperture ratio of the abdominal area of <italic>G. portentosa</italic> (777 mm<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Module characterisation</title><p id="Par36">The current–voltage (<italic>I</italic>–<italic>V</italic>) characteristics of the OPVs were recorded under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>, with the intensity calibrated using a silicon reference solar cell) using a SourceMeter (Series2400, Keithley) under ambient laboratory conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Wireless locomotion control module and battery</title><p id="Par37">The wireless locomotion control module consisted of three rigid components, namely a stimulation voltage generation circuit, wireless communication circuit, and boosting converter. To receive the on/off status from the external server, a wireless communication module with nRF24L01 + (Nordic Semiconductor) was used. An Arduino Pro mini was used as the stimulus voltage generation circuit. For electrical stimulation of <italic>G. portentosa</italic>, pulse-width modulation control was programmed to produce a signal with 3.3 V, 50 Hz, and duty ratio of 50%. An energy-harvesting IC (LTC3105 250 mV low voltage boosting converter module, Strawberry Linux Co., Ltd.) was installed to stably charge the battery using the output from the organic solar cell module. The output power from the organic solar cell module was fixed at 0.95 V using a maximum power point controller with a 100 kΩ resistor, and the boosting converter increased the voltage to 4.2 V. A 3.7 V, 40 mAh lithium–polymer battery was used as the rechargeable battery. The overall dimensions of these components were W 18.0 mm × L 37.2 mm × H 18.3 mm, and the weight was 8.14 g, and these were mounted onto the thorax with the 3D-printed backpack.</p><p id="Par38">An Arduino Uno external server was used as the microcomputer board. A communication module equipped with an nRF24L01 + (Nordic Semiconductor) was used as the wireless module for communication. Furthermore, an Arduino Uno with a push-button switch was used to control the on/off state. The state of this button was transmitted to the module on the insect through a wireless communication module. The external server was connected to a PC to obtain a constant voltage of 5 V.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Charging test</title><p id="Par39">The lithium–polymer battery was discharged to 3.2 V using an electrochemical measurement system (HZ-7000, Hokuto Denko). The organic solar cell module attached to the 3D printed <italic>G. portentosa</italic> model was connected to the battery. The simulated 1-Sun light was applied continuously to the module directly from above, and the voltage between the batteries was monitored using a source meter (Series2400, Keithley).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Mounting of electric components onto the insect</title><p id="Par40">The surfaces of the thoracic and abdominal segments of <italic>G. portentosa</italic> were scraped evenly with sandpaper. The 3D printed backpack was attached to the first to third thoracic segments using a superglue (LOCTITE, LBR-005). The wireless locomotion control module and battery were attached to the backpack using a double-sided tape (Nystack™ NW-5, Nichiban Co., Ltd.). Holes were made on the side of the fifth abdominal segment and cerci using an insect needle (No. 1, Shiga Insect Spreading Co., Ltd.) or a scalpel. Silver microwires were connected to the holes and fixed using an ultraviolet curing epoxy resin (UV-LED resin star drop hard, Padico). An ultrathin organic solar cell module was attached to the whole abdomen using a resin-based adhesive for skins (Spirit Gum, Mitsuyoshi). Both the anodes and cathodes were connected to boosting converters using an anisotropic conductive tape (ECATT 9703, 3 M) and silver microwires.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Demonstration of recharging and wireless locomotion control of cyborg insect</title><p id="Par41">A simulated 1-Sun light was applied to <italic>G. portentosa</italic> to recharge the empty battery using a solar cell module. The total illumination duration was 30 min. A 2 min interval was set for every 10 min illumination to prevent the <italic>G. portentosa</italic> body temperature from rising too high. After the recharging process, a wireless electrical stimulation test was performed. When electrical stimulation was applied to the right cercus, the insect made the turn-right locomotion. The time during which the control server and the electrical stimulation module communicated was measured to evaluate the total energy provided to the battery by the organic solar cell module. To confirm whether electrical stimulation achieved effective control, the trajectory of the rear end of <italic>G. portentosa</italic> was recorded using a video camera and analysed using MATLAB (The MathWorks).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was partially supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science under its Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) (no.
