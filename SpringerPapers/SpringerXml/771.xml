sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">The renewable electricity-powered CO<sub>2</sub> reduction has been considered as one promising route to the product of chemical feedstocks, which might close the carbon loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Multi-carbon (C2+) products such as ethylene, ethanol, n-propanol, etc. are important raw materials in the chemical industry or can be used directly as fuels, thus the efficient CO<sub>2</sub> reduction to C2+ products system is essential to the production of high-value commodity chemicals with a net negative carbon emissions footprint. Among various CO<sub>2</sub> reduction catalyst materials, Cu has been studied extensively as it can produce C2+ products with appreciable selectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Among numerous ways to promote C2+ formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, adjusting the facet of Cu-based catalysts is an effective method since the dimerization reaction is facet sensitive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. According to the theoretical calculations, the Cu(100) facet can significantly lower the dimerization energy barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Thus, it is an effective approach to improve the selectivity toward C2+ by designing Cu catalysts with Cu(100) as the dominant exposed facet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Colloidal chemistry is an inexpensive, simple, and widely used method for facet exposure control. It produces catalysts with preferential exposure of specific facets by using capping agents to manipulate surface energies, which changes the growth rates of different facets to alter the shape of nanocatalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Recently, colloidally synthesized Cu nanocubes rich in Cu(100) facets were shown to achieve a Faradaic efficiency (F.E.) of ~57% towards ethylene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, the corresponding electricity conversion efficiency (E.C.E.) and single-pass yield have been rarely reported. Some studies also propose that the intermediates along the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction pathways can control the formation of specific facets, where the adsorption of the intermediates plays a role analogous to that of capping agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, these approaches require specific chemicals, such as capping agents, to be selectively adsorbed on particular facets to reduce the surface energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However, the effectiveness of the colloidal method might compromise to some extent since low-index facets of fcc transition metals often possess similar surface energies (1.25 J cm<sup>−2</sup> for Cu(111) and 1.43 J cm<sup>−2</sup> for Cu(100))<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Besides, residual capping agents left on the catalyst surface could block catalytically active sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Moreover, the colloidally synthesized catalyst needs to be dispersed in a solution containing polymer binders (such as Nafion) to form a well-mixed ink before being drop-casted on the conductive support to form an electrode, which is not always compatible with the catalytic electrode system due to agglomeration and the peeling-off of catalysts especially when scaling up the electrodes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. At the same time, due to the existence of the cross-linked network formed by polymer binders<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, the contact between the colloidally synthesized catalyst and the conductive substrate is weak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and plenty of active sites are further encapsulated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, which will lead to slow electron transfer and low E.C.E. Thus, it is highly desirable to develop a novel approach to replace colloidal synthesis to prepare Cu electrodes with dominant (100) facets in one-step without using capping agents and polymer binders to achieve a high E.C.E. and a single-pass yield.</p><p id="Par5">In this work, we describe the design and realization of a dynamic deposition-etch-bombardment process to produce Cu(100)-rich films as the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction electrode in one-step, which could break the limitation of using capping agents while avoiding the issue of catalyst loading faced by conventional methods. This Cu(100)-rich film yields a full-cell electricity conversion efficiency of 40.5% towards C2+ products in the 4 cm<sup>2</sup>-membrane electrode assemble (MEA) system. This facile one-step method also makes it easier for scaling up electrodes, with a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> electrode exhibiting a 13.2% single-pass yield of C2+ product at a total current of 12 A in the MEA system. Thanks to the controllable structure, the influence of facets on the adsorption and activation of intermediates is further revealed by in situ spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par6">To amplify, when Cu atoms with high kinetic energy bombard the deposited Cu film, the high local temperature causes dynamic recrystallization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Facets with the relatively loose atomic arrangement, like Cu(100) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1c</xref>), would receive less damage and remain at lower temperatures thereby acting as recrystallization centers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. As a result, the Cu(100) will preferentially grow, replacing the more densely packed Cu(111) facet (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1b</xref>). Therefore, by controlling the kinetic energy of bombarding copper atoms, the exposure ratio of Cu(100) facets could be adjusted.</p><p id="Par7">To realize the simultaneous deposition, etching, and bombardment, high-energy radio frequency (RF) sputtering was adopted to prepare Cu(100)-rich films (details in the “Methods”), which enables the direct deposition of catalysts on carbon-based gas diffusion layers (GDLs) as electrodes in one-step (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>). Three typical types of sputtered Cu films with different Cu(100) proportions were obtained by adjusting the RF power to control the kinetic energy (E<sub>k</sub>) of the bombarding Cu atoms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, details in “Methods”), resulting in low-power, medium-power, and high-power sputtered Cu films (denoted as LS-Cu, MS-Cu, HS-Cu, respectively). The obtained HS-Cu film is prone to expose the Cu(100) facet, as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>) and X-ray diffraction (XRD, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>), while LS-Cu tends to form Cu(111) facet (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>).

As different Cu facets feature distinctive OH<sup>−</sup> electrochemical adsorption behaviors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, surface structures of these samples were probed by using the OH<sup>−</sup> electroadsorption technique (the features were labeled by comparing the CVs to those of single crystals shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of OH<sub>ads</sub> peaks (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3b</xref>) reveal that the presence of Cu(111) is suppressed in the HS-Cu film.

To increase the ECSA, an oxidation−reduction procedure was included, during which the preferential exposure of Cu(100) could be maintained. Specifically, molecular O<sub>2</sub> (with a constant partial pressure of 0.67 Pa) was introduced during this deposition-etch-bombardment process to obtain Cu<sub>2</sub>O as precatalysts, which could be further reduced during the pre-reduction process (−0.5 V vs. the RHE) under the same CO<sub>2</sub> reduction conditions to metallic Cu with the Cu(100) facets retained (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, details in “Methods”).

Therefore, the introduction of an oxidation-reduction step will be able to increase the ECSA while retaining the same Cu(100) exposure. Correspondingly, samples obtained by reactive sputtering followed by reduction are referred to as low-power, medium-power, and high-power reactively sputtered Cu films followed by reduction (denoted as LRS-Cu, MRS-Cu, and HRS-Cu). Typical XRD patterns (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5a</xref>) show that all the obtained precatalysts are mainly Cu<sub>2</sub>O, which is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Auger spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5b, c</xref>), and Raman spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4d</xref>). The same type of Cu facets distribution could be maintained for these electrodes regardless of the oxidation-reduction process according to TEM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c–e</xref>, more images of different samples are also provided in Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>) and XRD (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>), consistent with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The different proportions of Cu(100) facet on these samples (i.e. HRS-Cu, MRS-Cu, and LRS-Cu) are also evidenced by the electrochemical OH<sup>−</sup> adsorption peaks on Cu(100) and Cu(111) at potentials of ~0.33 and 0.43 V versus the RHE (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Meanwhile, large ECSA is obtained for these samples (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Thus, this one-step surfactant-free route indeed leads to nanostructured Cu films with preferred Cu(100) exposure and high surface area that could be further used as CO<sub>2</sub> reduction electrodes.</p><p id="Par9">To further explore the importance of the high-energy atom bombardment proposed above, another control electrode was prepared. Cu<sub>2</sub>O precatalyst (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>) was obtained through wet chemistry without using capping agents (denoted as W-Cu). Then this control Cu<sub>2</sub>O precatalyst was airbrushed onto GDEs and pre-reduced to Cu under CO<sub>2</sub> reduction conditions to form a control electrode (details in “Methods”). The typical TEM image shows that the lattice fringes corresponding to Cu(111) are widely distributed in this control electrode (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.

It is also worth noting that LRS-Cu, MRS-Cu, HRS-Cu, and W-Cu all consist of metallic Cu only without residual oxides after the pre-reduction, as confirmed by in-situ Raman spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>, details in “Methods”). Thus, this control experiment reveals that the lack of high-energy atom bombardment during the synthesis process would result in the dominant exposure of Cu(111) facets, similar to the scenario of lacking capping agents that are widely used in the synthesis of Cu nanocubes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">Before performance testing, it was confirmed that different samples (LRS-Cu, MRS-Cu, HRS-Cu, and W-Cu) possess similar mass loadings (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>), catalyst layer thickness (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>) and morphology (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>) of Cu, which ensures a fair comparison to explore the activity difference among various samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The activities were evaluated at different potentials using 2 M KOH (aq.) as the electrolyte (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> and Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>, details in “Methods”) in a flow cell electrolyzer (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>) for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction with an effective electrode geometric area of ~0.64 cm<sup>2</sup> for both cathode and anode. As for HRS-Cu, the products detected in significant quantities were ethylene, ethanol, n-propanol, and CO. At more negative potentials, a small amount of methane was produced, and the remaining charge was attributed to the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Compared with the control samples, the HRS-Cu exhibits a maximum F.E. of 58.6% for ethylene, 86.6% for C2+ products (containing ethylene). Consistently, the HRS-Cu sample also exhibits the largest ethylene and C2+ products partial current densities (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17c, d</xref>) among the four samples at all applied potentials. Moreover, at the applied potential of −0.85 V versus the RHE, the C2+-to-C1 ratio of the HRS-Cu electrode reaches about 15.2, which largely outperforms that of its counterparts (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref>). Due to the close contact between the catalytic Cu film and the GDL substrate, the reaction system could exhibit higher E.C.E. The corresponding full-cell E.C.E. towards ethylene and C2+ products of this HRS-Cu-based reaction system reaches 24.8 and 36.5%, respectively, exceeding the efficiency of many other reaction systems reported so far (see below). The stability of the HRS-Cu was also examined under a constant applied potential of −0.75 V versus the RHE for 4.5 h (270 min), where ethylene and C2+ F.E.s remained stable over the test duration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>). Although the surface of the Cu-based catalysts may undergo reconstruction during the reaction to obtain Cu(100)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, the HRS-Cu, MRS-Cu, and LRS-Cu samples after use show similar surface exposures as before the reaction (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22</xref>), indicating that the reconstruction process could not significantly change the main facet exposure, and thus surface reconstruction alone cannot guarantee electrodes similar to the HRS-Cu (showing a predominant Cu(100) exposure without undergoing reconstruction). The mass of the HRS-Cu sample after the reaction is also almost the same as that before the reaction (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>), which further indicates that the firm conjunction between the substrate and the active composition.

It is clear that C2+ products formation depends strongly on the surface structure. With the increasing exposure of Cu(100) facets, a lower change of the Tafel slope can be observed, which indicates that the Cu(100) surface is beneficial to the formation of C2+ products. However, the Tafel slope of all samples locates at approximately 120−140 mV dec<sup>−1</sup>, implying that they might share the same rate-determining step (details in “Methods”), which is further validated by the results of CO partial pressure dependence experiments (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">25</xref>). To further compare the reaction rates, the performances are normalized to the ECSA (details in “Methods”). Obviously, the current densities of specific ethylene and C2+ products of HRS-Cu are larger than other electrodes (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">27</xref>), which indicates the highest intrinsic activities of HRS-Cu.</p><p id="Par12">Understanding the behaviors of adsorbates is essential to the inquiry into the nature of the catalytic activity. Thus, in-situ attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS, details in “Methods”) was applied to investigate the effect of facets exposure on the adsorption of intermediates. When the potential is swept from −0.1 to −1.5 V versus the RHE, a positive band centered at ~2050 cm<sup>−1</sup> which corresponds to the linear-bond CO (CO<sub>L</sub>, a reactive adsorbed species) is observed on all electrodes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a–c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">28</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, a small positive band centered at ~1800 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which corresponds to the bridge-bond CO (CO<sub>B</sub>, an unreactive adsorbed species)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> is also observed on the surface of other samples except the HRS-Cu. These results of the ATR-SEIRAS are also corroborated by the corresponding Raman spectra, where the HRS-Cu surface was covered by abundant CO<sub>L</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, while the LRS-Cu surface exhibited a pronounced appearance of CO<sub>B</sub> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">30</xref>). The appearance of CO<sub>B</sub> might result from the interconversion of CO<sub>L</sub>. According to the literature, when the *CO (*denotes the adsorbed species) coverage of the electrode decreases, a fraction of CO<sub>L</sub> would convert to CO<sub>B</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Therefore, the increase of CO<sub>B</sub> ratio reveals the reduction of surface *CO coverage. By calculating the CO<sub>B</sub> to CO<sub>L</sub> ratio of different samples, the *CO coverage might decrease as the exposure of Cu(100) facets decreases (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29</xref>). Normally, *H and *CO occupy most of the surface sites, so they are in direct competition with each other for surface sites. Meanwhile, the surface coverage of *CO eventually influences the distribution of products derived from CO<sub>2</sub> reduction. It has been previously speculated that when the surface cannot maintain a high *CO coverage, the corresponding *H coverage will increase, inhibiting the dimerization of *CO to produce C2+ products, thereby shifting the selectivity to C1 products and H<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, which is also demonstrated by the results of our CO partial pressure dependence experiments (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">25</xref>). Meanwhile, the results of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction performance support the above speculation. The LRS-Cu and the W-Cu with a lower exposure of Cu(100) facets exhibit the highest F.E. of methane, meanwhile, the methane F.E. increases rapidly as the potential becomes negative (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31</xref>). Thus, these ATR-SEIRAS results prove that Cu(100) facet might be a type of strong *CO adsorption site, and a higher exposure of Cu(100) facets is beneficial to the increase of strong adsorption sites on the surface that maintains a higher *CO coverage on the surface, thereby leading to the catalyst with a higher C−C coupling performance, which is also supported by other experimental and computational studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Spectroscopic investigations of various Cu films and DFT calculations on different Cu facets.</title><p>In situ ATR-SEIRAS spectra of <bold>a</bold> HRS-Cu; <bold>b</bold> MRS-Cu; <bold>c</bold> LRS-Cu; <bold>d</bold> adsorption geometry for different C−C coupling precursors (i.e., CO<sub>L</sub>−CO<sub>L</sub>, CO<sub>B</sub>−CO<sub>L</sub>, CO<sub>B</sub>−CO<sub>B</sub>), where solvent molecules are not presented to show the adsorbate configurations; <bold>e</bold> reaction barriers for C−C coupling from different precursors on Cu(100) and Cu(111) facets.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2021_26053_Fig3_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par13">Since the ATR-SEIRAS cannot directly provide the adsorption energy and activation barrier of the intermediate, DFT calculations on Cu(111) and Cu(100) (3×3) models were performed to further understand the facet exposure effect (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">32</xref>, details in “Methods”). Based on the Tafel analysis and CO partial pressure dependence study (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24</xref>), the energetics of *OCCO formation is chosen as the main consideration.

(Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>). In addition, the barriers of various C−C coupling processes are always higher on the Cu(111) facet than on Cu(100) facet, implying that *CO dimerization is the most sluggish step on the Cu(111) facet (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>). Thus, LRS-Cu and W-Cu are less active in catalyzing the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to C2+ products. These theoretical calculations are in good agreement with our ATR-SEIRAS and performance test results.</p><p id="Par15">Due to the impressive E.C.E of this HRS-Cu-based reaction system, a PV-EC system (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) was further constructed to demonstrate the photosynthesis of C2+ products. Using the same test conditions (electrolyzer, cathode, anode, and electrolyte, details in “Methods”) for measuring the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction performance on the cathode side (as in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), it is found that an overall cell voltage of about 2.5 V is required (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) to obtain an operating current density varying from 60 to 70 mA cm<sup>−2</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>), which could be translated to a cathodic potential of ~−0.55 V versus the RHE that yields ~45 and ~72% F.E. for ethylene and C2+ products (containing ethylene), respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). The deviation of these F.E.s from the maximized F.E.s for ethylene and C2+ products is because of the matching between electrolyzer and the solar panel towards the maximum power point (MPP) of the solar panel.

(58.6%) in the flow cell system (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). The optimal ethylene F.E. reaches 55.8%, while the corresponding full-cell E.C.E of ethylene and C2+ products increase to 26.4 and 40.2%, respectively. After ~4.5 h of operation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">41</xref>), the ethylene selectivity (50.4%) still remains above 90% of the initial value (55.8%). Although many works have obtained impressive CO<sub>2</sub> reduction selectivity, the single-pass yield for C2+ products is generally low (mostly below 3%, Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). In order to improve the single-pass yield of C2+ products, it is vital to further increase the current density and electrode area without affecting the transport of CO<sub>2</sub> (details in the “Methods”). Using the one-step method proposed in this work, a HRS-Cu electrode with 25 cm<sup>2</sup> activity area could be easily fabricated with the deposition-etch-bombardment process (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">42</xref>). In a 25 cm<sup>2</sup> MEA system (i.e., the area of cathodic flow fields is 25 cm<sup>2</sup>), the optimal ethylene F.E. of HRS-Cu reached 50.9% and maintained above 45% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">43</xref>) after ~3.5 h of operation at a total current of 12 A (i.e., 480 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>). The corresponding single-pass yield of CO<sub>2</sub> towards C2+ products increased to and 13.2%, with ethylene increased to 12.0%. However, a corresponding decrease in E.C.E. was observed (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). Therefore, using more efficient anode materials, while controlling the operating conditions of the device such as temperature and pressure, or designing a new flow field structure to enhance CO<sub>2</sub> mass transfer may be effective ways to further improve the E.C.E.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par19">In conclusion, this work demonstrates a deposition-etch-bombardment process that feasibly increases the exposure of Cu(100) facets in low-cost nanostructured Cu films. This strategy obviates the use of capping agents, achieving precise control of surface structures in a one-step approach. The obtained Cu(100)-rich film functions as a high-performance electrode for CO<sub>2</sub> reduction towards ethylene and C2+ products. In flow cell, it realized ethylene and C2+ (containing ethylene) F.E.s of 58.6 and 86.6%, respectively. In addition, this deposition-etch-bombardment method bypasses the electrode assembly process, avoids the use of polymer binders, enhances the contact between the catalytic film and the substrate. Due to the above advantages, in flow cell, a corresponding full-cell E.C.E. of 24.8 and 36.5% for ethylene and C2+ products were obtained, respectively, which is a notable advance over existing single metallic Cu-based systems. Moreover, this preparation method is flexible and easy to achieve electrode scale-up. When a 4 cm<sup>2</sup> electrode was applied to the MEA system, the corresponding full-cell E.C.E. could be increased to 40.5 and 26.8%, respectively, without compromising product selectivity. When the electrode area of the MEA system is increased to 25 cm<sup>2</sup>, the single-pass yield of C2+ products can be further increased to 13.2%, with an ethylene yield of 12.0%. In situ ATR-SEIRAS studies and theoretical calculations provide insights into the role of Cu(100) facets for increasing *CO coverage and reducing the energy barrier of C−C coupling, vital for ethylene and C2+ products formation. The potential of using this Cu(100)-rich film for photosynthesis was also demonstrated using renewable electricity generated by Si solar panels, achieving a solar-to-C2+ products efficiency of ~6.0% under simulated 1 Sun illumination. Future research endeavors may focus on the generation of energetic particles (atoms, molecules, ions, etc.) in other environments such as solutions in ambient conditions, which may further reduce the cost of one-step facet control by this vacuum-based deposition-etch-bombardment method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Synthesis of LS-Cu, MS-Cu, HS-Cu</title><p id="Par20">The deposition-etch-bombardment process was conducted in a custom-designed radio frequency (RF, 13.56 MHz) magnetron sputtering system (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1a</xref>).
