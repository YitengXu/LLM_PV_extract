Several changes on aircraft propulsion will occur in the next 30 years, following the aircraft market demand and environmental regulations. Two commercial areas are in evolution, electrical urban air mobility (UAM) and hybrid-electric regional aircraft. The first one is expected to come into service in the next 10 years with small devices. The last one will gradually come into service, starting with small aircraft according to developments in energy storage, fuel cells, aircraft design and hybrid architectures integration. All-electric architecture seems to be more adapted to UAM. Turbo-electric hybrid architecture combined with distributed propulsion and boundary layer ingestion seems to have more success for regional aircraft, attaining environmental goals for 2030 and 2050. Computational models supported by powerful simulation tools will be a key to support research and aircraft HEP design in the coming years. Brazilian research in these challenging areas is in the beginning, and a multidisciplinary collaboration will be critical for success in the next few years.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par43">Since the introduction of jet engines, the air transport industry has doubled its size every 20 years, the highest rate in transport sector, and it is expected to continue in a similar rate in the next years. However, its environmental impact in terms of noise and pollutant emissions has gained public attention (IATA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par44">In addition, the foreseen financial benefits of increased energy efficiency have motivated the transport industry to invest in propulsion alternatives (IATA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2019</xref>). Whereas air transport industry is responsible for a considerable part of greenhouse gas emissions, a concept where ICEs and electric motors (EM) are combined in the propulsion to increase vehicle efficiency and reduce the impact is being analyzed (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2016</xref>). This alternative has been called by some authors hybrid-electric propulsion (HEP) (Hung and Gonzalez <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2012</xref>).</p><p id="Par45">This hybridization can be achieved combining ICEs or FCs with EMs and batteries (González Espasandín et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2014</xref>). Some of the main advantages of HEP compared with the traditional propulsion are: (a) increasing the global aircraft efficiency; (b) increasing aircraft reliability, power distribution/quality, and flight range; (c) emissions and noise reduction; (d) capacity of extending the market to smaller airports (Sliwinski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par46">Hybrid-electric propulsion system (HEPS) appears as the most viable solution for an energy efficient, cleaner and quieter aeronautical propulsion, since it is able to combine the advantages of the conventional propulsion system and the all-electric approach (Sliwinski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2017</xref>). Despite this, several goals must be achieved to make the technology viable. <italic>NASA</italic>’s Subsonic Fixed Wing project identified four “corners” to be overcome: noise, emissions, aircraft fuel burn, and field length (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par47">Recent advances in electrical motors, energy storage systems, and power electronics converters (PEC) are leading the aircraft propulsion to become increasingly electrical (Sliwinski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2017</xref>). The concept More Electric Aircraft (MEA) aims for changing the aircraft systems to be fully powered by electricity. Currently, only monitoring devices and auxiliary systems are electrical, while more powerful devices still work with hydraulic or thermal systems (Buticchi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>). Despite this, since 2010 developments with all-electrically propelled aircraft have augmented, even faster from 2016, especially in the area of urban air vehicles (UAVE) (IATA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par48">The hybrid-electric propulsion offers operational flexibility, due to the greater number of components. Fuel and battery sources allow more possibilities for managing of the propulsion system in the various stages of a mission, and reduce the energy consumption, compared with traditional. However, it implies an increase in the necessary load during the design phase, and a greater complexity in the operation. Proper management of the electrical components and combustion is mandatory to meet the environmental requirements and reduce the fuel consumption (Riboldi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par49">Aircraft propulsion will gradually evolve from small all-electric UAVEs in the beginning, to medium size hybrid-electric aircraft, and later to HEP regional aircraft in a lapse of three decades. The study of HEPS requires a multidisciplinary combined approach to cope with all the related areas, a challenging task to cope with. This present work is a survey that depicts the state-of-art development in HEP identifies the most challenging requirements in the short and mean times, resumes the different approaches and alternatives, and points the paths of future research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Civil Aviation Market</title><p id="Par50">Civil global aviation market has experienced a considerable economic growth in recent years, and will keep increasing. It is estimated that around 1300 new international airports will be required, and the commercial aircraft fleet will double by 2050 (IATA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2017</xref>; Liu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2013</xref>). Brazil has a considerable stake in this increment, since it is the second country in the world in the amount of airports, and the third domestic commercial market with 22,340 registered aircraft (ANAC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2019b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">a</xref>).</p><p id="Par51">The aeronautical sector generates considerable greenhouse gas emissions, 781 million tons of <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq1_Math"><mml:msub><mml:mtext>CO</mml:mtext><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Another issue is that VTOLs have high power demand at the beginning and end of a flight. This technology still holds high certification risk and failure modes, since it doesn’t have actuator redundancy or glide capability. Most of them require high BED, able to suffer thermal failures, which raises certification concerns. Social barriers related to safety, privacy and noise must also be analyzed.

In flight phases that require low propulsive effort (e.g., cruise phase), the energy converted by the generator may also recharge the batteries. Series architecture can be combined with DP concepts (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par68">The main advantage of the series architecture is that the ICE is not mechanically coupled to thrust generation, and thus can constantly run in its best operating power and speed. Additionally, the simplicity of the concept leads to an easy propulsion control.

The ICE drives an electric generator and PECs with EM drive electric a fan or propeller. All the power comes from the fuel, and there are no additional energy storage devices (Welstead and Felder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2016</xref>; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2016</xref>). The same way as in series, decoupling the ICE propulsive from the EM thrust-producing devices enables higher performance in the propulsion, and design flexibility in the aircraft. ICEs may operate close to its peak efficiency power vs. speed conditions, and can be located at optimum locations in the aircraft (Welstead and Felder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2016</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par77">This architecture is well suited to combine with DP concepts, where the power is distributed to several EM-driven fans, positioned to provide synergistic integration in the airframe, and also with superconducting electrical systems.

When combined with BLI, it increases the overall efficiency, reducing vehicle wake dissipation (Welstead and Felder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2016</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par78">Full turbo-electric architecture employs all the power from ICE to generate electrical energy.

An advantage of this architecture is the possibility of using “green fuels” such as Hydrogen. State-of-the-art turbo-electric developments combine SOFCs fueled by hydrogen that supply EMs to drive fans, and cryogenic superconducting components (Ji et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2020</xref>; Filipenko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>All-Electric Architecture</title><p id="Par80">All-electric architecture employs batteries as the only source for aircraft propulsion (IATA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2019</xref>; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2016</xref>). The advantages are the higher efficiency on energy conversion of EMs and PECs compared with ICEs, and the simpler control strategies required to manage a unique power source.

It replaces the ICE fan on conventional aircraft with several small EM-driven fans embedded into the upper rear surface of the airframe. In conventional ICEs the fan or propeller speed is coupled to the speed of the ICE, while in DP both are decoupled, enabling each device to be operated at their ideal point. This decoupling enables higher BPR with efficiency increasing estimated in 4–8%. Subdividing the thrust, the concept aims for noise reduction, increased efficiency, reducing weight, shorter takeoff and landing distances, reduced fuel consumption and improved stability. Drag reduction, lift augmentation and swirl cancellation are also advantages from DP (Sliwinski et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2017</xref>; Liu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2013</xref>; Brelje and Martins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par84">Since ICEs generally decrease performance and efficiency when scaled down in size while EMs scale more linearly, the latter is more viable for DP.

This increases the dynamic pressure over the wing, and reduces the wing area with reduction in cruise drag (Stoll and Bevirt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par86">A DP variation employs two types of propellers: “high-lift” smaller propellers distributed upstream of the wing’s leading edge, and two “cruise” propellers, one at each wing tip. The first ones are operated only at low speeds, and during higher speed, flight props are folded and stowed against the nacelles to reduce drag. The last ones reduce the induced drag on wing tips, and provide all the thrust during higher-speed flight (Patterson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2016</xref>). Analysis based on Virtual Disk Model and developed on CFD software show that wing tip distributed propellers reduce the induced drag, and increase the high lift capabilities.

The same way, an EP system (batteries, PECs, EMs and propeller) global efficiency is 75–83%. EP can be considered about three times more efficient than the ICE propulsion. However, since the highest declared BED of actual batteries (400 Wh/kg) is roughly 30 times lower than the ICE’s jet fuel, the propulsive power relation of ICE with EP is about 10–1.

For this, there are several types of PECs to correct the power factor on buck-boost operation. Control algorithms are used to minimize the EM’s starting current and achieve a power factor close to one. Two PEC rectifier controls are presented in a work, a nonlinear for voltage and a type 2 for current, aiming to minimize the starting time to a minimum.

Quad-Active-Bridge (QAB) topology in conjunction with variable virtual resistor control manage different load priorities in the MEA distribution system, extracting power from multiple buses on peak demand, reducing the need to over-designing the EMs. The QAB converter can be used as a storage manager ensuring galvanic isolation between ports, and prioritizing power consumption from fast power sources. The main challenge is to control the energy flow between different sources. Simulations show that in small rapid variations, the feedforward control strategy is sufficient to guarantee good performance. Experiments in a high voltage (HV) scenario show that the converter can achieve very good efficiency with the use of Silicon Carbide (SiC) devices.

The algorithm charges of the operation of the isolated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT) gates, keeps the generator current operating at a defined value, and maintains the state of charge (SOC) of the batteries, preventing it from discharging completely.

Batteries, supercapacitors and FCs are DC energy sources that level at low voltage, and require converters to integrate with the DC bus. High-conversion high-voltage (HCHV) DC-DC converters with higher DC bus voltages are a trend in electric aircraft development, aiming to reduce size and weight and to increase power density. However, electromagnetic interference, safety and reliability are a primary concern. Two-port converters and multiport converters architectures are analyzed for HCHV. The first one endures reliability, while the second, that improves the power density.

The control algorithm commands the power division ratio and the Continuous Variable Transmission (CVT) relationship. The battery charge status is used as a state variable. The optimization function aims to minimize the used fuel consumption and energy. An iterative algorithm is based on dynamic program in which the mission is divided into stages and the code starts at the beginning of each of them, which reduces the working space and the processing time.</p><p id="Par198">An optimal energy management problem is analyzed for a propulsion system consisting of an ICE and a battery-powered EM in HEP on parallel architecture. It combines an aircraft dynamic model of electrical and mechanical losses on the propulsion system. A nonlinear real-time MPC is proposed, using convex optimization. The simulations are based on a representative 100-seat aircraft. The MPC strategy maintains almost constant electrical power throughout the flight (Doff-Sotta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>) .</p><p id="Par199">In Wall and Meyer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2020</xref>) the modeling, control design and simulation of a Cirrus SR20 is presented with a HEPS composed of a combustion engine and batteries. Two optimization control problems are developed. The first calculates the elevator deflection and the power and speed of the propeller shaft that minimizes the tracking error of the desired flight profile. The second manages HEP energy flows, while compensating for fuel usage and drift in battery charge level.</p><p id="Par200">In Friedrich and Robertson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2015</xref>), it was applied a rule-based control in a simulation using an ultralight fuselage with a gasoline engine and a Honda EM. It is determined in this study that HEP components produce or consume power based on the current battery charge level and the power required for desired flight operations. Their study found, at most, a fuel saving of 37% with the new system.</p><p id="Par201">A HEP control with an artificial neural network is described presenting the results of an optimization strategy, and minimizes the power consumption of the ICE from the electrical source on an UAVE. The controller achieves a fuel consumption saving of 72%. Comparing rule-based control with neural network, the last one renders an additional fuel savings of 7% (Harmon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par202">In Hung and Gonzalez (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2012</xref>), employing a rule-based control logic in HEP UAVEs aims to operate a gasoline engine on its ideal operating line and provide additional torque from the electric motor when needed, or even charge batteries with excess power from the ICE. An integrated flight mission and the HEP model were simulated in a MATLAB-Simulink environment that achieves a declared fuel saving of 6.5%.</p><p id="Par203">In Zhu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2020</xref>), a simultaneous two-level multi-objective optimization of the system components of a HEPS is proposed, which performs component sizing (upper level) and energy management (lower level). Multi-objective particle swarm optimization is developed for the upper level due to its reduced computational. An adaptive strategy of minimizing energy consumption with lower computational load, has been performed for the lower level, considering the state of charge of the battery and the efficiency of the motor.</p><p id="Par204">A sensitivity analysis is performed in a HEPS for a defined aircraft in series architecture, to study the influence of variations on specific power and efficiencies of electric components (PECs and EMs), on the MTOW and fuel burn. The HPES is composed by two turboshaft ICEs that drive electric generators with rectifiers supplying a HV distribution unit, supported by batteries or FCs. The HV distribution supplies four inverter-fed EMs which drive propellers through gearbox. Hydrogen-fueled FCs are used during full electric taxi and descent phases, the ICEs are employed for other phases. Models of each component of the HEPS based on simplified analytic derivation address the integrated design process. The process links weight variations on thrust (Pettes-Duler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par205">A challenge in HEP is to define proper control strategies to balance the requirements on a mission flight, such as increasing efficiency or energy specific air range (ESAR). The first step is to establish relationships among the system components through mathematical models to support the formulation of the problem. Some works use this approach to develop computational strategies using artificial intelligence tools, and assist the energy-based decision process, the basis for future optimization. In order to test this approach, it is being mounted in Brazil a HEP test bench, to map the advantages several strategies with three hybrid architectures (series, parallel and turbo-electric) (Rendón et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">b</xref>).</p><p id="Par206">A large improvement in the power density of the motor and the energy density of the battery is expected in the next 15 years, with different scenarios of batteries and motors and with the multiple methodologies implemented to optimize the energy management; with this, it is possible to better understand and exploit the hybridization potential in this field of application (Donateo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec27" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par207">The aviation industry has increased in an accelerated rate in last years, and even after the COVID-19 impact, it is envisaged that will recover and keep this rate in a scenario for the three next decades. Aircraft greenhouse gas emissions have also grown despite the advances in fuselage and propulsion design. Ambitious environmental restrictions have been stated since 2005 with goals until 2050. To attain these goals, new propulsion technologies are in course, that will change the aviation market introducing competitive price transportation for shorter distances, and employing smaller unused airports. The most critical aspects for aircraft industry in the next years are sustainable growth, low operational costs and look for opportunities coming from the new technologies.</p><p id="Par208">To attain environmental goals, all-electrical and hybrid-electrical propulsion will modify the aircraft market next years. Four aspects are critical for this technologies: noise, emissions, fuel consumption and flight range.</p><p id="Par209">In the short term, the first significant change will come from UAM, a revolutionary market envisaged to EIS from 2023 on applications such as airport shuttle, taxi, ambulance, and police. The biggest challenge in UAM in the next years is related to certifications and energy density. Most of research advances point to all-electric eVTOLs for 1–2 passengers, a technology that require a BED of around 500 Wh/kg. This density is envisaged to be available in the next 5 years.</p><p id="Par210">Several HEP architectures are being studied, with characteristics suitable to different applications. All-electrical seems to be well suited for UAVEs, while turbo-electric is the base of the most cited HEP concepts for medium size aircraft, in concepts that combine it with DP and BLI. Parallel architecture is well suited for vehicles with short time and varying power requirements. Series architecture seems to be applicable for small aircraft combined with FC or Wankel ICEs. Thermal power sources such as improved ICEs and FCs are in focus, as well as higher energy density batteries and supercapacitors.</p><p id="Par211">Various HEP demonstrators have been developed, most of them on small-size aircraft of up to 4 passengers, with series or parallel architectures, and powered by ICEs or FCs. Commercial regional HEP aircraft are still on the concept stage. Simulation analysis is in course, because of the low BED most of approaches suggest partial or full turbo-electric architectures.</p><p id="Par212"><italic>Evolutionary</italic> aircraft design is expected to EIS in the next 15 years, while <italic>revolutionary</italic> designs are envisaged for the following 15 years. FW is a revolutionary configuration for regional aircraft that has already tested a small-scale aircraft on flight.

PECs are testing different topologies and control strategies, aiming to deal with challenging demands of aircraft environment such as HV circuits, fast changing operation conditions of EM-driven propellers, low pressure environments and TMS. Working on higher frequencies on PEC increases the power density, but also the electromagnetic interference, and capacitive effects. To attain high level of efficiency, control strategies based on artificial intelligence and model based adaptive control are being tested. Silicon carbide commuters seem to offer better performance for PEC.</p><p id="Par214">Improvements on EM design with new materials and configurations are under development. To achieve high power density SMs are being tested, considering the impact on aircraft performance of the cooling systems additional weight. PMSM and IM seem to be more fitted for aircraft applications.</p><p id="Par215">The improvements on thermal engines are also remarkable. New designs are in course to improve the BPR of turbofan ICEs, combined with EM-driven turbofans. For small-size airplane state-of-the-art, RE is a promising solution. Open rotor ICE designs are being improved to reduce the operation noise. SAF is being studied too, especially synthetic fuels obtained with environmentally friendly processing techniques.</p><p id="Par216">Several approaches are being tested for HEPS management and control. Rule-based and artificial intelligence strategies are being analyzed on simulation approaches with optimistic results.</p><p id="Par217">Brazilian aviation industry is one of the biggest in the world, with the third world aircraft manufacturer, and one of the biggest number in commercial flights. Despite this, few experiences have been published on EP and HEP, all of them small-size all-electric airplanes. Last years, the aviation industry has established partnerships with research institutions aiming to encourage the study of HEPS. This partnership has initiated a multidisciplinary research on ICEs, EMs, PECs, energy storage systems, management, control and propeller design. The actual scenario demands to establish the trends for a time lapse of the next 30 years.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflicts of interest/Competing interests</title><p id="Par221">Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Code availability</title><p id="Par222">Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Availability of data and material</title><p id="Par223">Not applicable.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">ACARE (2018) Protecting the environment and the energy supply. <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.acare4europe.org/sria/flightpath-2050-goals/protecting-environment-and-energy-supply-0" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.acare4europe.org/sria/flightpath-2050-goals/protecting-environment-and-energy-supply-0</ext-link></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">ACS Aviation (2019) EACS SORA-e. <ext-link xlink:href="https://acs-solutions.com.br/index.php/produtos" ext-link-type="uri">https://acs-solutions.com.br/index.php/produtos</ext-link></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">AeroVironment.
