Aqueous SCs are considered to be more environmentally friendly than those based on organic electrolytes. Because of the corrosive nature of the aqueous environment, however, expensive electrochemically stable materials are needed for the current collectors and electrodes in aqueous SCs. This results in high costs for a given energy-storage capacity. To address this, we developed a novel low-cost aqueous SC using graphite foil as the current collector and a mix of graphene, nanographite, simple water-purification carbons and nanocellulose as electrodes. The electrodes were coated directly onto the graphite foil by using casting frames and the SCs were assembled in a pouch cell design. With this approach, we achieved a material cost reduction of greater than 90% while maintaining approximately one-half of the specific capacitance of a commercial unit, thus demonstrating that the proposed SC can be an environmentally friendly, low-cost alternative to conventional SCs.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>7223</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep39836.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The number of publications regarding electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) or supercapacitors (SCs) and related applications is rapidly increasing.

The ACs are micrometer-sized clusters of irregularly shaped porous carbon particles. in cases in which the amount of ACs was dominant, the shrinkage increased and the electrode became more brittle.

The discharge rate was approximately twice as high during GC compared with that during CV, thus resulting in a shorter time for ion diffusion and explaining the lower specific capacitance values measured by GC. At low discharge rates, the ions have sufficient time to diffuse into the deep pores of the electrode, whereas at high rates, only the large, easily accessible pores are accessed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This difference is more evident in the case of the electrodes with a larger proportion of AC because they have a substantially higher theoretical specific surface area. The difference between the measured and theoretical capacitance stemming from the increases amount of ACs may be attributed to insufficient electrolyte wetting or unavailable surface area. The NFC binder may form a thin film covering part of the available pores, essentially blocking them. This can be assumed from the SEM images in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>. Another scenario is an uneven particle distribution in the electrode with clusters of poorly connected ACs contributing with an inaccessible surface area.</p><p id="Par13"><xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref> shows a bar plot of the ESR of the unit, the electrical resistivity in the electrode-coated graphite foil (ECGF <italic>ρ</italic>) and the electrical resistivity in the electrode film (EF <italic>ρ</italic>) for samples A to D.

The graphite foil was 200 <italic>μ</italic>m thick, and the electrodes from samples A to D were between 200 <italic>μ</italic>m and 250 <italic>μ</italic>m thick. The measurements of electrical resistivity clearly showed that the interfacial resistance between the graphite foil and the electrode was low. The electric resistivity in the electrode-coated graphite foil was more than one order of magnitude lower than that in the electrode film. Despite the large difference in electrical conductivity in the electrodes and the fact that the units were evaluated without applied pressure (uncompressed), the ESR was fairly low for all samples, thus indicating that the graphite foil is a good candidate as a low-cost current collector in aqueous environment. The ESR was also low in comparison to some other aqueous unconventional SCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, but still large for high power applications.</p><p id="Par14">Xiaohang Z. <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> reported on a 20 V stack of aqueous SCs with titanium plates as current collectors and CNT-polypyrrole electrodes; showing an ESR (compressed stack) of 16 mΩ per cell, which is low compared to the graphite foil at approximately 100 mΩ. Notably, the electrode coated graphite foil SC units were uncompressed and coated at room temperature without any sintering or calendering. The ESR could potentially be further decreased by vacuum-drying the electrodes at elevated temperature with subsequent calendering, to reduce the large cavities shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,d</xref> and enhance the contact between particles in the electrode. Another interesting feature of the metal foil, such as Ti, is as bipolar plate between cells in a stack<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, this is unfortunately not possible with graphite foil since its slightly porous structure do not prevent ion transport through the foil.</p><p id="Par15"><xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref> shows cycle stability data from 24 h constant current cycling (0 V − 1 V − 0 V) at a current density of 0.8 A/g (2.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>) for SC units A to D. No change in specific capacitance could be observed for unit A, B and C during 24 hours cycling, but a small improvement was observed for SC unit D. Unit D showed approximately 4% higher specific capacitance after 24 h (706 cycles), compared to cycle 2. This can be a consequence of insufficient time for electrolyte wetting during SC unit assembling, resulting in continued wetting of deeper pores during cycling. The cyclability study indicates good cycle stability, despite the simple electrode manufacturing by coating with water-based binder solution together with the use of aqueous electrolyte in the SC units. An explanation for this could be that high shear forces were used both for nanographite exfoliation and during addition of NFC and AC. When dried, the particles in the dispersion are held together by the nano-fibrils in a web-like formation forming a robust composite with good mechanical stability and wet strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16"><xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a–c</xref> shows I–V curves from CV measurements of SC units A to D with three different scan rates, 10 mV/s (a), 20 mV/s (b) and 30 mV/s (c). The shapes of the CV measurements showed that no reactions occurred, other than electrostatic charging and discharging. The differences among the units were evident the curve shapes and the current plateaus, which showed higher capacitance (plot area) for units with grater amounts of activated carbons. This was most pronounced at a scan rate of 10 mV/s, at higher scan rates the curvature shifted substantially for unit C and D. The different curve shapes further indicated that, with increasing amount of AC, a higher cell voltage is required to obtain the same charge current density as that of unit A (the bending distance is longer for units B to D), thus indicating greater resistance to charge transfer (charge propagation) in the electrode. This is most evident at scan rates of 20 mV/s and 30 mV/s and might be a result of a higher electrode resistance combined with a higher surface area, thus leading to longer diffusion times for the ions. In addition, the current plateaus at 10 mV/s were flat or slightly bent during discharging but steeper during charging. This effect was more apparent in the voltammograms of units with grater amounts of AC and may be a direct result of unit leakage current. The leakage current was generated from the internal resistance and thus increased with increasing cell voltage, resulting in a measured charge current greater than the measured discharge current.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Shows I–V curves from cyclic voltammetry measurements with different scan rates in (<bold>a</bold>–<bold>c</bold>) and constant current curves from galvanostatic cycling with different current densities in (<bold>d</bold>–<bold>f</bold>).

According to the low-volume price lists from both Alfa Aesar and Sigma-Aldrich, the relative cost, RC, of the organic electrolyte is &lt;30 compared with an RC = 1 for aqueous electrolytes. The AC used was a low-cost product normally used for water purification. The specific surface area was 1200 m<sup>2</sup>/g, and RC = 2 relative to RC = 1 for high-purity flake graphite. ACs designed for SCs with specific surface areas of 1000 to 2500 m<sup>2</sup>/g, are in the RC range of from 20 to 100. The thermally expanded graphite obtained from Superior Graphite was an experimental product; however, in general, expanded graphite has an RC range from 2 to 8 depending on its quality. The RCs are based on quotes from a number of manufacturers to estimate the material cost for pilot-scale production of SCs. The Sigraflex graphite foil current collector has RC = 5 compared with RC = 1 for Aluminum foil. Other materials suited for aqueous electrolytes are stainless steel foil (RC = 30), nickel foil (RC = 50) and titanium foil (RC = 180). The relative costs of current collectors are approximations based on a price comparison in Gheytani <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and on quotes for Sigraflex graphite foil. All foils had a thickness of 0.2 mm and the relative cost refers to the foil price per unit area.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par19">The design and processing of a metal-free SC with an aqueous electrolyte was studied and reported. The use of graphite foil as a low-cost and metal-free current collector showed promising results. The carbon-carbon interface between the current collector and electrode resulted in low interfacial resistance and a significant decrease in electrical resistivity, despite large cavities in the electrode material. The ESR was fairly low for an uncompressed aqueous SC, but still large for high power applications. Calendering and cell compression could be needed to lower the ESR further. The low-cost SC concept had approximately half the specific capacitance of commercial SCs but more than 90% lower cost, thus making this approach interesting for large-scale applications without a strict space limitation, such as stationary use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par20">The electrode materials used in this experiment were nanographite for good electrical conductivity and AC for improved surface area and, thus, improved capacitance.
