An <italic>in situ</italic> method has been developed to fabricate gold nanoparticle (Au NP) films on different substrates, regardless of whether they are hydrophilic or hydrophobic surfaces, including glass, 96-well polystyrene plates, and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). A mixture of sodium formate (HCOONa) and chloroauric acid (HAuCl<sub>4</sub>) solution was used to prepare Au NP films at room temperature. An experimental study of the mechanism revealed that film formation is dependent on surface wettability and inter particle attraction. The as-fabricated Au NP films were further applied to the colorimetric detection of influenza virus. The response to the commercial target, New Caledonia/H1N1/1999 influenza virus, was linear in the range from 10 pg/ml to 10 μg/ml and limit of detection was 50.5 pg/ml. In the presence of clinically isolated influenza A virus (H3N2), the optical density of developed color was dependent on the virus concentration (10–50,000 PFU/ml). The limit of detection of this study was 24.3 PFU/ml, a limit 116 times lower than that of conventional ELISA (2824.3 PFU/ml). The sensitivity was also 500 times greater than that of commercial immunochromatography kits.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>7223</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>14</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep44495.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep44495" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep44495</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Numerous promising approaches to fabricating nanostructured films have been developed to enhance their surface and interfacial properties by achieving an appropriate combination of surface structure, morphology, and physical and chemical properties.

In particular, noble-metal NP films have been extensively studied because of their versatility, chemical stability, and unique optical properties stemming from localized surface plasmon resonances, which lead to enormous local, nanoscale optical field enhancements. This phenomenon finds applications in optical devices, microelectromechanical devices, sensors, medical devices, and catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Among plasmonic materials, gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) are one of the most promising materials because of their unprecedented ability to confine electromagnetic fields and potential applications in a vast array of photonic and optoelectronic technologies ranging from chemical sensing and biosensing applications to energy harvesting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, data storage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, and optical tweezer devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> for nanomaterial manipulation. Because of these possible applications of Au NP films, many conventional and Nano technological methods have been proposed for film fabrication, including electron-beam lithography and nanoimprint lithography as top-down techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, these methods require sophisticated fabrication equipment and their applications are limited by either high costs or small sample sizes. Alternatively, wet-chemical approaches have advantages over lithographically fabricated films because wet-chemical building blocks enable the fabrication of highly crystalline materials on a large scale. Furthermore, simple bottom-up approaches based on self-assembly, such as Langmuir-Blodgett film deposition, dip coating, and electrochemical deposition, have also been developed for large-scale fabrication to obtain films with much fewer defects; however, these techniques are time-consuming and laborious<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. reported a novel and simple <italic>in situ</italic> fabrication technique to prepare Au NP-PDMS free-standing films that do not require additional reducing agents; these films can be used in enzyme reactors, immunoassays, and other biochemical analyses on microchips<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Goyal <italic>et al</italic>. have also reported a simple one-step method for synthesizing noble-metal NP-embedded free-standing PDMS composite films. Their process involves preparing a homogenous mixture of the metal salt (Ag, Au, or Pt), a silicone elastomer, and a curing agent (hardener) to form NPs when the hardener crosslinks with the elastomer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, such techniques are limited to PDMS substrates. Therefore, two major limitations must still be overcome to advance the industrial applications of plasmonic Au NP films. Among the more urgent challenges in the nanobiotechnological field is the development of a method for preparing Au NP plasmonic films on different substrates, regardless of the substrates’ hydrophilic or hydrophobic character. Such films would play an important role in the development of next-generation flexible electronic devices, display devices, hybrid nanostructures, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates and immunoassays. The need to develop facile <italic>in situ</italic> self-assembling Au NP films on a large scale is another urgent challenge to reduce the time and labor involved and the amount of waste generated, as well as to push plasmonic films toward practical applications.</p><p id="Par5">In this article, we present a simple approach to fabricate Au NP films <italic>in situ</italic> on various types of substrates. Our fabrication process is a one-step procedure that involves a mixture of sodium formate and an HAuCl<sub>4</sub> solution and can be used to obtain Au NP films on any hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrate, e.g., glass, 96-well polystyrene plates or PDMS. SERS and immunosensing applications were demonstrated films fabricated via the proposed method.

The films turned a reddish color, indicating the good deposition of the particles. UV-Vis spectroscopy was used to monitor the surface plasmon absorption of the Au NPs. As the concentration of HCOONa (reducing and stabilizing agent) was increased, the peak absorption centered at 548 nm (at 200 mM HCOONa) was slightly blue shifted, indicating that the particle size decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM56">Fig. S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM56">Supplementary Information</xref>).

At the hydrophobic surface, water molecules in contact with hydrophobic moieties tend to be displaced into the aqueous solution to reduce the total free energy of the system, resulting in a favorable interaction between the hydrophobic moieties of substrate surfaces and the Au NPs. The hydrophobic interaction is suppressed when the substrate surface is hydrophilic. Additionally, because of the electrokinetically negative surface of bare Au<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, the highly negatively charged surface of clean glass and oxygen-plasma-treated PDMS induce electrostatic repulsion toward the NPs, resulting in a sparsely deposited Au film. The electrostatic interaction is partially responsible for the different morphologies of the Au films on the hydrophobic PDMS and hydrophobic (relative hydrophobic) glass surfaces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM56">Fig. S5A,B and S5D,E</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM56">Fig. S5B and D</xref>, the hydrophobicity of the two different surfaces is similar (107.1° and 113.3°), but the deposited Au films have reasonably different coverages of NPs, which is attributed to the different surface potentials of PDMS and glass. The cleaned and OTS-modified glass surfaces are highly negatively charged (−48.64 ± 0.07 and −35.15 ± 0.36 mV, respectively)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The untreated glass surface is also negatively charged, but the charge is weaker than that of the cleaned glass. The as-prepared and patterned PDMS surfaces are neutrally charged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The Au NPs also form large aggregates on the glass (untreated, cleaned and OTS-treated) and oxygen-plasma-treated surfaces. However, the Au NPs are fairly dispersed on the hydrophobic PDMS surfaces. This dispersion is attributed to the hydrodynamic interactions between the particles and substrate, which induce long-range attractive forces between the identically charged surfaces of the Au NPs and the substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Observation of surface-enhanced Raman scattering effect on Au NP films</title><p id="Par11"><xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows the SERS profiles of the R6G molecules on the Au NP films that were formed using different concentrations of HCOONa.

For EDC-NHS chemistry, 100 μl of EDC (4 mM) and 100 μl of NHS (10 mM) were added to all the wells of the nanostructured 96-well polystyrene plates, which were incubated for 10 min. Then, 1 μl of the HA ab66189 antibody (final concentration = 5 ng/ml) was added to each well and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. The plate was washed three times with a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution using an immunowasher (Bio-Rad, Model 1575, Segrate, Italy) to remove the nonspecific or unbound components. The antibodies bind to the Au film either through the amide bond or simply by electrostatic interaction. To determine whether the antibodies bound to the film, the samples were blocked with 100 μl of 2% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature. Anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG)-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (1 ng/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to each sample. After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the samples were washed three times with PBS solution. HRP was developed with 100 μl of the TMB substrate solution (10 μg/ml TMB, 10% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in 100 mM NaOAc, pH = 6.0) for 5–30 min at 25 °C. A blue-colored solution was obtained at this stage. The reaction was halted by the addition of 100 μl of 10% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The solution then turned yellow, and its absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a reference at 655 nm using a microplate reader (model 680, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). To conjugate anti-H3N2 antibody HA MAb with film, same procedure with EDC/NHS chemistry as described above was followed in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Synthesis of positively charged gold nanoparticles ((+)Au NPs)</title><p id="Par28">The (+)Au NPs were prepared according to a published protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Briefly, a cysteamine solution (400 μl, 213 mM) was added to 40 ml of a 1.42 mM HAuCl<sub>4</sub> solution. After the resulting solution was stirred for 20 min at 25 °C, 10 μl of 10 mM NaBH<sub>4</sub> solution was added and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 10 min at 25 °C in the dark. The mixture was then further stirred for 15 min, and the resulting wine-red solution was stored at 4 °C until further use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conjugation of (+)Au NPs with anti-influenza A virus neuraminidase (NA) antibodies and anti-H3N2 antibody HA MAb</title><p id="Par29">After the supernatant was separated by ultracentrifugation (Kubota 6200, Tokyo, Japan) at 5,000 rpm for 30 min, the (+)Au NPs were dispersed in Milli-Q water. Then, 1 ml of the synthesized (+)Au NP solution and 1 μl of anti-NA antibody (New Caledonia/20/1999/(H1N1) (final concentration of 5 ng per ml) were incubated for 30 min and maintained at 4 °C for 24 h. At this stage, the NPs were conjugated with the antibody through electrostatic interactions. The conjugated (+)Au NP-antibodies were separated from their unconjugated or nonspecific binding partners through centrifugation (5,000 rpm for 30 min) and redispersed in 1 ml of Milli-Q water. To confirm that the antibody had bound to the (+)Au NPs, the samples were blocked with 100 μl of 2% BSA for 2 h at 25 °C. One ng per ml anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to each sample. After incubation at 25 °C for 1 h, the samples were washed 3 times with PBS solution. HRP was developed with 100 μl of TMB substrate solution (10 μg per ml TMB, 10% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in 100 mM NaOAc, pH 6.0) for 5–30 min at 25 °C. A blue solution developed at this stage. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 10% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The solution then became yellow in color, and its absorbance was read at 450 nm using a microplate reader (model 680, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Same procedure was followed to conjugate and binding confirmation of (+) Au NPs with anti-H3N2 antibody.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Detection of influenza virus A/New Caledonia/20/1999(H1N1) and A/Yokohama/110/2009 (H3N2)</title><p id="Par30">The anti-HA Ab (ab66189)-conjugated Au NP films were rinsed 3 times with PBS. Then, 100 μl of anti-NA Ab-conjugated (+)Au NPs containing different concentrations of recombinant influenza A (H1N1) were added to the microplate wells. An Ab-conjugated (+)Au NP solution in BSA and influenza virus A (H3N2) were added to the same microplate as a negative control. The microplate was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After the microplate was washed three times, 100 μl of a TMB and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (5 nM) solution was added to each of the wells. The microplate was then incubated for 1 min at 25 °C. Finally, 100 μl of 10% H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> was added to each of the wells as a stopping reagent. The absorbance of the color was read at 655 nm using a plate reader (Model 680, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). A dose-response curve was constructed on the basis of the absorbance values using different concentrations of influenza virus A (New Caledonia/20/1999) (H1N1). Here, the proposed sensing assay may offer a new strategy to monitor influenza virus with high sensitivity through the conjugation of different antibodies to the film and nanoparticles. The same protocol as described above was used to detect influenza virus A/Yokohama/110/2009 (H3N2) using anti-HA (H3N2) Ab-bioconjugated Au NPs film and (+)Au NPs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Spectroscopy and structural characterization</title><p id="Par31">The ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra of the nanostructured films were recorded using a Tecan Infinite M 200 spectrophotometer (Infinite<sup>®</sup> F500, TECAN Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland).
