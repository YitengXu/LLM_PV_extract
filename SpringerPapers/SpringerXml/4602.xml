The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed that the crystal systems of rhombohedral (21.34 nm) and monoclinic (17.76 nm) were observed for pure NiO and Mo-doped NiO NPs respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results show that the pure NiO NPs possess irregular spherical shape with an average particle size of 93.89 nm while the Mo-doped NiO NPs exhibit spherical morphology with an average particle size of 85.48 nm. The ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectrum further indicated that the pure and Mo-doped NiO NPs exhibited strong absorption band at the wavelengths of 365 and 349 nm, respectively. The free radical scavenging activity of NiO and Mo-doped NiO NPs was also investigated by utilizing several biochemical assays. The Mo-doped NiO NPs showed better antioxidant activity (84.2%) towards ABTS. + at 200 µg/mL in comparison to their pure counterpart which confirmed that not only antioxidant potency of the doped NPs was better than pure NPs but this efficacy was also concentration dependant as well. The NiO and Mo-doped NiO NPs were further evaluated for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive (<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>) and gram-negative (<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) bacterial strains. The Mo-doped NiO NPs displayed better antibacterial activity (25 mm) against <italic>E. coli</italic> in comparison to the pure NPs.

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The excessive utilization of the noxious chemical substances for the purpose of food preservation have emerged as one of the major concerns for the scientific community in recent times. These chemicals utilize their antimicrobial potency and antioxidant potential in order to perform the food reservation process by modulating the metabolic oxidative and microbial food spoilage problems. The organic foods particularly fruits, vegetables, fish, meat, poultry, and fresh cereal-based products are largely affected by the microbial spoilage (i.e. the degradative reactions performed by bacteria, fungi and algal strains<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The onset of the food spoilage is remarked by the pronounced variation observed in the texture, taste, color, and odour of the food. Furthermore, the physical parameters including light, moisture content, temperature, and air flow etc. also modulates the degradation rate of the food by directly impacting the working of the enzymes and proteins (of the microorganism) present in the food. Usually, the favourable the conditions are for the enzymatic degradation, the larger are the number of the oxidative free-radicals produced in the food which results in its spoilage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The reactive oxidative species (ROS) are extremely unstable species containing an unpaired electron in its atomic orbitals. The presence of the unpaired electron makes these radicals quite reactive and these free-radicals destroy the surrounding food molecules via numerous destructive mechanisms (i.e. via undifferentiated bond breakage of the biomolecules of proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids etc.). Even in the absence of the microbes, the oxidative free-radicals are usually generated during the metabolic conversion of the consumed food in the human beings as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The excessive presence of these free-radicals inside the human cell is quite dangerous as these species constantly interact with the constituents of the human cells and hinders its proper functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Recently, the overproduction of these ROS in human body have been heavily linked with the onset of numerous diseases including immunity system failure, neurological diseases, cancer, neuro-degenerative ailments and certain cardiovascular diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Similarly, the enhanced aging phenomenon was also found to be related with the adverse oxidative impacts of these ROS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Consequently, it can be observed that the modulation of the proper amount of the ROS in the food and the human body is an essential research domain which should be explored when dealing with food preservation and biomedical applications, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In case of living organisms, human beings are equipped with natural defence mechanisms to counter the deterioration effects of the oxidative species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. For instance, the consumption of meat and plants (particularly plants) allows us to consume natural antioxidant substances that scavenge these ROS from the human body. However, the natural intake of these antioxidant substances is incidental and supplementation in the form of the synthetic antioxidants (including butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)) is required for properly modulating these ROS based oxidative stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Although BHT and BHA are one of the two most extensively utilized antioxidants, the focus has now been shifted towards the identification or development of the novel antioxidants as the synthetic antioxidants of BHA and BHT have been documented to have carcinogenic issues associated with them<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The nanomaterial (NMs), substances having at least one of its dimensions within the nanometers range (i.e. 1–100 nm), are one such material that have been documented to be extensively utilized as the antioxidant substance for controlling the oxidative stress in foods and human beings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. The NMs are regarded as the unique substances that exhibit the diverse characteristics (surface, physical, optical, chemical, and electrochemical properties) owing to their extremely small size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The surface area associated with these NMs is exponentially higher in comparison to their bulk counterpart which make these materials excellent substances for surface dependent applications such as water purification applications (including adsorption, catalysis, photocatalysis, etc.), electronics and biomedical applications (antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer applications, etc.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. The antimicrobial applications are particularly dependent upon the size of the NPs. The smaller the size of the NPs, the easier it is for the NPs to penetrate into the microbial cells and cause lysis. Consequently, it can be said that the features of intensely small size and high surface area of the NPs are exceedingly significant for the numerous applications of the NPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The NMs, particularly transition metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs), have been known for numerous applications owing to their antioxidant properties performed via two mechanisms: i.e. either by quenching of the radicals via chain breaking processes or by supressing the production of the oxidative radical promoters via chelation processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Ge et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> presented an interesting fact that among both the metal and metal oxide NPs, the metal oxide NPs exhibited better antioxidant potential owing to the involvement of the oxygen atom in their structures. Presence of the oxygen atom not only enhances the chelation capabilities of the metal oxide NPs (by developing the electrostatic interactions with the radicals that are missing in neutral metal NPs) but it also increases the quenching potential of the synthesized NPs (owing to the presence of the different oxidation states of the metal ions involved in the numerous oxides of the transition metal oxide NPs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Muthuvel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> synthesized titanium oxide NPs and utilized the synthesized assembly for photocatalytic, antioxidant and antibacterial infections. Haq et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> synthesized nickel oxide (NiO) NPs by utilizing the green synthesis methodology for antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Keeping the above discussed points in mind, it can be inferred that the metal oxides are one of the most prominent NMs that are explored for investigating the antioxidants and antimicrobial applications.</p><p id="Par6">For this particular study, we have focused on developing the doped NiO NMs. The NiO is an exceptional transition metal oxide known for its insulation nature (i.e. low conductivity values at room temperature) and is widely used in the fields of the electrochromic materials, supercapacitors, gas sensors and battery manufacturing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This p-type semiconductor material also exhibits the bandgap value of 3.51 eV making these materials quite suitable for catalytic applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The NiO NPs are modified in numerous ways to achieve better results such as formation of nanocomposites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, surface modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, and doping process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. All these processes are designed in such a way that the electrical, optical, or structural characteristics of the NiO NPs are improved for the specific applications. The process of doping includes the introduction of the specific transition metals/impurities within the crystal system of the NMs in order to modulate the structural, optical, and electrical properties of the parent NMs. Achieving the doping is quite difficult task as the crystal lattice system of the NMs has to remain intact and only one or more atoms present at the specific points in the crystal unit have to be replaced by the dopant atom<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Literature survey associated with the intercalation studies of NiO NPs reveal that mostly copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), magnesium (Mg), and potassium (K) are utilized for the doping of the NiO NMs. Ethiraj et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> synthesized Cu doped NiO NPs and indicated that the optical property of the bandgap increased from 3.26 to 3.67 eV by increasing the dopant concentration from 0 to 4% respectively. Lee et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> also synthesized Co doped NiO NPs and documented that the electrical conductivity and interfacial characteristics of the NiO NPs were enhanced by the doping process. All these case studies indicated that doping of the NiO NPs is an excellent technique for improving the properties of the NPs.</p><p id="Par7">Here, the pure NiO NPs and molybdenum (Mo) doped NiO NPs were synthesized by using ultrasonic assisted wet chemical synthesis. The selection of Mo was done on the basis of its natural affinity to act as a cofactor for numerous enzymes in biological systems. As the main focus of our study was to synthesized doped NiO NMs and employ it for the antibacterial and antioxidant applications, the biocompatible dopant of Mo was selected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Apart from these applications, the authors made an attempt to explain the mechanism involved in the antibacterial activity of the NPs which adds on to the novelty of this study. The mechanism studies explaining the process of the bactericidal activities of the NPs are rarely explored in the academic literature. Authors believe that this study will provide significant insights in understanding the mechanisms involved in the interaction of pure and doped NMs with the bacterial cell.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis</title><p id="Par8">The average crystallite size and crystal phase associated with the synthesized NP were investigated by using XRD analysis. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> depicts the XRD pattern of pure NiO and Mo doped NiO NPs. The crystal phases of rhombohedral (JCPDS card No. 89-3080) and monoclinic (JCPDS card No. 86-0361) were observed for pure NiO and Mo doped NiO NPs, respectively. For pure NiO NPs, it was observed that the 2θ values of 21.16°, 30.78°, 37.19°, 43.18°, 48.20° 62.84°, 75.39°, and 79.30° corresponded to the respective diffraction planes of (101), (110), (021), (202), (211), (220), (223), and (006). In case of Mo doped NiO NPs, the 2θ values of 12.73°, 14.74°, 16.70°, 21.01°, 24.40°, 28.06°, 28.97°, 29.94°, 37.19°, 43.29°, 47.92°, 54.63°, 62.78°, 75.26°, and 79.30° corresponding to the diffraction planes of (001), (110), (-111), (111), (021), (201), (220), (-311), (-113), (041), (-204), (133), (422), (-316), and (171) respectively were observed. The slight changes observed in the 2θ values of Mo doped NiO NPs in comparison to the 2θ values of pure NiO NPs is indicative of the fact that the parent structure of the NiO NPs remains the same and Mo is only incorporated as an impurity in the system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. For instance, the slight difference of 0.11° was observed at the major diffraction peak of NiO NPs (at 43.18°) which was shifted at the 2θ value of 43.29° in the case of Mo doped NiO NPs. The average crystallite size of the NPs was calculated by using the Debye Scherrer formula. The average crystallite size of pure NiO and Mo doped NiO was found to be 21.34 nm and 17.76 nm respectively. Panigrahi et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> has investigated the effect of Mg and Zn doping on NiO nanoparticles by changing the ratio of dopant and the pure NiO exhibited cubic phase. According to the Panigrahi’s report, the parameters of both bond length and lattice parameters exhibited increase with the increase in the ratio of metal dopant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. According to the above mentioned literature, the main dopant of Mo is responsible for the crystal structure observed in case of the doped NiO NPs.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>XRD analysis of NiO and Mo doped NiO NPs.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2023_28356_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)-energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) analysis</title><p id="Par9">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> depicts the SEM analysis of pure NiO and Mo doped NiO NPs.

The XRD analysis revealed that the pure NiO NPs had rhombohedral crystal phase while the Mo-doped NiO NPs exhibited monoclinic crystal phase. According to HR-TEM analysis, the pure NiO also revealed to have an irregular spherical shape morphology with an average particle size of 93 ± 4 nm, while Mo-doped NiO NPs exhibited a spherical morphology with an average particle size of 85 ± 3 nm. The pure NiO NPs and Mo-doped NiO NPs exhibited an absorption maximum at 365 and 349 nm, respectively, in the visible region. The NiO NPs and Mo doped NiO NPs were analysed for their ability to scavenge free radicals in numerous biochemical assays including DPPH, ABTS<sup><bold>.</bold>+</sup>, FRAP, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, reducing power assay, and SOD assays. All these assays revealed that the doped NiO NPs exhibited better results in comparison to the pure NiO NPs owing to their smaller size. Furthermore, the antioxidant potential of the NPs was found to be concentration dependent application. . Using the agar well diffusion method, the antibacterial potential of NiO and Mo-doped NiO NPs against gram-positive (<italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>B. subtilis</italic>) and gram-negative (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>) bacterial strain was determined. It was again found out that the Mo doped NiO NPs exhibited better inhibition and lysis potential in comparison to the pure NiO NPs due to high penetration potential of doped NPs because of their small size. The mechanism associated with the bactericidal application of the NPs was also investigated which revealed that the exposure of the cell to the NPs enhanced ROS stress in the cell. Consequently, the concentration of associated enzymes like SOD, and POD was found to increase with the increase in the concentration of NPs in the system. Further tests revealed that the overproduction of ROS caused the damage to the cell membrane and adversely affected the DNA leading towards the lysis of the cell. All these findings suggest that the NiO and Mo doped NiO NPs are excellent materials for biomedical applications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by, the Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice-Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia [Project No. GRANT915].
