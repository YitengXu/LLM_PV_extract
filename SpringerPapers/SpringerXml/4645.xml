Further, a composite of as prepared MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers and rGO is constructed by simple ultrasonic exfoliation technique. The crystallography and morphological studies have been carried out by XRD, FE-SEM, TEM, HR-TEM and EDS etc. Here, XRD study revealed, a composite of exfoliated MoS<sub>2</sub> with expanded spacing of (002) crystal plane and rGO can be prepared by simple 40 minute of ultrasonic treatment. While, FE-SEM and TEM studies depict, individual MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers with an average diameter of 200 nm are uniformly distributed throughout the rGO surface. When tested as sodium-ion batteries anode material by applying two different potential windows, the composite demonstrates a high reversible specific capacity of 575 mAhg<sup>−1</sup> at 100 mAg<sup>−1</sup> in between 0.01 V–2.6 V and 218 mAhg<sup>−1</sup> at 50 mAg<sup>−1</sup> when discharged in a potential range of 0.4 V–2.6 V. As per our concern, the results are one of the best obtained as compared to the earlier published one on MoS<sub>2</sub> based SIB anode material and more importantly this material shows such an excellent reversible Na-storage capacity and good cycling stability without addition of any expensive additive stabilizer, like fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), in comparison to those in current literature.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>28</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep12571.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>18</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep12571" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep12571</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p><bold>C</bold>ompare to lithium-ion battery, sodium-ion battery is more compatible to being part of a large-scale storage system that stores energy for renewable energy such as solar and wind where energy is produced intermittently. Although Li-ion batteries are high energy density batteries that can store large amount of energy in a small size however, the negative aspects associated with this technology like high cost, cycle life and safety restrict them to apply universally. On the other hand, sodium is the sixth most common element on the planet and easy to extract from earth crust, therefore batteries can be made of sodium-ion will be much inexpensive compare to lithium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p>However, few challenges that sodium-ion battery facing currently are selection of intercalation/conversion/alloy based anode, electrolyte and electrode-electrolyte interface stability. These problems may arise from an inherent characteristic of sodium, that sodium- ions (1.02 Å) are nearly twice as large as lithium-ions (0.59 Å) and the large size causes a greater change in the host structure upon insertion and de-insertion, which results in a massive failure in cyclic stability in all tested anode materials till date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. To date, several attempts have been devoted to develop the electrode materials with improved sodium (Na)-ion intercalation and transportation behaviour. For anode, different kind of materials have been investigated such as, i) non-graphitic carbon anode including hard carbon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, carbon microspheres by pyrolysis of polymeric resin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, N-doped porous carbon fibres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> ii) Ti-based anode materials like, amorphous TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, Na<sub>2</sub>Ti<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>/Carbon black<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and expanded graphite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Here, all of these anodes involved in a reversible sodium intercalation/de-intercalation mechanism, demonstrating specific capacity in the range of 100–300 mAhg<sup>−1</sup>. Organic electrodes such as, polytriphenylamine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, di-sodium terephthalate (Na<sub>2</sub>C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> were also reported. Apart from these, alloying/de-alloying type anodes like, SnSb/C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and P/C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> etc. were shown as promising candidates due to their high specific capacity. However, these materials suffer from severer volume expansion (up to 500%) during sodium uptake, causing pulverization of materials thus irreversible capacity loss. Moreover, some of the metals are toxic and some of them leave flammable side products during charge-discharge reaction with electrolyte. On the other hand, metal oxides/chalcogenides have established themselves as potential anodes for SIBs due to their rich electrochemistry and significant high capacity value<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p>Molybdenum sulphide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) possesses a typical graphite-like layered structure, where each Mo atom is covalently bonded to S atoms forming two-dimensional S-Mo-S sandwich like structure. Furthermore, these 2D layers are stack together by weak van der Waals attraction providing a large interlayer spacing (0.615 nm vs. 0.335 nm of graphite) along C-axis which can eventually accommodate large Na-ions. However, due to their large surface energy, these 2D nanomaterials have a tendency to restack in order to minimize the surface energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Moreover, these materials exhibit low inherent electronic conductivity which also affects their electrochemical performance of Na-ion storage. However, owing to such difficulties, these layered materials can be composite with reduced graphene oxide (rGO). The rGO sheets not only improve the electrical conductivity and the same enhances the mechanical strength. Furthermore, rGO sheets can act as a spacer that can inhibit further agglomeration of MoS<sub>2</sub> nano-sheets.</p><p>Most of the previous reports, MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers were prepared by hydrothermal synthesis route, result in formation of MoS<sub>2</sub> with particle size ranges between 500 nm to 3 μm with lattice fringes thickness ≥12 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.Therefore it is obvious that for sodium battery application, those bigger particle will significantly increase the Na-ion diffusion path and thick MoS<sub>2</sub> plates will suffer from more internal strain during reaction with sodium, leading to cracking of material, hence poor electrochemical performance. Therefore, it is better to develop a strategic synthetic route that will produce ultrathin MoS<sub>2</sub> layers with smaller particle size.</p><p>Herein, we report a simple hydrothermal technique to produce MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers with optimized stabilizer (PVP) concentration and low hydrothermal temperature. The low hydrothermal temperature promotes the slow nucleation of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles to form controlled MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets and PVP assists the controlled growth of those nanosheets. Further, a composite of exfoliated MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers with rGO has been constructed by simple liquid phase exfoliation method. The exfoliated MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers and graphene composite could exhibit excellent electrochemical performance against sodium compare to most of the recent literature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref>, represents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of as synthesized MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers (referred as MoS hereafter) and MoS<sub>2</sub>/rGO (referred as MoS-G hereafter) demonstrate phase purity of MoS<sub>2</sub> with hexagonal structure (JCPDS # 37-1492). In both cases, peak broadening imply the less number of stacked, disordered layers with smaller crystallite size. Moreover, a shift in (002) diffraction peak from 2θ = 14.04<sup>0</sup> in MoS to 2θ = 13.8<sup>0</sup> in MoS-G demonstrate there is an increase in interlayer spacing of (002) crystal plane for MoS-G as compared to MoS. Magnified view of (002) peak is shown in inset of <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> with (002, 2θ = 14.378) of JCPDS # 37-1492 as a standard. Furthermore, a broadened peak appearing at 2θ = 26.14<sup>0</sup> in case of MoS-G, is purely associated to (002) plane of rGO, which verifies the presence of rGO in MoS-G sample. However, no shift in 2θ was observed for the remaining peaks of MoS and MoS-G. Further, to know the purity of MoS and MoS-G, Raman spectroscopy was carried out. The Raman Spectra of MoS and MoS-G were shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>. The three peaks in the lower wave number range (300–500 cm<sup>−1</sup>) correspond to hexagonal MoS<sub>2</sub>. The peak at 381 cm<sup>−1</sup> ascribed to E<sup>1</sup><sub>2g</sub>, associated with the opposite vibration of two S atoms with respect to Mo atom and A<sub>1g</sub> peak at 407 cm<sup>−1</sup>, are originated from out-plane vibration of only S atoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Another typical MoS<sub>2</sub> peak, assigned as 2 LA (M) appears at 454 cm<sup>−1</sup>. Whereas, MoS-G exhibits two additional broad peaks around 1343 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 1590 cm<sup>−1</sup>, attributed to D-band and G-band of rGO arise from defect-induced vibrations and in-plane vibrations of Sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon in rGO.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Structural characterization of MoS and MoS-G samples.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of MoS and MoS-G, (<bold>b</bold>) Schematic representation of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers (MoS) and MoS<sub>2</sub>/rGO composite (MoS-G) preparation, (<bold>c</bold>) Raman spectra of MoS and MoS-G.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep12571_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The morphology and microstructural analysis of as prepared MoS<sub>2</sub> and its composite with rGO were carried out by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM). <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> shows flower-like three-dimensional nanosphere architecture of MoS<sub>2</sub>, with a diameter ranging between 100–300 nm. The close-up view of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref> depicts these nanoflowers consist of ultrathin nanosheets with a thickness of less than 8 nm. Furthermore, in order to investigate the role of PVP during hydrothermal synthesis, MoS<sub>2</sub> has been synthesized with excess amount (0.5 g of PVP) of PVP and without PVP under the same experimental conditions. It is observed that without PVP, the irregular MoS<sub>2</sub> nanospheres were formed, where individual nanosheets are rarely observed (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). While, by using excess PVP there was no sphere formation instead one dimensional growth of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets was observed (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). Therefore it can be concluded that, PVP plays an important role in forming such smaller size and regular shape of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers. From morphological study, it can be said that PVP could be adsorbed on MoS<sub>2</sub> surface through its C-N and C=O interaction when sufficient amount was used, which prevented the agglomeration of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets further and facilitated a controlled three dimensional growth of nanosheets. Without any capping agent like PVP, irregular growth of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets was observed and resulted in agglomerated nanostructures. Further, with increasing the PVP concentration, the three dimensional growth of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets was supressed by the presence of excess amount of PVP in the solution; hence one dimensional growth was predominantly observed (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2f</xref>). A schematic presentation of such phenomenon is given in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2g</xref>. As indicated by <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b,c</xref> and S1, individual MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers with an average diameter of ≤200 nm are uniformly distributed on rGO surface. For microstructural analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were performed and the images provide more detailed structural information of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers and MoS<sub>2</sub>/rGO composite. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>, represents the TEM image of as-prepared MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers and inset shown a distinct ring pattern of selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) further demonstrates that it is well-crystallized. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>, displays micrographs of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers after 30 minute of sonication in NMP solvent. From these two figures, it is visible that after sonication, the agglomeration size of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers significantly decreased compare to as-prepared MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers and the transparency level also increased. This reflects relatively loose packing with decreased number of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets after ultrasonic treatment. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref> depicts TEM image of MoS<sub>2</sub>/rGO composite after 40 minutes of sonication along with rGO, where individual MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers with expanded interlayer spacing are uniformly distributed on rGO matrix. The SAED pattern of MoS<sub>2</sub>/rGO composite shown as inset of <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>. Furthermore, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images reveal the effect of sonication time on the interlayer distance of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers in NMP. It has been found that MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers, initially having an interlayer distance of 0.62–0.63 nm (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>) increased to 0.64–0.69 nm (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>) only after 30 minutes of sonication. Moreover, ultrasonic treatment for additional 10 min results in an interlayer spacing of 0.68–0.69 nm (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). At the same time, it is also observed that the number of layers in MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers gradually decreased with increasing the sonication time.This may be due to the chipping off of 2D nanosheets from the outer surface of MoS<sub>2</sub> by vibration induced by ultrasonication<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>FEG-SEM images of MoS and MoS-G samples.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) MoS, (<bold>b</bold>,<bold>c</bold>) MoS-G at different magnifi-cations, (<bold>d</bold>) MoS (without PVP), (<bold>e</bold>,<bold>f</bold>) MoS synthesized with optimum and excess PVP ratio respectively.

In both the cases, 1<sup>st</sup> discharge curve shows three plateaus at 1.0–0.8 V, 0.75 V–0.4 V and 0.4–0.01 V which are consistent with the CV analysis. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref> demonstrates the cyclic stability of MoS and MoS-G at 100 mAg<sup>−1</sup> in the same potential range. MoS electrode displays a discharge capacity of 797 mAhg<sup>−1</sup> in 1<sup>st</sup> cycle and an average capacity of 528 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> was observed after 30 cycles. But, after 30 cycles a gradual reduction in discharge capacity (i.e.528 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> to 373 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> at the end of 50 cycles) as well as in the coulombic efficiency were observed. To improve the cyclic stability of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers, a composite material was prepared with rGO (5% of total MoS<sub>2</sub> content). MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets/graphene composite (MoS-G) delivered initial discharge capacity of 1080 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> and a reversible capacity of 575 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> was observed after 10 cycles. At the end of 50 cycles, a discharge capacity of 557 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> was retained, which is about 97% of the reversible capacity of 3<sup>rd</sup> cycle. A coulombic efficiency of around 96% was estimated for initial 30 cycles, which decreased to 94% after 50 cycles. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref>, displays the rate performance of MoS and MoS-G electrodes at different current densities where both the electrodes showed excellent reversible capacity at high current densities (i.e. 500 mA g<sup>−1</sup> and 1 A g<sup>−1</sup>). At 1 A g<sup>−1</sup>, their respective discharge capacities were 406 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> and 433 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>, which is about 75–78% of their discharge capacity at 100 mA g<sup>−1</sup>. Furthermore, when the current density reversed to 100 mA g<sup>−1</sup>, both the electrodes recovered their initial capacity after 20 cycles, suggesting an excellent rate performance cycling stability and robustness of the electrode. The rate capability of MoS electrode can be attributed to its small particle size (≤300 nm) and ultrathin lattice fringes (≤8 nm) that significantly reduces the Na-ion diffusion path. Recently, Wang <italic>et al.</italic> have shown rGO can deliver a reversible capacity of ~176 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> at 100 mA g<sup>−1</sup> against sodium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore 5 wt% rGO in the composite (MoS-G) is expected to contribute only ~11 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>. Hence, it can be concluded that the rGO present in the composite is not contributing significantly to the capacity; rather it improves the interfacial electron transfer in between MoS<sub>2</sub> and rGO surfaces during charge/discharge process. Further rGO induces an increased porosity and high surface area of the composite material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> which can facilitate transport of solvated Na-ion through the electrode, as a result of which, Na<sup>+</sup> can reach each part of electrode materials. rGO can also act as a mechanical buffer to ensure that no change in the electronic connectivity of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers occurs due to the volume change encountered during sodiation/desodiation and helps to maintain the structural integrity of the composite electrode. Additionally, in case of any fracturing due to cycling fatigue, incorporation of rGO in the composite ensures the fractured particle remains in electronic circuit and ensures better capacity retention. Further, to understand the reason behind gradual capacity fading of MoS electrode after 30 cycles and how very less amount of rGO is improving the electrochemical performance of MoS<sub>2</sub> in MoS-G composite, ex-situ TEM analysis of electrodes was performed after their corresponding 50<sup>th</sup> charge cycle. As indicated in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>, no trace of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoflowers can be found after 50<sup>th</sup> charge cycle. It might be due to pulverization of electrode material that results in the formation of very fine MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles which further masked by additive carbon and SEI layer formed during charge/discharge cycling. Such phenomenon leads to loss of contact with current collector hence rapid capacity fading. However, in presence of rGO, even after 50 cycles MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoplates with lateral length 5–20 nm were observed on rGO surface (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4f</xref>). HRTEM images of those nanoplates reveal (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4g</xref>), these are mainly single-layer (blue dotted circle), bi-layer (green dotted circle) or tri-layer (red dotted circle) MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets with expanded interlayer spacing. Thus, rGo possibly helps in keeping MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets a part of the electrical circuit even after fracturing/pulverisation.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Electrochemical performances of MoS and MoS-G via conversion reaction.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Charge-discharge profile at 100 mAg<sup>−1</sup> between 2.6 V–0.01 V vs. Na/Na<sup>+</sup>, (<bold>b</bold>) Cycling performance electrodes at 100 mAg<sup>−1</sup>, (<bold>c</bold>) Power cycle at different current rates, (<bold>d</bold>) Cycling performance of MoS-G anode at 500 mAg<sup>−1</sup>.

It is evident that, 1<sup>st</sup> discharge curve in both cases consists of two plateaus at around 0.97–0.8 V and 0.8–0.4 V, which further shifted to 1.6–1.1 V and 1.06–0.7 V from 2<sup>nd</sup> discharge onwards. It reflects higher degree of reversible sodium intercalation/de-intercalation process. According to <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>, MoS-G, when charged-discharged at 50 mA g<sup>−1</sup>, delivers an initial discharge capacity of 328 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> and then maintained an average capacity of ~203 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> for 100 cycles with ~100% Coulombic efficiency. As per our knowledge, this is one of the best results obtained among recently published MoS<sub>2</sub> SIB anodes based on intercalation/de-intercalation reaction of Na-ion. Whereas, at the same current rate of 50 mA g<sup>−1</sup>, MoS electrode displays an average reversible capacity of ~172 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> for 100 cycles, but exhibits a relatively low efficiency of 96–98%. However, the superiority of MoS-G over MoS is attributed to expanded and exfoliated MoS<sub>2</sub> interlayers in MoS-G, which actually provides more active Na<sup>+</sup> storage sites and low energy barrier of Na<sup>+</sup>-ion to intercalation/de-intercalation. The current densities were also varied to investigate the rate capability of both the samples which are shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>, where minimal drop in capacities with increased current densities indicates higher degree of reversible Na intercalation/de-intercalation owing to their expanded interlayer spacing. The long-term cycling stability of MoS and MoS-G electrodes at a high current density of 1 A g<sup>−1</sup> is represented in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>. It is evident that MoS-G maintains an average discharge capacity of ~131 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> over 1000 cycles with 100% Coulombic efficiency. MoS electrode delivers an average capacity of ~118 mA g<sup>−1</sup> for initial 200 cycles which then reduced to ~90 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> after 1000 cycles. The electrochemical characterization of 8:1:1 ratio electrodes was also carried out and compared with the results of the 6:2:2 ratio electrodes. The reasons for utilizing 6:2:2 electrodes for this study are discussed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supplementary information Fig. S3</xref>. To understand the interfacial charge transfer kinetics of both of these electrodes, EIS experiments were conducted at OCV (open circuit potential).

Furthermore, a large slope of the impedance at low frequency region demonstrates better solid-state diffusion of Na<sup>+</sup>-ions into the MoS-G compare to MoS electrode. This is again attributed to high porosity and large surface area induced by rGO matrix in the electrode structure.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Electrochemical performances of MoS and MoS-G via intercalation mechanism.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Charge-discharge voltage curves during initial two cycles at 50 mAg<sup>−1</sup> between 2.6 V–0.4 V vs. Na/Na<sup>+</sup>, (<bold>b</bold>) Cycling performances at 50 mAg<sup>−1</sup> (<bold>c</bold>) Rate capability at different current densities, (<bold>d</bold>) Cycling performance at 1 Ag<sup>−1</sup>.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep12571_Fig5_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>As we observed in our previous study, MoS<sub>2</sub> electrode behaves differently with lithium after first discharge-cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Using high surface sensitive instruments and with the help of ab-initio calculation we came to a conclusion that in the 1<sup>st</sup> discharge cycle, MoS<sub>2</sub> converted to Mo and Li<sub>2</sub>S as usual conversion mechanism. However, during the opposite scan, the reaction changes its route and undergoes alloying reaction between Li and S at room temperature. The extra capacity contribution can be accounted for Li-S alloy reaction and that was not investigated by any other group previously. The proposed mechanism is well agreement with theoretical study and through experimental results. The present study is dedicated to understanding the interaction of Sodium with MoS<sub>2</sub> in different cycles. In the beginning, the changes in the crystal structure upon sodiation/de-sodiation process were studied using ex-situ XRD taken at various stages of the reaction during first cycle. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref> depicts the XRD pattern of MoS electrode before cycling at open circuit voltage (OCV), at 0.8 V and at 0.4 V in discharge (middle region of the discharge reaction), at 0.01 V after complete discharge, at 1.5 V in the middle of the charge reaction and finally at 2.6 V at the end of the first charge process. When the electrode is discharged to 0.4 V, the diffraction peak corresponding to (002) plane almost disappeared, whereas peaks for (100), (103) and (110) crystal planes became broader. At 0.4 V, MoS<sub>2</sub> does not involve in any kind of chemical reaction except intercalation of Na<sup>+</sup> ions into MoS<sub>2</sub> layers.After complete discharge to 0.01 V, all peaks for MoS<sub>2</sub> disappeared and only one peak located at 2θ = 38.9<sup>0</sup>(marked in red circle), can be indexed to the (220) plane of Na<sub>2</sub>S (JCPDS No. 03-0933). This phenomenon suggests the amorphous nature of MoS<sub>2</sub> which converted to Mo and Na<sub>2</sub>S. During charging at 1.5 V, the Na<sub>2</sub>S peak still exists (marked in green circle), but became broader, indicating partial conversion of Na<sub>2</sub>S. When MoS electrode was further charged to 2.6 V, the peak for Na<sub>2</sub>S finally disappeared and a diffraction peak at 2θ = 33<sup>0</sup> (marked in blue circle) appeared again, which corresponds to (100) crystal plane of MoS<sub>2</sub>, indicating complete conversion of Na<sub>2</sub>S and Mo and reformation of MoS<sub>2</sub>. For more insight of the reaction mechanism, the EDAX and elemental mapping profiles of MoS electrodes at OCV and after completion of 1<sup>st</sup> cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S5</xref>) were performed and revealed the atomic percentage (%) ratio of Mo:S remain constant to 1:2. The observation is also indicative of reformation of MoS<sub>2</sub> after 1<sup>st</sup> charge cycle. However, the increased percentage (%) of oxygen along with the introduction of sodium after complete cycle is attributed to surface deposition of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> as SEI and arial oxidation of sodium into Na<sub>2</sub>O during sample handling. To further elucidate the structural changes during charge-discharge process, an ex-situ HRTEM of the MoS electrodes were carried out at three different stages during the 1<sup>st</sup> cycle: (i) at OCV, (ii) at the end of intercalation reaction i.e. 0.4 V during discharge, (iii) at the end of conversion reaction i.e. 2.6 V after complete charge. It is evident from <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>, that as the electrode discharged to 0.4 V, the crystallinity of MoS<sub>2</sub> layers (in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>) have been destroyed and a distorted structure with irregular orientation of expanded MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoplates were observed. Furthermore, such distortion also leads to cracking and formation of single layer MoS<sub>2</sub> shown by blue dotted circle in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>. HRTEM image of charged-discharged electrode at 2.6 V (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>) reveals the formation of very fine nanoparticles with enlarged interlayer spacing. The formation of very fine nanoparticles might be the reason for the absence of (002) XRD peak along with other low-intense diffraction peaks of MoS<sub>2</sub> after a complete charge process.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Ex-situ X-Ray diffraction pattern and HRTEM images of MoS electrode.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Ex-situ X-ray diffraction pattern of MoS at different cut off potentials.

Therefore, to further understand the SEI formation, which are mainly Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and alkyl carbonates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> on electrode/electrolyte interface during the progress of cell reaction with sodium-ion and the charge-discharge mechanism, in-situ electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed during 1<sup>st</sup> discharge-charge cycle and shown in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>. The EIS of MoS electrode was taken during sodiation/de-sodiation process at eight specified potentials (<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>). The analysis of impedance spectra is based on the equivalent circuits presented in the inset of <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>, where the symbol R<sub>o</sub>, represents the ohmic resistance, contributed by combination of current collectors, electrode, separator and mainly electrolyte, is indicated by the intercept at high frequency. R<sub>sl</sub> and Q<sub>sl</sub>, represented by semicircle at high frequency are attributed to resistance of migration and capacity of surface-passivation layer respectively. The R<sub>ct</sub> and Q<sub>ct</sub> stand for charge transfer resistance and double layer capacitance, respectively, shown by a semicircle in mid-frequency region and Warburg impedance (W), displayed by a straight line at low frequency region, originates from the diffusion of charged species (i.e. solvated Na<sup>+</sup>-ion) through the bulk of the electrode material. Form <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7a</xref>, it is observed that upon sodiation from OCV to 0.8 V, two semicircles appeared in the corresponding Nyquist plot, where the high frequency semicircle (HFS) displays high resistive nature compared to medium frequency semicircle (MFS). Generally, the semicircle in high frequency is attributed to the resistance of surface- passivation layer (SEI) and the small semicircle in medium frequency is indexed to the resistance of charge transfer on electrode/electrolyte interfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Hence, HFS at 0.8 V can be considered to be originating from SEI formation on the interface (the resistance of SEI film coupled with SEI film capacitance) and the MFS is related to Na- intercalated MoS<sub>2</sub> on the surface of the electrode. This phenomenon is very similar to Li/graphite system where intercalation-deintercalation is a dominant process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. As the electrode discharged to 0.4 V, the small semicircle in the medium frequency region disappeared instead a single semicircle with significant high R<sub>sl</sub> value was observed. Such phenomenon indicates the formation of a thick SEI layer on the surface. Another reason being that more Na-intercalation at 0.4 V leads to distortion and exfoliation of MoS<sub>2</sub> (previously shown in ex-situ XRD and ex-situ TEM analysis), providing significant number of fresh electrode/electrolyte interface, on which new SEI layer could be formed. Besides, an almost perpendicular straight line in low frequency region indicates the consumption of Na<sup>+</sup>-ion by SEI layer causing reduction in Coulombic efficiency. This thickening of SEI layer was also verified independently by Lacey <italic>et al.</italic>, via in-situ. AFM study where they observed that the average thickness of SEI formed on sodiated MoS<sub>2</sub> surface is 20.4 nm ± 10.9 nm within a potential window of 3.0 V–0.4 V<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Whereas, at 0.01 V, the single semicircle in the whole frequency range is correspondences to the SEI layer dominating impedance response. However, a little decrease in R<sub>sl</sub> value and slight inclination of Warburg impedance (i.e. solid state diffusion is preferred over Na<sup>+</sup>-ion adsorption) are indicative of formation of a new phase. During charging, upon subsequent de-sodiation, the R<sub>sl</sub> starts to decrease dramatically and continued to the end of the charge process. Such phenomenon is attributed to dissolution or destruction of SEI layer caused by significant volume change of electrode material due to Na<sup>+</sup>-ion migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. When the charging process attended to 1.5 V from 0.5 V, there is no significant change in their corresponding Nyquist plots, instead a drop in R<sub>sl</sub> value corresponding to SEI decomposition was observed. Now, as the electrode charged to 2.0 V, an impedance plot with two semicircles came into scenario. Herein, it is obvious that the semicircle at high frequency is contributed by SEI and the semicircle at medium frequency could be ascribed to incomplete MoS<sub>2</sub> formation. Moreover, similar phenomenon was also demonstrated by voltage profile charge-discharge curve in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7b</xref>. Where, during charging a voltage plateau starts at 1.5 V and disappeared around 2 V, suggesting main charge reaction happens in this voltage range. Further charging to 2.6 V, the HFS remains almost unaffected, indicating complete destruction of surface-passivating layer is not possible in 1<sup>st</sup> cycle, where the MFS get depressed and exhibits diffusion dominant behaviour. This is attributed to the formation of very small MoS<sub>2</sub> particles with expanded interlayer spacing, which significantly increases the surface area of the electrode. Hence, providing sufficient contact between the active material and electrolyte, leads to decrease in charge transfer resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> which is in good agreement with ex-situ TEM image at 2.6 V (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>). Furthermore, formation of such fine nanoparticles induces additional porosity and shorter diffusion pathway allowing Na<sup>+</sup>-ion to diffuse into the bulk.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy study and analysis of MoS electrode at different state-of-charge conditions.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) EIS (Nyquist plot) spectra of MoS electrode at different potentials during 1<sup>st</sup> cycle (circles: experimental curve, lines: fitted curve, D: discharge, C: charge, inset: corresponding equivalent circuits), (<bold>b</bold>) charge-discharge profile of 1<sup>st</sup> cycle along with potential points where EIS were taken and (<bold>c</bold>) tabulation of impedance values of 1<sup>st</sup> charge-discharge cycle.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep12571_Fig7_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>In summary, a simple and scalable hydrothermal-ultrasonic method has been successfully developed to make exfoliated MoS<sub>2</sub> and composite of MoS<sub>2</sub>-r graphene oxide as high energy density anodes for SIBs.

After complete drying, the electrodes were sealed in separate air-tight sample boxes and taken out from glove box for respective XRD analysis. Whereas for TEM analysis, first disperse the electrode materials in isopropyl alcohol inside the glove box, then taken out from glove box and drop casted on Cu-grid followed by 30 minutes sonication.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Electrochemical cell fabrication and measurements</title><p>The MoS electrodes were prepared by mixing of active material with Carbon (Carbon black, C65, Timcal, Switzerland) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) sodium salt in de-ionized water in the wt. ratio 6:2:2. For MoS-G the preferred ratio is 6:1.5:2, in order to keep carbon content fixed to 20%. The electrodes were also fabricated using a ratio of 8:1:1. Then those electrode materials were painted on Cu-foil and dried overnight in an air oven at 65 °C. After complete drying, 10 mm circular discs of electrodes were loaded into Swagelok type half-cell configuration cells for electrochemical testing. The cells were assembled in an Ar-filled glove box (UniLab, Mbraun, H<sub>2</sub>0 ~ 0.5 ppm, O<sub>2</sub> ~1.0 ppm) with cast discs as working electrode against Na-foil (Alfa Aesar) anode which acts as both counter and reference electrode, with a borosilicate glass fibre (GF/D, Whatman) as separator soaked in 1 M NaClO<sub>4</sub> in 7:3 (w/w) propylene carbonate (PC): ethylene carbonate (EC) electrolyte. The prepared electrodes were then aged for 6 h before any electrochemical testing to ensure good soaking of electrolyte into electrodes and separator. The typical active material loading of the negative electrodes were in the range of 1.22 ± 0.1 mg.cm<sup>−2</sup>. The Galvanostatic charge-discharge tests were performed with Arbin Instrument, USA (BT2000 model, USA) at various current rates with two different voltage cut off of 2.6 V–0.01 V and 2.6 V–0.4 V (vs. Na/Na<sup>+</sup>).Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) experiments were conducted by measuring <italic>i-V</italic> response at a scan rate of 0.1 mVS<sup>−1</sup> within potential limit of 2.6 V–0.001 V (vs. Na/Na<sup>+</sup>) using Biologic VMP-3 model, France. The in-situ Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out using Biologic VMP-3 model, France. Eight different potential points (OCV, different discharge points as: 0.8 V, 0.4 V and 0.01 V vs. Na/Na<sup>+</sup> and charge points as: 0.5 V, 1.5 V, 2.0 V and 2.6 V vs. Na/Na<sup>+</sup>) were selected according to voltage profile during charge-discharge curve of MoS electrode for in-situ EIS experiments. At each point potentiostatic EIS was taken within a frequency range of 1 MHz to 10 mHz and with voltage amplitude ∆V = 5 mV. For EIS experiments, charge-discharge experiment of electrodes was carried out at a current density 20 mA g<sup>−1</sup>. All the electrochemical performances were measured at a constant temperature of 20 °C with controlled humidity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Sahu, T.
