id="Abs1"><title>Abstract</title><sec><p id="Par1">Imposing lockdown amid COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected flower cultivation and their trades. Flower plants are very sensitive to the harvesting, and any unexpected delay may cause great loss (~ 50–60%) to the farmers. In 2018–2019, the worth of total production of floriculture products was ~ Rs 571.38 crore. During lockdown, the availability of human laborers and restricted transport has disrupted the supply of flowers to the market. Hence, some alternative options are suggested here for the farmers, for example, conversion of decorative flowers (e.g., anthurium, China aster, globe amaranthus, sweet-william, anemone, sea lavender, etc.) and inflorescence (e.g., Michaelmas daisy, zinnia, statice, ferns, aspidistra, eucalyptus, magnolia, etc.) can also be into value-added products through drying and dehydration technologies. Many dehydration methods such as hot air oven, solar drying, press drying, freeze-drying, embedded drying, glycerine drying, and microwave oven drying polyester drying can be used for flower drying at room temperature (~ 25 °C). These floral and foliage dehydration techniques are quite simple, which can also be operated by unskilled persons. Moreover, it will generate self-employment for the youth and women along with increased revenue than selling fresh flowers. In this review, different techniques of flower drying have been discussed in detail along with the influencing factors, efficiency, economic feasibility, flower waste management and sustainability. Further, it has also been suggested how these techniques could be useful for farmers, researchers, and traders to create value-added products? Hence, the present paper could be very interesting for the flower growers, retailers, students, as well as floricultural scientists who are involved in flower production worldwide.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p id="Par2"><fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10668_2023_3376_Figa_HTML.png" position="anchor" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Drying techniques of flowers</kwd><kwd>Local employment</kwd><kwd>Waste management</kwd><kwd>Value-added products</kwd><kwd>Environmental sustainability, COVID-19 triggered lockdown</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-collection-editor</meta-name><meta-value>Jesús Peña-Vinces, João J.

In India, flowers are associated with the happiness and sorrow of the individual as man is born with flowers, lives up with flowers, and eventually dies with flowers. Worship is likewise an essential part of human life and places of worship consist of temples, mosques, churches, and gurudwaras where flowers are used all the year without difference of religion. Recently, floriculture has been proved as a profitable business as its importance, utility, and scope of ornaments have been realized (Raghava, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">2001</xref>). The color and fragrance of flowers bring a sense of freshness and beauty to life and are a beautiful way of expressing one's feelings and play a vital role in making the life of a person more joyful. Flowers are one of the best gifts to offer to someone, but fresh flowers cannot be stored for long periods; however, gifts in the form of dried flowers can stay with the recipients for longer times as sweet memories (Bhalla et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Dried flowers can be a potential sources for replacing fresh flowers and foliage plants in the house decoration, as well as for artistic and industrial uses. In both domestic and international markets, dehydrated flower products are in high demand. There is a great demand for dried flower items in the USA, Japan, and Europe, which are marketed at higher costs due to handcraft and new valuable products. The use of dried flowers in the manufacture of various products enhances the appearance and beauty of handicrafts (Batra, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>; Singh &amp; Kumar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">2008</xref>). In the changing climate scenario, dehydrated flower items can be made throughout the year and are also very important sources of additional income for the farmer's family as well as the rural unemployed persons. Kant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2018</xref>) concluded that drying techniques of ornamental plants and foliage are one of the pleasant methods to maintain these in original shape, color, and year-round availability due to toughness, novelty, smooth operation, low transportation price as well as being environmentally pleasant. Dehydration technology of flowers can help to remain the shape and color of flowers as original for a longer time with little care. Dried flowers are long life span flowers and maintain their size and color for several months after harvesting (Malcolm, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">1994</xref>). Dried flowers can have a longer shelf life if they are dried under proper technique (Sheela, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">2008</xref>). Dried products prepared from ornamental plants have a huge range of characteristics together with unique quality, longer durability, creativity, flexibility, and all-year availability for flower lovers (Joyce, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">1998</xref>). Dried flower industries can assist in the creation of jobs for other family members, rural women, physically challenged individuals, and farmers where these unemployed persons can easily generate more income. Presently, consumers are becoming more environmentally concerned, and they want to use flower products that are eco-friendly and biodegradable (Singh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">2018</xref>). A wide range of wild/unused plant species are available and can be used commercially to make various dried flower products (Bhattacharjee &amp; De, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2003</xref>). The drying of flora and leaves can also be used for various functions to make ornamental products including floral segments, greeting cards, wall hangings, potpourris, landscapes, calendars, etc. (Bhalla &amp; Sharma, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2002</xref>; Bhutani, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1990</xref>). Murugan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2007</xref>) reported that potpourris that are the main parts of the dried flower trades earned value at Rs 55 crore in India. In the earlier period, the British established a dry flower industry in Calcutta for its proximity to the northern and eastern parts of India, where a wide range of diverse flowers as well as exotic in nature are available. In floriculture and flower-based value-added products, the business of dried flowers in India's fastest-growing industry, with more than 50 enterprises, is presently involved. Most of the companies are mainly located in Tamil Nadu, Calcutta, and Mumbai. M/s Ramesh Flower Limited, situated in Tuticorin (Tamil Nadu), exported 50% of the total dried flower shares from India (Anon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>). In the year 2016, total floriculture products exported amounted to Rs 450 crore, with dried flowers contributing Rs 315 crore (60%). The industry exported 500 different varieties of dehydrated flowers and foliage part to 20 countries around the world (Jawaharlal et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2013</xref>). The main export houses of dried flowers in India are in Tuticorin (50%) and Kolkata (40%), and remaining 10% are exported other parts of country. The major dry flower players in India are Singhvi International, Kolkata (based on Tuticorin port), M/s Minex Agencies, Kolkata (APEDA, 2017). Keeping in view the above facts about the dried flower industry, the present review focuses on the flower production scenario and how flower growers can benefit flower products during the lockdown in the country like COVID-19. These days, the ICAR, a premier research organization in India, also encouraged farmers to make dried colored plants from roses, marigolds, chrysanthemums, and China aster in preference to destroying the ornamentals. Dried flower petals may be utilized to develop gulal in various colors and different marketable commodities for further use (Anon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Impact of lockdown on flowers trade</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>World scenario</title><p id="Par5">Ornamental plants have strong socio-economic values across the world. Dried flowers and leaves can be used to derive value-added products with imposing beneficial impacts on the society. Flowers represent the € 15bn (£ 14bn/$ 18bn) worldwide industry, which supports financially better to the millions of human populations, which involved in their trades. A total of 169 countries are involved in exports of floriculture products. The top ten floriculture exporting countries are presented in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, which show that among the floriculture trading countries, a country like the Netherlands leads the global market with 43.41%, followed by Colombia (7.23%), Germany (5.24%), and India that is ranked 27th with accounted for 0.39% of total global exports in 2019 with a total value of 78,284,000 USD. In importing of floriculture products, 127 countries were involved. The top ten flower importing countries are depicted in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. Germany is the largest importer of floriculture products with a 14.73% share, USA (13.02%), and Netherlands (12.21%), and India is in 48<sup>th</sup> rank with a total value of USD 31,545,000 and share in world trade is 0.16%. Floriculture was severely altered due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the world moved to lockdown, with flowers closing their doors, resulting in the EU cut flower traders spending an amount of €1bn (£900m/$1.2bn) during the first six weeks of lockdown as reported by Union Flyers, The International Flower Trade Association (Fredenburgh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2021</xref>). On March 13, 2020, the Dutch auction fell and Royal Flora Holland in Amsterdam stopped importing and exporting, which is responsible for 40% of the world's total cut flowers on demand. During lockdowns in various countries, the need for flowers, decorative ornamental plants, as well as bulbs of flowering plants decreased due to the COVID-19 epidemic (Van der Ploeg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR232">2020</xref>). This is because of the cutback on global flights and shipments, which are major logistics ways to supply the chain of flowers. Social gatherings, weddings ceremony, funerals, and other flower-based activities around the world have been banned by issuing guidelines from various countries, which has significantly reduced the demand for these products. Therefore, financial risks to florists were observed. For example, in the early stages of lockdown by April 2020, the New York Times reported that Dutch florist had destroyed nearly 400,000,000 flowers that had not been sold due to the pandemic COVID-19 or even donated to hospitals or passers (Lioutas &amp; Charatsari, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2021</xref>). In a survey carried out via Perez-Urestraz et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2021</xref>), the entire variety of contributors who spoke back the questionnaire from different nations was 4205. The survey obtained general responses from forty-six international locations global. Brazil had the highest turnout (29.6%), followed by Greece (23.8%), Spain (19.6%), and Italy (9.4%). Overall results indicate that the need for ornaments and flowers may not decrease, but market availability was almost nil. Royal Flora Holland sales have dropped by an average of 50% each week in comparison with the earlier year due to a shortage of flowers (Craig, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>). The European Union is a major producer, trader, as well as consumer of flowering plants (Darras, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2020</xref>). The total production of flowers in the EU is approximately about 20 billion, which is 44% of global flower and potted plant production. The main flower-producing countries under the EU are the Netherlands, Italy, Germany, France, and Spain (Darras, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2020</xref>). European Union ornamentals decorators are estimated to have misplaced almost four billion $ because of the entering of COVID-19 in nations (Button, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2020</xref>). Seventy percentage of flowers produced in Kenya are exported to Europe, primarily through the auction of the Netherlands. Most of the ornamentals are offered in early spring, but because of the epidemic starting from March 2020, the ornamentals had no longer been exported to the market. Instead, there is a shortage of requests for ornamentals, due to restrictions, declining sales, the closing of shops, and a situation where people cannot get out of their homes. Fredenburgh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2021</xref>) pointed out that Kenya is the third-largest supplier of all rose varieties and sold these flowers in the European Union, where 100,000 flower farms pay low wages to workers and in general vulnerable to sudden losses of income as told by Anna Barker, senior consultant of flowers and served at the Fairtrade Foundation. Flower exports from Kenya fell by 85% in April, "said Barker. By May 2020, 50,000 people had lost their jobs and 20 million had indirectly affected their livelihoods. From 2020, new rules were enacted in favor of the area (legislation of 22 March 2020), which allowed the production, transportation, marketing of ornamental seeds as well as plants, cut flowers, potting plants, etc.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Top ten exporting countries for floricultural products in 2019</p><p>(Source: APEDA/COMTRADE, United

Rs 571.38 crore), but due to COVID-19 in 2020–2021, the country is expected to export floriculture products worth Rs 575.98 crore with a total of floriculture products exported quantity being 15,695.31 MT. Indian floriculture products include dried petal flowers (77.1%), flowers under cut flower category (6.1%), bulbs of ornamentals (0.8%), foliage (0.02%), and others (15.9%). Prominent export destinations from India are the USA, Netherlands, United Arab Emirates, UK, and Germany (APEDA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>). The top ten floriculture product importer scenarios are presented in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, with the USA being the largest importer of floriculture products from India and contributed INR lakh 15,895.51, followed by the Netherlands with INR 10,930.30, Australia (INR 1044.08 lakh) and Singapore being the tenth largest importer of floriculture products (INR 1119.58 lakh) from India in the year 2020–2021. The COVID-19 advisory constituted by way of APEDA recommended that Indian exporters could take advantage of the flower by supplying gaps created from African countries to European markets. However, it is estimated that 99% of the flowers are sold in the domestic market and any loss from that market will have a greater impact on them. The effect of COVID-19 on the flower industry in India has also been observed in areas where the virus does not affect people. The market then plummeted due to lockdown in the whole country due to the spreading of the COVID-19 epidemic. The lockdown becomes introduced in two levels as level I had been started from 25 March to 14 April 2020 and II level lockdown implemented from 15 April to a few days in May 2020 and closed all social gatherings, cultural occasions, religious capabilities, motels, and hospitals wherein plants are big in call for sell. Saha and Bhattacharya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2020</xref>) reviewed reports on the influence of the COVID-19 epidemic on Indian florists and found that florists suffered losses as they could not even recoup their investment. Mitesh Patel, a florist in Badarkha village near Ahmedabad, was worried about the lockdown, fearing that his rose plants were burnt due to high temperature that caused delays in harvesting. Patel, a florist, also said that the supply of fresh roses and marigolds had not been done during the entire crop and dumped the crops in a dust bin as there was no supply of flowers. Monaz Waman from Maharashtra destroyed chrysanthemum flowers worth Rs. 1.60 lakhs, because he could not sell almost 2 tons of chrysanthemum flowers. In the city of Ahmedabad, florist Kunal Yadav expressed his opinion that he had to destroy flowers Rs. 15,000 worth of flowers due to not proper care they are rotting and stinking. Bolapalli, who is also the director of the South India Floriculture Association (CIFA), a florist and exporter's association, said flower growers were suffering because most of the flowers did not fall under the category of essential commodities. He grows cut flowers like carnations and roses from Bangalore, but due to the non-supply of flowers, all flowers were kept in a compost pit or used the stalks for cattle feed due to the lockdown. Keshav Murthy, a florist in Denkanikottai, exports an average of 1.2 lakh roses to countries like New Zealand and Malaysia but was unable to export such cut flowers due to interruption in air connectivity and lockdown. Ashok Kumar, from Solan, Himachal Pradesh, in northern India, said he had grown chrysanthemums and carnations on 3000 m<sup>2</sup> of land, but lost at least Rs. 15 lakhs due to COVID-19 (Vora &amp; Kulkarni, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR238">2020</xref>). Maitreyi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2020</xref>) opined that due to the country lockdown, people were not going to temples for religious and social gatherings, and events were postponed or canceled. Therefore, marigold, chrysanthemum, lily, jasmine, and other locally grown flowers are taken to wholesale markets in cities and dumped. According to the Financial Express Bureau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2021</xref>), due to the lockdown, floriculture farmers have been lost Rs. 100 crores, and it was very difficult to export flowers due to increasing freight charges. Protected agriculture in India is expected to comprise 2000 acres of cut flower land, with a daily yield of 30–40 lakh stems, according to the Indian Society of Floriculture Professionals (ISFP). Praveen Sharma is working in the capacity of president of the Indian Society of Floriculture Professionals (ISFP); the flower export market had completely collapsed due to the cancellation of marriages, which was causing trouble to the florist farmers. Najeeb Ahmed, president of the South Indian Floriculture Association (CIFA), said the lockdown had damaged flower cultivation and management since there was no business from March to October 2020. Although the floriculture business started after October, Indian florist was unable to export their products due to high freight prices. This occupation is highly dependent on labor and the reverse migration of labor has affected crop management. However, to address the problem of florists, the Government of India (GOI) has issued guidelines from 25 April 2020 to partially open retail outlets with limited restrictions and to restart the limited flowers supply chain management. Therefore, states such as West Bengal permitted flower markets to be sold flowers for a few hours, but some flowers were wasted due to the non-supply of flowers. COVID-19 was declared a "Notified Disaster" by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), Government of India, on March 14, 2020, under the Disaster Control Act, 2005. The review report suggested that state governments can make State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) to resolve this problem. According to the guidelines, the Government of India will allocate a fund consisting of 75% amount of the SDRF allocation to states that comes under the general category/ Union Territories as well as Northeastern (NE) States like as Sikkim and to special category states/ Union Territories such as Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Jammu &amp; Kashmir. The National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), established under the same Act, makes 90% of donations to states, in the event of a serious natural disaster and, if not adequately funded, affiliates to the State SDRF. The Fifteenth Financial Commission has approved INR 28,983 crores for the provinces for the fiscal year 2020–2021, with the SDRF accounting for 80% of the total. States might allocate 40% accountability and freedom, as well as 40% recovery and reconstruction in this scenario. Such an amount can be used to help flower producers and retailers that have suffered losses as a result of COVID-19. According to a statement by the Director of the Ghazipur Flower Market Traders Association, which was published in the Hindu newsprint on April 10, 2020, flowers worth a few crores had to be dumped due to COVID-19 and the country's lockdown. The relief amount can be used to compensate floriculturists as well as retailers where they lost their flowers due to COVID-19. Many of them even have poly house bank loans. A statement was given by the President of Himachal Pradesh Fruit, Vegetables and Flowers Grower Association where he reported that floriculturists are not included to receive income support under the scheme launched by Govt. of India under the umbrella of the PM-KISAN Scheme. Bulgari et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2021</xref>) also reported that ornamental products are not important to the human diet; due to the emergency of COVID-19, most of the farmers as well as flower growers are not sold flowers and destroy flowers.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Floriculture product exports from India in the year 2020–2021 </p><p>(Source: DGCIS Annual export)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>S.

Dried flowers, as well as plant parts, are also used to design different greetings and art cards as well as interior decorations. Other plant parts containing pods, bract, peduncle, fruit, or anything found in the ground, with a moisture content varied from 15 and 20% or less (after drying), are appropriate under such category (Chakrabarty &amp; Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2021</xref>). Plant parts like mosses, stems, fleshy fungi, inflorescence, twigs, branches, bark, flowers, thorns/spines, fruits, leaves/ foliage, selaginella, ferns, cones, seeds, roots and minor forest products like lichens, etc., are also appropriate for drying (Raj, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2001</xref>; Vermam et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR236">2012</xref>). Murugan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2007</xref>) reported that the drying of flower arrangements (final products) can be classified under eight categories including (1) liners, (2) main blooms, (3) dehydrated flowers and parts of plants in bulk, (4) floral arrangements, (5) fillers, (6) floral handicrafts, (7) potpourri, and (8) exotics. Dried flowers and their economically important products have an additional value and may be preserved for a longer period if they are kept dry and dust-free. It is well known that dried flower products can be stored for years without being disturbed by various environmental conditions. In recent days, flower drying at the commercial level has been selected as a potential source for the export destination, making up 15% of the world's flower business, while the Netherlands leads the way in dried flower exports after the USA, Mexico, India, Columbia, and Israel (Sharvani &amp; Sree, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">2018</xref>). India exports over INR 315 crores worth of dried flowers and plants each year, with the USA being the top consumer of dried and processed flowers (APEDA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>). Currently, over 300 export-oriented businesses exist in India, with Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu accounting for half of them (Chakrabarty &amp; Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Dried flower products</title><p id="Par8">Various types of dried flower products such as potpourri, flower wreaths, painted cards, and greeting cards are used (Jain, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2016</xref>).

Some of the common ingredients used to prepare potpourri are orris root, benzoin, sweet flag, gum, fine-grained non-iodized salt, storax, and ambergris. In India, main flowers such as rose, bougainvillea, and marigold can be used in combination with globe amaranthus and cockscomb. These flowers and their parts are contained in a well-designed glass bowl of various ranges in colors and stand or placed in a colored satin or muslin bag. Potpourris are not made only to provide a pleasant aroma, but also to repel moths and protect woolen garments while they are being stored.

All plant materials like flowers, foliage, branches of plants, nuts, seeds, grains, pods, cones, berries as well as fruits can also be used for drying (Musgrove, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">1998</xref>). Raj (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2001</xref>) suggested the materials for drying including leaves/foliage, flowers, cones, roots, thorns/ spines stems, twigs, mosses, bark, fruits, branches, seeds, lichens, ferns, fleshy fungi, etc., and all are used to create various value-added products. Floral crafts and flower-based arrangements made from fresh flowers are indestructible and long-lasting. However, the quality of dried materials is dependent on the type of variety in a particular crop. It has been observed that some flowers deteriorate their ornamental value after drying. As a result, the selection of suitable crop/genotype for drying is critical to the profitability of the dried flower sector (Mishra et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2003</xref>). Flowers like as sweet william, anemone, rose, narcissus, pansy, zinnia, stock, daffodil, lily, allium, carnation, freesia, chrysanthemum, marigold, etc., respond well to drying (Rogers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">1988</xref>). Similarly, foliage like ferns, eucalyptus, aspidistra, and leaves such as ivy, magnolia, mahonia, laurel are also showed suitability for dehydration (Healey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">1986</xref>; Rogers, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">1967</xref>). In the case of sweet pea flowers, when the flowers are pressed, the dried flowers have lost their color and have turned dark brown, making them unfit for use (Jean &amp; Lesley, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">1982</xref>). In Helichrysum, the petals are tough but lose their shape as they dry, the petals turn downward and the center disc flowers fall off. This characteristic is more common in the yellow varieties than in the rest (Sangama, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">2004</xref>). Safeena and Patil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">2013</xref>) dried four different varieties of roses, and the Lambada cultivar scored the highest for retaining color, form, and texture, while the lowest scores for color, form, and texture were recorded in 'Ravel' '. Datillo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2001</xref>) made his opinion that the brighter the color of the flower, the longer its color lasts. The bright orange roses, impatiens, marina, tropicana, carrot tops, and holly Toledo faded to dry brilliant orange when drying the yellow flowers keep their color well after drying; however, white blooms can turn a light gray-brown tone. Flowers in dark red colors may darken as they dry. Differences in flower color can be caused by a variety of traits. This type of difference in the color of drying rose varieties was also reported by Acharyya et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2013</xref>), Sohn et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR212">2003</xref>). Sharma et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">2019</xref>) dried various varieties of roses such as First Red, Taj Mahal, Peach Avalanche, Gold Strike, Avalanche, Confetti, Corvette, Guana, Hollywood, Nobelsey, Sweet Avalanche, and Teineke.

The optimum flowering stage, harvesting time, and dehydration time differ from plants and foliage parts. Wang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239">2019</xref>) suggested that chrysanthemum flowers drying under hot air drying showed the lowest general flavonoid levels. Microwave treatment for 30 min after that treated by hot air drying at 75 °C was found most effective method for preserving biologically active chemicals with improved antioxidant properties and further inhibition of the enzyme acetyl cholinesterase. Vacuum air oven drying has been visible as the fine technique for maintaining floral color and associated characteristics. (Pinder &amp; Namita, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2018</xref>). Oulakh and Radha Rani (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2018</xref>) advocated various display packaging materials to increase the visibility of the products and retain the whole quality of the dehydrated flowers for a longer time.

Kant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2018</xref>) reported the timing of harvesting of some important flowers as depicted in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. However, harvesting of flowers during the hot months responded best because most of the water content evaporates from flowers. Adequate care is required in the selection of a method to obtain good results. Harvesting time depends on the flower to flower, and usually, flowers should be harvested when they have reached maturity but before the flower color has disappeared (Padmavathamma, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">1999</xref>). Bhattacharjee and De (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2003</xref>) suggested that flowers such as chrysanthemum, rose, and celosia are harvested at the semi-blooming and full-blooming stages for drying. However, pine cones, ornamental grasses, seeds, and seed heads are harvested when they reach complete maturity (Sankari &amp; Anand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">2014</xref>). Datta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1997</xref>) made his opinion that after one or two of irrigation, flowers and leaves should be collected from the fields. The plucked flowers should be moisture and dew-free. Therefore, it is advisable fact that flowers should be plucked on a sunny day in dry weather. Norman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">1998</xref>) concluded that the flowers must be harvested in the noon period and given proper ventilation for complete drying. Spielberg (2002) opined that the blooms should be picked on dry sunny days for drying. Flowers should pluck when they fully open, but special attention is to be taken for Helichrysum where the flowers shattered during storage if plucked very later. Sharon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">2006</xref>) pointed out that drying methods do not play any role, but it should be ensured that the flowers must be plucked at an appropriate time means before reaching full maturity. The harvesting stage of the flower depends on the species and types of flowers (Paul &amp; Shylla, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2002</xref>). Prasad et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">1997</xref>) reported that fully open flowers should not be harvested as these are not suitable for oven drying. Safeena et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">2006b</xref>) observed that flowers collected at the half-bloom stage took less time to dry. White et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">2002</xref>) gave the opinion that hay, pine cones, seeds, and most seed heads are harvested at the fully mature stage, but before they become visible wither. They further suggested that the flowers are plucked before fully open and the leaves are collected at the peak of the crop growth. In Helichrysum, flowers cut at the fully open stage take less time to dry than the tight bud and half-open bud stage (Sangama, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">2004</xref>). Lourdusamy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2001</xref>) measured the drying pattern in three flowers. They concluded that completely opened gomphrena flowers, as well as half and full opened French marigold and zinnia flowers, are excellent for dehydration. Erv, Evans, and Miller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">1998</xref>) suggested that herb flowers that are dried and harvested for crafts are plucked just after fully opened. The sun's rays, moisture in the blossoms and cold, cause the flowers to discolor and deteriorate the herb's quality. Seeds, pine cones, hay, and mostly seed heads are harvested at a fully mature stage, but before they become visible wither (Dana &amp; Lerner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2002</xref>). Hemant et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2016b</xref>) reported that drying is done in a microwave oven embedded with silica gel for excellent dried flower quality, size, color, flower diameter, integrity, and pigment retention. Sharma et al.

Plucking of flowers during the dry season gives the best performance because water contains in flowers and foliage easily evaporates. In terms of flower quality, the winter season produces the brightest colors, but in monsoon, the plants are more susceptible to various insects, pests, and diseases. Flowers ought to be plucked on dry sunny conditions, mid-morning to mid-afternoon (after complete evaporate dew), but avoid picking too late as bright sunlight can fade the bloom. The appropriate time for plucking flowers is early morning when the sun rises because the plants' dew has evaporated due to the sun (Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1999</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>For dry grasses, seeds, pine cones, and most seed heads</title><p id="Par37">Seeds, seed heads, dry grasses, and pine cones when reaching full maturity but have not dried are collected on the last day of their growing season (Chakrabarty &amp; Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Drying methods</title><p id="Par38">The drying procedure has a considerable impact on product quality, clarity of dried products, and other decorative elements (Chakrabarty &amp; Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2021</xref>). Various methods for drying or dehydrating flora or foliage are used. In these techniques, moisture is eliminated artificially by the use of various techniques of dehydration and desiccants. Datta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2016</xref>) standardized various dehydration techniques including pressure drying, freeze-drying, embedded drying, air drying, press drying, oven drying, etc., for fresh forms of flowers, twigs, branches, leaves, etc., which may store for a longer period. Flowers and other plant parts are commonly dried in the sun for commercial purposes, but alternative drying strategies such as microwave oven drying, air drying, oven drying, desiccants drying, ice drying and glycerinization treatment are now also useful. Drying flowers and other plant parts like foliage may be helpful to make decorative floral craft items such as floral-based cards, flower arrangements, wall hangings, landscapes, calendars, and potpourris. Among the dried flower products, Potporis is the major segment of the dried flower industry (about 70% or more) for various purposes.</p><p id="Par39">Drying of plant parts refers to the evaporating moisture artificially from any plant parts by heating under controlled humidity, temperature, and airflow. In living materials, the drying process has been used to examine any chemical alterations and microbial growth (Bhattacharjee et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>). The quality of dried flowers as well as plants foliage is generally influenced by the dehydration method adopted for drying purposes. Various dehydration techniques, such as sun drying, air drying, oven drying, dryer drying, freeze-drying, press drying, and microwave oven drying, have been now in progress. Glycerinization can be used to treat flowers, twigs, and leaves for retaining their fresh appearance for several months or years (Mishra et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2003</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Natural drying</title><p id="Par40">It is the oldest and simplest method of drying in which leaves, plants, pods, etc., can be dried in the solar.

In this drying method, the plant material is attached with a rope/wire and kept in a dark or sun-hanging position for quick drying. A wide range of flowers has been demonstrated the suitability for air drying (Chakrabarty &amp; Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2021</xref>; Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2015</xref>; Geetha et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2004</xref>; Raj, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2006</xref>; Singh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">2008</xref>). Collier and Jett (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2002</xref>) concluded that air drying is the simplest method to preserve seed pods and flowers with little or no cost. Dana and Lerner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2002</xref>) stated that air drying is suitable for plants with semi-dry flowers and stems. It demands a warm, dark, and well-ventilated environment with a minimal humidity (Raghupathy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">2000</xref>). However, Champoux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1999</xref>) reported that flowers hanged under dark conditions took 8–10 days to dry if adequate ventilation is available. Raghupathy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">2000</xref>) mentioned that a clean dark place with a minimum of humidity in the drying area is needed to dry the air. Flowers should be picked in good quality for air drying, and then, the foliage should be removed and hung upside down in a warm dark place. Stewart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR217">1997</xref>) noted the withering of petals in air-dried flowers, while Martha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">1997</xref>) noted that air drying works best on plants, perennials, and ornamental grasses. Weak flowers if any should be discarded before they dry out (Perry, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">1996</xref>). White et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">2002</xref>) optimized longer time for dehydration in foliage and more fleshy flowers. Dana and Lerner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2002</xref>) opined that air drying is the easiest technology for semi-dried flowering plants and drying is recommended in a cool, dark place with good air circulation. The flowers are tied with twine, ribbon and hung in warm air in a dark room, a process that takes 1–2 weeks to dry completely and is determined by atmospheric humidity, temperature, humidity, flower size, air, and velocity (Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2015</xref>). Sell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">1993</xref>) suggested that rooms with a relative humidity of 75% or higher encourage the growth of mold that spoils flowers so humidity must be maintained. Datta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1999</xref>) concluded that flowers can spread on blotting sheets/newspapers and be saved inside the darkish or within the sun to dry plants. Sharon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">2004</xref>) made his opinion that air drying is an excellent technique for plant parts drying and is of high quality suited for flowers with low humidity. Air drying technology should be accomplished in a closed cellar due to the fact that dark places assist the flowers to retain their natural shade. Dubois and Joyce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2005</xref>) discovered that raising the air temperature hastened the drying process. The ideal temperature range for drying flora is between 60 and 80 degrees celsius. Enzyme reactions are destroyed if the temperature surpasses 60 °C, which is relevant because some enzymes are necessary for chemical reactions that result in browning (for example, polyphenol oxidase). Schmutze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">2007</xref>) pronounced that air drying is the greatest method for preserving color and flavor. According to Bryan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1992</xref>), air drying in roses, larkspur, statice, and strawflowers is the finest approach. Helichrysum and statice flowers have a crunchy feel that can be dehydrated by hanging them upside down or keeping them in a container until dry (Bhutani, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1995</xref>). Delphiniums, globe thistle, celosia, and hydrangeas can be easily dried by air drying (Mercer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">1996</xref>). During the dry season and summer, Kumar and Parmar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">1998</xref>) discovered that air dehydration under shade is very beneficial to flowers like acroclinium, helichrysum, and limonium. Salvia, goldenrod, strawflower, celosia (crested and plumed types), hydrangeas, baby wreath, and statice were found to be suitable for air-drying (Smith &amp; Laschkewtsch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">1998</xref>). Pavildou (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">1998</xref>) noted that species including<italic>, Craspedia globosa, Delphinium consolida, Limonium suworowii, Limonium ottolepis, Helipterum manglesii, Achillea millefolium, Helichrysum bracteatum, Helipterum roseum, Limonium perezii and Limonium sinuatum</italic> responded best under air drying. To keep their color and quality, all of the above species can do well when dried at 30 °C for the first week and 20 °C for the second and third weeks under darker conditions and well-ventilated areas. Pertuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2002</xref>) noticed that air-dried flowers become exceedingly rigid. After drying, blue and yellow flowers retain their color but pink blooms fade. Flowers with a crisp texture, such as strawflowers, statice and others are more suited to this drying procedure (Susan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">1990</xref>). This approach is simple and inexpensive, but it takes a longer time to dry. Anopheles, Delphinium, Oregano, Rumex and Holmscoldia, among other flowers, can also be air-dried (Raj, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2006</xref>). Statice flowers, gypsophila, and gomphrena responded best in air drying when hang dry under a dark room (MacPhail, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">1997</xref>). Some important flowers with a crisp texture, such as Limonium (statice), helichrysum (strawflower), and acrolinum (paper daisy), are hung upside down and placed in a pot so that they are dried easily. Keep in mind that the drying area is sufficiently ventilated to prevent the flowers from decaying before they dry out. Poppy heads, globe thistle, Chinese lanterns, and baby's wreath dry out in the air when hung upside down (Singh &amp; Kumar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">2008</xref>). Pinder and Namita (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2018</xref>) observed high acceptability of dried flower texture, minimum brittleness of dried flowers, flower damage, flower size, and maximum flower color acceptability under a vacuum air oven for 60 days. However, reduced flower weight was observed under microwave drying. Overall, drying with vacuum air oven drying performed best because it preserved floral color and associated parts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Sun drying</title><p id="Par42">The plant material is implanted in a container and dried quickly in the sun using the sun-drying process. Materials like eucalyptus, palm leaf, poppy pod, lotus pod, cornflower, etc., are commonly used for sun drying. Aside from that, flowers such as marigolds, pansies, zinnias, and pompon chrysanthemums are dried by embedding them upside down in the sand before exposing them to the sun. In India, sun-drying is the most frequent method (Anon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1997</xref>). Bhutani (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1995</xref>) briefly discussed the use of sun-drying in flowers. For most flowers and herbs, solar dryers have been employed for the same reason. In India, open sun drying is a typical method of flower drying. Bassapa et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1991</xref>) investigated the suitability of sun-drying strategies for strawflowers (<italic>Helichrysum bractatum</italic>) and concluded that drying in sun responded best for strawflowers. Flowers including poppy, zinnia, acroclinium, chrysanthemum, globe amaranth, and marigold can be easily sun-dried (Deepthi &amp; Santhosh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2008</xref>). Dubois (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2005</xref>) suggested that solar dehydration is a low-cost method for dehydration of flowers. Rangasamy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">1998</xref>) mentioned that the best solar dryer could reduce drying times and may be the best strategy for drying flowers. He also said that the sun dryer method of rapid dehydration is less expensive, although it is depending on weather conditions. Chrysanthemum, pansies, zinnias, pompon, and marigolds embedded in the sand and set in the sun will dry up within two days (Sankari &amp; Anand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Press drying</title><p id="Par43">Flowers and foliages are kept between newspaper sheets or two blotting paper layers, and these sheets are placed on corrugated board of the same size to evaporate water to escape from the plant and also be permitted to flowers and leaves to dry without losing the products natural shape. The method of press drying is described in 1820, but this method was later adopted to prepare the herbarium (Lawrence, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">1969</xref>). In this method, it must be ensured that the water vapor completely escapes from the plants otherwise there is a risk of microorganism attack, failure of drying and loss of material. Drying sheets are placed in the oven at the optimal temperature; drying time can be reduced (Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1997</xref>). Prasad et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">1997</xref>) highlighted the drawbacks of press drying and observed that the shape of the material could not be maintained as it flattened by the press. Flowers and leaves flatten after press drying; they cannot be utilized to manufacture products like floral designs, greeting cards, and other wall-mounted art (Bhutani, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1990</xref>).</p><p id="Par44">A wide range of flowers and leaves as well as a big variety of unknown materials can be dried quickly by press drying (Chakrabarty &amp; Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2021</xref>; Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2015</xref>; Geetha et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2004</xref>; Mir et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2009</xref>). Kher and Bhutani (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">1979</xref>) optimized the temperature and time of flowers under press drying in an oven at 35–39 °C for 48 h as compared to 24 h for leaves of hibiscus, haemotoxylon, calliandra, marigold, and Cassia. Flowers such as roses, carnations, and helichrysum are dried under an electric hot air oven at 40–45 °C for 120, 133, and 72 h, respectively, as compared to 24 h for leaves and flowers of adiantum, nephrolepis, and flowers of thuja, Hibiscus, marigold, and caliandra (Verma et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">2012</xref>). The drying time can be reduced if the sheets are kept at the proper temperature in the oven. The original color of the material is preserved in this procedure, but the shape of the substance is not (Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1997</xref>). Lourdusamy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2002</xref>) noted that flower press drying is a quick-drying method for drying chrysanthemum, verbena, candytuft, lantana, rose, euphorbia, and leaves as fern, silver oak thuja, etc. Gill et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2002</xref>) optimized time for rose drying at 120 h while carnation took 132 h and helichrysum best drying and took 72 h for press-drying. They further suggested that absorbent face tissues can be kept on the pages to aid in the drying of the flowers. Kher and Bhutani (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">1979</xref>) optimized time for dehydration of pansy under press drying varied from 35 to 39 °C while oven took 48 h, compared to 24 h for thuja, adiantum, and silver oak leaves. According to Smith and Laschkewtsch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">1998</xref>), pressing flowers is a simple method of preserving them, but the color fades and the blooms flatten out, especially asters, buttercups, zinnias, pansies and geraniums. Buttercups, daffodils, pansies, marigolds and Queen Anne lace, on the other hand, are excellent in suppressing it. Flowers can be pressed by layering them between absorbent materials such as newspapers, old books, or catalogs. Flowers like pansies, coral-bells, lilies, hardy geraniums, and vine flowers are appropriate for press drying (Sharon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">2004</xref>). Datta and Roy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2011</xref>) reported press drying for fern (9 days); caeselpinia, rorippa, (13 days); <italic>Digera muricata, Digitaria setigera, M</italic>imusops <italic>eleng</italic>i, <italic>Setaria glauca, and Echinochloa colonial</italic> (12 days); Mussanda, <italic>Vernonia cinerea</italic> (18 days); <italic>Wedelia chinensis,</italic> Ixora and <italic>Oplisnemus hirtellus,</italic> (11 days); Acalypha, <italic>Bamboo spp</italic>, <italic>Azadirachta indica, Sapium cebiferum</italic> (14 days); thuja (28 days); bougainvillea (8 days), Brassica (25 days); phlox (29 days), <italic>Oplisnemus spp., Polygonum spp., Sida acuta, Synedrella nudiflora</italic> took (16 days) under press drying.

In this technology, the size and color of product remained. Flowers and foliage must be very fine for embedded drying. Drying of flowers can be done throughout the year by embedding methods with readily available flora and fauna by setting up small-scale industries, which can help generate employment for unemployed men and women (Batra, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>). Flowers and foliage are gently embedded in silica gel, sand, clay, borax metal or plastic containers in a well-ventilated environment at room temperature. During hang-drying, Raj (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2006</xref>) noticed changes in the shape of dehydrated ornamental products primarily owing to moisture loss from the cells. Flowers must be dried by adding desiccants such as borax mixture, fine sand, and silica gel to avoid petal shrinkage. As for embedding media, borax, sawdust, sand, perlite, silica gel, and a combination of desiccants are utilized. Sand and borax are less expensive in embedded media, but drying takes longer; therefore, desiccants including borax, sand, silica gel, and cornmeal are utilized. Silica gel responded best for delicate flowers like roses, dahlias, carnations, etc. (Prasad et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">1997</xref>). Borax and alum are lighter in weight and can be used in dehydrating flowers (Bhattacharjee &amp; De, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2003</xref>). Being hygroscopic, borax can be used to bleach petals of flowers, if they are left in place for a long period (Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1997</xref>). Due to its easy handle, weighty and not reacting with water vapor fine sand is the excellent embedding media (Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2001</xref>). Silica gel is supported by Winter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR247">1998</xref>, because it is absorbed moisture more quickly from flowers than from borax and sand and the shape of the flowers is also retained (Nirmala et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2008</xref>). Trinklein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR227">2000</xref>) observed that flowers treated with silica gel dried quickly, so it is an easy way to have more flowers dried in a short period. Silica gel crystals turn blue on drying and showed pink color after absorbing moisture. If reuse silica gel as embedding media, heat it in the oven until the crystals turn blue. Drying may be successful, but it is a time-consuming procedure that is completely dependent on weather conditions. The pots were kept at the proper temperature after the flowers were embedded with desiccants (Kher &amp; Bhutani, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">1979</xref>).</p><p id="Par46">Various workers have reported that silica gel responded ideal media for producing high-quality dehydrated flowers (Susan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">1990</xref>; Bhutani, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1993</xref>; Champoux, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1999</xref>; Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1999</xref>; Alleman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1994</xref>;, Roberts, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">1997</xref>; Thomler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR225">1997</xref>; Lourdusamy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">1998</xref>; Pertuit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2002</xref>; Nirmala et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2008</xref>; Hemant et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2016b</xref>; Jeevitha et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2020</xref>; Jeevitha et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2021</xref>). Silica gel is the fastest-acting desiccant (Neave, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">1996</xref>). At all drying temperatures, silica gel embedded flowers minimized maximum moisture loss (Nair &amp; Singh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2011</xref>). Trinklein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR227">2000</xref>) noted that the flowers treated with silica gel dried quickly, allowing for the movement of more dried flowers in the same season. When embedding and drying chrysanthemum and dahlia flowers, Sell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">1993</xref>) found that a mixture of borax and corn flour (1:1 v/v) produced the best results. According to Smith (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">1993</xref>), borax is a good drying medium for carnations, roses, larkspur, asters, marigolds, geraniums, dahlias, delphiniums chrysanthemums, and zinnias. Sujatha et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR218">2001</xref>) showed that a 1:1 ratio of borax crystals and sand was the optimum combination for maintaining quality and color. Of the various desiccants used fine sand gave the best results in water lily flowers (Geetha et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2002</xref>). Datta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2001</xref>) also pointed out that fine sand responded best as embedding media due to easy handling, being heavy, and not reacting with water vapor. Moona (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2004</xref>) observed minimal changes in flower size with higher carotenoids in dried flowers when embedded in silica gel. Kumar and Jayanthi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2004</xref>) observed that silica gel as an embedding media had shown the highest score of texture and size in chrysanthemum. When zinnia flowers were dried in the sand, good quality dried flowers with magnificent bloom color and flawless petal texture were noticed (Singh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">2004</xref>). Silica gel is made up of a huge network of interconnected tiny pores that use physical adsorption and capillary condensation to attract and hold moisture. Mishra et al. (2009) dried zinnia flowers by embedding method using sand and silica with electric oven and microwave oven. Flower size and color remained unchanged in both media after dehydration but decreased flower weight due to water vapor from products. Swati et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">2017</xref>) embedded flowers of African Marigold cv. Pusha Orange in four embedding media, namely dust, fine sand + silica gel in the ratio of 2:1, river sand and borax + cornmeal in the ratio 1:1 and exposed to hot air at a temperature of 45 °C drying in the oven. Sand + silica gel (2:1) took the shortest time to complete drying, while the maximum reduction in flower size, the highest percentage of moisture loss from flowers obtained in the dust-embedded treatment. However, acceptable quality was seen by dust in terms of color retention, whereas river sand produced good texture and shape. Akram and Sharma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2021</xref>) took <italic>Cleretum bellidiforme</italic> and <italic>Calendula officinalis</italic> embedded by various desiccants at room temperature and in a hot-air oven at 55 °C. Embedding drying with silica was found to be the best for flower texture after dehydration. Kumar et al.

This is the fastest method of dehydration but has the drawback that the plant material tends to discolor. The efficiencies of hot air oven-dried flowers were higher in the covered condition when using silica gel at 60 °C for 24 h. In that way, flowers obtained from the microwave oven were embedded in silica gel for 90 s under covered conditions achieving maximum marks (Sankari &amp; Anand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">2014</xref>). An advantage of the hot air-drying method is that it does not affect the environment for dehydration. The process is quick, and the product quality is very good (Raval et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">2020</xref>). After a specific drying time of products, the containers are removed from the oven and maintained at room temperature for a certain amount of time to allow the moisture to escape and the plant material dries out completely. China aster flowers dried using white sand under an oven which remained the original color, texture, and shape of dehydrated products (Raju &amp; Jayanthi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2002</xref>).

Microwave oven drying is the best method for conserving antioxidant activity, total anthocyanin content, and total phenolic content in dried flowers, as it results in the least moisture loss, epicuticular wax, and percentage of leachates while producing the highest dry weight (Acharyya et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2017</xref>; Arunkumar &amp; Mangaiyarkarasi, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2019</xref>; Biswas &amp; Dhua, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2010</xref>; Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2015</xref>; Preethi et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2019</xref>; Safeena &amp; Patil, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">2013</xref>; Ullas et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR229">2018</xref>). It is a suitable method for the flowers like snapdragon, China aster, chrysanthemum. Microwave radiation has the unusual virtue of being preferentially absorbed by water, according to Dubois (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2005</xref>), making it an extremely effective energy source for the drying process. The maximum dry weight of flowers was recorded with quartz sand for 120 s in the microwave oven drying method (Nirmala et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2008</xref>). White et al.

Bhutani (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1990</xref>) discovered that using an electrical microwave oven to dry the planting material releases moisture by activating the water molecules present in the organic material. Before beginning the oven process, Rothenberger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2000</xref>) suggested putting a cup of water in it to prevent excessive drying. To avoid moisture absorption from the air, spray dried flower petals with hair spray or lacquer before placing them in the microwave oven.

All pretreatments showed no significant difference in the drying time of rosehips, but there was little taste change in roses when treated with 0.1% hibiscetin compared to other pretreatments.

Plants like <italic>Morina longifolia, Catharanthus sp., Digitalis purpurea, Iris orientalis, Humulus lupulus, Anthurium andrianum, Grevillea, Avena, Breeza sp., Cyperus alternifolius, Citrus limon, Codiaeum variegatum, Camellia japonica, Clematis, Crotalaria selloana,</italic> Dracaena<italic>, Eucalyptus sp., Hordeum jubatum, Hydrangea macrophylla, Ilex sp., Juniperus communis, Magnolia longiflora, and Populus sp</italic>. are suitable for glycerinization (Geetha et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2004</xref>). Harten (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2002</xref>) also reported that drying by glycerin is best suited for foliar preservation due to its osmotic nature, so leaves preserved in glycerin retain flexibility, shape, and texture. Among the drying techniques, glycerin drying is the least expensive of the drying processes and has a larger water-attracting capacity. Leaves protected by a 33% glycerol solution showed soft and flexible (Dana, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1983a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1983b</xref>). However, Dubois and Joyce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2005</xref>) reported that the effect of glycerinization depends on the type of leaf. To maintain the elasticity of the plant material, fresh and fairly mature foliage should be treated with hygroscopic chemicals. Glycerinizing chemicals are thought to be responsible for the moisture present in plants to maintain foliage shape, texture, and sometimes color. Brown et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2013</xref>) observed that glycerinization depends on leaf type and among the glycerinization techniques; the dip method is more suitable for short or dissected leaves such as ferns, while the uptake method is better for broadleaves such as magnolia. Texture retention under dip treatment may be due to the replacement of contain moisture present in the leaf with glycerin, which remains the shape and texture (Bale, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2006</xref>). The reduction in brittleness with glycerin can be attributed to the plasticizing and softening action of glycerin. Anon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>) also reported that glycerin-dehydrated substances are more flexible and have a natural shape. Drying the glycerin, the product quality was good because the flower moisture restores by a mixture containing glycerin and water (Paul &amp; Shylla, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2002</xref>). Glycerin is a proper source for microbes; hence, just a trace amount of antibiotics is required to protect microbes in dried samples. Paparozzi and McCallister (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">1988</xref>) reported that glycerized annual statice with microwave protection retained the flexibility of the flower without greasing. Healey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">1986</xref>) examined conserved timing for different types of foliage. Maximum conserved time (12 h) taken by <italic>Aspidistra spp</italic>. followed by <italic>Fatsia japonica</italic> (7–10 weeks), <italic>Mahonia spp</italic>. (3–6 weeks), <italic>Magnolia spp</italic>. (3–4 weeks) and a minimum conserved time (2 weeks) recorded with <italic>Eucalyptus spp</italic>. Semant et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">1993</xref>) discovered that one part glycerin and two parts hot water were the best combination for absorbing 26 twigs plant at room temperature. The substance can be kept in the solution until it is completely absorbed. The resulting leaves in glycerin drying were soft and flexible as reported by Dana, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1983a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1983b</xref>. Sell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">1993</xref>) preserved magnolia stems in glycerin: hot water (1:2 v/v). Mature leaves showed good results in this treatment, and the solution was easily transferred to the stems. The glycerinizing process modified the water content of the leaves and gave the plant material a strong and resilient nature (Anon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2004</xref>). Hydrangea, ivy, and magnolia are good materials for this strategy. Westland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR242">1995</xref>) observed that the preserving of leaves and berries in a solution of glycerin and hot water was prolonged. According to Prasad et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">1997</xref>), glycerin is the best source of microorganisms; hence, very small dose of antibiotic is required to protect the microbial contamination in dehydrated products. Deepthi and Santhosh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2008</xref>) stated that maiden hair fern, camellia, ivy, and leaves of eucalyptus are suitable for glycerin drying. Glycerinization is excellent for conserving small leafy tree branches where glycerin can penetrate the leaves and turn brown (Dana &amp; Lerner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2002</xref>). The typical time to dry during the summer season is 2–3 weeks, although best results can be attained when absorption is rapid. Jawaharlal et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2013</xref>) observed the best performance in glycerinized leaves of thuja (<italic>Thuja orientalis</italic>) and camellia (<italic>Camellia reticulata</italic>), silver oak (<italic>Grevillea robusta</italic>) with softer leaves and highest overall acceptability. Jhanji et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2018</xref>) glycerized with 20% under a well-ventilated dark room and yielded the best results in three leaf types as <italic>Asparagus cetaceus</italic> (asparagus), <italic>Nephrolepis exaltata</italic> (ferns) and <italic>Gravila robusta</italic> (silver oak). Singh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">2018</xref>) found the glycerin most effective for leaves such as asparagus, fern, cordyline, and silver oak. Yadav et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR249">2018</xref>) glycerized cut leaves of <italic>Peltophorum ferruginum</italic> by two methods of glycerin (uptake and full dip) with different concentrations of glycerin (10, 20, and 40%). Leaves treated with 40% glycerin solution by full dip method showed the minimum percentage of leachate with minimum change in leaf area and maximum scores on textural quality, shape retention, brittleness, and overall acceptance. Marak et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2016</xref>) used the glycerization approach to produce the greatest results for silver oak in the context of size as well as texture, fragile, and overall acceptability in 20% glycerin. Buxus leaves treated with the full-dip method of glycerin were better than the absorption approach (Yadav et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR249">2018</xref>), and among the concentrations of the glycerin solution, 40% was the best for drying the cut leaves. According to Karmakar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2020</xref>), the useful life of <italic>Nephrolepis exaltata</italic> may be prolonged by 40% glycerin when using the full-dip method.</p><sec id="Sec40"><title>Desiccant drying</title><p id="Par52">Some wild flowers such as blanket flower (<italic>Gaillardiax grandiflora</italic>), maximilian sunflower (<italic>Helianthus maximiliani</italic>), and black-eyed susan, desiccant are suitable for desiccant drying (Frogge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2000</xref>). Dana and Lerner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2002</xref>) found the most satisfactory results in two desiccants, namely silica gel and sand-borax combination. Other desiccants like perlite, sawdust, kitty litter, corn starch, and maize are also being used, but they are not as efficient. Westland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR241">1992</xref>) reported that the application of borax showed a slight discoloration of the color and a rough petal texture. Silica gel is suggested as the best media as compared to sand or borax for faster dehydration of flowers (Anon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1997</xref>) and also retains flower color (Champoux, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1999</xref>). When flowers are dried in silica gel, the color of the flowers resembles the original in white, yellow, lavender and blue (non-rose). Colors that are already dark, such as crimson, dark pink and orange grow considerably darker (Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2015</xref>; Dilta et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2011</xref>; Safeena, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">2005</xref>; Sankari &amp; Anand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">2014</xref>; Shailza et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">2018</xref>). Dried flowers acquire moisture from the air quickly, so put them in a sealed container containing silica gel to avoid this. With silica gel and sand, flower quality is preserved very well in terms of post-drying properties and lifespan (Malakar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2019</xref>). Evelyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">1997</xref>) employed fine grains like sand to drying of flowers. Fresh kitten litter can also be used to dry flowers (Barnett, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1996</xref>). According to Gupta and Prashant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2005</xref>), out of four embedding agents (river sand boric acid, sawdust, and silica gel), silica gel showed the most effective for removing moisture from leaves and flowers. After conventional air drying, many delicate flowers lose their structure irrevocably. The petals can be held in the desired form by placing the flower in fine-grained sand that has been entirely dried in the oven (Dubois, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2005</xref>). Cornmeal, borax, silica gel, and kitty litter are also be utilized and their desiccating activity draws water out of the air, allowing for speedier drying with the original color of products. According to Dhatt et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2007</xref>), silica gel showed the best embedding technique of dehydration for preserving color and shape in rose cvs. Kristen Dyer and Gold Medal, Carnations, marigolds, lilies, and dahlias are stored for extended times in a dry state for drying (Deepthi &amp; Santhosh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2008</xref>). Flowers with numerous petals such as zinnias, dahlias, and daisies are dried with silica gel. Drying of different types of roses using silica gel yielded good results (Safeena et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">2006b</xref>). Flowers that have been pre-treated with particular chemicals have also been proven to be appropriate for drying. Sindhuja et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">2016</xref> pretreated the flowers with magnesium chloride (10%) for 5 h. It is then dried by embedding in media containing silica gel + borax (1:1, v/v) followed by dehydration under a hot air oven at 55 ± 1 °C produced the best shape, texture, color, fragile and overall acceptability with total carotenoid pigment in the carnation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Sand drying</title><p id="Par53">Tulips, snapdragons, marigolds, roses, and dahlias are among the flowers that can be dried with sand drying (Anon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>). Daisy flowers can be dried with the petals facing down. Blooming branches in the sand should be planted horizontally with elongated snapdragons, lilacs, blossoms, and flowering branches. Sand can be used to dry small and hard flowers (Martha, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">1997</xref>). Flowers such as zinnias, marigolds, pansies, and pompon chrysanthemums do best in sand drying. Roses and cup-shaped flowers were dried upside-down, daisies were dried downward, and snapdragons and other elongated flowers were arranged horizontally in the sand (Anon, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2001</xref>).</p><p id="Par54">An application of two desiccants, such as borax, with a mixture of sand, when applied in a ratio of 1: 0.5 to 1:1 can change the color of the flowers. Sea sand with a smaller concentration of borax in flowers like roses, carnations, and gerberas dried well for 10–15 days. Flowers kept in a 1:1 combination of dry sand and borax have been shown to keep their natural shape with minimal shrinking and color retention. Flowers kept using a combination of sand and borax in the ratio of (2:1) took 10–12 days to become scaly and dry, but they are less rigid as compared to the flowers treated with the "hang and dry" method (Chakrabarty &amp; Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2021</xref>). In some cases, sand can cause small holes in the petals because of its rough edges (Pertuit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2002</xref>).

Although William Hyde Wollaston affiliated with the Royal Society in London in 1813 presented the technology which discover the attractiveness and lifespan of freeze-dried flowers. The freeze-drying technology of flowers is an advanced technology and completely new to India. The main merit of freeze-drying is that the products produced by freeze-dryers look almost like fresh ones (Nilsback &amp; Zisserman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2006</xref>). Freeze drying is the most effective way of flower preservation. Freeze drying is based on the sublimation concept, which involves holding ice at a low temperature (less than 0 °C) in a partial vacuum (less than 4.58 torr) and then evaporates by heating without passing through the liquid phase. The vacuum drying temperature is low resulting in a flower color similar to that of fresh flowers (Chen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2000</xref>).</p><p id="Par56">Wilkins and Desborough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">1986</xref>) investigated the efficacy of various pretreatments (Glycerine (G), clove oil (CO), ethylene glycol (EG), G + dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), CO + DMSO, and EG + DMSO when carnation flowers are kept at a cryo-drying temperature of – 80 °C for 12 h. Flowers that had not been treated retained their natural appearance, but flowers that had been treated had less aesthetic value. Brown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1999</xref>) observed drying in various cultivars of rose and carnation and discovered that the temperature and freezing time of flowers play an important role in maintaining the bloom quality of dehydrated flowers.

Microwave drying technology takes less time than other drying methods. The hues of the blossoms have a big impact on the fresh and dry weight of the carnation flower. Bassapa et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1991</xref>) observed that helichrysum flowers dried in a room retain their color intensity for a longer period in open sunlight than 40 °C and 50 °C oven-dried flowers. Venugopal and Patil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR233">2000</xref>) also noticed similar results when flowers of helichrysum were dehydrated at room temperature in the shade and then oven-dried at 50 °C for 150–180 days, retaining their original color intensity. Kumar and Jayanti (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2004</xref>) studied the efficacy of several drying processes for chrysanthemum (button type) flowers including oven drying, sun drying, and microwave drying. Microwave drying with silica gel produced excellent outcomes, whereas white sand with oven drying produced the greatest color and acceptability of flowers. Liu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2017</xref>) employed principal component analysis (PCA) and Flow-Injection Mass Spectrometric Fingerprinting (FIMS) to analyze the applicability of drying materials using two daylily flowers (Mengzhi and Chongli) with three drying technologies (solar dehydrator, vacuum freeze dehydrator and hot-air technique). The straightforward FIMS approach is capable of distinguishing between species (raw materials) and treatments within each species. After being processed in the hot air-drying method, two species could not be distinguished very effectively. Shisa Ullas et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">2018</xref>), Ullas et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR229">2018</xref>) employed different drying procedures to dry the ray florets of five anthocyanin-rich chrysanthemum (<italic>Chrysanthemum morifolium</italic> Ramat.) cultivars. A microwave oven was an excellent method for maintaining anthocyanin content in by-products, antioxidant activities and total phenolic content. The microwave oven drying method retained the highest total phenolic content with antioxidant activities and total anthocyanin pigment. Microwave dried ray floret-based antioxidant activity assays revealed a positive and substantial association between varieties. Barani et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2019</xref>) dried flowers with various concentrations, viz. 0.1%, 1% and 2% w/v) like as chemicals (citric acid, CA; ascorbic acid, AA; tartaric acid, TTA; and sucrose, Suc) after that fresh roses were dried at 50 °C in hot air. Flowers pretreated with 2% TTA resulted in the greatest amount of anthocyanin, the dry mass 
cyaniding 3-glucoside equivalent equated to a 3.2% loss in comparison with the fresh sample. Flowers color-treated with 2%-TTA were not so better as products generated by the treatment of 0.1% TTA, 0.1% Suc, and 1% Suc. As per the literatures, silica gel method of flower drying has been considered as the best method. However, solar drying is the cheapest method for flower drying and environment friendly in nature. Moreover, for the countries like India, it is quite suitable because of having a greater number of sunny days in one calendar year.</p></sec><sec id="Sec48"><title>Factors affected dried flower and foliage products</title><sec id="Sec49"><title>Pre drying treatment</title><p id="Par63">The speed with which dried flowers dehydrate determines their texture, size, and general desirability. Citric acid is a common flower preservative that can help improve the form and color of flowers. It functions as an acidifying agent, reducing the pH of the fluid and preventing xylem vessel obstructions. It also aids in the improvement of size, shape, and color.</p></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>Moisture content after drying</title><p id="Par64">The drying flower moisture content has an impact on their quality. Low moisture content in flowers provides hardiness, while high moisture content in dried flowers causes flowers to wither. Therefore, the percentage of moisture content should be determined before ensuring the drying of various flowers. Chen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2000</xref>) discovered that dried flowers with robust and rigid petals had low moisture content. The mechanical help furnished by using the media at some point of the drying manner ensures preserved flower form and moisture content less than 11.55%. Dried flowers containing moisture also affect the longevity of dried flowers. Pandey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2001</xref>) also reported a moisture content of 8–11.5% in dried flowers, which ensures the finest quality, strength and remains products quality for a longer time. The drying period of the flowers in excess resulted in the petals falling off during storage (Singh, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">2004</xref>). Less than 8% moisture content in dried flowers showed a shedding effect, which can be related to excess moisture loss in flowers. In addition, Wilkins and Desborough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">1986</xref>) found the amenability of flowers to breakage under vacuum-dried flowers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec51"><title>Packaging, storage, and care of dried plant products</title><p id="Par65">Packaging material plays a crucial role to maintain the quality of dried flowers. Therefore, display packaging of dried flower products is the major requirement in the current competitive market. The packaging material must be stable and firm to hold the dried flowers well without any damage during storage. A wide variety of materials are available in the market for the packing of dried flowers and leaves, including wood, bamboo, rigid and foam plastics, solid cardboard and corrugated fiberboard. Dehydrated flowers and foliage are arranged properly with covered with transparent glass as well as plastic sheets to protect products from wind, dust, and humidity. Flowers and leaves are stored in appropriate size cardboard boxes without any lining performed better in terms of color preservation than those stored in polythene covers. Cardboard boxes have seen more flower damage than polythene covers (Shital, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">2017</xref>). Acrylic is more suitable as compared to glass, plastic, and thermocol for glass table mounts and potpourri. This is owing to the material's transparency, which allows customers to appreciate the beauty of the dried flower arrangements inside the container while still being stronger than glass. Flowers that are kept open for storage show good self-life as compared to dried flowers that were kept in opaque containers. This may be due to the direct interaction of dried flowers with environmental factors (Radha Rani, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">2011</xref>). Bhupender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2012</xref>) pointed out that dried flower products are stored in dry cardboard boxes with silica gel pouches, which help to avoid moisture. Dried flower-based flower crafts require a polyethylene lining to protect them from pests and outside moisture. It should also be ensured that dry material should be dust-free and can be cleaned with a brush or dry cloth while plant parts such as cones, seed pods, berries, and large leaves are given a protective coating with varnish or shellac, which can improve their quality. In some cases, a dry part can be separated and fixed by applying transparent glue. Better results can be obtained when glue apply before drying (Sheela, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">2008</xref>). Smith and Laschkewitsch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR209">1992</xref>) opined that dried flowers should be stored in river sand with strong cartons to prevent the flower petals from breaking. Shirin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">2011</xref>) also reported that air-tight plastic containers for color, texture, and appearance upon storage performed better in dried flowers than in polythene covers dried flowers. Safeena et al., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">2006b</xref>) observed maximum moisture loss when the half-open flower is dried by silica gel-based embedding for 49 h under a hot air oven with a temperature at 40 °C. Misra et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2009</xref>) dried zinnia flowers and preserved them in glass plastic or acrylic containers by keeping a small amount of silica gel on the bottom of the container which preserves color and shapes for a longer period making it more durable and moisture resistant. Datta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1999</xref>) advocated that dried flowers should be kept in moisture barrier containers like moisture-resistant receptacles such as glass vials, acrylic boxes, and cardboard boxes coated with plastic film or wax paper. Because dried flowers are highly hygroscopic, they absorb atmospheric humidity and do not maintain their shape. He also suggests that the containers should be free from dust and protected from direct sunlight to retain their color. Shirin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">2011</xref>) recommended flower storage for color retention, texture, and size as compared to airtight plastic containers kept in polythene covers. Plomaritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2004</xref>) dried flowers stored in flakes with some naphthalene flakes to protect against the growth of pests and molds. Dried flowers should be sealed in containers such as airtight tins or plastic boxes, adhesive tape or airtight boxes and plastic bags for extended use. Trinklein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228">2006</xref>) recommended various control measures against domestic insects that enter boxes during storage. It is suggested to occasionally check the box for insects and use naphthalene flakes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec52"><title>Special operations used for drying of flowers</title><sec id="Sec53"><title>Processing</title><p id="Par66">In this method, the internal moisture of the flowers is replaced with 2-propyl alcohol or t-butyl alcohol (Romero-Sierra &amp; Webb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">1982</xref>), where these solvents destabilize the moisture from the flowers, so that flower size is lost. As a result, an epoxy resin replacement procedure using an ascending chain of acetone (Von Hagens, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">1981</xref>) has been created, resulting in full tissue discoloration. The colors precipitate out of the petals during drying because of the availability of water in the solvent in this process, which uses an ascending chain of ethyl alcohol. Markham et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2000</xref>) used a moisture replacement procedure without using water-based solvents and found that the pigment diffused but stayed in dried flower petals. Dehydrated flowers with natural hues and textures can be created by utilizing simple mono-hydroxy alcohols and lateral chain diols according to Ito et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2010</xref>. They devised a technique in which the primary and secondary soaking solvents like ethyl alcohol and polypropylene glycol were used, respectively. Petal shrinking is prevented by using a primary soaking solvent with low viscosity, such as ethyl alcohol. Petal depletion generated by secondary soaking solvents (polypropylene glycol) was considerably reduced after petals were first soaked in several primary soaking solvents such as ethyl alcohol.

In the flowering plant materials that are sold in the market, bleaching is very significant. Bleaching is used to eliminate all or almost all of the colors that develop during the dehydration phase of the preservation process. There are two types of bleaching: oxidative and reductive, but the level of efficiency is determined by the measurement of the bleach's access to lignin. Sodium chloride, hypochlorite and peroxide are examples of oxidative bleaches, while sodium sulphide, hydrosulfite and dioxide are examples of reductive bleaches. According to Lourdusamy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">1998</xref>, sodium chlorite (10%) performed better than hydrogen peroxide (30%) as a bleaching agent for flowers like gomphrena. Bleached ornamental plant material shows contrasting attractiveness when kept with dried or dyed ornamental plants. Bleaching also makes it possible to utilize dyes for coloring. Because it is relatively selective for lignin and causes minimal harm to the fiber, sodium chlorite is an effective bleaching agent. Hydrosulfites (sodium or zinc hydrosulfite) are less expensive than other bleaching chemicals. Many workers advocated the superiority of hydrogen peroxide because peroxides are responsible for degrading of cellulose, as well as discolor of products and stain removal is less expensive (Dubois &amp; Joyce, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2005</xref>; Zeronian &amp; Inglesby, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR251">1995</xref>) and also found to be the best bleaching agent (Lourdusamy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">1998</xref>). The main concern after bleaching with oxidative or reductive chemicals is plant material yellowing. To avoid yellowing, an alternative with multistep bleaching such as reductive bleach should be done. A final wash with a 2% solution such as calcium hydroxide, aluminum sulfate, barium hydroxide, and sodium bicarbonate can prevent yellowing. Because of its selective action, sodium chlorite is commonly used to bleach for plant foliage (Masschelein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">1979</xref>). Even after longer contact, this bleach eliminated the full color from cellulose-based materials while causing no harm to the cellulose. Mazamder et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">1994</xref>) investigated the efficiency of para-acetic acid-like as jute fabric bleaching agent and found it better than peroxide bleaching with non-silicate stabilizers. Dana and Lerner, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2002</xref>) &amp; White et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">2002</xref>) discovered that boiling leaves in a solution of 1 tsp. lye or baking soda per quart of water for 40 min has a skeletal impact. Jawaharlal et al.

The dyeing consistency was light fastness, wash fastness and rubbing fastness with acrylic dyes. Mir and Jana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2015</xref>) found that a mixture of 20% hydrogen peroxide and 15% “Ala” can be used to bleach venation skeletons for up to 2 h. Preethi et al.

According to an estimate, 20–30% energy consumption will also increase across the world in coming decades (Singh &amp; Tirkey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">2022a</xref>). Currently, most of the energy demand is being full filled by low-quality coal reservoirs (Raj et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2022</xref>).

For example, several researchers from around the world have found some correlation between waste management and environmental sustainability in the form of municipal solid waste management of Nigeria (Okwesili &amp; Iroko, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2016</xref>), the economical and environmental importance of waste management (Rigamonti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">2016</xref>; Sahar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">2019</xref>), improving environmental sustainability in developing countries through improvements in waste management (Vaccari et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR231">2012</xref>) and various construction companies (Kurdve et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2015</xref>). Therefore, in the future, such practices should be encouraged in society as well as at the governance level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec64"><title>Future perspectives</title><p id="Par78">The future of the dried flower trade is predicted to contribute lots to the country's economic system versus in fresh flowers and other foliage plants. The demand for dried plants and flower crafts is increasing continuously within the local and global markets. The dried flower-based retail has grown rapidly as customers decide to prefer the biodegradable alternative of flowers. Presently, with annual exports of nearly Rs 500 crore, India is the world's top supplier of dried plant parts (Chakrabarty &amp; Datta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2021</xref>). There is huge potential in India for the establishment of the dried flower sector. Dried flower industries can generate employment apart from self-employment as the industry needs a lot of people to do the work. Therefore, innovative training programs and awareness campaigns should be started for rural unemployed by government agencies to promote the export of dried flowers. As per the data given in Horticulture Statistics in 2018, the total number of flower growers in India is 897,077, out of which 799,709 were marginal flower growers (0.5–1 ha) and 58,196 were small flower growers (1–2 ha) in shape. Therefore, flower growers' relief is critically needed for marginalized flower growers, who are particularly vulnerable to financial risk. Bulgari et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2021</xref>) suggested the increase online home delivery of flowers, which may be helpful to flower producers to greater income. The distribution chain should be improved by optimized transportation to minimize the loss of quality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec65" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par79">India has a rich source of flower cultivation because of its diverse geographical locations and weather conditions. Large volumes of the various types of flowers are destroyed every year because of wastage, mishandling, extreme weather conditions, etc. Flowers are very perishable, and any delay in their supply in the market may convert them into wastes. However, &gt; 80% of such types of can be valued through the process of dehydration. These flowers can be used to develop value-added products by employing drying technologies. Moreover, heavy infrastructure is also not required for the operation of such types of technologies. These techniques are very simple and can be handled by unskilled persons, and also promotion of self-employment especially for the women is also possible in rural areas. Hence, flower drying techniques can be a better alternative to procure the value-added products. Further, dried flower may have long-lasting lives, which can be used later as per the requirements. Such types of initiatives are very useful in COVID-19 like pandemic situations. Dried flowers can also be used as flower vases or bouquet decorations, making floral handicrafts, floral based greetings, wedding cards, segments, wall hangings, attractive calendars, colorful candles, picture frames, flower ornaments, mirror ornaments, glass jar arrangement, etc. Some developers and exporters in India are already earning ~ 10–15 times higher income from the local as well as world trade by exporting such types of the dried flower products. Therefore, dehydration techniques of flowers can help in raising the economic condition of many residents of the rural areas like farmers, along with their traders.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par80">The authors declare no competing interests.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Acharyya</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Biswas</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Saha</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Chakraborty</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Studies on methods of dehydration of rose Buds ‘Gold Medal’ and ‘Minu Parle’</article-title><source>Acta Horticulture</source><year>2013</year><volume>970</volume><fpage>293</fpage><lpage>298</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.17660/ActaHortic.2013.970.36</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Acharyya</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Majumder</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Malakar</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Biswas</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Standardization of dehydration techniques of some selected flowers</article-title><source>Acta Horticulture</source><year>2017</year><volume>1181</volume><fpage>85</fpage><lpage>92</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.17660/ActaHortic.2017.1181.11</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adnan</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Nordin</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">How COVID 19 effect Malaysian paddy industry?
