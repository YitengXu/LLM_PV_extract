However, the performance of AEM electrolysis is still lower than what can be achieved with conventional technologies. The performance of AEM electrolysis is limited by integral components of the membrane electrode assembly and the reaction kinetics, which can be measured by ohmic and charge transfer resistances. We here investigate and then quantify the contributions of the ohmic and charge transfer resistances, and the rate-determining steps, involved in AEM electrolysis by using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis. The factors that have an effect on the performance, such as voltage, flow rate, temperature and concentration, were studied at 1.5 and 1.9 V. Increased voltage, flow rate, temperature and concentration of the electrolyte strongly enhanced the anodic activity. We observed that here the anodic reaction offered a greater contribution to the overpotential than the cathode did.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Research Foundation</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001321</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">2019H1D3A2A02102994</award-id><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">2019R1I1A3A0305044112</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vincent</surname><given-names>Immanuel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Hyung-Man</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>293</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>28</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2020_Article_80683.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Electricity production by renewable sources such as solar, wind and tidal hydraulics now offers the most promising solutions to our current energy demands, taking a clean environment into consideration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

This then leads to an interrupted supply of the renewable energy, hence renewable energy must be stored and then used on demand for specific applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.

To further advance in this field, it is mandatory to gather more information on the factors that may limit the performance of AEM electrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Accordingly, further consideration/evaluation of various factors are required, e.g., the OER and HER reaction mechanisms, and resistances offered by each of the integral parts/components of the MEA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

When a voltage is applied between the anode and cathode, the electrons flow through an external circuit, balanced by OH<sup>–</sup> ion transfer through the AEM, thus the electrolysis takes place<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Upon the application of higher voltage, the electrons try to flow through the external circuit and the OH<sup>–</sup> ions attempt to cross the AEM. However, due to internal barriers, the electrons and OH<sup>–</sup> ions are not able to transfer at lower voltages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Hence, there is a decrease in hydrogen production due to the voltage drop—this is referred to as the activation overpotential or charge transfer resistance (R<sub>CT</sub>). However, if the applied voltage is relatively low, the flow of electrons is limited by the internal components, such as the AEM, the catalyst layer and the gas diffusion electrode (GDL)—this is referred to as the ohmic resistance (R<sub>ohm</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">Thus, the performance of an AEM electrolyser depends on three factors: ohmic resistance, kinetic resistance and mass transfer resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. These are sources of overall polarization losses, and they can be separated, and quantified, by the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization technique. The EIS technique has therefore been widely applied in various electrochemical processes, such as in batteries and fuel cells, and in PEM electrolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">AEM electrolysis technology, being a recent and still developing technology, has been little investigated using EIS.

To better understand the activity of the catalyst layer itself on the GDL, experiments were carried out at close to the thermoneutral voltage of electrolysis (1.48 V). The lower voltage EIS experiments were carried out at the following voltages: 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 V. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a shows the Nyquist plots of EIS measurements at these low voltages. The high frequency is plotted towards the left side of the plane and the lower frequency towards the right side. Here, a perfect semicircle was obtained, the height and the diameter of which decreased with increasing applied voltage. The decrease in diameter indicates a decrease in the charge transfer resistance. The migration of the ions and electrons is responsible for the transfer of charge at the electrode–membrane interface. Hence, when the applied voltage is increased from 1.5 to 1.7, more ions and electrons pass through the electrode and membrane, hence increasing the rate of reaction, which is directly proportional to the applied voltage. At the lower frequency, there is a small inverted semicircle after the large semicircle. The observation of an inverted semicircle, or low-frequency inductive loops, is attributed to nonstationary behavior. The inductive loops that are observed are due to changes in certain (experimental) factors, such as liquid electrolyte concentration, membrane thickness, hydrogen pressure, and the OER/HER kinetics. There are two possible reasons for the observation of low-frequency inductive loops in the impedance responses:<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> (1) relaxation of adsorbed intermediates species associated with cathodic reactions and the formation of hydrogen peroxide, and (2) formation of NiO with subsequent dissolution of Ni from cathode catalyst layer.
