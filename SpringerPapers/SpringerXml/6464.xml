Similar figures have been estimated for marine organisms. This flux is about ten-times higher than that emitted by anthropogenic release of CO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Thus, an increase in the biological carbon fixation by even a few percent would greatly influence the carbon balance on earth. Cyanobacteria utilize solar energy to split water and produce NADPH and ATP via photosystems and the electron transport chain to support carbon fixation via the CBB cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The CBB cycle accounts for the vast majority of carbon fixation on earth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, in which RuBisCO is the major enzyme catalyzing conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) to two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (3PG). Subsequent steps require ATP and NADPH to reduce 3PG to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), which can be metabolized to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) as precursors for glycogen synthesis or to regenerate RuBP to continue the CBB cycle (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The regulation of CBB cycle involves multiple factors and mechanisms, including light, redox potential and circadian regulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. As a marine organism, cyanobacteria frequently experience underwater light fluctuation and encounter environmental stress. The cell has to shut down CO<sub>2</sub> fixation rapidly in low-ATP conditions to avoid futile cycling resulting from simultaneous CO<sub>2</sub> fixation and respiration. Although all ATP-dependent reactions proceed slower at low ATP levels, it is desirable to stop the CBB cycle preferentially and immediately to prevent non-productive resource draining; however, such a mechanism has not been discovered. On the other hand, if this mechanism can be exploited, carbon fixation in cyanobacteria could be increased.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Effects of ATP on the activity of <italic>Se</italic>XPK.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Proposed roles of <italic>Se</italic>XPK in response to ATP levels.

It converts F6P, xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu5P) or sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P), which are intermediates in RuBP regeneration, to produce acetyl phosphate (AcP) and C3, C4 or C5 sugar phosphates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). XPK is also a key enzyme in the synthetic non-oxidative glycolysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and has been exploited for engineering metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>; however, its physiological role in cyanobacteria is not fully understood. A previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> suggested that XPK in the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. is responsible for utilization of xylose or glucose under heterotrophic conditions. We have shown<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> that the cyanobacterium <italic>Synechococcus</italic> <italic>elongatus</italic> PCC7942 XPK (<italic>Se</italic>XPK) is inhibited by ATP and participates in ATP production through the XPK–acetate kinase (ACK) pathway for long-term survival under anaerobic, dark and osmotic stress conditions.

The role of XPK in carbon metabolisms and its ATP inhibitory mechanism are still puzzling in cyanobacteria under phototrophic growth conditions. In the CBB pathway, allosteric AMP inhibition of fructose-1,6/sedohaptulose-1.7-bisphosphatase has been reported in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> 6803 (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>). In glycolysis, pyruvate kinase (Pyk) from <italic>Synechococcus</italic> PCC 6301 is inhibited by ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Moreover, a CO<sub>2</sub> fixing enzyme PEP carboxylase (PEPC) in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> is regulated by Pll sensor-transducer, which is allosterically modulated by adenyl nucleotides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In the absence of Pll, PEPC is inhibited by ATP. The above studies elucidated the importance of allosteric enzyme regulations by adenyl nucleotides in metabolic pathways.</p><p id="Par5">Considering that <italic>Se</italic>XPK is inhibited by ATP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, we propose that XPK may play a heretofore unrecognized role in dynamic metabolic regulation by diverting the RuBisCO substrate precursors away from the CBB cycle when ATP is low (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) to avoid futile cycling. If so, its function would be most pronounced under low-ATP conditions, such as during light fluctuations, and the molecular mechanism of ATP sensing by XPK would provide a useful insight. Furthermore, if XPK serves as a metabolic ‘brake’ for the CBB cycle, it could be deleted or inhibited to increase CO<sub>2</sub> fixation, thereby increasing the net carbon draw down by cyanobacteria and even producing useful compounds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title><italic>Se</italic>XPK functions as a CBB brake upon ATP drop</title><p id="Par6">We first performed steady-state kinetic analysis, which suggested that <italic>Se</italic>XPK is inhibited in vitro by ATP through an allosteric mode (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b,c</xref>), similar to <italic>Cryptococcus</italic> <italic>neoformans</italic> XPK reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

Cyanobacterial XPK, however, evolved to acquire a unique mechanism to bind to ATP at the interface between two subunits through its N-terminal residues. The binding leads to a conformational change of active site residues to inhibit its activity. With this ATP-sensing activity, <italic>Se</italic>XPK stops carbon fixation when ATP levels are low, by diverting CBB cycle intermediates to AcP, which may proceed to produce acetate and ATP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="Fig18">10</xref>). Typically, low ATP levels occur at the transition between L/D periods. Alternatively, during high-frequency light fluctuation caused by self-shading or ocean vertical currents, ATP levels could also drop. Under these conditions, if both CBB cycle and respiration are functional, the simultaneous operation of both leads to a futile cycle with a net effect of draining ATP. <italic>Se</italic>XPK evolved to avoid this wasteful activity and represents a distinct mechanism to control carbon fixation through CBB. Thus, <italic>Se</italic>XPK facilitates cell survival under high-frequency light fluctuations.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>XPK serves as a CBB cycle brake under low ATP conditions.</title><p>Under normal ATP conditions (&gt;1 mM), which occur at sufficient light or during dark periods when respiration is fully functional and CBB stops due to the lack of reducing power, XPK is inhibited and serves no function; however, during sudden environmental changes (for example self-shading and high-frequency light fluctuation), the ATP level drops and XPK is relieved from inhibition.

Thus, deletion of <italic>Se</italic>XPK does not affect growth; however, in a high-cell-density culture with self-shading, deletion of <italic>Se</italic>XPK increased net carbon fixation, due to the lack of the CBB cycle brake. Notably, the increased carbon fixation flux primarily results in sucrose secretion. Thus, <italic>Se</italic>XPK interrupts carbon fixation and prevents sucrose excretion in response to low ATP; however, the link between <italic>Se</italic>XPK deletion and sucrose secretion remains unclear.</p><p id="Par29">Unlike introducing synthetic pathways or overexpressing CBB pathway genes that increase carbon fixation, deletion of XPK achieves these goals without additional gene modifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>.

The deletion of <italic>Se</italic>XPK can be combined with other metabolic engineering strategies to increase the production of sucrose or other products. Another example has been discovered in <italic>Synechocystis</italic><italic>Δeda</italic> mutant whose 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate-6-phosphate (KDPG) aldolase is lacked in the Entner–Doudoroff (ED) pathway. KDPG cannot be converted to pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate but enhances CBB flux and glycogen formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Sucrose production in cyanobacteria is used as osmoprotective compound to balance the osmotic potential between cell interior and exterior<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Previously, by adding salt to a sucrose-secreting strain expressing <italic>cscB</italic>, a heterologous sucrose/proton symporter, in <italic>S.</italic> <italic>elongatus</italic> PCC7942, sucrose production was dramatically increased up to 0.9 g l<sup>−1</sup> a day<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.

The <italic>xpk</italic> deletion enables sucrose synthesis, probably due to its increase in the substrate levels for SPS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="Fig10">2</xref>). G1P is the precursor for UDP/ADP glucose formation, then SPS converts UDP/ADP glucose and F6P to sucrose phosphate. Subsequently, sucrose is formed via sucrose phosphate phosphatase. Of note, the <italic>Δxpk</italic> strain synthesized more sucrose but accumulated less glycogen in <italic>Δxpk</italic> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="Fig10">2c</xref>). Unlike sucrose synthesis, which can proceed with UTP, glycogen synthesis requires ATP to form the glucan chain. In the WT strain, XPK functions as a CBB brake under low ATP levels. When ATP is again available, carbon fixation resumes immediately. In the <italic>Δxpk</italic> strain, carbon fixation via CBB continues even under low ATP levels and produces excess hexophosphates, which are then converted to sucrose and secreted. As CBB continues in the <italic>Δxpk</italic> strain, glycogen breaks down to G1P, followed by phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI) and ED pathway to replenish CBB intermediates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. This may explain the lower glycogen amount in the <italic>Δxpk</italic> strain (Extended Data Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="Fig10">2c</xref>). While glycogen and sucrose can both store energy in the cell, storage of sucrose increases osmotic stress. As a result, sucrose is secreted from the <italic>Δxpk</italic> strain. Hence, the role of XPK is to prevent two wasteful processes under low ATP conditions: futile cycling between carbon fixation and respiration and sucrose secretion.</p><p id="Par30">The secretion of sucrose by <italic>Δxpk</italic> in the dark without osmotic stress broadens the conditions from our previous results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.

As the CBB cycle shares many steps with the RuMP cycle in methylotrophs, it is conceivable that the same ATP-sensing mechanism is used to control methane and methanol assimilation in these organisms (Extended Data Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="Fig9">1h,i</xref>).

The amount of lactic acid was detected by the diode array detector at UV wavelength 210 nm. For intracellular sucrose and glucose measurements, the sample extracts were quantified by monitoring the NADH production using a colorimetric method. The concentrations of the standard NADH samples were prepared from 0.125 mM to 1 mM. The extracts containing sucrose and glucose were digested to glucose and fructose by mixing with 200 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, containing 6 U invertase (from baker’s yeast, Sigma-Aldrich), at 55 °C for 1 h. The cell pellet for glycogen measurement was mixed with 200 μl KOH 30% (v/v) then boiled for 30 min. Acetic acid was added to the sample for adjusting the pH to 7 at room temperature. The sample was then mixed with the enzymatic digesting reagent, containing 50 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.8, 6 U ml<sup>−1</sup> amyloglucosidase and 50 U ml<sup>−1</sup> α-amylase. The reactions were held at 37 °C for 2 h to catalyze glycogen to glucose and then stopped by heating to 99 °C for 10 min.

We repeated the experiments to assess the carbon incorporation rates, carbohydrate productions and enzymatic kinetics three times and to evaluate the growth phenotype twice. Similar results between different experimental repeats were obtained. For cryo-EM experiments, thousands of micrographs were collected for the individual dataset.

Comparison between the free and bound structures here and in the main text provides detailed information on the effect of ATP binding, for all 8 residues in the conserved motif P702, W703, H706, Y’710, R’711, H719, R721, R753 as well as the key helices α24 and α19. Since the main text focuses more on the interaction with α24, here we provide detailed explanation for the interaction with α24, which also involves dynamic features of W703 (density maps in Extended Data Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="Fig13">5b</xref>). P702 resides at a turn connecting the helix α24 and the loop where W703 and Y701 respectively reside. Therefore, it provides certain degree of flexibility to the local region. In the free XPK, the W703 from one subunit can reside at two positions, swinging upwards and downwards, but alternates with the other W703. When the W703 side chain swings upwards, it partially occupies the ATP binging space. In the AMPPNP-bound structure, both W703 residues swing downwards and show subtle side chain movement (side-to-side), which is stabilized by the cation-pi interaction with K707 and an H-bond between C=O of Y701 and NH of W703. Such interaction is also likely facilitated by P702. The three residues form a beta-turn like configuration to keep W703 side chain pointing downwards and interact with D551 or N555 from helix α19. In addition, the dynamic feature of W703, assisted by its neighboring residue P702, could function as a regulatory switch in response to ATP binding.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42255_2023_831_Fig15_ESM.jpg" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></p><p id="Par66"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="Fig16" xlink:title="Extended data"><label>Extended Data Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Structure-based PDB searches.</title><p><bold>a</bold>.
