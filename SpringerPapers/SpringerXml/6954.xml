Local plants next to farmers can reduce environmental impacts, as well as reduce storage, shortage risks, and price volatility of fertilisers. Since local NH<sub>3</sub> production is not cost-effective, we analyse how internalisation of environmental impacts into economic analyses could help to promote novel technologies for NH<sub>3</sub> synthesis when supplied with renewable energy.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Mini-HB plants working at high pressure and temperature, as well as novel alternatives based on plasma reactors working at ambient conditions and using electricity from renewable sources, have been recently proposed for decentralised NH<sub>3</sub> production. To evaluate the environmental performances of these alternative and traditional NH<sub>3</sub> pathways, a life cycle assessment was performed to quantify the reduced emissions in each production process and the impacts of by-product utilisation, such as steam, oxygen, or carbon black. Different scales of storage and transportation, fuelled by traditional energy sources, were modelled to quantify the impacts of the simplified NH<sub>3</sub> supply chains. A review of monetary valuation coefficients was performed to internalise the life cycle environmental impacts into the techno-economic analyses of NH<sub>3</sub> production in Australia.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par3">Most of the estimated environmental costs were due to the carbon emissions of conventional plants and thermal plasma plants because of the use of fossil-based electricity. However, the high external costs associated with the photochemical oxidant formation and particulate matter affected the thermal plasma and non-thermal plasma (NTP) plants, costing in total 9,500 and 4,200 $/t NH<sub>3,</sub> respectively, due to the impacts of solar panels manufacturing. In contrast, electrolyser-HB plants obtained rates of 114 $/t NH<sub>3</sub> because of the high energy efficiency and oxygen sales. In the future scenario for NTP-based plants, this alternative could also be competitive with rates of 222 $/t NH<sub>3</sub>. Additionally, the estimated total external costs for the conventional NH<sub>3</sub> industry in Australia amounted to about US$5 billion per year.</p></sec><sec id="ASec4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Electrolyser-HB plants could be cost-effective in the short term due to the energy efficiency of HB processes. However, the HB process has reached its efficiency limits, while the NTP process still has room for improvement, as well as its production costs are lower at smaller scales. In addition, if monetised environmental costs are analysed for a whole industry, public administrations could be prompted to invest the expected savings in the promotion of these novel technologies.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Plasma</kwd><kwd>LCA</kwd><kwd>Fertilisers</kwd><kwd>Ammonia</kwd><kwd>External costs</kwd><kwd>Supply chain</kwd><kwd>Local production</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Research Council</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">810182</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hessel</surname><given-names>Volker</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>19</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/11367_2023_Article_2187.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Economics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Engineering/Biotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Chemistry</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Earth and Environmental Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Supplementary Information</title><p>The online version contains supplementary material available at <ext-link xlink:href="10.1007/s11367-023-02187-5" ext-link-type="doi">https://doi.org/10.1007/s11367-023-02187-5</ext-link>.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par42">Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) is an indispensable fertiliser feedstock to sustain global food production. Over 90% of NH<sub>3</sub> is produced from hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) and nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) through the Haber–Bosch (HB) process (Fúnez-Guerra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>)), mainly using natural gas (NG) via the steam methane reforming (SMR) process (Parkinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2018</xref>). This energy-intensive process has a carbon footprint of about 1.6 t CO<sub>2</sub>/t NH<sub>3</sub>, contributing to 1.8% of global carbon emissions (The Royal Society <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par43">Dependency on energy feedstock has led to the concentration of NH<sub>3</sub> production in a few countries where non-expensive NG is available, such as Trinidad and Tobago, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States, or in countries with abundant coal reserves, such as China (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2021</xref>; Indexbox <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2023</xref>). This centralisation of NH<sub>3</sub> production increases the carbon footprint of fertilisers when exported to different continents. Moreover, the volatility of NG prices has revealed the unsustainability of conventional fertilisers production. The rise in NG prices by the end of 2021 increased the cost of each NH<sub>3</sub> tonne in Europe from US$ 300 up to US$ 810 (Durisin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2021</xref>). The recent trade disruptions related to the pandemic lockdowns have also increased international shipping costs and time. Additionally, the NH<sub>3</sub> offer curtailment due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict has escalated NH<sub>3</sub> prices in March 2022 reaching peaks of US$ 1,625 in Tampa (Agroberichten Buitenland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2022</xref>). Food security in countries with a high dependency on imported fertilisers has been affected to a greater extent. For example, in Peru, 68.5%, 97.4%, and 50.9% of NH<sub>3</sub>-derived fertilisers such as urea, ammonium nitrate, and ammonium sulphate, were imported from Russia in 2021, respectively (Government of Peru <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2022</xref>). These factors have generated a local shortage of fertilisers and tripled their prices, triggering protests of farmers and inflation because fertilisers usually share about 27% of the total production costs of basic food products such as rice (Agencia Agraria de Noticias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2022</xref>; Adepia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2022</xref>). Furthermore, challenges encountered in inland transportation significantly increase the cost of fertilisers for end-users, particularly in landlocked countries and regions with rough topography and limited rail transport. In these areas, the distribution of fertilisers heavily relies on expensive road transport, especially in South America and Sub-Saharan Africa (Roberts and Vilakazi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2014</xref>; Vilakazi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2018</xref>; IFDC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>; Takele and Tolcha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2021</xref>). Similarly, countries with geographically dispersed agricultural areas away from cities and ports, such as Australia, encounter high costs for inland distribution of fertilisers due to the limited railway network connections near end-users (Tran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par44">These drawbacks have made us aware of the need to move towards an economic model based on a resilient and self-sufficient decentralised production. Small-scale NH<sub>3</sub> distributed plants next to farmers, besides mitigating the global supply chain issues, can create additional benefits such as local employment, the utilization of local resources, technological and knowledge transfer, crop intensification by a tailored fertiliser production, and environmental benefits due to the use of cleaner energy sources.</p><p id="Par45">Different plant configurations have been proposed to produce cleaner NH<sub>3</sub> than the conventional NG-based plants which produce “grey NH<sub>3</sub>”, such as the “turquoise NH<sub>3</sub>” plants that also use NG but through high-temperature plasma (HTP) pyrolysis for the H<sub>2</sub> production which does not release CO<sub>2</sub> (Long et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2021</xref>; Sarafraz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2021</xref>; Osorio-Tejada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2022c</xref>), or “green NH<sub>3</sub>” plants that use electricity from renewable sources to produce H<sub>2</sub> through water electrolysis to be used in all-electric HB (eHB) plants (Morgan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2013</xref>; Fasihi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2021</xref>) or in novel non-thermal plasma (NTP) reactors (Anastasopoulou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020b</xref>; Osorio-Tejada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2022b</xref>). NTP systems have been recently proposed as promissory alternative because they can be turned off and on quickly due to low thermal inertia (Snoeckx and Bogaerts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2017</xref>), in contrast to the HB systems, which ideally run continuously, that is, they take many hours to reach a steady state process (Muelaner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2020</xref>), which does not interface with the intermittency of renewable energies.</p><p id="Par46">The feasibility of these emerging technologies can be promoted by the internalisation of the environmental benefits. Fasihi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2021</xref>) analysed NH<sub>3</sub> production costs at factory gate of electrolyser-eHB plants in different locations supplied by photovoltaic and wind electricity. They concluded that these plants would be cost-effective by 2040 if a carbon tax of 75 €/t CO<sub>2</sub> were charged. However, they assumed that renewable-based electricity was zero emissions, omitting the life cycle emissions of these resources and other environmental impacts. In a recent study (Osorio-Tejada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2022b</xref>), we performed life cycle assessments (LCA) for conventional and alternative NH<sub>3</sub> production pathways considering relevant environmental impact categories in chemicals production (Maranghi and Brondi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2020</xref>; Osorio-Tejada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2022a</xref>), concluding that the electrolyser-HB plants fed with solar energy can generate only 0.12 t CO<sub>2</sub>/t NH<sub>3,</sub> in comparison to 2.10 t CO<sub>2</sub>/t NH<sub>3</sub> of conventional plants, in a cradle-to-site (farm) assessment. These alternatives for distributed production also reduced ozone formation impacts caused by NOx emitted by diesel trucks, as well as reduced water eutrophication impacts caused by the fossil-based electricity from the national grid, especially from the hard coal and lignite power plants. However, these small-scale plants for distributed NH<sub>3</sub> production cannot reach the economics of the large-scale centralised NH<sub>3</sub> plants, costing around three times higher than the average (Tran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021</xref>). For this reason, despite the benefits of local production, alternative plants have not been widely deployed. Even if taxes on carbon emission are imposed, alternative plants would not be competitive during periods of low NG prices.</p><p id="Par47">In that regard, to enhance the competitiveness of cleaner production processes, there have been proposals to internalize emissions other than CO<sub>2</sub> through various methods aimed at monetising environmental impacts based on LCA impact categories. Monetisation represents the weight of an impact category in monetary value based on the costs of preventing or repairing damages, as well as how much society is willing to pay to prevent these impacts (Durão et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2019</xref>). However, hitherto there is no consensus in the scientific community on the most suitable monetisation method (Thi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2016</xref>; Canaj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021</xref>). This is because of the high uncertainty in estimating monetary valuation coefficients (MVC) due to diverse factors involved, including: <italic>(i)</italic> the monetisation approach, which can be based on abatement costs, budget constraints, damage costs or societal willingness-to-pay (Pizzol et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2015</xref>; Arendt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>); <italic>(ii)</italic> the geography, as methods developed in Europe might not be applicable to other continents due to different market prices and budget constraints, resulting in very different MVC (Amadei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>); and <italic>(iii)</italic> the followed life cycle impacts assessment method, which can be based on a few impact categories (Davidson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>; Ahlroth and Finnveden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>; European Commission et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2019</xref>), or several impact categories, such as the 16 categories of the Product Environmental Footprint method (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>) utilised in (European Commission et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020</xref>; Amadei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>), or the 18 categories of the ReCiPe 2008 (Goedkoop et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>) and 2016 (Huijbregts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017</xref>) methods utilised in (de Bruyn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>) and (Ponsioen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par48">In a recent review on monetisation methods in LCA, Amadei et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>) analysed 18 methods that presented MVC for diverse impact categories. Many of these methods considered different lists of impact categories and some had similar impact categories but with different units (e.g., ionizing radiation can be expressed in either kg U-235 eq. or kg Co-60 eq.), making them incomparable. Only six impact categories were common across diverse methods by using the same units and monetisation approach (e.g., damage cost), These categories were climate change, ozone depletion, particulate matter, ionizing radiation, photochemical ozone formation, and acidification. Although the monetisation methods utilise a similar approach, the uncertainty surrounding the choice of a specific method is exemplified by the fact that the MVC for these six impact categories can vary by up to three orders of magnitude (Amadei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>). This level of uncertainty would suggest the need for sensitivity analysis or comparison of different monetisation methods when no specific method is identified as appropriate for a given study.</p><p id="Par49">In brief, we perform a techno-economic analysis (TEA) and a LCA of different NH<sub>3</sub> production pathways to estimate the cost and environmental impacts of NH<sub>3</sub> at farm in Australia. In this country, most of the nitrogen fertilisers are imported and the domestic production is concentrated in large-scale plants located near ports, resulting in long-distance transport of fertilisers to inner agriculture areas (Fertilizers Australia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2019</xref>; Tran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021</xref>). In this sense, the TEA and LCA consider credits of by-products utilisation and reduced emissions in the production stage by using novel technologies, as well as the impacts of storage and transport. Moreover, LCA results are monetised and internalised using MVC for five impact categories to identify the most cost-effective configuration when environmental aspects other than carbon credits are considered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par50">The environmental profiles of the different NH<sub>3</sub> production pathways were estimated according to the standard ISO 14044 (ISO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2006</xref>) for LCA studies. The TEA was performed by estimating the unitary cost of production (UCOP) of NH<sub>3</sub>, as well as the cost of its storage and transport to provide insights into the economic performance of the conventional and alternative pathways. We estimated the external costs of NH<sub>3</sub> production, that is, the costs that society would pay to mitigate the damages to human health, ecosystems and material resources caused by the emissions in the NH<sub>3</sub> supply chain, which are not generally assumed by producers.

The O<sub>2</sub> sales revenues might be lower, even obtaining minimum revenues of 0.1 AU$/kg O<sub>2</sub> (Gurieff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2021</xref>).

However, the selection of impact categories and life cycle impacts assessment (LCIA) method was constrained by the selection of monetisation methods. Given the regionalized nature of the economic variables in monetisation approaches, it is explicitly stated in several methods such as Ecovalue08 (Ahlroth and Finnveden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2011</xref>), the Environmental Prices Handbook (de Bruyn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018</xref>), MMG (Allacker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>), and EVR (Vogtländer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2001</xref>), that their MVC are only representative for emission sources in Europe, as countries with different technological development levels have varying abatement costs (Arendt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). For this reason, choosing a specific geography can limit the implementation of MVC as the results may vary significantly across regions depending on the adopted monetisation approaches (Amadei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, no specific LCA monetisation method has been developed for the analysed region. Hence, to avoid the high uncertainty of the use of any of the available methods, we have defined a range of different MVC for each impact category. This assessment had to be restricted to the six midpoint impact categories identified by Amadei et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>) and the relevant pre-selected categories. Therefore, we utilized the maximum and minimum MVC for five impact categories (i.e., climate change, ozone depletion, particulate matter, photochemical ozone formation, and acidification) presented by de Bruyn et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>), Schneider-Marin and Lang, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2020</xref>), Alberici et al.

Most of these impact categories are included in ReCiPe 2016 (Huijbregts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017</xref>), one of the most updated and accepted LCIA methods by scientific community due to its representativeness at global scale (Kobayashi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2022</xref>).

However, due to the high quantity of O<sub>2</sub> credits<sub>,</sub> the electrolyser-eHB plant at county-scale had the lowest sale price of 766 $/t NH<sub>3</sub>. Yet, given the use of the HB process, this pathway is highly affected when the production scale is reduced, being less competitive in pathway 5. Nevertheless, these alternative pathways presented environmental benefits when supplied by solar photovoltaic energy, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Environmental impacts of ammonia production in different pathways.

However, despite the benefits of steam credits, they are not sufficient to compensate for the high environmental impacts of NH<sub>3</sub> production in SMR-based plants. In fact, the conventional pathways had worse environmental performance than alternative plants, except for the HTP-based plant. SMR-HB plants generated 2.35–2.60 t CO<sub>2</sub> eq./t NH<sub>3</sub>, while regional plants using HTP technology had the worst performance by generating 9 t CO<sub>2</sub> eq./t NH<sub>3</sub> because these plants consume more electricity and NG than SMR-based plants. In these HTP plants, the most relevant source of emissions was the electricity input because it mostly comes from coal and lignite power plants in Australia. For this reason, when solar energy is used, the environmental impacts are highly reduced, especially in the climate change impact category, where electrolyser-based plants have a rate of up to -1.22 t CO<sub>2</sub> eq./t NH<sub>3</sub>. NTP-based plants can release 1.28 t CO<sub>2</sub> eq./t NH<sub>3</sub> and, in the future, these plants could have emissions of about -0,83 t CO<sub>2</sub> eq./t NH<sub>3.</sub> The inversion of the emissions balance is mainly promoted by the O<sub>2</sub> sales because the traditional methods for O<sub>2</sub> production consume a lot of grid electricity, reducing in this way the market for this pollutant traditional-made O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p id="Par68">The simplified supply chain for the decentralised plants also played an important role by reducing the impacts of transport, which accounted for up to 16% of the net carbon footprint and up to 59% of the net photochemical oxidant formation of centralised produced NH<sub>3</sub>. Besides the long distances from the conventional NH<sub>3</sub> plants to farms, the special characteristics of the load, trucking fleet, roads, and energy sources in Australia contributed to the relevant environmental impacts of NH<sub>3</sub> distribution. Only for climate change, the CO<sub>2</sub> eq. emissions per tkm were double when using specific modelling compared to the Ecoinvent dataset. While the generic Ecoinvent dataset shows an emissions rate of 0.14 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq./tkm, the modelled articulated and rigid truck emitted 0.17 and 0.30 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq./tkm, respectively. The increase in emissions rate was due to higher fuel consumption and also the higher footprint of the production of low-sulphur diesel B5. The production of this fuel with 5% v/v content of vegetable oil methyl ester generates about 17% more carbon emissions than the 100% fossil fuel due to the considerable carbon footprint of palm oil crops in Southeast Asia (Grainger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2013</xref>; EFE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>; Vijay et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2016</xref>). Diesel-electric trains in Australia also use diesel B5, resulting in a rise in emissions rates from 0.052 to 0.060 kg CO<sub>2</sub> eq./tkm. Additionally, the high carbon intensity of the Australian electricity also contributes to the high carbon emission rates of transport because it powers vehicle maintenance and road operations.</p><p id="Par69">The obtained environmental results were internalised in the NH<sub>3</sub> production costs by using MVC, presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Internalisation of environmental impacts of ammonia production of different pathways in the sale price.

The pathways releasing high quantities of these emissions were affected by the internalisation of environmental impacts, such as the HTP-HB regional plant and the electrolyser-NTP local plant, costing in total 9,488 and 4,195 $/t NH<sub>3.</sub> The NTP-based plant, despite being all-electric and supplied by renewable energy, did not obtain the expected improvements because the solar photovoltaic electricity has relevant environmental impacts in its life cycle, mainly related to the manufacturing of solar panels. Particularly, most of the high impacts on photochemical oxidant formation and particulate matter from plants that use solar energy are attributed to the production of high-purity polycrystalline silicon in China. This process requires a substantial amount of electricity, which is primarily generated from hard coal, resulting in the emission of high levels of NOx and particulates.</p><p id="Par71">Nevertheless, despite the range of external cost per kg of CO<sub>2</sub> eq. is the lowest among the selected emissions, climate change costs are very relevant in the total external costs. For pathways using fossil NG, climate change costs account for over 80% and 60% of the total external costs when the max and the min MVC were considered, respectively. This is because, in these pathways, the net CO<sub>2</sub> eq emissions are over 2,000 kg/t NH<sub>3</sub>, in comparison to only the PM<sub>10</sub> eq. and CFC-11 eq emissions which are up to 10 kg/t NH<sub>3</sub> and 0.007 kg NH<sub>3</sub>. In contrast, for the NTP-based plant (pathway 6), the participation of climate change cost in the total external costs was 56% and 26% when the max and the min MVC were considered, respectively. This is because the other impacts related to solar energy such as particulate matter become relevant, which can share 26% and 73% of the total external costs when the max and min MVC are considered for pathway 6, respectively. These particulate matter emissions become more relevant when using min MVC in all pathways, as opposed to the climate change costs, because the defined min MVC (18.64 $/kg PM<sub>10</sub> eq.) is only 3.7 times smaller than its max MCV (69.83 $/kg PM<sub>10</sub> eq.), compared to the range for climate change where the min MVC is 23.2 times smaller than its max MVC. Detailed contributions of environmental impacts in the total external costs can be obtained from tables for internalisation charts in supplementary material <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">SM2</xref>.</p><p id="Par72">For the pathways 4, 5, and 6’ where the avoided emissions of the O<sub>2</sub> sales offset or even inverted the emissions balances of NH<sub>3</sub> production for climate change, ozone depletion, and acidification impacts, the NH<sub>3</sub> sale prices after internalisation are below the estimated sale price in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. This is because it was assumed that producers would have received a bonus due to emissions reduction. In this sense, the pathways considering the electrolyser-eHB plant at county scale overperformed the novel NTP-based plants, obtaining final sale prices of about 114 $/t NH<sub>3</sub>. Nevertheless, at cooperative scale, the future scenario for NTP-based plants would be more competitive (222 $/t NH<sub>3</sub>) than electrolyser-eHB plants (409 $/t NH<sub>3</sub>) because of the overrun of scaled-down HB plants.</p><p id="Par73">From Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, it could be concluded that even if bonuses for the environmental benefits of the alternative plants are not considered, and only the taxes due to pollution are charged, the electrolyser-eHB (at county scale) and future NTP-based plants at cooperative scale would be competitive. However, this scenario would hardly occur because imposing such high environmental taxes on traditionally manufactured NH<sub>3</sub> would make this industry less competitive not only against cleaner local NH<sub>3</sub> production but also with the international NH<sub>3</sub> market. Since NH<sub>3</sub> is a commodity, additional taxes on this product would significantly affect exports, which would not be viewed favourably by the public administration due to the significant loss of income for the country. In this sense, instead of internalising the monetised environmental impacts into each tonne of manufactured NH<sub>3</sub>, another way of using these MVC would be for the estimation of the total environmental costs of the national NH<sub>3</sub> market. In this way, public administrations could be aware of the amount of money required to mitigate or repair the damages to human health, ecosystems and resources caused by the conventional NH<sub>3</sub> industry, money that would be saved if cleaner NH<sub>3</sub> is produced. These estimates for the expected money savings might be useful to take decisions about the budgets that could be invested to promote novel technologies for local NH<sub>3</sub> production using renewable energies.</p><p id="Par74">For this case study in Australia, the national NH<sub>3</sub> demand is approximately 2.6 million tonnes per year (Tran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2021</xref>). In this sense, if we consider only the external costs related to the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the conventional NH<sub>3</sub>, the total expenditures for public administration in Australia would be between 208 and 5,324 million US$ per year due to the emissions of this industry. In the scenario of considering the external costs of the five impact categories evaluated in this study, the annual expenditures would be between 266 and 6,185 million US$, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Total external costs for the annual demand of conventionally manufactured NH<sub>3</sub> in Australia using min and max MVC</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11367_2023_2187_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par75">In Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, the external costs due to CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are presented separately given the relevance and focus of the current environmental policy towards the net zero carbon scenarios. Moreover, we can see that when the other four impact categories are considered, the total external costs only increase by 16%. This means that most of these environmental costs in this analysis are related to the carbon emissions, even though each kg of carbon emissions costs less than other emissions such as of CFC-11 eq. or PM<sub>10</sub> eq. Hence, given the high amount of carbon emitted in the SMR-HB pathway, the climate change costs correspond to 86% of the total external costs of the conventional NH<sub>3</sub> industry. In this sense, if the max MVC are considered, budgets of around US$5 billion to promote cleaner technologies for NH<sub>3</sub> synthesis could be considered an investment rather than an expense by public administration in Australia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par76">Decentralised and renewable energy-based production of fertilizers has been shown to emit fewer pollutants compared to conventional production pathways. However, despite the environmental benefits, the economic viability of these green fertilizers remains a barrier to the adoption of alternative technologies. The internalisation of environmental impacts of NH<sub>3</sub> production, as well as the inclusion of impacts of transport, storage, and utilization of by-products, is proposed as a tool to support the transition towards a more sustainable fertiliser supply chain. Internalisation of environmental impacts into monetary cost involves incorporating the external costs or impacts identified in the environmental evaluation into the decision-making process by assigning a monetary value to these impacts. In this way, the full costs of the NH<sub>3</sub> supply chain are accounted for, including the environmental costs that are often externalised and borne by society. Particularly, the LCA and TEA of novel modular and full electric plants have been performed to determine their competitiveness with conventional SMR-HB plants for a more local NH<sub>3</sub> production. The 16% of the total 2.60 t CO<sub>2</sub> eq. emitted per NH<sub>3</sub> produce at national-scale SMR-HB plants corresponded transport, share that is reduced to 7.5% and 1% when NH<sub>3</sub> at regional and farm-scale plants, respectively. If other impact categories are analysed, such as net photochemical oxidant formation, transport shares 59% of the impacts of centralised produce NH<sub>3</sub>. The use of alternative technologies fuelled by solar energy and using O<sub>2</sub> by-product from electrolyser can reduce and even invert the emission balances, generating up to -1.22 t CO<sub>2</sub> eq./t NH<sub>3</sub> in electrolyser-eHB plants and -0,83 t CO<sub>2</sub> eq./t NH<sub>3</sub> in future NTP-based plants. This reduction is mainly promoted by reducing the market for traditional-made O<sub>2</sub> using fossil-based electricity mix in Australia. According to the TEA, SMR-HB plants produce the cheapest NH<sub>3</sub>, with sale prices around $590 per ton, while electrolyser-eHB plants have prices ranging between $766 and $1,325 per ton, and NTP-based plants have prices ranging between $796 and $2,404 per ton of NH<sub>3.</sub> After the internalisation of environmental impacts, the electrolyser-eHB plants showed the lowest NH<sub>3</sub> sale prices than the novel NTP-based plants and the conventional SMR-HB. These later plants would have to sell NH<sub>3</sub> at prices over 2,636 $/t NH<sub>3,</sub> while the electrolyser-eHB plant reaches rates of 114 $/t NH<sub>3</sub>. This is due to use the optimized energy usage of the HB processes, which is much higher than the NTP process. However, is important to know that the HB process has reached its efficiency limits, while the NTP process still has room for improvement, as well as its production costs are lower at local-scale plants. In this future scenario of the best energy efficiencies for NTP-based plants, this alternative could also be competitive with rates of 222 $/t NH<sub>3</sub>. In addition, if monetised environmental costs are estimated for a whole industry instead of internalising them into each tonne of NH<sub>3</sub>, it is found that the total external costs of the conventional NH<sub>3</sub> industry in Australia could amount to about US$5 billion, which can be invested to promote cleaner technologies for local NH<sub>3</sub> synthesis given the expected savings for public administrations of using these novel technologies.
