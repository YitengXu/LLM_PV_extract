In this study, de novo molecular generation based on recurrent neural networks was applied to discover a new chemical space of kinase inhibitors. During the application, the practicality was evaluated, and new inspiration was found.

Considering only drug-like molecules, the number of compounds in the drug-like chemical space is estimated to be 10<sup>60</sup>, which means that there are more drug-like compounds than there are atoms in the solar system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the drug-like chemical space, only a tiny proportion of molecules have been found as drugs, and for a long time, numerous efforts have been made to modify the drug map. After years of high-cost and time-consuming trials exploring the drug space, computers started to be used to guide the exploration in the 1980s, when computer-assisted drug design (CADD) emerged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, even with the help of quantum approaches, which require massive calculation, the biological activity of compounds can hardly be predicted precisely. As no formula can be found to precisely describe the interactions between molecules and their targets, automating drug research and development (R&amp;D) through machine learning (ML) from a large number of samples represents a new option [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In recent years, explorers of the drug map have started to think differently, and they are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) as an effective guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Inspired by the successful applications of deep learning in areas such as image recognition and natural language processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], researchers have increased their interest in the deployment of AI in drug R&amp;D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. As reviewed in several articles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], deep learning (DL) and AI have had significant effects on CADD. Especially, the linear form of molecules is similar to sequences in natural language processing and thus establishes a starting point for de novo molecular generation.</p><p id="Par19">De novo molecular generation aims to produce new chemical space with certain properties, which has been greatly bolstered by NN-based algorithms, as introduced recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Simplified molecular input line entry specification (SMILES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and international chemical identifier (InChI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] are two linear representations of molecules that have been applied to de novo molecular generation, and SMILES is more commonly used due to its simple grammar. During training, RNN-based models try to learn how sequences of training molecules are composed, so the models are able to regenerate the sequences after training. And even, the models can further reorganize sequences, so to produce molecules that are structurally novel but similar to those known molecules. Although there are novel molecules generated, their fragments are mainly learned from the training molecules. To some degree, those structurally novel but similar molecules further enrich the chemical space around the training molecules, and the generated molecules represent the local chemical space around the training molecules. In early studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], transfer learning (TL) was adopted by RNN-based models to generate the chemical space around target molecules quickly and effectively. During TL, models are first trained with datasets providing a large number of molecules. Then, the models will be fine-tuned with target molecules. TL performed on molecules resembles a process during which the learned chemical space is transferring from those unrelated datasets to desired molecules. With this method, researchers have successfully discovered several compounds with moderate to high activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Details of generative models based on NNs have been recently reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Although various complex models designed for de novo molecular generation have been created, their real performance in the exploitation of chemical space remains uncertain. Sometimes, complex models may not perform as well as expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In comparative studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] on different generative models, simpler models such as models based on long short-term memory (LSTM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] are found to be more powerful than complex models, and simple RNNs with SMILES as inputs are one of those satisfactory models. Generative models based only on simple RNNs remember or generalize the chemical space around target molecules directly, so simple models have been found to be effective tools for exploring the chemical space around target molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Notably, generative models are usually trained with a large number of data, which in turn could be at the expense of losing novelty. With a background of strict protection of intellectual property (IP), such as Markush structures covered by IP, novelty and accuracy seem to be necessary issues for generative models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. To help relieve the uncertainty in the models, their application in real tasks seems indispensable.</p><p id="Par21">Because the R&amp;D of kinase inhibitors is part of a competitive field in medicinal chemistry, a successful trial of RNN-based models could be persuasive. Proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus kinase 1 (Pim1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) are two widely-studied kinases, and the online database ChEMBL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] collects hundreds of known inhibitors for each of the two targets. In 2017, Abemaciclib was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), whose half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) values for Pim1 and CDK4 are 50 nM and 2 nM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Additionally, both Pim1 inhibitors and CDK4 inhibitors show anti-tumor activities through affecting cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and the two targets show potentials in treatment of renal cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The both targets have abundant and potent inhibitors, namely, the chemical space of their inhibitors has been greatly exploited. Overall, exploring new chemical space of Pim1 inhibitors and CDK4 inhibitors is challenging, which helps test the performance of those generative models.</p><p id="Par22">In this study, we applied RNN-based generative models to generate potential inhibitors for Pim1 and CDK4. With RNN-based generative models, this study aims to explore spaces both near and far from the explored space. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a, RNNs can be directly applied to generate molecules based on training molecules to realize exploration near the exploited space around the training molecules. However, the neighbor exploited space implies insufficient novelty. To solve this problem, we combined RNN-based generative models and virtual screening. According to structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies, the chemical space of active molecules could be local, so the larger local space enriched by virtual screening may correspond to a higher probability of discovering novel active molecules. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, RNNs were applied to molecular generation based on molecules to be screened, so virtual screening can be performed on the groups of similar molecules to the training molecules rather than the training molecules alone. The proposed idea was then validated in silico and in practice. During the application, details on the implementation are uncovered to help better improve the models used for de novo molecular generation. Finally, the models that we prepared successfully designed one potent Pim1 inhibitor and two novel lead compounds targeting CDK4.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Chemical space exploration with RNNs. <bold>a</bold> Direct chemical space exploitation around known active molecules.

The first 500 molecules with smallest IC<sub>50</sub> values were downloaded respectively as active molecules for the two targets. Without considering chirality, replicate molecules were then removed, and 448 CDK4 inhibitors and 453 Pim1 inhibitors were used for generator_1, generator_canonical and generator_random. TL was also applied in this study to pre-train generator_2, and the DrugBank 5.1.2 database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] was downloaded.

The “\n” symbol separates two neighbor sequences, indicating both the end of a previous sequence and the start of the next sequence. The concatenated sequences were then divided into tokens. Tokens represent certain atoms, bonds and connections that appeared in SMILES sequences. In this study, the tokens used are c, C, n, N, o, O, s, S, p, P, F, I, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, −, +, [, ], (, ), =, #, \n, [nH], [S+], [O−], [N+], [N−], Br, Cl and Si.</p><p id="Par26">In each dataset, tokens of all the sequences were divided into 128 batches, and 128 batches of continuous tokens were input through N times.

Tokens that are not included in the N × 128 × 64 tokens through N times of inputs will be ignored. Before being input, the tokens were encoded with one-hot encoding.

Then, the pre-trained model was trained with the randomized sequences for 30 epochs to convergence, and new sequences were sampled every 10 epochs to generate similar molecules of the seven molecules as many as possible. During each sampling, 200,000 tokens were sampled as described in part 2.2. Repeated and invalid molecules were then removed with RDKit before virtual screening. Unique generated molecules e were then further screened by the pharmacophore model of Pim1 and the molecular docking model of CDK4.

The pharmacophore model and the molecular docking model built for CDK4 inhibitors were used to perform virtual screening, and -PMF was used as the scoring function during molecular docking.

Because it is hard for models to learn rules from a small quantity of data, TL helps improve molecule generation by pretraining with datasets that are large but not highly related. However, previous models ignore the diversity of SMILES sequences belonging to complex molecules, which helps enlarge datasets so that the enlarged datasets directly related to corresponding tasks can be appropriate inputs. In this study, models trained with or without randomized SMILES sequences were compared at the beginning, corresponding to generator_random and generator_canonical. Both models were trained to convergence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), and they generated different diversities of their new chemical space. After sampling for 200,000 tokens, the generator_random produces more novel molecules as training continues, while the generator_canonical produces more replicates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b, c). Overall, the generated chemical space around the training molecules was developed better with the dataset of randomized SMILES sequences (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d) than with the model trained with canonical SMILES sequences (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e). It appears that SMILES randomization can further improve the novelty of generated molecules. In a recent report, it is also found that the randomized SMILES sequences help improve the RNN-based generative models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Notably, SMILES randomization enables a great increase in the number of sequences, which helps solve the problem of data deficiency. TL is frequently used in generative models based on RNNs.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Training and molecule generation based on canonical SMILES sequences and randomized SMILES sequences. <bold>a</bold> The convergence of both models; the loss values were recorded every 200 steps. <bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold> Similarity of newly generated unique molecules to their closest inhibitors after training with canonical SMILES sequences (<bold>b</bold>) or randomized SMILES sequences (<bold>c</bold>) for 1000 steps and 2000 steps. <bold>d</bold>, <bold>e</bold> t-SNE plots of combined unique molecules generated through sampling twice after training with canonical SMILES sequences (<bold>d</bold>) or randomized SMILES sequences (<bold>e</bold>). 2-D coordinates of CDK4 inhibitors, Pim1 inhibitors and newly generated molecules are colored blue, green and yellow, respectively</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13321_2020_446_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par51">However, generative models trained with TL seem to learn from target molecules after being trained with many unrelated molecules. Though TL brings novelty in terms of the generated molecules, part of the generated molecules may be far from the chemical space of the target molecules, which may require the AI-based models to turn to traditional CADD models. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, a small number of molecules with a Tanimoto similarity index smaller than 0.6 were generated by the directly trained models so that novelty was partly realized by the model trained directly with the dataset of randomized sequences. In a direct way, randomized SMILES sequences help exploit the chemical space around target molecules. This characteristic may help RNN-based models generate molecules that are novel but similar to known molecules. In regard to the field of medicinal chemistry, reliable, automatic me-too drug design could be realized. Because the chemical space around known active molecules is always protected by strict IP, determining whether the method is practical requires a real application.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Direct chemical space exploitation around known active molecules</title><p id="Par52">From the chemical space generated by generator_1, three molecules were selected due to their synthetic accessibility.

Luckily, in the case of MJ-1055, AI-based reorganization could help discover treasures around the space explored previously.

Perhaps the model found that the hydroxyl-substituted phenyl moiety is still an active fragment among the training molecules, so the introduction of the group successfully maintains potent activity.

After virtual screening for the potential active molecules, molecules that are most similar to abemaciclib were kept at most, which is shown with t-SNE (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a) and similarity analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The filtered molecules after the first round of virtual screening with the pharmacophore model for Pim1 and the molecular docking model for CDK4 and -PMF. <bold>a</bold> t-SNE plot of CDK4 inhibitors (blue), Pim1 inhibitors (green), abemaciclib (red), inactive molecules (magenta) and screened molecules (yellow). <bold>b</bold> Number of the most similar molecules compared to the seven target molecules</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13321_2020_446_Fig4_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p><p id="Par60">After the first cycle of generating similar molecules and enrichment with virtual screening, the first 50% of screened molecules sorted by their -PMF score were kept as the potential active molecules. Compared to the preliminary generated molecules, the screened molecules meet the requirements of the virtual screening models better, which represent more ideal molecules with preferable structures. To find the core structures shared in the screened molecules, those molecules were represented by seven centers through clustering according to their structures, and the seven cluster centers represent more preferable core structures for the virtual screening models compared to the structures of the original seven molecules. Then, the second cycle of molecule generation and virtual screening was performed to discover structures that are more preferable for the virtual screening models. With t-SNE (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a) and similarity analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b), the space around abemaciclib was further emphasized as expected, while the local space near CHEMBL1802355 was also enriched. From the result of t-SNE (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a), the screened molecules appear to be distant from CHEMBL1802355. Then, the closest molecule of CHEMBL1802355 based on Tanimoto similarity and the cluster center of the screened space around CHEMBL1802355 were found to check the new preferable structure for the virtual screening models. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, both molecules possess extra guanidyl groups, and it is the same for most generated molecules in the local space around ChEMBL1802355. As guanidyl is a basic group, it conforms well to the positive pharmacophore in the model of Pim1 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S3), and the basic fragment matches well with the SAR reported in a study on Pim1 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], where ChEMBL1802355 was found to lack activity and the introduction of basic fragments helps improve the inhibitory activity.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The filtered chemical space after the second round of virtual screening with the pharmacophore model for Pim1 and the molecular docking model for CDK4 and -PMF. <bold>a</bold> t-SNE plot of CDK4 inhibitors (blue), Pim1 inhibitors (green), abemaciclib (red), inactive molecules (magenta) and screened molecules (yellow). <bold>b</bold> Number of the most similar molecules compared to the seven target molecules</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13321_2020_446_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO8"/></fig><fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Representative molecules in the transferred chemical space moving away from CHEMBL1802355.

The aim was preliminarily set to discover new inhibitors of CDK4. The pharmacophore model built for CDK4 and the molecular docking model aided by -PMF were used to perform virtual screening. Potential active molecules were first screened out. After one cycle of molecule generation based on the preliminarily screened molecules and virtual screening, the screened preferable molecules for the virtual screening models were visualized with t-SNE (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>), and molecules (flagged in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) from the large local space and small local space were obtained and tested. Among those molecules, only AF-399/37285031 is found as a new CDK4 inhibitor, with inhibition of 57.8 ± 5.0% at 10 μM, which proves the reliability of this method in practice. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>, the chemical space around AF-399/37285031 is retained through virtual screening, and the chemical space around several inactive molecules shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> fails to be enriched. However, not all the molecules selected from the enriched chemical space show activity. The reason may be due to unreliable traditional models. Although those traditional models may be inaccurate, virtual screening from the perspective of groups of similar molecules still help improve the accuracy.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>t-SNE plot of the screened molecules.

Although these models perform reorganization of sequences without optimization, key fragments contributing to the activity can be effectively extracted and further assembled to afford novel and potentially active generated molecules. More importantly, an ignored detail that a complex molecule may have different SMILES sequences helps effectively generate molecules that are similar to training molecules, and the characteristic further improves the models’ ability to exploit the chemical space around those training molecules, which may be helpful for the industry to solve IP issues. However, the models can still be further improved. During the application of the models, synthetic accessibility and stability exhibited problems, perplexing us, which could represent the obstacles for AI-based generative models.</p><p id="Par63">To explore new chemical spaces of active molecules, RNN-based models show their applicability. With vivid cases reported in this study, traditional virtual screening could be further improved from the perspective of local chemical space. On the one hand, the accuracy of virtual screening may be further improved. On the other hand, the cycle of molecule generation and virtual screening could guide discovery of ideal structures that match traditional models much better, which would help guide further structural modifications. In regard to new targets for which there is little knowledge of active molecules, virtual screening based on local chemical space shows priority when compared to traditional models that could be inaccurate without validation and to AI models desperate for abundant data.</p><p id="Par64">Overall, RNNs deal with the raw representation of molecules well, and this feature makes RNNs good at exploring the chemical space. With further improvement and application of the models, AI may realize more efficient and accurate drug discovery and ultimately bolster more fierce competition for the industry in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank American Journal Experts (AJE), NC, USA, for their English language editing.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>XL, YX, HY, KL, conceived the main theme of the work and ensured that the study was rationally valid.
