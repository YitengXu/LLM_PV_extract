Free photosynthetic pigments are unstable in the presence of light and oxygen, a situation which can hardly be avoided during the operation of DSSCs, especially in large-scale applications. We therefore investigated the recombinant light-harvesting protein LHCBM6, which naturally occurs in the photosynthetic apparatus of the green microalga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> as a bio-dye in DSSCs. Photocurrent densities of up to 0.87 and 0.94 mA·cm<sup>−2</sup> were determined for the DSSCs and solar energy to electricity conversion efficiencies (η) reached about 0.3% (100 mW·cm<sup>−2</sup>; AM 1.5 G filter applied). Importantly, we observed an unprecedented stability of LHCII-based DSSCs within long DSSC operation times of at least 7 days in continuous light and show that operation times are restricted by electrolyte decomposition rather than reduced dye performance, as could be demonstrated by DSSC reactivation following re-supplementation with fresh electrolyte. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analysing bio-dye sensitized DSSCs over such long periods, which revealed that during illumination an activation of the DSSCs occurs.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bundesministerium f&amp;amp;#x00FC;r Bildung und Forschung (Federal Ministry of Education and

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Oxygenic photosynthesis can be sub-divided into two major types of biochemical reactions. Light reactions provide energy (ATP) and reducing equivalents (NADPH) by the endergonic process of water-splitting, which is driven by light absorption in the photosynthetic antenna. The ATP and NADPH produced by the light reactions are required to fix inorganic carbon and to produce glucose within the Calvin-Benson cycle, a cycle of reactions which are collectively termed “dark reactions”. Green algae and higher plants absorb light energy using light-harvesting complexes (LHC) associated with both photosystems and spanning the thylakoid membrane. This light absorption provides the energy needed for charge separation in the reaction centres of photosystems I and II. Depending on their predominant location at PSI or PSII, pigment-binding LHC proteins are designated LHCI (LHCA) or LHCII and two main types of LHCII proteins can be distinguished. The most abundant major LHCII proteins (termed LHCBM in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>) form the peripheral antenna of PSII in green microalga and higher plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, while the less abundant monomeric LHCII proteins (CP26/CP29 in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>) are located in close proximity to the PSII core complex. Excitation energy transfer towards the special pair chlorophyll of the PSII reaction centre (P680), whose excitation is followed by charge separation reactions and electron transfer to the electron carrier plastoquinone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, requires chlorophyll <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> as well as carotenoids bound to LHCII apoproteins. Besides being involved in excitation energy transfer, the carotenoids associated with LHCII (lutein, neoxanthin, and xanthophyll cycle pigments) are also implicated in dissipative processes (NPQ) and the scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS), when light energy is provided in excess<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Dye-sensitized solar cells, have been introduced as a promising alternative to conventional solar cells by Grätzel and O’Reagan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Typically, an organic dye is immobilized on the surface of wide bandgap semiconductor (e.g. mesoporous film of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle), which upon excitation injects electrons into the conduction band of the semiconductor. The photoanode is connected to a counter electrode (typically translucent conductive oxide with thin platinum coating to act as a catalyst), where an electrolyte component (e.g. the I/I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> redox couple) is reduced, while oxidation of the redox couple fills the electron gap created via excitation in the dye<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. LHCII molecules isolated from spinach leaves and binding photosynthetic pigments have been used within DSSCs before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, but so far the use of recombinant LHCII proteins has not been tested.

We wanted to investigate, whether recombinant LHCII molecules represent a promising alternative as a dye for the bio-sensitization of photoanodes. For the <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of LHCII proteins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>), the <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> LHCII isoform LHCBM6 (UniProtKB - A8J287) was cloned into the <italic>E. coli</italic> expression vector pQE80L to enable IPTG-inducible expression of the protein (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>; left panel), which contained a 6xHis-tag fused to its N-terminus. The chloroplast transit sequence (amino acids 1–15 at the N-terminus) as predicted by Predalgo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> was excluded from the coding sequence used for expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Supplemental Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>; HisL6). Since LHCBM6 is an integral membrane protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> it formed inclusion bodies in <italic>E. coli</italic>, which were purified to serve as a starting material for <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>; right panel; IBs; Supplemental Figs <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). The workflow of the reconstitution/refolding procedure is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>. Insoluble and misfolded His-LHCBM6 present in inclusion bodies is solubilized and unfolded by boiling in the presence of detergent, while refolding is induced by exchanging the ionic detergent LDS with the mild non-ionic detergent Octyl β-D-glucopyranoside in the presence of pigments (chlorophylls <italic>a</italic>/<italic>b</italic> and carotenoids) isolated from spinach leaves (Supplemental Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Excess pigments are removed from the refolded sample by chromatography on a Ni-NTA resin, before pooled eluted fractions containing His-LHCBM6 are subjected to centrifugation through a sucrose gradient. Centrifugation through the sucrose gradient resulted in a separation of the Ni-NTA eluted protein into two discrete bands (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>). In order to confirm the success of the refolding procedure, spectroscopic analyses of both gradient fractions were conducted. For both gradient fractions absorbance spectra were recorded and only the fraction with the higher sedimentation velocity clearly displayed the expected Qy peaks at 671.5 nm and 651 nm as well as the Soret transitions at 439 nm and 466 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Comparison of the absorbance spectra indicated that the lower phase contains properly refolded LHCBM6 protein, which was further confirmed by recording fluorescence emission spectra of both fractions after excitation at 440 nm, 475 nm and 500 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B, C</xref>). A perfect overlap of emission spectra in the case of the higher density fraction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>) demonstrates an unperturbed excitation energy transfer between bound pigments and proper refolding, while this could not be observed for the lower density fraction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Therefore, it could be concluded that the refolding procedure yielded functional light-harvesting protein LHCBM6.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><italic>In vitro</italic> reconstitution of 6xHis-LHCBM6 from inclusion bodies after heterologous expression in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

An activation during the first 12 hours was followed by a sharp decline in P<sub>max</sub> (12–25 h). In order to exclude that a denaturation or photobleaching of LHCII molecules during DSSC operation was responsible for the electric power decline observed in the short deactivation phase, an additional experiment with an exchange of spent electrolyte E1 with fresh electrolyte was performed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>; E1 exchange; black arrow). Addition of fresh electrolyte to the DSSC within the deactivation phase led to a recovery of the DSSC, as seen by a re-increase of the maximum electric power obtained. Therefore, an inactivation or desorption of light-harvesting proteins as the cause for DSSC activation can be ruled out, pointing at electrolyte (E1; Iodolyte AN-50 from Solaronix) decomposition as the cause for the decline in DSSC performance. Electrolyte bleaching, the disappearance of I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> ions, has been proposed as a mechanisms of DSSC inactivation before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The conversion of I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> to iodate (IO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) was proposed as the mechanism leading to electrolyte bleaching, which was in turn thought to be promoted by the inevitable presence of water in the assembled DSSC, raising the pH by activating pyridine base additives, thus reducing the stability of triiodide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Since the E1 electrolyte used within the DSSC contains a pyridine additive, electrolyte bleaching might have caused the observed loss in DSSC activity during operation. Importantly, however, the fact that photocurrent generation can be restored by adding fresh electrolyte excludes LHCII desorption and denaturation of LHCII proteins as the main cause of the observed phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Long-lasting photocurrent production for several days with LHCII-sensitized DSSCs and UV-depleted light</title><p id="Par11">The photosynthetic pigments (chlorophylls a/b and carotenoids) bound to LHCII molecules show their strongest absorbance in the 400 to 700 nm range, the so-called PAR (photosynthetically active radiation) range<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. We therefore repeated photocurrent measurements by applying a UV filter, in order to exclude radiation with a wavelength below 400 nm from the light for DSSC irradiation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

In contrast to previous studies, long-term measurements of DSSC performance under continuous illumination and an operation of the device for several days were conducted (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>). These long-term analyses revealed that during continuous illumination an activation of the DSSC occurs, which is reversed in a second phase. We currently cannot depict the mechanisms underlying the impressive rise in photocurrent densities observed within the activation phase (Figs <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A, B</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), but it seems reasonable to suggest that a re-organization of LHCII molecules on the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle surface is one of the contributing mechanisms. The aggregation state of LHCII molecules physisorbed onto titanium dioxide surfaces has already been shown to have a great impact on photocurrent generation, and was explained by the promotion of Chl-Chl charge transfer states, facilitating electron injection into the semiconductor<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. An exchange of the electrolyte (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>) excluded an inactivation of the LHCII bio-dye as the cause for a decline of photocurrents in the deactivation phase. The precise mechanism of electrolyte decomposition is difficult to explain, considered that although several hypotheses regarding the detrimental role of trace amounts of water inevitably present in DSSCs were formulated, the actual consequence of water contamination in DSSCs remains enigmatic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In fact, a study published by O’Regan and coworkers in 2010 and showing an unaffected J<sub>SC</sub> up to the presence of 40% (v/v) in the electrolyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, lead to a novel view on water as DSSC component<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Independent of the actual mechanism which interferes with electrolyte function, a higher electron turnover in the presence of UV light seems to accelerate the process, as can be seen by comparing the duration of the activation phase in measurements conducted with (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and without (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) UV light. The use of heterologous expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> together with refolding opens up novel opportunities to create bespoke bio-dyes based on light-harvesting proteins. For instance, replacing Chl <italic>a</italic> by Chl <italic>f</italic>/<italic>d</italic> during the refolding process might be a means to extend the PAR region via red-shifted chlorophylls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. The process applied to generate LHCII bio-dyes in the present study should probably not be easily scalable and economically viable. Furthermore it cannot be considered sustainable since heterotrophic microorganisms and hence reduced carbon sources are used for cultivation. In addition organic solvents are applied to extract photosynthetic pigments from spinach leaves. Future strategies should therefore consider the production of tagged LHCII molecules directly in green microalgae from carbon dioxide in conjunction with simple purification methods, maybe based on direct absorption of LHCII molecules from crude extracts onto photoanodes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Fabrication of DSSCs</title><p id="Par13">Photoanodes (Solaronix Titania Electrodes, opaque, #74101) and cathodes (Solaronix Platinum Electrodes, drilled, #74201) were heated up from RT (~20 min.) and then baked at 450 °C for 30 min.
