One halophilic strain and seven freshwater strains of cyanobacteria representing four of the five taxonomic orders of Cyanophyta were examined to determine the following: (i) whether they contain polyphenols, including flavonoids; (ii) the resistance of their cultures when suppressed by the presence of exogenous hydroxychalcones—precursors of flavonoid biosynthesis and (iii) whether these photoautotrophs can transform hydroxylated chalcones. All examined strains were found to contain polyphenols and flavonoids, and the growth of their cultures was inhibited in the presence of 2′-hydroxychalcone, 2″-hydroxychalcone and 4″-hydroxychalcone. We also confirmed that the examined cyanobacteria transformed hydroxychalcones via hydrogenative bio-reduction and formed the corresponding hydroxydihydro derivatives with yields above 90% whenever the substrates were bioavailable for such a conversion. Moreover, we observed that the routes and efficiency of biohydrogenation (and hydroxylation) of chalcones were dependent on the location of the hydroxyl substituent. The final products obtained as the results of biotransformations were extracted from the media and identified by mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (<sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, COSY, HSQC). Based on those results, we believe that the very efficient biohydrogenation of hydroxychalcones, which may easy be scaled up for biotechnological purposes, reflects the natural activity of the cyanobacterial defence system, because hydroxydihydrochalcones were less active inhibitors of the growth of cyanobacterial cultures than the corresponding substrates.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Chalcones are a group of plant-derived compounds belonging to the flavonoid family that are synthesised through the phenylpropanoid pathway and play a vital role in different metabolic pathways in photosynthesising organisms. Structurally, chalcones are composed of two aryl groups (A- and B-rings) linked by an open-chain three-carbon unit α,β-unsaturated carbonyl system. Naturally occurring chalcones are broadly distributed in various plant species and possess a conspicuously yellow colour (Attar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>; Ballester et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>). They are biogenetic precursors of all known flavonoids and exist most commonly in hydroxylated form. Chalcones are frequently produced in nature by hydroxylases in the biosynthetic pathways of plants (Ni et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2004</xref>). In view of their relative structural simplicity and associated facility of synthesis, coupled with their attractive biological activities (Avila et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>; Karaman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>), chalcones continue to enjoy considerable attention from chemists researching new molecular scaffolds for the creation of novel therapeutics (Okoniewska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2016</xref>; Ritter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2014</xref>; Stompor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Biocatalysis represents a successful and, in many cases, outstanding substitute to standard chemical synthesis (Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2009</xref>) or extraction of chalcones from plant material (Du et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>). This strategy is particularly valuable for microbial whole cell systems, which afford cheaper, scalable, and more available means of efficiently acquiring derivatives of chalcones (de Carvalho and da Fonseca <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2006</xref>). Thus far, transformations of hydroxylated chalcones by whole cell systems have been performed only by heterotrophic microorganisms and the main reactions of these processes mimic the natural metabolic conversion pathways of these molecules in plant kingdom. Therefore, hydrogenation, dehydrogenation, hydroxylation, O-methylation, O-demethylation, glycosylation, deglycosylation, C ring cleavage of the benzo-γ-pyrone system, cyclization and carbonyl reduction were found as the main ways of transformation (Cao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2015</xref>). Microbial conversion of compounds containing a three-carbon enone moiety has attracted increasing attention, particularly with the recent rediscovery of ene-reductases from the old yellow enzyme family. These flavoenzymes selectively catalyse the hydrogenation of activated C=C bonds of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl molecules in excellent yield (Fu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>). Ene-reductases have also been identified in prokaryotic microalgae, i.e. cyanobacteria (Fu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>), and used for light-induced, photocatalytic reduction of C=C bonds (Koninger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2016</xref>) that conduces to the formation of dihydrochalcones. Because of their high sweet taste, these compounds have potential applications in the food industry for the production of low-calorie, multicomponent, nontoxic and safety sweeteners of natural origin. Consequently, their UV-protective, antioxidant and health-promoting properties make dihydrochalcones of interest to the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries (DuBois et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1977</xref>; Winnig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Biocatalytic transformations using microorganisms are anticipated to be more selective and environmentally friendly (Matsuda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>; Nakamura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2003</xref>); however, the microbes do not always deliver the expected reactions. The major disadvantage of bioconversion is the prerequisite for an aqueous ambience for most enzymatic reactions, which can be a limitation for the slightly soluble organic compounds acted as substrates. Additionally, a real difficulty associated with the use of biocatalysts is the successive supply of the cofactors NADH or NADPH, which deliver reducing power and chemical energy. In case of oxygenic photoautotrophic organisms, the solar light energy captured by photosynthetic systems is converted to electrochemical energy to regenerate NADPH from NADP<sup>+</sup> via photosynthetic electron-transfer reactions. NADPH is the solitary reducing agent for the reduction of exogenous artificial substrates (Nakamura and Yamanaka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2002</xref>). Therefore, living cyanobacterial cells that possess the ability to regenerate their own respective cofactors are hopeful and eminently effective pretender for novel ‘photobiocatalysts’. Additionally, cyanobacterial species possess thylakoids, an intracellular membrane system that makes them highly suitable hosts for expressing the P450 enzymes that participate in phenylpropanoids biosynthetic (Melis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1999</xref>; Xue and He <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>). As prokaryotic microalgae, cyanobacteria are an unconventional and attractive source of phenylpropanoids and create great opportunities for discovering unique secondary metabolites with potential biological activities due to the facility of mass-scale cultivation. Moreover, several inherent features of cyanobacteria, such as oxygenic photosynthesis, amenability to genetic engineering and capacity to survive in extreme habitats or under chemical stress, make them prominent cell factories for targeted biotransformations (Xue and He <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2015</xref>). We hypothesise then that organisms that produce phenylpropanoids, which are also precursors of flavonoids (Goiris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2014</xref>; Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2017a</xref>), must possess active enzymatic pathways that enable them to transform these compounds according to cellular needs.</p><p id="Par5">To verify this hypothesis, the ability of the biocatalytic systems of whole cells of halophilic and freshwater species to transform hydroxylated chalcones was studied.

Because of their phototrophic lifestyle and constant exposure to high oxygen and radical stresses, these biota have a high capability for producing plentiful efficient protective chemicals against oxidative and radical stressors and exhibit adaptive responses to oxidative stresses by stimulating their intrinsic antioxidant defence systems based on mediator compounds, including polyphenolic substances (Babić et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2016</xref>). Previously published data indicate that the phenolic acids and flavonoids in cyanobacterial cells may be responsible for their antioxidant properties (Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2017a</xref>), and thus a higher content of phenolics in cyanobacterial species may be presumed as an adaptation strategy of these organisms against abiotic stresses in their specific habitats. Therefore, the properties of these organisms may also include functional values such as free-radical quenching, metal chelation and ROS-scavenging activity (Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2017a</xref>). Our evaluations are consistent with literature reports showing that metabolites such as flavonoids are involved in the defence system of cyanobacteria against adverse conditions (Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2017b</xref>).</p><p id="Par53">Independent of the intrinsic content of polyphenolics, the presence of these chemicals outside cyanobacterial cells may significantly influence their growth and metabolism, as demonstrated for naringenin (Żyszka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017b</xref>). This inhibition is higher when the substance is structurally related to hydroxylated chalcones, which are biosynthetic precursors of all flavonoids. We found that the tested hydroxychalcones inhibited the growth of all eight examined strains representing four of five cyanobacterial taxonomic orders, and this inhibition depended more on the structure of the hydroxychalcone than on the microbial strain. Our results are consistent with those obtained by Nakai and co-authors, who observed that the growth of the cyanobacterium <italic>Microcystis aeruginosa</italic> was inhibited in the presence of polyphenols such as ellagic and gallic acids and catechin (Nakai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2005</xref>). The presence of flavonoids, such as 4′,5-dihydroxyflavone, apigenin, and luteolin, also suppressed the growth of <italic>M</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> significantly, and this effect increased with the concentration of these compounds (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2015</xref>). Importantly, in the case of our study, the position of the substitution of the hydroxyl group is likely responsible for this effect, suggesting that this aspect is crucial for understanding the mechanism of interactions between chalcones and cyanobacterial species.</p><p id="Par54">Studying mentioned interactions, we observed that each of the tested hydroxychalcones was bioconverted, mainly into the corresponding hydrogenated derivative. Moreover, the processes of (bio)hydrogenation of the C=C bond in the three-carbon enone subunit of the hydroxylated chalcones were regiospecific and mainly proceeded by cyanobacterial transformation. This finding fully corresponds with the results of our previous study on the bio-reduction of chalcones (Żyszka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017a</xref>) and has important ecological implications because hydroxydihydrochalcones have approximately 15–20% lower inhibitory effects on the growth of cyanobacteria (data not presented). Therefore, this route of transformation may be considered a natural component of the cyanobacterial defence system since these organisms successfully faced dozens of extreme environmental stresses during evolution (Żyszka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2017b</xref>). This hypothesis is well-supported by the results of the present study because the most active growth inhibitor, 2″-hydroxychalcone, was converted with the highest yields. Thus, we confirmed that the inhibition of the growth of cyanobacterial cells supplemented with hydroxylated chalcones does not affect their activity as biocatalysts. This issue seems to be especially important, since whenever the substrates were available for cyanobacterial catalysis, bioconversion was highly efficient, with yields often above 99%. This finding is notable compared to the chemical hydrogenation of chalcones, which requires 24–48 h in an atmosphere of H<sub>2</sub> with the use of 10% Pd-C as a catalyst and EtOAc as a solvent. Although dihydrochalcones are obtained in good yields under these conditions (Vijaya Bhaskar Reddy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2017</xref>), the efficiency of these processes is far lower than hereby reported 99%, highlighting the value of the presented cyanobacterial catalytic systems. This biotechnological approach does not require chemical catalysts, which may be highly specific and therefore expensive (Luan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>). For comparison, biotransformation of 2′-hydroxychalcone by yeast strains and filamentous fungi cultures afford the corresponding dihydrochalcone with 2–98% substrate conversion (Janeczko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>). And transformation of another hydroxylated chalcone, chalconaringenin, in the culture of <italic>Rhodococcus</italic> sp. led to dihydrochalconaringenin (phloretin) in 84% yield (Stompor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par55">Remarkably lower efficiency of biotransformation of 2′-hydroxychalcone together with its weaker inhibitory action compared to 2″-hydroxychalcone drew our special attention. Basing on the results of our study, we concluded that the reason was the lack of bioavailability of 2′-hydroxychalcone, which tended to intramolecular isomerisation into flavanone. The effective chemical formation of flavanone from the initial chalcone proceeded under mild and totally environmentally friendly conditions (microbial media at room temperature) and thus may be considered a fully ‘green’ process. This rearrangement, however, was not the only side process with unexpected benefits. All examined strains turned out to have a tendency to purify, probably by utilisable absorption, the biotransformation media of small amounts of impurities that accompanied the substrates. In such circumstances, a simplified extraction of pure product together with the mild conditions of the process significantly supports the use of cyanobacterial biocatalysis in the hydrogenation of hydroxychalcones.</p><p id="Par56">The results presented have important implications when compared to those obtained during biotransformations of chalcone published previously (Żyszka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017a</xref>). The same strains of cyanobacteria transformed unsubstituted chalcone to its dihydroderivatives; however, only <italic>A</italic>. <italic>laxa</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aquatilis</italic> performed this transformation with high efficiencies similar to those of the corresponding conversion of 4″-hydroxychalcone. In the case of this compound, the routes and efficiency of biohydrogenation and hydroxylation were dependent on the presence and location of the hydroxyl substituent. This information strengthens our conclusions on the structural dependence of the biotransformations of chalcones and their derivatives by cyanobacteria. In this way, these results support the usefulness of these substances as molecular probes for more detailed studies of the enzymes responsible for these transformations. The existence of such enzymes in cyanobacterial cells and their catalytic mechanism has only been postulated (Fu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2013</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Funding information</title><p>This work was supported by Polish National Science Centre (NCN) grant number 2016/21/N/NZ9/02310.</p></sec><sec
