Here, a photovoltaic device based on a high-work-function metal/single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)/low-work-function metal hybrid junction was investigated. In the device, asymmetric metal electrodes (palladium and aluminum) were fabricated on opposite ends of a single semiconducting SWNT, which was used as the photosensitive material. This structure allowed a strong built-in electric field to be generated in the SWNT to efficiently separate photogenerated electron-hole pairs and achieve good photovoltaic effect. In the dark, the device behaved as a gate-dependent Schottky diode and exhibited the electrical characteristics of a rectifier. The SWNT diameter (band gap) was found to have a significant effect on the device characteristics. For the device fabricated with a 1.4-nm-diameter SWNT, a high rectification ratio (I<sub>forward</sub>/I<sub>reverse</sub>) of &gt;10<sup>3</sup> could be achieved in the dark.

Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) have excited much interest in the photovoltaic industry because their response to different light wavelengths can be tuned by varying the nanotube diameter. However, most SWNT-based solar cells have poor power conversion efficiencies because of the difficulty of creating a strong, built-in electric field for photocarrier in these highly uniform nanomaterials. Changxin Chen and co-workers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China have overcome this challenge with a device that suspends an SWNT between separate palladium and aluminum electrodes. The contacts with these metals, which hold on to their electrons with different strengths, transformed the SWNT into a diode that converted light into electricity with an impressive quantum efficiency of 75%.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs3" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par3">A photovoltaic device based on a high-work-function metal/single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT)/low-work-function metal hybrid junction was constructed to generate a strong built-in electric field in the SWNT for efficiently separating photogenerated electron-hole pairs.

in electronic and energy fields. The unique and excellent physical and mechanical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) make them good building blocks for photovoltaic devices.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> SWNTs have a direct band gap that increases with decreasing diameter, and they exhibit strong photoabsorption in the spectral range from ultraviolet to infrared. They also have a separated electronic sub-band structure, which can prevent the rapid relaxation of hot carriers, allowing more photogenerated carriers to be collected by the electrodes. Moreover, ideal SWNTs have defect-free structures and can greatly inhibit the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. In addition, they exhibit high carrier mobility and good mechanical strength. SWNTs have been used in some photovoltaic devices such as organic solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and dye-sensitized solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> to improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency. However, in these devices, SWNTs only acted as the conductive material or as the transparent electrode that conducted or collected the photogenerated charge carriers. The power conversion efficiency of these cells was low (~0.11%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> or was only slightly enhanced compared with that of the traditional cells without SWNTs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> To fully exploit the properties of SWNTs and produce high-performance photovoltaic devices, it is desirable to use SWNTs as the photosensitive material in the device.</p><p id="Par5">To achieve a photovoltaic effect, a photovoltaic device must have a strong built-in electric field to separate photogenerated electron-hole pairs. Methods that have been used to generate a built-in electric field within SWNT-based photovoltaic devices include split gates,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> chemical doping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and intramolecular junctions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> Because SWNTs have fully saturated surface bonds and no interface states, Fermi-level pinning at the SWNT/metal contact interface does not occur. Accordingly, a promising way to induce a built-in electric field in a SWNT is to contact the SWNT with metals that have different work functions. Not only does this method involve relatively simple fabrication processes, but it also results in fabricated devices with high operational stability.</p><p id="Par6">Here, a photovoltaic device based on a high-work-function metal/single SWNT/low-work-function metal configuration was investigated. In this device, Pd and Al contacts were fabricated on opposite ends of a single SWNT to form p-type and n-type Schottky contacts, respectively, resulting in a strong built-in electric field within the SWNT. The constructed device exhibited excellent rectification characteristics with a high rectification ratio of &gt;10<sup>3</sup> and acted as a tunable Schottky diode in the dark. Under monochromatic illumination by a 1550-nm laser at an intensity of ~4.8 W cm<sup>−2</sup>, the device had a power conversion efficiency of ~5% and a high quantum efficiency of ~75%. The band gap width affected the performance of this photovoltaic device significantly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental Procedure</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Preparation of the semiconducting SWNT solution</title><p id="Par7">The semiconducting SWNT solution (semiconductor purity ~98%) was prepared by a density gradient ultracentrifugation method using P2-SWNTs (Carbon Solutions, Inc., Riverside, CA, USA).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> The SWNTs (5 mg ml<sup>−l</sup>) were sonicated in a 2% sodium cholate (SC) aqueous solution in a horn sonicator at 8 W for 1 h. The SWNT suspension was subsequently centrifuged at 13 000 r.p.m. for 10 min to remove large SWNT bundles or particles. Then, the surfactant concentrations in the resulting SWNT solution were adjusted to 0.8% (w/v) SC and 0.2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate. A linear gradient maker was used to prepare a density gradient in the centrifuge tube with a linear iodixanol concentration gradient from 15% at the top to 30% at the bottom, while maintaining uniform surfactant concentrations of 0.8% (w/v) SC and 0.2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate. The SWNT solution with the same SC and sodium dodecyl sulfate concentrations was inserted below the gradient where the iodixanol concentration was 34%. The remainder of the centrifuge tube was filled with an overlayer consisting of 0.8% (w/v) SC and 0.2% (w/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (no iodixanol). The resulting gradient solution was centrifuged at 31 000 r.p.m. for 20 h. Then, the fractions in the centrifuge tube were extracted by a fractionator. Finally, the fractions were dialyzed to obtain the SWNT solutions with 1% SC. The enriched semiconducting SWNT fraction with a SWNT diameter range of 1.2–2.1 nm was identified for later device fabrications by measuring the ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared absorption spectrum of each fraction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Light-absorption measurements of the SWNTs</title><p id="Par8">The ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared absorption spectra of the SWNTs were measured using a Lambda 950 UV/Vis/NIR spectrometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA).

The SWNT solution was loaded into a capillary tube for the measurements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Fabrication of the photovoltaic devices</title><p id="Par10">The semiconducting SWNT solution was used to construct the photovoltaic device. The substrate consisted of a heavily n-doped silicon wafer with a 450-nm-thick thermal oxide layer. After removing the SiO<sub>2</sub> layer from the unpolished (back) side of the silicon wafer using an HF buffer solution (28 ml HF, 113 g NH<sub>4</sub>F, 170 ml H<sub>2</sub>O, pH 6), an Au film (200-nm thick) was sputtered onto the back of the silicon wafer to form a good contact on the silicon substrate to act as the back gate. Then, Au markers for the usage of the pattern overlay in e-beam lithography were pre-patterned on the polished side of the silicon wafer using standard UV lithography. The silicon substrate was subsequently cut into small square chips (1.5 cm × 1.5 cm) for further device fabrication.</p><p id="Par11">The devices were fabricated by the process shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. First, SWNTs were dispersed on the silicon chip by spin-coating a 7:1 isopropanol:water solution of SWNTs (5 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>) on it. Individual SWNTs with different diameters were identified by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and used to fabricate devices. The samples were considered to be individual SWNTs when the SWNT height was less than 2.3 nm. Then, Pd and Al electrodes (~100-nm thick) were fabricated on opposite ends of the SWNT by electron beam lithography and lift-off processes to form asymmetric contacts. Finally, the devices were annealed at 200 °C for 20 min under vacuum (~0.1 Pa) to improve the SWNT/metal contacts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>AFM characterization of the devices</title><p id="Par12">A Multimode NanoScope IIIa AFM (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) was used to obtain images of the devices and to measure the SWNT diameters.

The SWNT diameters were determined by AFM measurements of their heights. The strong van der Waals force between the SWNT and the substrate prevented the SWNT’s movement during the AFM measurement. On the basis of the SWNT diameter range and the van der Waals separation between the SWNT and the substrate (approximately 0.3 nm),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> it was assumed that each device consisted of a single SWNT, not a SWNT bundle, when the AFM height was smaller than 2.3 nm.</p><p id="Par18"><xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> shows the typical I-V characteristics of a device fabricated from a SWNT with a diameter of 1.6 nm and a channel length of ~1.2 μm (see <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>). This device exhibited diode-like electrical rectification behavior in the dark, that is, conduction under a forward bias and blocking under a reverse bias. Under forward bias conditions, the drain-to-source current of the device (I<sub>ds</sub>) increased considerably when the gate voltage (V<sub>g</sub>) was decreased from +15 V to −15 V (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2a and b</xref>). The I<sub>forward</sub>/I<sub>reverse</sub> ratio could be tuned from 10 to more than 500 by changing the gate voltage (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). The diode-like rectification behavior of the device was attributed to the formation of asymmetric Schottky barriers at the two SWNT/metal contacts. Pd has a high work function (5.12 eV), and its Fermi level is thought to be located at the top of the SWNT valence band.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> In contrast, Al has a work function of 4.2 eV, and its Fermi level is slightly lower than the bottom of the SWNT conduction band.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> As a result, a p-type ohmic contact and n-type Schottky contact were formed at the Pd and Al ends of the SWNT, respectively, and a built-in electric field was induced after equilibrium because of the different energy-level alignments at the Pd/SWNT and Al/SWNT contacts. The formation of different contact types at the SWNT ends was also demonstrated by the p-type or n-type field-effect transistor behavior exhibited by SWNTs with symmetric Pd or Al contacts, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). When a forward bias was applied, the holes and electron could readily pass through the Pd/SWNT and Al/SWNT interfaces, respectively (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>), generating a large forward current. When a reverse bias was applied, the high barriers at the Al/SWNT and Pd/SWNT contacts prevented the holes and electrons from entering the SWNT channel (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>), and thus, the current was blocked under reverse bias conditions.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Electrical characteristics of a device with asymmetric metal contacts, showing the rectification behavior.

Both the forward and reverse currents changed when the gate voltage applied to the device was varied. This result was attributed to the fact that the effective Schottky barrier height at the SWNT/metal interface can be altered by changing the gate voltage. For the device fabricated with a 1.6-nm-diameter SWNT shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d</xref>, the highest rectification ratio of 540 was achieved at a gate bias of approximately −6.0 V (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref>). The highest rectification ratio could be achieved at a suitable gate bias because of the band structure of the device. As shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref>, under forward bias conditions, decreasing the gate bias lowered the effective hole Schottky barrier height at the Pd/SWNT contact, which resulted in a rapid increase in the forward current. Under reverse bias conditions, the changes in the effective hole and electron barrier heights were small compared with their initial Schottky barriers when a relatively small negative gate bias was applied (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). Therefore, only a small change in the reverse current was observed. Thus, when the applied negative gate bias was small, the rectification ratio increased with decreasing gate bias. However, when the gate bias was decreased further, the hole Schottky barrier at the Al/SWNT contact became thin enough to allow the probability of the holes tunneling through the barrier to increase rapidly (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2d</xref>). Then, the reverse current increased more rapidly than the forward current, and the rectification ratio decreased accordingly.</p><p id="Par20">To determine the effect of the SWNT band gap on the device performance, devices were fabricated using SWNTs with different diameters and the same channel length (~1.0 μm), and their performances were compared. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3a and c</xref> show the AFM images of the devices fabricated using SWNTs with diameters of 1.4, 1.8 and 2.0 nm (the scanning electron microscope images of these devices are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>).

The rectification ratios were ~1012, 818 and 706 for the devices with SWNT diameters of 1.4, 1.8 and 2.0 nm, respectively. Thus, the device with the smaller SWNT exhibited the better rectification performance, indicating that it had a stronger built-in electric field, which would improve the photovoltaic effect of the device. As illustrated in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>, despite the difference in the SWNT band gaps (the SWNT band gap in the top device in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref> was larger than that in the bottom device), the Pd Fermi level was located at the top of the SWNT valence band, and the Al Fermi level was slightly lower than the bottom of the SWNT conduction band. Thus, a device fabricated with a SWNT with a larger band gap is expected to have a stronger built-in electric field at equilibrium owing to the larger difference between the Fermi levels of the two metal contacts in that device.</p><p id="Par22">Given that the strongest optical absorption was observed for the SWNT S<sub>11</sub> band, a 1550-nm laser (E<sub>photon</sub>=0.80 eV) was used to measure the photovoltaic performance of the fabricated devices. An optical image of a device under laser illumination is shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a</xref>. The intensity of the incident laser was approximately 4.8 W cm<sup>−2</sup>.

When the SWNT diameter was decreased to 1.8 nm, the photogenerated current was 5.12 pA, and the voltage was 0.045 V.

Evidently, a smaller SWNT diameter allowed the device to respond to laser illumination more intensely and generate a larger output power. The difference in the photovoltaic performances of the different devices was attributed to the larger band gap (E<sub>gap</sub>) of the SWNTs with smaller diameters, which is closer to the photon energy (E<sub>photon</sub>) of the irradiating laser, and the stronger built-in electric field in the devices with smaller SWNTs. When E<sub>photon</sub>&gt;E<sub>gap</sub>, decreasing E<sub>gap</sub> (that is, increasing the SWNT diameter) reduces the electron-photon scattering cross-section, resulting in an exponential decrease in the electron-hole generation probability despite a small linear increase in the light absorption area.
