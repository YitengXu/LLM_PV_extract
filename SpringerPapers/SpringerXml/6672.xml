Here, using few layer 2H-MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets, layer by layer process of nanocomposite fabrication, and strain engineering, we demonstrate a reversible and chromatic mechanical response in MoS<sub>2</sub>-nanocomposites between 405 nm to 808 nm with large stress release. The chromatic mechanical response originates from the <italic>d</italic> orbitals and is related to the strength of the direct exciton resonance A and B of the few layer 2H-MoS<sub>2</sub> affecting optical absorption and subsequent mechanical response of the nanocomposite. Applying uniaxial tensile strains to the semiconducting few-layer 2H-MoS<sub>2</sub> crystals in the nanocomposite resulted in spatially varying energy levels inside the nanocomposite that enhanced the broadband optical absorption up to 2.3 eV and subsequent mechanical response. The unique photomechanical response in 2H-MoS<sub>2</sub> based nanocomposites is a result of the rich <italic>d</italic> electron physics not available to nanocomposites based on <italic>sp</italic> bonded graphene and carbon nanotubes, as well as nanocomposite based on metallic nanoparticles. The reversible strain dependent optical absorption suggest applications in broad range of energy conversion technologies that is not achievable using conventional thin film semiconductors.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep34831.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>16</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep34831" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep34831</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ability to convert photons into mechanical motion is of significant importance for many energy conversion technologies. Establishing an optical-mechanical interface has been attempted since 1881 when A.G. Bell used the optoacoustic effect (photophone) to produce sound in a gas with chopped beam of sun light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. However, only few materials exist that can convert photons of different wavelengths into mechanical motion that is large enough for practical import. Examples of materials that can directly convert light of different wavelengths into mechanical motion include range of organic photochromic compounds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, lead-lanthanum-zirconate-titanate (PLZT) ceramics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, carbon nanotube polymer composites with selective chirality distributions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and more recently metallic nanoparticle-polymer composites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Photomechanical actuators, motors, and micro-walking devices based on these materials have also been developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In general, most photomechanical actuators based on sp bonded carbon namely nanotube/graphene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> are triggered mainly using near infra-red light and they do not exhibit wavelength selectivity. The mechanism in these nanocomposites is non-radiative decay of photons resulting in localized thermal effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. While, near infrared triggered mechanical response was recently reported in bulk MoS<sub>2</sub> nanocomposites prepared using a shear mixing process, these nanocomposites neither exhibit wavelength selectivity nor enabled phase separated and layered nanocomposite structure which can bring the more interesting and unique structure based chromatic optical absorption in these materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. While this field is growing rapidly with many applications reported from cantilever based photomechanical actuators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, photo-mechanical micro-grippers with milli-second (ms) time constants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, photo-thermal micro-pillar actuators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, micro-mirrors with large rotational angles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, nanopositioners<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and plastic motors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, there is still need for a material design that is simple, versatile, reversible, wavelength selective, scalable and encompasses large optical to mechanical stress response that is based on their unique structure based tunability in optical absorption at different wavelengths. Phase separated nanocomposites based on TMDs prepared using a layer by layer processing method may offer a new material design and approach for chromatic photomechanical actuation with large stress release owing to the van Hove singularities in the joint density of states in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum that could be useful in designing future wavelength selective reconfigurable technologies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p>Layered transition metal di chalcogenide (TMDs) provide intriguing opportunities to develop low cost, light and wavelength tunable stimuli responsive systems that are not possible with their conventional macroscopic counterparts. TMDs are stack of triple layers with transition metal layer between two chalcogen layers. While the atoms within the layers are chemically bonded using covalent bonds, the triple layers can be mechanically/chemically exfoliated due to weak van der Waals bonding between the layers. Due to the large optical absorption (~10<sup>7</sup>m<sup>−1 </sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>) in these materials, they are already being exploited for photocatalytic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, photoluminescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, photo-transistors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and solar cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> applications. Bulk form of MoS<sub>2</sub> has an indirect band gap of ~1.29 eV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and single layer has a band gap of 1.9 eV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The in-plane structure of MoS<sub>2</sub> is determined by strong covalent bonds resulting from the overlap between the 4d and 3p electron orbitals of Mo and S respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The elastic modulus and the breaking strength of an ideal defect-free single-layer MoS<sub>2</sub> is expected to be E<sup>2D</sup>/9, where E<sup>2D</sup> is the in-plane stiffness as per the theory of rupture and flow in solids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The ultra-high strength is generated from the p orbitals of the chalcogen atoms which generate the σ bonds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. The large breaking strength (capable of sustaining elastic deformation of 25% before failure)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> together with large band gap and strong light-matter interaction in these materials has resulted in plethora of investigation on electronic, optical and magnetic properties of such layered ultra-thin semiconductors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p>Utilizing exfoliated MoS<sub>2</sub>, unique layer by layer process of nanocomposite fabrication, and strain engineering, here we present direct chromatic mechanical response in MoS<sub>2</sub>-polymer nanocomposites between 405 nm–808 nm. The advantage of our fabrication methods are as follows: (1) liquid phase exfoliation process resulting in high quality few layers with distinctive direct electron transition peaks, (2) phase separated nanocomposite due to the layer by layer processing, (3) access to the unique layer dependent optical absorption properties of MoS<sub>2</sub> layers inside the nanocomposite, (4) the reported architectures enables the creation of spatially varying bandgap profiles of 2-D nanomaterials and study of resonance Raman scattering as a function of number of layers and (5) the design enables scalable and flexible process for developing stimuli responsive and energy conversion devices at macro, micro and nanoscopic length scales utilizing different polymeric systems. Further, the layer by layer process as reported here enables preservation of the intrinsic properties and eliminates environmental degradation effects such as oxidation. The reported photomechanical actuators based on this process not only showed strong and wavelength dependent light matter interaction in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, but also showed unexpected deviations. Not only, we found that the photo-thermal energy transduction from the MoS<sub>2</sub> crystals to the polymer chains is high resulting in high amplitudes of photomechanical actuation, it is also dependent on the wavelength of light and the photo-thermal actuation is better than graphene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and carbon nanotubes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, which is unexpected given the low thermal conductivity of the MoS<sub>2</sub> additives (52 W/m-K for few-layer MoS<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> versus 313 W/m-K for graphene thin films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(a)</xref> presents the lattice schematic and <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(b)</xref> honeycomb structure of the semiconducting phase of 2H-MoS<sub>2</sub>. In the 2H-MoS<sub>2</sub> lattice, each Mo atom is located at the center of a trigonal prism created by six S atoms. The lattice constant of 2H-MoS<sub>2</sub> was reported to be: <italic>a</italic> = <italic>b</italic> = 3.14 Å<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> and <italic>c</italic> = 12.3 Å<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. A single layer of 2H-MoS<sub>2</sub> is ~0.65 nm thick and can be exfoliated using scotch tape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and liquid phase exfoliation techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.

The insert in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(c)</xref> presents the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the HRTEM image indexing the crystallographic planes of the single layer 2H-MoS<sub>2</sub>. Small distortions and apparent non-uniform intensity distribution of the spots in FFT are due to a slight tilt of the flake with respect to the electron beam.

However, as the layers decrease in MoS<sub>2</sub>, the indirect band gap becomes so large that the material changes into a direct band gap semiconductor with Eg~1.9 eV(<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> with intrinsic photoluminescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

Three types of samples were prepared namely (a) bulk: sonicated for 7 hours and no centrifugation (b) intermediate: sonicated for 50 hours and centrifuged for 45–120 minutes and layers separated (c) few layers: well characterized commercially available few layers in ethanol was purchased. The samples were characterized for number of layers using an SEM (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(b–d)</xref>) and an AFM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1 Suppl.</xref>). It is observed that bulk samples had morphology of flakes (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>), while the intermediate was well separated crystals. The crystals were also large measuring almost 1 μm in size (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>) and the few layers were small in size measuring 100 nm in diameter (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref>). Further characterization for number of layers was done using an AFM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1 Suppl.</xref>). Three different regions were identified based on the Z-axis height measurements of the flakes using an AFM. Based on the number of layers, the suspensions were classified as bulk (100–500 layers), intermediate (10–30 layers) and few layers (1–6 layers) and henceforth the films and the nanocomposites made using these suspensions will be addressed as such throughout the paper.

For bulk nanocomposites, it is seen that power transmitted through the sample is similar irrespective of wavelength (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>). They also exhibited similar photo-mechanical actuation stress at all wavelengths (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref>). A photomechanical stress value of ~0.6 kPa was measured. In these nanocomposites, the photo-mechanical actuation is due to the non-radiative decay of photons resulting in similar thermal response at all wavelengths. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5(c)</xref> presents the power transmitted in the intermediate nanocomposites (10–30 layers) samples that suggest weak but selective absorption of light of different wavelengths. The corresponding photomechanical stress (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>) is also dependent on the wavelength of light and ~4.5 times larger than bulk nanocomposites (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(b)</xref>). The selective transmittance of light in these intermediate samples can be traced to the direct exciton peaks A and B indicated in magnified insert in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(c)</xref>. These two peaks were observed but weak in the intermediate samples. Correspondingly, the optical absorption and photomechanical response was also wavelength selective but the amplitude of mechanical response was small. Moving on to the few layer nanocomposites (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(e)</xref>), the power transmitted through the sample is observed to be highly dependent on the wavelength of light. Again, this can be related to the strength of the direct exciton peak A and B in the nanocomposites in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(c)</xref>. It is seen that the most of the IR is transmitted (~72%) (1.53 eV) through the sample whereas most of the UV (97%) is absorbed (3.0613 eV). The results suggest a direct bandgap dependent absorption in the nanocomposite due to the unique structure of the MoS<sub>2</sub> few layers. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5(f)</xref> presents the photomechanical actuation of the few layer (1–6 layers) nanocomposites. One can observe not only wavelength dependence but extraordinary increase in mechanical stress as large as 10 times (~5.5 kPa) at 405 nm wavelengths (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5f</xref>). The photomechanical stress of few layer nanocomposites at 808 nm (below the bandgap) was also similar to bulk suggesting no significant optical absorption. The photoactuation stress at 640 nm and 532 nm follow the same trend as the optical absorption. The mechanical response is seen to be strong and follows the light absorption at 640 nm, 532 nm and 405 nm. The mechanical response is also reversible as when the light is switched off irrespective of the wavelength of light, the system comes back to its original state or reversible switching with one type of wavelength. To compare, in Azobenzene chromophores, reversible switching is accomplished with two different wavelengths (420 nm and 365 nm) between an extended <italic>trans</italic> and a shorter <italic>cis</italic> configuration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photomechanical Actuation.</p><p>Power transmitted through the sample and the corresponding photomechanical actuation of nanocomposites at different wavelength of light respectively: (<bold>a,b</bold>) bulk consisting of 100–500 layers; (<bold>c</bold>,<bold>d</bold>) intermediate consisting of 10–30 layers and (<bold>e,f</bold>) few layers consisting of 1–6 layers.

However, the small weight fractions of the MoS<sub>2</sub> (0.1 wt. %) inside the optically transparent PDMS suggest most of the light may be transmitted through the sample rather than scattered. Further experiments were conducted to understand how optical absorbance, scattering and photomechanical response change with increase in weight fractions of bulk MoS<sub>2</sub>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S3 (suppl.)</xref> presents the photomechanical actuation of bulk nanocomposites with increasing weight percentage of MoS<sub>2</sub> additive. The transmitted power is also plotted on the same graph. An exponential decrease in transmittance is seen between 0.1 wt. % and 1 wt. % at all wavelengths. Above 1 wt. %, the power transmitted is almost zero suggesting strong light absorption. The rise in photomechanical actuation follows the same exact trend as the power absorbed by the sample. If the exponential decrease in transmittance in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S3 (suppl.)</xref> is as a result of dominant scattering with increase in weight fraction, this would result in significant decrease in photomechanical stress levels which is not observed. The insert in this <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S3</xref> presents the absorbance plot of the bulk nanocomposites with increase in weight fraction of MoS<sub>2</sub> additive. The A/l is seen to follow the photomechanical actuation stress amplitudes. The extinction, absorbance and photomechanical stress amplitudes all increase with increase in MoS<sub>2</sub> additive even for bulk over all the wavelength (300 nm to 1100 nm). Above 1 wt. % non-linear behavior is noted and saturation of optical absorption and photomechanical response. Thus we see two regimes in bulk nanocomposites. At low weight percentage of bulk MoS<sub>2</sub> additive (~0.1 wt. %), high light transmission through the sample and geometric scattering cause lower photomechanical response. However, as the weight fractions of bulk MoS<sub>2</sub> additive increases in the nanocomposite, optical absorption becomes dominant resulting in significant increase in photomechanical response. These results are also validated by the presence of van Hove singularity (peak L<sub>2</sub>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(a)</xref>) in the resonant Raman scattering experiments in bulk suggesting dominant absorption in these materials. It is interesting to note that, all the bulk samples irrespective of the weight fractions were insensitive to the wavelength of light suggesting the chromatic mechanical response is unique only to the few/intermediate-layer semiconducting structure of the 2H-MoS<sub>2</sub> originating in the <italic>d</italic> orbitals. The direct exciton transition peaks A and B is the origin of the chromatic mechanical response and the strength of the A and B peaks determines the power transmitted and the overall mechanical response in few layer and intermediate nanocomposites. Thus, this is a unique photomechanical effect not seen in any other type of actuator. The origin of the photomechanical effect is as a result of optical absorption aided by the unique structure of the additive and its integration with the polymer chains. This also compares well with the past reports in this area of carbon nanotube and graphene based photomechanical actuators, where strong <italic>sp</italic><sup>2</sup> bonds of nanocarbons resulted in large amplitudes of photomechanical response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.

In our few layer nanocomposites, applying global macroscopic uniaxial tensile strain of 10% using a custom made strain gadget (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S4 suppl.</xref>) resulted in the shift of the E<sub>2g</sub> mode by about−1.7 cm<sup>−1</sup> and negligible change in A<sub>1g</sub> as presented in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6(c)</xref>.

These results suggest that as MoS<sub>2</sub> layers in the nanocomposite were strained globally, a continuously varying strains developed inside the material resulting in more power being absorbed by the sample even at energies up to ~2.3 eV (higher than bandgap of single layers) that resulted in significantly better photomechanical response. It should be noted that although the design enables high strains to be applied to the sample, the strain transfer to the MoS<sub>2</sub> additives inside the sample is between 1–5% for all the strains applied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, not enough to cause failure/delamination that can change the optical absorption irreversibly. Since our samples consisted of layers of MoS<sub>2</sub> (1–6 layers) stacked on top of one another, stretching the sample globally must result in strain gradients and differential shift in the layers resulting in spatially varying energy levels of the stacked crystals that led to increase in optical absorption. Our results also suggest one can tune the power absorbed almost all wavelengths in the visible region in a macroscopic device with strains. Thus the strains, optical absorption and photomechanical response can be continuously, rapidly and reversibly tuned in these nanocomposites at different wavelengths and offers room for development of flexible energy harvesting devices in the future with advanced designs of our nanocomposites with scalability of localized strain engineering into macroscopic response. This does not happen in carbon nanotube<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, graphene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and gold nanoparticle based actuators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and thus is a unique photomechanical effect due to the rich d electron physics in TMDs.</p><p><xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure 7</xref> presents some figures of merit for the few layer nanocomposite actuators.

The efficiencies were calculated exactly as in our previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The increased thermal effect at higher energies decreased the efficiency slightly. However, these numbers are still impressive for photo generated work in polymers. In comparison, past–light driven actuators based on polyvinyledene difluoride (PVDF) have demonstrated an efficiency value of ~8.3 × 10<sup>−5</sup>% under quasi-static motion, about three orders of magnitude less efficient than our exfoliated MoS<sub>2</sub>-elastomer systems (~6 × 10<sup>−2</sup>%).

No pre-strains were applied to the sample. The slightly greater than ~3 kPa matches exactly the photomechanical actuation experiments presented in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(f)</xref> at 640 nm wavelength (the time delay between these experiments is ~3–6 months). It should also be noted that the long term experiments in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7(c)</xref> were conducted after the strain based optical absorption experiments presented in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6(d)</xref>. There are several conclusions that can be deduced from these long term experiments. First, the photomechanical actuation of the 2H-MoS<sub>2</sub> few-layer nanocomposite is fully reversible and robust actuation mechanism. Second, the strain based optical absorption experiments did not delaminate the interface/sample, which would otherwise cause an irreversible change in the amplitude of photomechanical actuation stress (a significant reduction in stress) due to increased scattering in these long term experiments. Third, the strain gradients on the MoS<sub>2</sub> crystals and the change in bandgap is also completely reversible as the sample exhibits pristine-like behavior (0% strain behavior) with the same amplitude of mechanical response in these long term experiments. The strain transfer to the MoS<sub>2</sub> additive is thus in line with previous reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and should be in between 1–5% in our samples at the highest strain applied to the nanocomposite, not enough to cause failure, delamination and degradation all of which will irreversibly change the long term photomechanical response. This also lends credence to the high strength of the few layer MoS<sub>2</sub> additive. Thus the high strength and strong light-matter interactions in 2H-MoS<sub>2</sub> giving rise to this robust chromatic mechanical response is not only a new mechanism but also a new material design for future macroscopic photo mobile polymer networks based on TMDs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Liquid Phase Exfoliation, Imaging and Optical Absorbance Spectroscopy</title><p>The bulk MoS<sub>2</sub> solution was obtained by 7-hour bath sonication of MoS<sub>2</sub> Ultrafine Powder obtained from Graphene Supermarket.

The few layer samples were bought from Graphene Supermarket in ethanol and used as such. The number of layers were characterized for each type of suspension using AFM. The AFM images were taken using a NaioAFM of Nanosurf in tapping mode with a cantilever resonance frequency of ~148 kHz. HRTEM was conducted using an FEI Tecnai transmission microscope (TM) (model G2 F20). FFT was obtained from the HRTEM image. The operating voltage was set at 200 kV. The sample was prepared by dropping one drop of exfoliated MoS<sub>2</sub> in ethanol solution on lacey-carbon Cu grids (Ted Pella Inc., CA). The Cu grids were dried in air to make sure there are sufficient isolated flakes to be observed.

Using this solution, 2 mL of MoS<sub>2</sub> in ethanol is then used (200 μg MoS<sub>2</sub>) for vacuum filtration process resulting in a mass per area of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles of 0.18601 g/m<sup>2</sup> on filter membrane (Whatman Anodisc). Area is calculated based on the diameter of the deposited film. Here 47 mm diameter Anodisc membrane after vacuum filtration resulted in 37 mm diameter of deposited mass. This resulted in 0.18601 g/m<sup>2</sup>. This layer is then transferred to an 80 μm thick PDMS layer and then another layer of 80 μm thick PDMS is spun coated on top of this layer. The mass of the two layers of PDMS is then measured by cutting known areas of the neat PDMS (i.e. the clear part without any MoS<sub>2</sub>) and calculating the mass/area of PDMS layers. This process is repeated several times for each sample to get averages.

PDMS silicone elastomer obtained from Dow Corning (Sylgard 184) was used as the host matrix. PDMS is a two part solvent-free flexible silicone organic polymer in the form of a base compound with a separate hydrosilane curing agent that acts as a cross-linker. The term cross-linking ratio (CLR) used throughout the paper refers to the ratio of PDMS cross-linker to the base compound. The PDMS base was mixed in 1:10 ratio to the cross-linker and then deposited on a glass slide. A standard spin coating process at 750 rpm for 90 seconds produces 80 μm thick film of PDMS on the glass slides. The films are then cured at 120 °C for 20 minutes and post-cured for 12 hours at room temperature. A uniformly distributed layer of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles deposited on Whatman Anodisc inorganic membrane using a standard vacuum filtration process is then transferred into the first layer of PDMS. Another layer of PDMS is then spin coated and cured on top of the MoS<sub>2</sub> layer resulting in a layer-by-layer structure of about 160 μm thick. The samples are then cut in 50 mm × 5 mm strips (30 mm of active test area with 10 mm on each side for fixture mounting). All experiments were conducted in a climate-controlled laboratory. The photomechanical testing system, strain application, lasers all form an automated system that is placed inside a black box to avoid stray light from interfering the experiments.
