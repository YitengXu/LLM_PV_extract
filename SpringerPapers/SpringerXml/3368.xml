Yet the catalyst and reaction interface designs for directly fixing permanent gases (e.g. CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>) into liquid fuels are still challenged by slow mass transfer and sluggish catalytic kinetics at the gas-liquid-solid boundary. Here, we report that gas-permeable metal-organic framework (MOF) membranes can modify the electronic structures and catalytic properties of metal single-atoms (SAs) to promote the diffusion, activation, and reduction of gas molecules (e.g. CO<sub>2,</sub> O<sub>2</sub>) and produce liquid fuels under visible light and mild conditions. With Ir SAs as active centers, the defect-engineered MOF (e.g. activated NH<sub>2</sub>-UiO-66) particles can reduce CO<sub>2</sub> to HCOOH with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 2.51% at 420 nm on the gas-liquid-solid reaction interface. With promoted gas diffusion at the porous gas-solid interfaces, the gas-permeable SA/MOF membranes can directly convert humid CO<sub>2</sub> gas into HCOOH with a near-unity selectivity and a significantly increased AQE of 15.76% at 420 nm. A similar strategy can be applied to the photocatalytic O<sub>2</sub>-to-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> conversions, suggesting the wide applicability of our catalyst and reaction interface designs.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Photoreduction of permanent gas faces challenges in reactant diffusion and activation at the three-phase interface.

Resembling the functionalities of green leaves, interdisciplinary researchers have developed various photosynthetic systems across the natural–artificial spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Although a solar-to-electric energy conversion rate of over 20% can be achieved by inorganic photovoltaic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, abiotic photosynthetic systems that can fix naturally abundant permanent gases (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>) into value-added liquid fuels still face challenges in productivity and selectivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">First, challenged by the large kinetic barriers, both homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalysts feature inherent advantages and trade-offs for such applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. On one hand, homogeneous catalysts possess highly dispersed and accessible active sites with accurately tailored structures for specific reactions but poor product isolation and/or long-term stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. On the other hand, conventional heterogenous approaches exhibit enhanced product separation, but suffer from smaller active surface areas and limited accessibility to the active sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. One promising strategy bridging homogeneous and heterogeneous photocatalysis is to develop catalysts with atomically dispersed active centers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, which can significantly improve the accessibility and utilization of catalytic sites while facilitate the separation of products. For instance, photocatalysts with atomically dispersed active centers can effectively reduce CO<sub>2</sub> to CO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, suggesting the advantages of such single-atom photocatalysts (SAPCs); while systematic studies are still in great need to reveal the mechanism for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> on single-atomic sites to produce a much wider range of value-added products (e.g., hydrocarbons, alcohols, and carboxylates, etc.) with higher selectivity and efficiency.</p><p id="Par5">Second, the efficiency for reducing such permanent gas is further limited by the gas–liquid–solid reaction interface. The traditional photocatalytic interface design with dissolving or submerging catalysts in aqueous solutions is optimal for reactions involving only liquid reactants (e.g., water splitting)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The limited solubility and sluggish diffusion kinetics of permanent gas in aqueous solutions strongly retard the following catalytic conversion on the heterogeneous reaction interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In addition, the overwhelming competitions from water adsorption on the flooded catalyst surface further suppress the reduction of gas molecules with the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Consequently, photoreduction of insoluble and stable gas molecules on the three-phase catalysis interface inevitably confronts three formidable challenges: (i) the kinetically hindered diffusion, (ii) the sluggish surface adsorption, and (iii) the inefficient activation and catalytic conversion of the gas reactants. Fabricating films of stacked nanoparticles, including solid semiconductors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and catalyzing photocatalytic gas reduction on the gas-solid interfaces with water vapor as proton sources could partially solve the mass transfer limitation by avoiding the water flooding of the catalyst surface. However, such systems still suffer from slow mass transfer with the only driving force from spontaneous thermal motions of gaseous molecules. Therefore, to further promote the photoreduction of permanent gas to storable and portable chemical fuels, advanced photocatalytic systems should consist of both highly dispersed active sites lowering the reaction energy barriers and high-throughput reaction interfaces, with large surface areas boosting the diffusion of gaseous reactants to the active sites.</p><p id="Par6">MOFs, an emerging class of porous crystalline materials with large surface areas, high porosity, and tunable functionalities, prove to be a promising candidate for heterogeneous photocatalytic reductions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, showing great potential for solving the aforementioned challenges in both reaction kinetics and mass transfer process. Here, combining the advantages of porous MOF substrates and single-atom (SA) catalytic centers, we introduce gas-permeable membranes consisting of structurally tailored SA/MOFs particles for high-efficiency and high-throughput photocatalytic gas reduction reactions (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a, b</xref>). Single-atom iridium (Ir<sub>1</sub>) and palladium (Pd<sub>1</sub>) are anchored on the MOF nodes to serve as the catalytic hydrogenation centers for CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The defect-engineering of MOF matrix can not only enhance their light harvesting capability but also tailor the chemical structures of their oxide nodes (e.g., the Zr–O notes of NH<sub>2</sub>-UiO-66) to finely control their interactions to the introduced metal single atoms (SAs). The activated NH<sub>2</sub>-UiO-66 (denoted as A-aUiO hereafter) substrate can tailor the electronic structures of the supported metal species to enhance their catalytic reactivity. For instance, with stronger meal-supporter interactions (SMSI), Ir<sub>1</sub>/A-aUiO exhibited a near-unity HCOOH evolution selectivity in photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, while Ir nanoparticles supported by A-aUiO (IrNPs/A-aUiO) showed a much lower HCOOH selectivity of 16.5%. Moreover, the high porosity of SA/MOF membranes allows the creation of gas-membrane-gas (GMG) configuration, which boosts the high-throughput diffusion of humid CO<sub>2</sub> to the metal SAs located at the vast gas-solid reaction interfaces within the interconnected MOF pores. Compared with the traditional gas–liquid–solid reaction interface, such high-throughput gas–solid interface design can significantly increase the availability of gaseous reactants in the vicinity of each catalytic centers (e.g., SAs). Consequently, bridging advanced catalytic center and reaction interface designs, our Ir<sub>1</sub>/A-aUiO membranes can catalyze the CO<sub>2</sub>-to-HCOOH photoreduction with near-unity selectivity and a HCOOH activity of 3.38 mmol g<sub>cat</sub><sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup> (the term “cat” refers to the hybrid metal species and supporters, such as metal/MOFs and metal/oxides, hereafter), exceeding 6.5 and 338 times that of the Ir<sub>1</sub>/A-aUiO particles and the IrNPs/A-aUiO particles, respectively.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, bare A-aUiO showed no observable CO<sub>2</sub>RR activity. The IrNPs/A-aUiO catalysts (with an optimized metal loading content of 4.0 wt%, Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">23</xref>) exhibited a HCOOH generation activity of 10 µmol g<sub>cat</sub><sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup> (i.e., 10 µmol of HCOOH per gram of metal/A-aUiO catalysts per hour) with a poor selectivity of only 16.5% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24</xref>). The Ir<sub>x</sub>/A-aUiO samples, containing both Ir clusters and SAs, showed higher HCOOH evolution activity (0.16 mmol g<sub>cat</sub><sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup>) and selectivity (79.8%) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c, d</xref>). In sharp contrast, the 0.7 wt% Ir<sub>1</sub>/A-aUiO catalysts exhibited a HCOOH generation rate of 0.24 mmol g<sub>cat</sub><sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup> with a high selectivity of 96.3%. Increasing the Ir SAs loading to 1.4 wt% elevate the HCOOH activity to as high as 0.51 mmol g<sub>cat</sub><sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup> with a near-unity selectivity (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">26</xref>). The significant differences in CO<sub>2</sub>RR reactivity among iridium SAs, clusters, and NPs (all supported by A-aUiO) suggested that the chemical structures of Ir species and their interactions with the A-aUiO hosts played a critical role in the selective photoreduction of CO<sub>2</sub> to HCOOH. Compared with Ir clusters and nanoparticles, the Ir SAs were more positively charged (+3 to +4) as revealed by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">27</xref>). Such differences in electronic structures may thereby result in their different catalytic reactivity. According to the Arrhenius plots (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>), the Ir<sub>1</sub>/A-aUiO catalyst showed much lower apparent activation energy (<italic>E</italic><sub>app</sub>) for HCOOH evolution (9.8 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup>) than Ir<sub>x</sub>/A-aUiO (25.1 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup>) and IrNPs/A-aUiO (55.6 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup>), suggesting the much faster CO<sub>2</sub>RR kinetics on Ir<sub>1</sub>/A-aUiO under similar conditions. Thus, the SMSI could substantially modulate the electronic structures of Ir species, and the positively charged Ir SAs presented the best CO<sub>2</sub>RR activity and selectivity targeting HCOOH production.</p><p id="Par12">The reaction route for CO<sub>2</sub>RR on the Ir<sub>1</sub>/A-aUiO catalyst was further studied by isotope-labeled mass spectroscopy (MS) and in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). As revealed by the electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">28</xref>), H<sup>13</sup>COO<sup>−</sup> was the only reduction product when <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> was used as feed gas, confirming that the formates were generated from photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub>RR exclusively. Additionally, as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29</xref>, FTIR peaks (at 1497 and 1433 cm<sup>–1</sup>) of the surface carbonic acid species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, the intermediate species for formic acid evolution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, were immediately observed when humidified CO<sub>2</sub> was fed into the reactors containing Ir<sub>1</sub>/A-aUiO or A-aUiO catalysts in dark, indicating the adsorption of CO<sub>2</sub> by the hydroxyls on the Zr–O nodes of A-aUiO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. The reactors were then purged with Ar to remove the excess CO<sub>2</sub>. Under visible light irradiation, new infrared peaks (at 2920, 2850, and 1576 cm<sup>–1</sup>) were observed on the Ir<sub>1</sub>/A-aUiO catalyst (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">30a</xref>), suggesting the formation of HCOO* species upon irradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. To the contrary, no significant HCOO* peaks could be found in the FTIR spectra for the bare A-aUiO particles (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">30b</xref>). In addition, as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>, the conduction band of A-aUiO (–0.60 V vs. NHE) is located more negative than the standard electrode potential of CO<sub>2</sub>/HCOOH (–0.37 V vs. NHE)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Therefore, a plausible reaction route for photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub>RR on Ir<sub>1</sub>/A-aUiO would be: the CO<sub>2</sub> molecules were first adsorbed by the A-aUiO to form surface carbonic acid species, and then hydrogenated on the Ir<sub>1</sub> catalytic centers with photogenerated electrons provided by the A-aUiO matrix and protons (from water) to form HCOOH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, the photo-generated holes could be reduced by the sacrifice agent (i.e., isopropanol, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31</xref>) to facilitate the transfer of electrons to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> species. Interestingly, similar photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub>RR route for HCOOH production can be also enabled on other Ir<sub>1</sub>/MOF catalysts. For instance, NH<sub>2</sub>-MIL-125(Ti) ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> (aMIL) decorated by Ir SAs (Ir<sub>1</sub>/aMIL, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">32</xref>) showed significantly higher CO<sub>2</sub>RR activity than the pristine aMIL components. Under visible light irradiation, the HCOOH evolution rates were 0.27 and 0.013 mmol g<sub>cat</sub><sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup>, with the <italic>E</italic><sub>app</sub> of 20.1 and 58.7 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup>on Ir<sub>1</sub>/aMIL and bare aMIL, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">33</xref>). Therefore, the synergy between the MOF matrix and the Ir SA active centers contributes to CO<sub>2</sub>RR for HCOOH evolution with high activity and selectivity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Reaction interface design</title><p id="Par13">Along with the catalytic center optimization, fabricating porous SA/MOF membranes allows us to build novel gas–solid reaction interfaces that can break the mass transfer limitation for gas reactants to further promote CO<sub>2</sub>RR.

The increase of CO<sub>2</sub> availability and the reverse of CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O ratio in the SA/MOF membranes would thus dramatically enhance the CO<sub>2</sub>RR activity in a wide range of CO<sub>2</sub> flow rates (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). For instance, with the CO<sub>2</sub> flow rate fixed at 120 standard cubic centimeters per minute (sccm), the Ir<sub>1</sub>/A-aUiO membrane exhibited a HCOOH yield of 3.38 mmol g<sub>cat</sub><sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup> (i.e., 3.38 mmol of HCOOH per gram of Ir<sub>1</sub>/A-aUiO catalysts per hour) in the GMG mode, exceeding more than six times that showed by Ir<sub>1</sub>/A-aUiO particles (0.51 mmol g<sub>cat</sub><sup>–1</sup> h<sup>–1</sup>) in the PiS mode (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).

These significant differences in enhancement factors for CO<sub>2</sub>RR on MOF membranes, and solid films may arise from their markedly different mass transfer and photoelectron deliver efficiencies (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b, c</xref>). Thanks to the high porosity and open pore structure of MOF matrixes, the diffusion of CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O molecules from gas phase to the highly dispersed active centers would be efficient in high throughput (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">45</xref>). The delivery of photoelectrons from the local ligands to the active sites also not be hindered by stacking SA/MOF particles.

The decrease in catalyst activity would be possibly caused by the impurities in tap water or rainwater (e.g., Cl<sup>–</sup>, ClO<sup>–</sup> and other ions), which may poison the active centers. However, using the naturally purified water vapor as proton sources could effectively avoid the poisoning of catalyst from such impurities, and ensure the HCOOH yield despite the types of water sources.

On one hand, like molecular catalysts, the explicit structures for the highly dispersed photocatalyst modules (ligand–node–SA) allow us to modify their light harvesting, electron delivery, and catalytic conversion properties with atomic precision. On the other hand, the porous but rigid MOF crystals hold all the nanoreactors together via stable coordination bonds with interconnected pores, ensuring the high stability, dispersity, and accessibility of the atomically dispersed catalytic centers. Especially, starting with humidified gas instead of gas solutions, the novel GMG reaction interfaces not only facilitate the diffusion of gas molecules but also eliminate the competitive adsorption of liquid water, which is inevitable in conventional three-phase photocatalytic gas reduction reactions. The substantial increase in local concentration and molar ratio of gas reactants in the vicinity of each catalytic center, thereby promote the activity and selectivity of photocatalytic reduction of gas molecules significantly.</p><p id="Par19">In practice, our SA/MOF membranes can directly reduce CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> into value-added and ready-to-use chemical fuels (i.e., HCOOH and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). With specifically designed catalytic centers, the major components of air (CO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and even N<sub>2</sub>) could be fixed via sustainable photocatalytic reactions, with water vapor as proton donors under mild conditions to convert and store the intermittent solar energy. The facile preparation of SA/MOF membranes facilitates the scale-up of such photocatalysis devices, and the minimized usage of water vapor saves the cost of freshwater in arid regions with rich solar powers. Our work provides a general and programmable strategy bridging photocatalysis center, and reaction interface designs to solve the complexity for mass transfer and catalytic conversion in three-phase photocatalytic reactions. The powerful toolbox in single-atom and MOF chemistry endows us with almost infinite possibilities to engineer the chemical structures of SA/MOF membranes. Such design may find wider applicability in more substantial heterogeneous reactions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Preparation of NH<sub>2</sub>-UiO-66 (aUiO) particles</title><p id="Par20">In a typical synthesis, 10 mg of anhydrous zirconium chloride (ZrCl<sub>4</sub>) was dissolved in 5 mL of N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) in a 20 mL glass vial.
