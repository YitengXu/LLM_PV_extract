id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Biomimicry is described simplified as imitation of nature for the purpose of solving human problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Many seek relaxation of their stressful daily lives outside. The beauty and harmony of nature offers rest and recuperation. Looking more consciously, one can find interesting similarities between environment and everyday life. Famous are certainly the inspirations from bur fruits for the Velcro tape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] or morpho butterflies for the Mirasol display [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Fascinating is also the wall adhesion of geckos which stimulated the StickyBot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Besides special products there are other omnipresent circumstances where nature seem to be mimicked.</p><p id="Par3">In <italic>evolution</italic>, learning relates experience which is familiar from population growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Most populations follow a logistic model which shows an inflection point at maximum growth rate. Transferred to technological progress that might indicate maturity which triggers further developments. Typical industry ramp-up curves support that analogy. Living together requires mutual understanding. <italic>Synergy</italic> in teamwork merges individual performances; like between bee and flower [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Manufacturing of microchips and solar panels finds commonalities in semiconductors. Going forward, <italic>symbiosis</italic> is a partnership with reciprocal benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Like between clownfish and anemone one might consider a joint venture a fortunate arrangement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Particularly in emerging markets such business model is applied to ease new commerce. Natural structures, like minerals, are stable material modifications. For photovoltaic applications the chalcopyrite-type seriously evolved as an <italic>adaptation</italic> in solar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The conversion of light energy with different thermodynamics is key in biological photosynthesis and artificial photovoltaics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Consanguinity</title><p id="Par4">The property of being from the same kinship is the quality of being descended from the same ancestor. In a wider sense certain relations between nature and technology are similar dependencies.</p><p id="Par5"><italic>Evolution</italic> is in simple terms the gradual development of something [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Life is complex but the sigmoid curve is useful to catch complicated relationships. Many natural and artificial processes follow a characteristic, stretched and tilted, s-shape curve as shown as taijitu symbol and as learning curve in the first figure.</p><p id="Par6">The taijitu diagram in Chinese philosophy represents both, monist (wuji, literally “without ridgepole”) and dualist (yin and yang, literally “dark-bright”) aspects. It was first introduced by the Song dynasty and has been extensively studied during the Qing period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It has many variants and the modern symbol combines two interlocking spirals and two dots. It can be constructed from five circles or be described as two twisted fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To define exactly the two concepts of yin and yang is difficult because they are used for a wide variety of things and there is no exact definition. The easiest way to describe the two terms is at their earliest historical mention, the I Ching (Book of Changes). In it, yang and yin are associated with the adjectives strong and weak, equal and unequal, as well as male and female. This was generalized later to the idea that yin and yang were terms for feminine and masculine, and then more generally for polarity itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Marcel Granet refines it as a rather relative, rhythmic opposition between two rival but related groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Yin and yang refers to opposites in their interrelatedness as a totality, an eternal cycle. Therefore, they can be used to explain process changes, reciprocal limitations and returns of things.</p><p id="Par7">An example from nature is sex segregation during evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A detailed discussion would go well beyond the scope of this article. However, it should at least be said that the separation advantage lies in the mixture of genetic material and thus genetic diversity. This facilitates adaptation to changing environments. It is also economical to limit this to two sexes whereby the female has a special role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">An example from technology is an engineering company [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Production and development are the core of business. A typical issue is seen at technology scaling. Development aims potentials and production targets averages. It is important to balance both for business success. Whenever one partner gets the upper hand, trouble is inevitable. But key performance indicators and technology readiness levels can help with the balancing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The learning curve is a graphical representation of how an increase in learning comes from greater experience. There are basically two phases around the inflection point: acceleration before and deceleration after. Accordingly, the derivative indicates maximum speed at phase transition. Alternative representations of the sigmoid function show activity versus time. One recognizes the similarities to the taijitu. All things occur in cycles with a certain symmetry. The starting phase may also show a decline indicating learning loss through confusion. The like is true for the ending phase where downturn may occur instead of maturation in case of chaos. Crucial is to recognize the inflection point to anticipate the demand for change to sustain growth. Subsequent curves may be influenced by evolution or revolution which alters shape and superposition. The s-curve has also great forecasting powers for growth or decline in competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Obviously, it is not always easy to identify the proper indicators in complex systems.</p><p id="Par10">An example from nature is population growth towards environmental capability: increasing/decreasing births with abundant/scarce resources. Limits can be stretched with vaccinations, fertilizers or alike but resistances or depletions need to be carefully taken into account. Factors like migration, predation or competition also impact. To live with and not against nature is the way to go. The United Nations prospects that the world’s population could stabilize or even begin to fall sometime before the turn of this century at just over eleven billion people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Social structures might change globally. It is also noteworthy that the numbers of men and women remains roughly equal at varying age distributions.</p><p id="Par11">An example from technology is product development towards manufacturing capability: increasing/decreasing products with abundant/scarce capacities. Obviously, markets drive productions. Margins can be stretched with outsourcing, upgrades or similar but knowledge or investments should be diligently considered. Factors like durability, compatibility and popularity also matter. It is important to timely recognize market trends. For decades the semiconductor industry was geared to Moore’s law which states that the number of transistors in integrated circuits doubles about every 2 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This corresponds to the linear phase around the turning point (dashed line). Meanwhile billions of transistors are found in microchips; still orders of magnitude away from the number of nerve cells in the human brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. But singularity may be close [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Robert Colwell boldly forecasts an end to the scaling law in about 3 years at the seven nanometer node [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These are feature sizes close to the diameter of deoxyribonucleic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, Moore’s law was born with complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor technology. New device designs, fabrication routes as well as market demands may stretch the current trend or even start a new technology curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].<fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><caption xml:lang="en"><p>First figure: taijitu symbol (left) and learning curve (right) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42452_2019_811_Figa_HTML.png" position="anchor" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par12">Partnership can be liaison. When cooperating/collaborating, parties perform/work together, they co-operate/-labor, on a selfish/single yet common/shared goal in competition/harmony. Partners are manifold from individuals to collectives or combinations.</p><p id="Par13">A paraphrase of the term <italic>synergy</italic> is Aristotle’s thesis: [The whole is more than the sum of its parts] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Holism is based on this thesis. In other words it means “working together” leads to accomplishment. Synergies are examined interdisciplinary in synergetics. The terms originate from greek language and first appeared in the field of physiology since at least the middle of the nineteenth century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Synergistic phenomena are ubiquitous and include natural, human and social sciences. A popular example in chemistry is water, a molecule binding together hydrogen and oxygen atoms. A theoretical understanding of chemical bonding is only possible on the basis of quantum mechanics. Such covalent tie is explained by electron sharing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This division principle may also be applied to other partnerships such as between insects and plants as well as between microchips and photovoltaics as shown in the second figure.</p><p id="Par14">An example from nature is the relationship between bee and flower where pollen is shared; on one hand as seed and on the other side as food. Pollen is in the broadest sense the plant’s sperm and rich of proteins. Sharing the powdery substance is essential for both species to survive. Observed more closely, one sees that the bee also takes the flower’s nectar with mainly carbohydrates as food, while the pollen remains attached and accumulates in pallets at their legs. At every flower visit, the bee loses some pollen and pollinates another flower so that it can replicate. This is called zoophilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In the hive, nectar becomes honey and pollen turns into beebread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The bee is many millions of years old and thus underscores the stability of this synergy; a form of reproductive symbiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">An example from technology is the relationship between integrated circuits and solar cells where semiconductors are shared; on one hand in transistors and on the other side in diodes. Semiconductors are solids whose conductivity can be tuned between conduction and isolation. Sharing the advanced material is essential for both devices to perform. More particularly, it appears that transistors are more complex than diodes. The former is a four-terminal and the latter is a two-terminal electronic component. The heart of each is the semiconductor junction (dashed line) where two differently doped regions are present within the same crystal. The behavior of charge carriers at these interfaces is the basis of all modern electronics. The most prominent semiconductor is silicon which does not occur in elemental form in nature. Both devices also involve conductors for wiring and insulators to protect shorts. Typical materials are aluminum and silica, respectively. A field effect transistor regulates the electric current; and a photodiode converts light into electricity. Both require high-purity materials and clean working conditions. Many processes are alike and allow similar equipments and production flows. As mentioned above, Moore’s law has impressively helped to roadmap microchips but there is no similar shrinkage in photovoltaics. However, a commonality is seen in cost reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Swanson’s law is the observation that the price of photovoltaic modules tends to drop 20% for every doubling of cumulative shipments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Meanwhile module costs are at some Eurocents per Watt at hundreds of Gigawatts shipped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Until now, Moore has been confirmed for more than half a century, and Swanson for more than a decade.<fig id="Figb" position="anchor"><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Second figure: bee-flower synergy (left) and semiconductor devices (right) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42452_2019_811_Figb_HTML.png" position="anchor" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par16">The modern term for <italic>symbiosis</italic> is simply “living together” and matches the greek translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. It contrasts synergy by a tighter scope. Symbionts are living beings using their synergies. In symbioses which differ considerably by size, the larger partner is often called host and the smaller one as symbiont. Most biomass on earth consists of symbiotic systems of pro- and eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. An economic relationship between companies and their people may also be regarded as a kind of symbiosis as today’s work-life-balance is a concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The third figure shows the cohabitation of animals and humans.</p><p id="Par17">An example from nature is the anemone–clownfish relationship where mainly protection is the driver. The host anemone and the guest clownfish benefit mutual enemy defense. The anemone provides the clownfish protection against predators with its poisonous nettle cells. The clownfish in turn defends the anemone from invaders by attack and keeps its tentacles clean. Clownfish excretions can benefit the anemone. It has also been found that the clownfish at night fans water to the anemone and thus improves its oxygen supply [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. A clownfish gets its anemone in its earliest days. By careful rubbing on the anemone’s tentacles the clownfish acquires a chemical signature so that host trusts guest. Similar to the bees and flowers, both partners remain physically separated what is called ectosymbiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The clownfish–anemone symbiosis has many more special features. For one thing, clownfish are always born as males and can later convert to leader females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. On the other hand, sea anemones are plant and animal at the same time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Clown fish and sea anemones have developed an exceptional longevity. Some fishes survive decades and anemones an order of magnitude longer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">An example from technology is the parent-subsidiary company relationship where predominantly competitiveness is the motivator. The host–parent company and the guest subsidiary firm benefit mutual market share. Business partnerships highlight three commercial models with different degree of fabrication outsourcing (blackened areas), namely “fab integrated”, “fab lite” and “fab less”. Each has its benefits and drawbacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The “fab integrated” has full control over its technology roadmap but runs the risk of misinvestments in case of changing markets. That underlines technology leadership and capital strength. The “fab lite” model has partial control over its technology roadmap with access to alternative process routes but still sees some risk for market drifts. This looks like a venturesome undertaking at reduced investment risk. Many joint ventures follow this business model together with foundry partners. Turnkey projects lie somehow in-between “fab lite” and “fab integrated” because ownership changes from joint to sole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The “fab less” approach has no control over its technology roadmap with benefits of state-of-the-art external process routes but suffers foundry dependencies with their market orientations. That approach requires highest adaptability for design and marketing at a more limited capital base. Current trends indicate more and more success of “fab less” semiconductor companies whereas corresponding photovoltaic firms are still rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The former meanwhile focus on component solutions whereas the latter still aim at system designs. Capital expenditure is also an order of magnitude higher for computer chips compared to solar modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Last year the top fifteen ranking of semiconductor suppliers included one pure-play foundry and four “fab less” companies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].<fig id="Figc" position="anchor"><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Third figure: clownfish–anemone symbiosis (left) and business partnerships (right) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42452_2019_811_Figc_HTML.png" position="anchor" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par19">A broad definition of <italic>adaptation</italic> is something that is produced to fit different purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Like synergy and symbiosis, adaptation is another technical term also used in evolution. Solid is one of the four fundamental states of matter besides liquid, gas and plasma. The physical state is characterized by its structural rigidity. Atoms are densely packed, regularly or irregularly. The former is called crystalline, the latter amorphous. These materials exhibit a long- or short-range order of atoms, respectively. Whether a solid is crystalline or amorphous depends on the material involved and the conditions in which it was formed. The forces between atoms, molecules or ions can take a variety of forms ranging from strong to weak chemical bondings. The associated solid-state structures are just as varied. These diversifications have led to an extensive classification of solids. The fourth figure depicts macroscopic appearance and microscopic details of a mineral which can become a semiconductor just by changing its composition.</p><p id="Par20">An example from nature is the chalcopyrite mineral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. The covalent solid has the chemical formula CuFeS2 and belongs to the mineral class of sulfides and sulfosalts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Crystallographic data include the tetragonal crystal system and the four formula units per unit cell. Sulfur atoms are surrounded by two copper and two iron atoms, each at the corners of a nearly regular tetrahedron. And each metal atom is surrounded by four nonmetal atoms. Most crystalline solids in nature are polycrystalline. The polycrystalline structure is therefore often not mentioned but assumed as normal case. Physical properties are, for example, the gold to brass yellow color, metallic luster and opaque transparency. The occurrence is widespread and makes it one of the most important copper ores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The use is mainly as a raw material and occasionally as gem stone.</p><p id="Par21">An example from technology is the copper indium gallium selenide semiconductor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The covalent solid has the chemical formula CuInxGa(1 − x)Se2 and belongs to the compound semiconductor family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Crystallographic data is closely related to the chalcopyrite mineral: sulfur atoms are replaced by selenium atoms and iron atoms are replaced by indium or gallium atoms. It is a mixed crystal of copper indium selenide, CuInSe2 and copper gallium selenide, CuGaSe2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The physical properties are, for example, grey to black color, dull luster and opaque transparency. Particularly, the material exhibits direct bandgap semiconductivity and high absorption coefficients with a wide forgiveness to material imperfections. Thus, the material is ideal for photovoltaics. The manner in which light is converted into electrical energy is similar to photosynthesis which yields chemical energy. In contrast to the above-mentioned silicon, an indirect bandgap element semiconductor, substantially less material is required for the electrical device. That improves energy payback time. Despite that, a polycrystalline system with four elements is complex. Synergies with microelectronics are limited but architectural glazing techniques can be used. Module efficiency, temperature coefficient, low-light response and shading behavior are decisive criteria when selecting the technology application. Nonetheless, this thin-film technology has become established. Silicon-based photovoltaics still dominated last year with a global market share of over 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. However, the forecast for copper indium gallium selenide remains optimistic with significant capacity gains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].<fig id="Figd" position="anchor"><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Fourth figure: chalcopyrite morphology (left) and primitive cell (right) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42452_2019_811_Figd_HTML.png" position="anchor" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par22">Consanguinity compared nature with technology.
