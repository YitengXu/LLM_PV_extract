NIR-II fluorophores draw from a broad spectrum of materials spanning semiconducting nanomaterials to organic molecular dyes, yet unfortunately all water-soluble organic molecules with &gt;1,000 nm emission suffer from low quantum yields that have limited temporal resolution and penetration depth. Here, we report tailoring the supramolecular assemblies of protein complexes with a sulfonated NIR-II organic dye (CH-4T) to produce a brilliant 110-fold increase in fluorescence, resulting in the highest quantum yield molecular fluorophore thus far. The bright molecular complex allowed for the fastest video-rate imaging in the second NIR window with ∼50-fold reduced exposure times at a fast 50 frames-per-second (FPS) capable of resolving mouse cardiac cycles. In addition, we demonstrate that the NIR-II molecular complexes are superior to clinically approved ICG for lymph node imaging deep within the mouse body.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging &gt;1,000 nm allows deep tissue imaging, but available organic dyes display poor brightness and temporal resolution.

fluorophores emitting in the second near-infrared widow (NIR-II) at wavelengths ranging from 1,000 to 1,700 nm has allowed visualization of deep anatomical features with an unprecedented degree of clarity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr"

ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Light scattering and attenuation as well as background autofluorescence all decrease when imaging at progressively longer wavelengths, which have enabled non-invasive through-skull imaging of brain vasculature, detecting tumours at depths of ∼4 mm in the brain, resolving blood flow dynamics resulting from cardiac waveforms, and assessing blood flow anomalies in cardiovascular disease and traumatic brain injury<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, the majority of NIR-II fluorophores suffer from low quantum yields as the generation of long-wavelength photons require low bandgap materials in which non-radiative decay processes tend to dominate over radiative photon emission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In the visible or NIR-I (∼750–1,000 nm) regions quantum yields of ∼80% and ∼10%, respectively, are common yet those in the NIR-II are typically in the range of ∼0.01–1.4% with the exception of lead sulfide quantum dots<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The dearth of high quantum yield NIR-II fluorophores has hindered fully reaching the potential of deep-imaging penetration depths in this window and caused poor temporal resolution as long exposure times are needed to compensate for low brightness. A clinically translatable high quantum yield organic NIR-II fluorophore would open up many exciting possibilities for biomedical fluorescence imaging.</p><p id="Par4">While most current NIR-II fluorophores consist of inorganic semiconducting nanomaterials, the development of long-wavelength organic dyes similar in functionality and biocompatibility to those in the visible and NIR-I should allow NIR-II imaging to transition rapidly into a clinical setting and the broader research community. Donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) dyes are a promising class of small-molecule fluorophores for bioimaging whose emission extends past 1,000 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Traditionally used for semiconducting organic electronics such as OLEDs and dye sensitized solar cells, this highly tunable dye architecture is built around a strong electron acceptor such as benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) (BBTD) to which strong electron donors are wired through <italic>π</italic>-spacers to lower the energy gap. Molecular engineering of the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels allows wavelength tuning of emission peaks spanning the NIR-II. However, the hydrophobic nature of these dyes requires additional functionalization to increase aqueous solubility. We recently reported the first organic dye for NIR-II imaging, a carboxylated D–A–D dye termed CH1055, which required PEGylation if not conjugated to a hydrophilic protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Although CH1055-PEG demonstrated excellent pharmacokinetics, a low quantum yield of ∼0.3%, while typical of NIR-II fluorophores, leaves ample room for further improvement.</p><p id="Par5">Herein, we demonstrate that changing the functional groups from carboxylic to sulfonic acid results in a completely water-soluble organic NIR-II dye (CH-4T) that readily forms supramolecular assemblies with plasma proteins to produce a brilliant increase in fluorescent brightness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The fluorescence intensity of CH-4T increases ∼50-fold in serum compared to phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) and revealed an impressively high quantum yield of up to ∼5%. Further, simply heating the dye to 70 °C for 10 min in serum boosted its quantum yield up to 11%, affording the highest reported quantum yield to date for a clinically suitable NIR-II fluorophore. Optimizing the brightness of CH-4T through protein complexation prior to injection allowed for the fastest video-rate imaging in the NIR-II with ∼1.5–2 ms exposure times and ultra-fast 50 frames-per-second (FPS) dynamic imaging capable of resolving cardiac cycles with unprecedented temporal resolution. In addition, we demonstrate that lymph nodes deep within the mouse (∼5–8 mm) are clearly imaged in the NIR-II using the CH-4T complex with imaging performance superior to indocyanine green (ICG).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthesis and optical characterization</title><p id="Par6">Synthesis of the sulfonated small-molecule organic dye (CH-4T, 1.4 kDa, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) was achieved through amide bond formation between the carboxylated CH1055 and taurine by <italic>O</italic>-(benzotriazol-1-yl)-<italic>N,N,N′,N′</italic>-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-diisopropylethlamine (DIPEA) coupling in DMSO (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM53">Supplementary Methods</xref> for complete synthesis details). Taurine is a common biomolecule found throughout the body containing both an amine and sulfonate group, thus allowing facile modification of CH1055. After conjugation, CH-4T was purified with HPLC and the eluted fractions analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionizing time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) to collect CH1055 conjugated to four taurine moieties (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM53">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). An nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum further confirmed the synthesis and purity of CH-4T (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM53">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). An ultraviolet-visible absorbance spectrum revealed a strong peak at ∼738 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM53">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The relative fluorescent brightness of CH-4T was investigated by matching the absorbance at 808 nm (optical density (OD) 0.1) in deionized water (DI), PBS and fetal bovine serum (FBS) and imaging the vials on an indium-gallium-arsenide (InGaAs) camera under 808 nm excitation. The fluorescent brightness of CH-4T in DI water was marginally higher than in PBS, yet a drastic 35-fold increase in fluorescence in the range of 900–1,500 nm was observed after mixing free CH-4T dye with FBS (10 ms, 1100LP; <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs 1b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> for higher image dynamic range; see Methods for details on CH-4T spectroscopy). In contrast, CH1055-PEG mixed at equivalent concentrations in identical biological media produced a uniform NIR-II brightness across all solutions (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). A fluorescent emission spectrum collected for CH-4T and CH-PEG in both PBS and FBS under an excitation of 808 nm (using a NIR-II spectrophotometer that compensated for the variability in the detector quantum efficiency at different wavelengths (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>)) demonstrated a higher fluorescence brightness of CH-4T in serum than CH-PEG by 16-fold, again suggesting the CH-4T dye became brilliantly bright in the presence of serum proteins. CH-4T mixed with FBS from various sources all produced virtually the same level of fluorescence enhancement regardless of manufacturer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM53">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Synthesis and optical characterization of CH-4T.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Chemical structure of CH1055 and the one-step sulfonation to produce CH-4T.

Such a high-brightness dye additionally allows the detection of deeper features in the body as evidenced by the clear resolution of the lumbar lymph nodes. As the excitation power density drops off when penetrating deeper into the body, high quantum yield NIR-II fluorophores are necessary to generate sufficient fluorescent signal.

The first reported quantum yield of IR-26 as 0.5% in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), the most widely applied value, has been called into question by recent reports placing the quantum at both 0.05 and 0.1% (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>). The reported quantum yield for CH-4T and complexes is based on using HiPCO SWCNTs as a reference, whose quantum yield was similar to IR-26 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>). HiPCO SWCNTs were selected as a quantum yield reference as nanotubes are simple to disperse in water, demonstrate excellent stability unlike IR-26 that degrades in 1,2-dichloroethane over relatively short periods to time, and are the most common NIR-II contrast agent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The brightness of NIR-II dyes will be listed relative to other NIR-II fluorophores as well as in absolute quantum yield ranges henceforth until the discrepancies in the reported quantum yield of IR-26 are resolved. As this work marks a transition in the reference absolute quantum yield, the absolute quantum yield of CH-4T is 1.1–11% with respect to IR-26=0.05–0.5%. Changing the absolute quantum yield of the reference only serves to scale the brightness of the entire NIR-II field and does not affect the relative brightness between NIR-II emitting materials. Regardless, CH-4T is by far the brightest organic fluorophore of any NIR-I or NIR-II dye emitting past 1,000 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM53">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>) with a 27-fold higher quantum yield than HiPCO SWCNTs, a classic NIR-II imaging probe.</p><p id="Par23">Tuning the interactions between organic NIR-II dyes consisting of large, hydrophobic <italic>π</italic>-systems and plasma proteins is a route to brilliantly fluorescent dyes emitting past 1,000 nm. In a similar fashion to ICG’s ∼4 × increase in brightness when exposed to serum proteins, the 110-fold fluorescence increase between CH-4T/FBS-HT and CH-4T in PBS most likely occurs through the combination of multiple processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. First, the amphiphilic character of CH-4T may form aggregates in aqueous solution through van der Waals forces that reduce brightness through self-quenching which is known to occur in ICG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The dispersion of aggregates by CH-4T individualization through protein binding should contribute to the serum boost in quantum yield. Second, CH-4T geometrical confinement by hydrophobic pockets should promote a rigid dye conformation that minimizes the torsional rotations that result in non-radiative decay<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Rigid molecules have shorter fluorescent lifetimes and generally higher quantum yields as they dissipate less energy though internal conversion compared to those with freely rotating parts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Internal conversion is the most important competing non-emissive process for low energy-gap NIR-II dyes thus increasing rigidity through protein binding will favourably increase quantum yield. Heating magnifies these effects as CH-4T presumably becoming entangled in a rigid conformation as increased thermal energy allows access to typically inaccessible hydrophobic pockets. At higher temperatures, CH-4T may become completely encased in hydrophobic domains as proteins re-fold around the dye after heating to minimize the number of hydrophobic side-chains exposed to water. In addition, donor–acceptor dyes are subject to twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) in polar environments, especially if comprised of strong electron donors and acceptors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Molecular simulations predict the core of CH1055 can exist in non-planar conformations that may contribute to a red-shifted TICT conformation that can dampen fluorescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The observed hypsochromic shift of ∼50 nm can be explained through CH-4T adopting a planar configuration and the alignment of <italic>p</italic>-orbitals when binding to proteins via hydrophobic or charge interactions in conjunction with minimizing solvent relaxation.</p><p id="Par24">Developing a fundamental understanding of the manner in which NIR-II organic dyes interact with biological tissue is of critical importance for creating probes with high SBR ratios as well as high excretion levels. CH-4T demonstrated an impressively high quantum yield thorough protein binding and the dye was excreted through the biliary system with little residual dye left in normal tissue just days post-injection. Unlike current NIR-II nanomaterial fluorophores, CH-4T demonstrated complete excretion from the body, albeit at a slower rate than CH-PEG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM53">Supplementary Fig. 15</xref>). CH-4T elicited no observable cellular toxicity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM53">Supplementary Figs 16 and 17</xref>), while CH-4T/FBS-HT and CH-4T/HSA-HT showed a marginal reduction in cell viability at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM53">Supplementary Figs 18 and 19</xref>). However, in a similar manner to the pioneering work by Frangioni and colleagues, tailoring the interaction strength between NIR-II fluorophores and proteins to maintain a high quantum yield while employing strategies such as polyionic yet net-neutral probes may expedite excretion kinetics and reduce non-specific <italic>in vivo</italic> binding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. The same rational design principles developed for NIR-I fluorophores may be applied to NIR-II organic dyes to develop the next generation of contrast and molecular imaging agents.</p><p id="Par25">Hemodynamic imaging with a high frame rate in the NIR-II poses several advantages over other vascular flow imaging modalities such as laser speckle flowgraphy and photoacoustic imaging (PI). Laser speckle flowgraphy computes blood velocity based on the measurement of laser speckle blurring (termed normalize blur (NB)) from coherent light scattering from diffusing sources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Modulation of the laser backscattered interference pattern occurs as red blood cells travel through capillaries. Laser speckle flowgraphy has significant clinical potential as it requires no exogenous contrast agents yet this imaging modality currently suffers from a number limitations. Measurement of laser flux depends highly on tissue properties that can vary from person to person or in disparate disease states. A correlation between the unit-less NB and capillary blood flow velocities occurs only under a narrow set of conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. This disallows facile blood velocity comparisons among people or even between an individual’s eyes during retinal vasculature imaging. Photoacoustic imaging can additionally measure blood velocity without requiring exogenous contrast agents by exploiting hemoglobin’s strong visible absorbance. However, with minimum resolvable features on the scale of ∼10–100 μm, photoacoustic imaging cannot compete with fluorescence imaging in terms of spatial resolutionx<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. CH-4T’s penetration depth (1–3 mm) combined with high temporal (50 FPS) and spatial (∼1 μm) resolution enables high-fidelity hemodynamic imaging of vessel sizes ranging from microvasculature to major vessels. Application of high frame-rate NIR-II imaging with CH-4T for hemodynamic visualization within tumours, intravascular tracking of circulating tumour cells or post-trauma cerebral microvascular imaging may provide key insight into disease pathophysiology. In addition to providing absolute blood velocities, CH-4T’s high-brightness and long-wavelength emission may improve other biological optical imaging modalities. For instance, one-photon confocal imaging with CH-4T may push the penetration depth limit past that achievable with the current palette of visible/NIR-I/NIR-II fluorophores.</p><p id="Par26">Even with the superior NIR-I silicon CCD detector specifications (for example, pixel number, dark current, readout noise and so on), NIR-II imaging on the InGaAs detector with longer wavelength probes improves imaging metrics. As no current silicon detector has suitable sensitivity past ∼1,000 nm, biomedical fluorescent imaging in the NIR-II depended on the emergence of InGaAs focal plane array detectors. However, similarly to the benefits garnered by pushing probe emission out of the visible (∼350–600 nm) and into the NIR-I (∼650–900 nm) on Si cameras, the development of bright, long-wavelength NIR-II probes (&gt;1,000 nm) boosts imaging performance metrics. Internal comparisons within a broad wavelength range on an InGaAs detector have dramatically illustrated the imaging improvements by developing longer wavelength probes from 850 nm (ICG) to 1,100 nm (HiPCO SWCNTs) to 1,500 nm (laser vaporization SWCNTs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. ICG and laser vaporization SWCNTs both emit in a region with similarly reduced InGaAs quantum efficiency of ∼30–40% compared to ∼85% at ∼1,100 nm with HiPCO SWCNTs. This indicates the marked differences in imaging quality at progressively longer wavelengths arise from reduced scattering/autofluorescence rather than variable detector spectral sensitivities. Fundamental advances in fluorophore chemistry have largely driven the NIR-II imaging field, making InGaAs detectors more commonplace for biomedical imaging. While newer generations of InGaAs detectors can uniformly increase sensitivity/SBR of all NIR-II probes, relative imaging metrics within the NIR-II spectral range will still be governed by wavelength dependent light-tissue interactions. Improving NIR-II fluorescent probes (that is, increasing both quantum yield and NIR-II emission wavelength) should proceed in parallel with the ongoing innovations in improving InGaAs cameras.</p><p id="Par27">In summary, we have developed the first NIR-II contrast agent based on a small-molecule organic dye with an ultra-high quantum yield of 1.1–11% (IR-26=0.05–0.5%). The negatively charged sulfonate groups enabled supramolecular binding to serum proteins capable of a 110-fold fluorescence enhancement compared to CH-4T in PBS. Heating the CH-4T–protein complex caused a marked boost in fluorescence intensity indicating that brightness increases are possible through optimizing dye–protein interactions. <italic>In vivo</italic> vascular imaging was performed at 50 FPS, the fastest frame rate to date in the NIR-II at an exposure time of 2 ms to unambiguously resolve vascular hemodynamics. In addition, imaging of deep lymph nodes at a depth of ∼5–8 mm in both the first and second NIR windows clearly demonstrated the benefits of imaging deep anatomical features at longer wavelengths. CH-4T illustrates for the first time that high quantum yield dyes in the NIR-II are possible. Future work will strive to modify CH-4T to enable covalent linkable NIR-II fluorophores whose brightness can be utilized for ultra-high SBR <italic>in vivo</italic> molecular imaging.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Animal handling</title><p id="Par28">All vertebrate animal experiments were performed under the approval of Stanford University’s Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care.
