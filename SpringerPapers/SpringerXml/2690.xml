B = Pb or Sn; X = I, Br or Cl) have been investigated extensively for use as light-absorbing material in solar cells because of their unique properties such as direct optical bandgap, broadband light absorption, bipolar transport, and long carrier diffusion length. Since the first report about perovskite solar cells (PSC) having 3.81% power conversion efficiency (PCE) by Kojima <italic>et al</italic>. in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, which triggered intensive research in the development of PSC, remarkable enhancement in power conversion efficiency (PCE) reaching 20% has been achieved during past several years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p>In conventional silicon-based p-n junction photovoltaic (PV) devices, the pure crystal structure in photoactive layer has been known to be advantageous to efficient charge transport and reduced exciton quenching for high efficiency solar cell. However, in MAPbI<sub>3</sub>-based PSC showing high efficiency, tiny amount of residual PbI<sub>2</sub> impurity was often found with the perovskite crystal phase, even though the equimolar composition of organic (MAI) and inorganic (PbI<sub>2</sub>) components was utilized to fully convert them to perovskite crystal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, various approaches have been reported to find out if perovskite crystal with PbI<sub>2</sub> impurity would be advantageous to the performance of PSC or not. However, in general, the crystalline structure and nanoscale morphology of perovskite photoactive layers are significantly influenced by their deposition methodology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and therefore those reports should be individually interpreted depending on their growth mechanism.</p><p>Chen <italic>el al.</italic> reported an approach to produce pure MAPbI<sub>3</sub> film by treating as-deposited PbI<sub>2</sub> film with MAI vapor for several hours, from which PbI<sub>2</sub> component could be reversibly regenerated when annealed at 150 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. They showed that the regenerated PbI<sub>2</sub> from the pure MAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystal structure by annealing was helpful to passivate grain boundary (GB) between crystal domains, consequently improving their device performances due to the reduced recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Similarly, Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the role of PbI<sub>2</sub> in their perovskite film, grown by spin-casting hydrohalide deficient PbI<sub>2</sub>·xHI (x = 0.9~1) precursor under MA vapor atmosphere. Using their process, the proper amount of PbI<sub>2</sub> nanoplates could be located at the GB, which could consequently provide a longer photoluminescence (PL) life time and enhanced open-circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>) to their PSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p>As for the one-step solution casting-based perovskite films, Wang <italic>et al</italic>. studied their perovskite films using the time-resolved femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) spectroscopy and the slower relaxation rates were obtained from the perovskite film with PbI<sub>2</sub>, which proved the passivation effect of PbI<sub>2</sub> on the perovskite GB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Similarly, the positive effects of excess PbI<sub>2</sub>, added to intentionally exceed the equimolar composition of the components, were also shown, which were the reduction of ionic defect migrations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> and trap density close to the perovskite/TiO<sub>2</sub> interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, consequently improving their device performances. In contrast, there was a report, in which pure MAPbI<sub>3</sub> crystal structure without PbI<sub>2</sub>, prepared by an one-step spin-coating of the solution of MAI and PbI<sub>2</sub> mixture in <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-dimethylformamide (DMF) with hydriiodic acid (HI) additive, was advantageous to decrease hysteresis as well as to improve the device performances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These conflicting results may be because the amount, form, morphology or location of the residual PbI<sub>2</sub> could vary in perovskite films, prepared by different processing conditions during the one-step solution casting.</p><p>The growth mechanism of the perovskite crystal from the two-step sequential solution processes (<italic>e.g.</italic> dip-coating or spin-casting MAI on the spin-casted PbI<sub>2</sub>), known to follow dissolution and recrystallization procedures at the interface between liquid and solid generally around the PbI<sub>2</sub> surface, is different to that from the one-step mixed solution-based processes, known to follow interlayer diffusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Therefore, we can speculate that the effect of residual PbI<sub>2</sub> in photoactive layers during the device operation would be also different depending on their fabrication methods. Cao <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and Lee <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> individually showed that PSCs having remnant PbI<sub>2</sub> in two-step solution-based photoactive layers produced higher PCE, but the inferior performances, obtained from the pure perovskite phase-based devices, mainly originated in the non-uniformly grown perovskite films having over-grown needle-like structures due to longer dipping time to force the remaining PbI<sub>2</sub> converted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> or coarse nanomorphology having a lot of pinholes due to the recrystallization during their film formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Similarly, in the work by Wang <italic>et al</italic>., the perovskite film without PbI<sub>2</sub>, which provided inferior solar cell performances, was prepared by casting MAI on the coarse PbI<sub>2</sub> layer, consequently inducing the low surface coverage perovskite film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, to clearly verify the effect of PbI<sub>2</sub> in the two-step process-based PSC, the morphological discrepancy between perovskites with and without PbI<sub>2</sub> should be eliminated, first. Furthermore, Lee <italic>et al</italic>. showed the possibility that the higher conduction band of PbI<sub>2</sub> than that of perovskite could block the electron injection from perovskite to TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, and Liu <italic>et al</italic>. proved that the residual PbI<sub>2</sub> induced an intrinsic instability to the film under illumination condition, consequently degrading the film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Therefore, the merits of PbI<sub>2</sub> in two-step solution process-based perovskite, are still ambiguous.</p><p>In this work, we designed a printing-based two-step solution process, which could not only generate pure perovskite crystal without residual PbI<sub>2</sub>, but also provide uniform and full surface coverage perovskite film, of which the nanoscale morphology was comparable to that prepared by conventional two-step solution processes (such as spin-casting and dip-coating) generally containing a certain amount of remnant PbI<sub>2</sub>, to find out the advantages of pure perovskite on the performance of two-step sequential process-based PSC. Therefore, it is proper to have in-depth understanding of the advantages of pure perovskite crystal in two-step solution process-based PSC after excluding the morphology-driven effects. The information about the crystallinity and the morphological characteristics of perovskite films was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. Our results showed that, in two-step solution process-based PSC, pure perovskite photoactive layer had better photon absorption and longer carrier life time, revealed by UV-Vis spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), respectively, leading to superior photocurrent generation with higher PCE. Furthermore, this process was further applicable to prepare mixed phase pure perovskite crystal without PbI<sub>2</sub> impurity, and we showed that partial replacement of MA cation of pure MAPbI<sub>3</sub> with FA cation using the printing process, not degrading the high crystallinity without PbI<sub>2</sub> impurity and forming α-phase (MA)<sub>x</sub>(FA)<sub>1−x</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>, was beneficial to broadening the absorption wavelength range with the additional increase of the carrier life time and the reduction of charge recombination, proved by UV-Vis, TRPL, and transient photovoltage (TPV), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>To prepare two-step process-based pure perovskite film having uniform nanomorphology, soft printing-based process was designed as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. On a FTO-coated glass, compact TiO<sub>2</sub> and mesoporous (mp) TiO<sub>2</sub> layers were sequentially added, and PbI<sub>2</sub> dissolved in DMF was deposited over the mp TiO<sub>2</sub> layer. On top of the dried PbI<sub>2</sub> layer, MAI solution in 2-propanol was dispensed and capped with a gas-permeable silicone film enabling solvent evaporation, such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), to which a slight pressure was applied. The solidified perovskite layer remained on the TiO<sub>2</sub> substrate after removal of the silicone film. Because a shear stress applied to the solution across the whole depth between substrate and silicone film is much more effective than that between a substrate and an air surface (<italic>e.g.</italic> spin-casting), which decreases from the substrate to be zero at the air interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, it is expected that MAI during this process can be more efficiently diffused to PbI<sub>2</sub> in mp TiO<sub>2</sub> template than that during the conventional spin-casting process. Moreover, the solvent dwelling time can be adjusted by controlling the applied pressure or utilizing silicone films having different gas-permeability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, thus this approach is advantageous to optimize the conversion of the components (MAI and PbI<sub>2</sub>) to perovskite crystal, different to the conventional spin-casting. Even though dipping process can be utilized to freely control the solvent dwelling time in two-step solution process, it does not have any extendibility to continuous process such as roll-to-roll. In our former work, we have shown that this type of printing-based casting process could be extended to the continuous roll-to-roll process, by which a three-inch-wide uniform large area polymer bulk-heterojunction photoactive layer for organic solar cell was demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The extendibility of this printing-based process to the large area continuous fabrication is highly promising to the future high efficiency PSC technology.

Because the thicknesses of both perovskite films were almost identical (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c,f</xref>), the enhanced absorption was due to the increased crystallinity.

As shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, the solar cells fabricated by the pure perovskite (PCE = 15.0%) outperformed those by the perovskite with residual PbI<sub>2</sub> (PCE = 13.0%), and the improved PCE was mainly from <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> (from 20.4 to 22.0 mA·cm<sup>−2</sup>) and <italic>FF</italic> (from 0.66 to 0.69), believed to originate in the increased light absorption and carrier life time of the pure perovskite crystal.

At 5 mg·ml<sup>−1</sup>, lower than the optimum concentration (10 mg·ml<sup>−1</sup>), the size of nanocube were found to be much larger and disconnected each other, causing non-uniform and discrete perovskite film that resulted in the less surface coverage and capping of underlying TiO<sub>2</sub> film (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1b</xref>), and a strong crystalline PbI<sub>2</sub> peak was observed at 12.6° (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S1a</xref>), suggesting that this concentration of MAI was not sufficient for the complete conversion of PbI<sub>2</sub> into perovskite. When a HTL is deposited over this discrete perovskite film, direct contact between HTL and electron transporting layer (ETL) is more likely to form the shunt pathways, resulting in the degraded performance of device. Because of uncompleted conversion of PbI<sub>2</sub> into perovskite and the shunt pathway created by the direct contact between ETL and HTL, the performance of the cell fabricated using 5 mg·ml<sup>−1</sup> of MAI was found to be extremely poor. <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>, <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> and <italic>FF</italic> of such devices were found to be 0.73 V, 6.9 mA·cm<sup>−2</sup> and 0.39 respectively, which resulted in the PCE to be 2.0% (average values of forward and reverse scan).
