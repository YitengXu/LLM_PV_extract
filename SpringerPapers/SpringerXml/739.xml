However, their limited biomass productivity represents a bottleneck that needs to be overcome to meet the applicative potential of these organisms. One of the domestication targets for improving their productivity is the proper balance between photoprotection and light conversion for carbon fixation. In the model organism for green algae, <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, a photoprotective mechanism inducing thermal dissipation of absorbed light energy, called Non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), is activated even at relatively low irradiances, resulting in reduced photosynthetic efficiency. Two pigment binding proteins, LHCSR1 and LHCSR3, were previously reported as the main actors during NPQ induction in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic>. While previous work characterized in detail the functional properties of LHCSR3, few information is available for the LHCSR1 subunit. Here, we investigated in vitro the functional properties of LHCSR1 and LHCSR3 subunits: despite high sequence identity, the latter resulted as a stronger quencher compared to the former, explaining its predominant role observed in vivo. Pigment analysis, deconvolution of absorption spectra and structural models of LHCSR1 and LHCR3 suggest that different quenching efficiency is related to a different occupancy of L2 carotenoid binding site.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21956</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2020_Article_78985.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Among photosynthetic organisms, microalgae have high potential with a wide range of applications of their biomass and its derivatives, from food/feed to biofuels and high-value products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. These unicellular organisms are characterized generally by a higher photosynthetic efficiency compared to higher plants due to the absence of non-photosynthetic tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, some bottlenecks need to be faced in order to improve their domestication process: in fact, their photosynthetic efficiency is far lower than the theoretical value, ranging between 1 and 3% on industrial scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In a natural habitat, photosynthetic organisms are exposed to variable light conditions, which can induce photodamage, affecting their photosynthetic efficiency, so they have developed various acclimation mechanisms, such as thermal dissipation of energy absorbed in excess, a process called non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, this mechanism is activated in excess, especially in controlled photobioreactor conditions, leading to a massive energy dissipation, up to 80% of light absorbed, through heat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In algae, NPQ mechanism is triggered by antenna-like pigment-binding proteins located in thylakoid membranes, called Light Harvesting Complex Stress Related proteins (LHCSRs), which are over-accumulated upon high light exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">In <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, LHCSR3 protein is encoded by two almost identical genes <italic>lhcSR3.1/lhcSR3.2</italic> which differ only in the promoter region<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>: this subunit is usually considered as the main quenching subunit involved in NPQ, as evidenced by the strongly reduced NPQ phenotype observed in <italic>npq4</italic> mutant, a <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> mutant strain depleted of both <italic>lhcSR3</italic> genes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.

A second LHCSR subunit, LHCSR1, is encoded in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> by a single gene, being expressed generally to a lower level than LHCSR3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

However, a direct comparison between the quenching properties of LHCSR1 and LHCSR3 has not been obtained, due to their different accumulation level in vivo. Here, an in vitro study was used to elucidate LHCSR1 quenching capacity by its comparison with LHCSR3: carotenoid-binding properties were investigated by HPLC and spectral deconvolution of the absorption spectra in the 400–520 nm region (Soret region), where both chlorophylls (Chl) and carotenoids absorb, and quenching properties of LHCSR1 protein were then investigated by time resolved fluorescence analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Analysis of LHCSR1 and LHCSR3 protein sequences</title><p id="Par4">Alignment of LHCSR1 and LHCSR3 demonstrate a high level of identity between the two subunits (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Purified LHCSR1 apoproteins were then refolded in vitro with pigments, allowing the characterization of its biochemical and spectroscopic properties. The same procedure was performed in the case of LHCRSR3 as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Pigments from spinach thylakoids were used for the in vitro LHCSR1 and LHCSR refolding procedure. Indeed, spinach thylakoids share the same pigment composition, even if different relative concentration, as in the case of thylakoids found in C. reinhardtii cells with the exception of loroxanthin, which is present in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> but not in vascular plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. However, it was previously reported that LHCSR subunits cannot bind loroxanthin even if present in the pigment mix used to induce in vitro protein refolding<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Recombinant refolded holoproteins were investigated in terms of their pigment binding properties. As reported in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> in both cases Chl a, Chl b, lutein, violaxanthin and traces of neoxanthin were detected. The increased selectivity for Chl a rather than Chl b was conserved in both LHCSR1 and LHCSR3 with a slight increase of Chl b content in the former. In both cases more than two carotenoids were found per holocomplex, considering 8 Chl bound per apoprotein: these carotenoids were previously suggested to be bound to the inner carotenoid binding site L1 and L2 and to a third more peripheral site (N1/V1-like carotenoid binding site). Interestingly, the ratio between the amount of lutein and violaxanthin is much higher in LHCSR1 compared to the LHCSR3 case: considering the occupancy of violaxanthin in L2 site previously suggested for LHCSR3, this result might indicate a different composition of this carotenoid binding site. Pigments absorption is tuned by the environment in which they are located: when Chl are in a protein environment, their absorption in the Qy is red shifted compared to pigments in organic solvent or in detergent solution. As reported in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, in both LHCSR3 and LHCSR1 holoproteins a clear red shift in the Qy maximum absorption was evident compared to the free pigments case with peaks observed at 679, 676 and 668 nm for LHCSR3, LHCSR1 and free pigments, respectively. In either LHCSR1 or LHCSR3 proteins, it was possible to note that a very low content of Chl b, if any, was present, due to the absence of the peculiar Chl b absorption peaks, usually observed at 475 nm and 650 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Pigment analysis of LHCSR1 and LHCSR3 refolded recombinant proteins.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"/><th align="left"><p>Chl a/Chl b</p></th><th align="left"><p>Chl/Car</p></th><th align="left"><p>Chl tot</p></th><th align="left"><p>Neo</p></th><th align="left"><p>Vio</p></th><th align="left"><p>Lut</p></th><th align="left"><p>Cars</p></th><th align="left"><p>Lut/Vio</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>LHCSR1</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>4.10</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>3.40</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>8.00</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.11</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.49</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>1.75</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>2.35</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>3.57</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>LHCSR3</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>6.31</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>3.01</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>8.00</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.03</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>1.20</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>1.43</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>2.66</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>1.19</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Total amount of carotenoids (Cars) and the level of the different xanthophyll were normalized to 8 chlorophyll (Chl tot) content per aproprotein. <italic>Neo</italic> neoxanthin, <italic>Vio</italic> violaxanthin, <italic>Lut</italic> lutein.

According to this model, L1 carotenoid binding site is mainly occupied by lutein (96%) with a small amount of violaxanthin bound (4%).

Interestingly, the composition of L2 site is markedly different in LHCSR1 compared to LHCSR3, where the relative amount of violaxanthin bound is much higher.

Comparing LHCSR1 and LHCSR3 proteins, the latter showed a faster decay compared in most of the conditions tested, with the shortest fluorescence lifetime being measured in the case of LHCSR3 at pH 5 and 0.007% β-DM. The pH dependent reduction of fluorescence lifetime was similar in percentage at 0.03% β-DM, but more pronounced in the case of LHCSR3 at 0.007% β-DM. The quenching activity induced by aggregation, obtained by reducing the detergent concentration from 0.03 to 0.007% was again more evident in LHCSR3 at pH 5 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>).

This transcriptional control has been then validated by biochemical and immunoblotting analysis of <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cells grown at different CO2 concentrations: LHCSR3 is thus mainly accumulated in HL and low CO<sub>2</sub> conditions, while LHCSR1 requires both HL and high CO<sub>2</sub> to be expressed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In this work functional and biochemical properties of LHCSR1 were analyzed and compared to LHCSR3 upon apoprotein overexpression in bacteria and in vitro refolding in presence of pigments. As in the case LHCSR3, LHCSR1 holoproteins were characterized by a very low amount of Chl b bound, confirming that LHCSR proteins have higher affinity for Chl a<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Both LHCSR1 and LHCSR3 were found to bind lutein and violaxanthin, with traces of neoxanthin being found in both holocomplexes. Pigment stoichiometry based on a putative number of 8 Chl bound per apoprotein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> revealed the presence of more than two carotenoids in LHCSR1, as previously reported for LHCSR3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. However, while a similar content of lutein and violaxanthin was detected in LHCSR3, a higher affinity for lutein was evident in the case of LHCSR1 (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In order to investigate a possible different composition of carotenoid binding sites in LHCSR1 compared to LHCSR3, deconvolution of the absorption spectra in the Soret region of both refolded proteins was performed to resolve the different absorption forms of Chl and carotenoids bound<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. In both LHCSR1 and LHCSR3 three carotenoids binding sites were identified, consistently with the pigment stoichiometry proposed (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), on the base of the absorption shift induced to the carotenoid absorption forms (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Inner sites L1 and L2 and a third more peripheral N1/V1-like site could be identified in both LHCSR1 and LHCSR3. Carotenoid binding site inducing the smaller absorption shift (7.5–8.1 nm) was identified in both LHCSR1 and LHCSR3 being occupied by violaxanthin and neoxanthin. The carotenoid binding site inducing an intermediate shift (11–13.4 nm), identified as L1, was mainly occupied by lutein in both complexes, while the carotenoid binding site inducing the strongest red shift (16–18.4 nm), identified as L2, was respectively preferentially occupied by lutein and violaxanthin in LHCSR1 and LHCSR3. Different occupancy of L2 site in LHCSR1 compared to LHCSR3 with a higher affinity for lutein is consistent with the results obtained by HPLC analysis of pigment extracts (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Interestingly, the structural model built for LHCSR1 and LHCSR3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) revealed a different protein environment for one of the terminal ring of carotenoids in L2, comparing the two subunits: in the case of LHCSR1 the side chain of a phenylalanine (F116) residue was predicted to be orientated toward carotenoid in L2, possibly influencing the occupancy of this carotenoid binding site. This different L2 occupancy could be at the base of the different activity of the protein, influencing protein conformation and/or dynamics of protein activation toward a quenched state. In the case of LHCSR3 in vitro mutagenesis analysis demonstrated the involvement of both Chl 613, located close to carotenoid in L1, and Chl 603, located close to carotenoid in L2, in LHCSR3 quenching mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>: a different composition of L2 in LHCSR1 could thus influence its quenching activity. Quenching properties of the two proteins have been analyzed by time resolved fluorescence analysis. LHCSR3 have been reported to be activated as a quencher by low pH, as in the case of lumen acidification upon photooxidative stress, and/or by protein aggregation. The latter condition has been previously reported to generally induce LHC protein to a quenching conformation and it has been linked to the in vivo clustering of antenna proteins observed in the thylakoid membranes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. The results obtained demonstrate that both proteins have a quenching activity strongly induced by either low pH or protein aggregation, showing the shortest lifetime at low detergent concentration and low pH. Consistently with NPQ observation in vivo in presence of LHCSR1 or LHCSR3 only<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, both LHCSR subunits can be activated as quenchers at low pH to a much stronger extent compared to LHCII complexes, the major antenna subunits of PSII (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>). However, LHCSR3 resulted to be more effective as a quencher compared to LHCSR1 showing the shortest fluorescence lifetime at low pH and low detergent concentration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). It is important to note that LHCSR3 was also the subunit with the strongest reduction in percentage of its fluorescence lifetime comparing the conditions inducing the longest (pH 7.5 and 0.03% β-DM) and shortest (pH 5 and 0.007% β-DM) fluorescence lifetime (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>), demonstrating a more efficient transition toward a quenched state. This result suggests that LHCSR3 is a better quencher than LHCSR1 during NPQ induction, providing a possible explanation for the evolutionary preference of LHCSR3 dependent quenching mechanisms in <italic>C. reinhardtii</italic> cells exposed to the most dangerous photooxidative conditions: high light and low CO<sub>2</sub> concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. In this condition the high excitation pressure at the level of the photosynthetic apparatus is further aggravated by the low availability of CO<sub>2</sub> the final acceptor of electrons coming from the photosynthetic electron transport chain. Indeed, at low CO<sub>2</sub> concentration the metabolic flux through the carbon fixation reactions is reduced, slowing down the rate of ADP and NADP<sup>+</sup> regeneration, further reducing the availability of these cofactors required to de-saturate the photosynthetic apparatus. Preferential expression of LHCSR3 compared to LHCSR1 in this condition can thus have the rationale of ensuring the highest quenching efficiency to prevent ROS formation. At high CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, the risk of photoinhibition is reduced, while an higher fraction of excitation energy should be used to provide energy for carbon fixation: in this condition LHCSR3 is substituted with the less efficient LHCSR1 to meet the desired balance between photoprotection and photosynthetic efficiency. Further experimental work is required to prove this evolutionary perspective. Moreover, several details of the LHCSR1 dependent quenching need to be investigated, as the intramolecular quenching species formed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> or the interactions with other LHC subunits required for the NPQ activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">In conclusion, the in vitro analysis of LHCSR1 and LHCSR3 subunits suggested that both proteins can be activated as quenchers by reducing the pH of the medium and/or by inducing protein aggregation. However, LHCSR3 can reach a stronger quenching state compared to LHCSR1: this intrinsic properties of LHCSR1 and LHCSR3 are likely at the base of the different activity and regulation of LHCSRs subunit in vivo during NPQ induction.
