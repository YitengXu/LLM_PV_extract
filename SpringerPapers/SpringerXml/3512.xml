Herein, a two-dimensional interplanar heterojunction (FeOCl/FeOOH NSs) with ·OH generation under ultrasound irradiation is fabricated and utilized for catalytic cancer therapy. This interplanar heterojunction is prepared through replacing chlorine from iron oxychloride with hydroxyl. Benefiting from the longer hydroxyl bond length and enhanced affinity with water, the alkali replacement treatment integrates interplanar heterojunction synthesis and exfoliation in one step. In particular, a build-in electric field facilitated Z-scheme interplanar heterojunction is formed due to the aligning Fermi levels. The holes on the valence band of FeOCl have great ability to catalyze O<sub>2</sub> evolution from H<sub>2</sub>O, meanwhile, the generated O<sub>2</sub> is immediately and directly reduced to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by the electrons on the conductive band of FeOOH.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Chemodynamic therapy (CDT), a representative catalytic therapy, is a burgeoning treatment strategy that applies Fenton or Fenton-like reactions to generate hydroxyl radical (·OH) with high cytotoxicity for inducing cancer cell apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The production of ·OH via catalyzing the disproportionation reaction of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) depends on Fenton chemistry, which requires neither external energy input nor oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) as substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Such a distinct mode of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production enables CDT to circumvent the primary obstacles of tumor hypoxia-associated resistance and limited light penetration depth in cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Accordingly, much research effort has been dedicated to the development of CDT. In the past decades, various reductive ions, such as Fe-based and other metal-based nanomaterials with the capability of catalyzing Fenton-type reactions have been developed for tumor CDT by using endogenously produced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as the substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, although the intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> level in most cancer cells is higher than that in normal cells, the endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is still not nearly enough to meet the demand for satisfactory chemodynamic efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. As far as this is concerned, the introduction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> self-supplying ability into CDT agents is highly desirable for achieving a satisfactory anticancer effect.</p><p id="Par4">Two different patterns have been developed to improve the content of intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>: enhancement of endogenously mitochondrial production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or supplement via exogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation or delivery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, the endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced in mitochondria will inevitably be decomposed rapidly by cellular scavenging enzymes such as peroxidases and catalase before approaching CDT agents to initiate Fenton-type reactions, leading to poor practicability of endogenously produced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for enhancing chemodynamic efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In addition, the delivery of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or its precursor by nanocarriers to enhance intracellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration was limited by low delivery capacity, random release, and unsustainability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Currently, the most used H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> producers, glucose oxidase and its mimics, collaborated with a catalyst to yield ·OH, which enhances chemodynamic efficacy to some extent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, the glucose oxidase and its mimics mediated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production from glucose and O<sub>2</sub> are severely limited by the undesired elimination during blood circulation and tumor hypoxia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Despite enormous struggles, engineering CDT agents with specific and efficient H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-supplementing functionality without being limited to the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains a great challenge.</p><p id="Par5">In our previous studies, two-dimensional (2D) heterojunction with independent and separated oxidation and reduction centers have revealed great potential in photo-catalyzed water splitting, CO<sub>2</sub> reduction, and photo-induced cancer catalytic therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Specifically, the separated electrons in the conduction band (CB) of one catalyst with high reduction potential are able to catalyze various reduction reactions, such as O<sub>2</sub>/·O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup>, CO<sub>2</sub>/CO, O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, et al., meanwhile, the separated holes in the valence band (VB) of the other catalyst with high oxidation potential also have ability to mediated diverse oxidation reactions, such as GSH/GSSG, OH<sup>−</sup>/·OH, H<sub>2</sub>O/O<sub>2</sub>, et al. Therefore, 2D heterojunction with ability to realize reduction and oxidation reactions synchronously provides an alternative detour strategy for some reactions, which are difficult to be realized in one step, for example, in situ generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> through two-step circuitous strategy <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq1_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

However, the endogenous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is still not nearly enough to meet the demand for satisfactory chemodynamic efficacy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Moreover, the reported H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> supplying strategies to improve chemodynamic efficacy were restricted to safety, targeting, and tumor hypoxic microenvironment. Hence, engineering CDT agents with specific and efficient H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-supplying functionality without being limited to the TME is a huge breakthrough for clinic development of CDT and cancer treatment.</p><p id="Par7">In this work, we develop a smart wet-chemical strategy based on an alkali replacement reaction that can intelligently integrate interplanar heterojunction synthesis and two-dimensional ultrathin heterojunction exfoliation in one step. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the bulk layered iron oxychloride (FeOCl) is synthesized by the hydrothermal process using iron chloride (FeCl<sub>3</sub>) as a substrate. Afterward, the alkali etching strategy is applied to replace chlorine (–Cl) with hydroxyl (–OH), which not only widens the interlayer space but also increases interlayer water molecule infiltration due to the longer hydroxyl bond length and enhanced affinity with water molecules. Under probe sonication, 2D ultrathin heterojunction (FeOCl/FeOOH) with few nanometers are easily exfoliated. After PEGylation with PEG-NH<sub>2</sub>, the engineering FeOCl/FeOOH nanosheets (NSs) based interplanar heterojunction with efficient H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> self-supplying ability using H<sub>2</sub>O as the only substrate is developed and exhibits a highly efficient chemodynamic effect. In the interplanar heterojunction FeOCl/FeOOH NSs, FeOCl part and FeOOH part with different Fermi levels and energy band structures contacting with each other induces charges to redistribute at their interfaces due to the aligning Fermi levels, which mediates the construction of a built-in electric field in their interface. Upon US irradiation, the US-excited electrons on the CB of FeOCl is combined with the holes on the VB of FeOOH guided by the built-in electric field in their interface, leaving stronger reduction/oxidation potentials of separated electrons and holes on the CB of FeOOH and the VB of FeOCl. Meanwhile, a Schottky barrier is formed owing to the band bending at their interface, which further suppresses the electron flow from FeOOH to FeOCl and enhances their Z-schemed charges transfer. Hence, a built-in electric field and Schottky barrier facilitated Z-schemed catalytic mechanism is constructed, in which the holes on the VB of FeOCl have great ability to oxidize H<sub>2</sub>O and produce O<sub>2</sub>, meanwhile, the generated O<sub>2</sub> is immediately and directly reduced to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by the electrons on the CB of FeOOH. The self-supplying H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> guarantees the continuously and endlessly ·OH generation via the Fenton-like reaction catalyzed by both FeOCl and FeOOH. The obtained FeOCl/FeOOH NSs with highly efficient chemodynamic effect exhibit excellent anti-tumor performance both in vitro and in vivo. Hence, this research not only affords a smart method to synthesize two-dimensional ultrathin heterojunction, but also demonstrates a proof-of-concept application of the obtained 2D heterojunction in tumor catalytic therapy, which may serve as a modest spur to induce future valuable contributions to other possible fields.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Schematic illustration of preparation of FeOCl/FeOOH nanosheets (NSs) for efficient catalytic cancer therapy.</title><p><bold>a</bold> FeOCl/FeOOH NSs with Z-schemed heterojunction were fabricated by hydrothermal process, liquid exfoliation, and NaOH etching.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, the size of the FeOCl powder was about 500 nm, and the layered structure was clearly exhibited in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of FeOCl (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a, b</xref>). In addition, the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) mappings observed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref> exhibited that these characteristic elements Fe, O, and Cl were uniformly distributed in FeOCl NSs, demonstrating the successful fabrication of FeOCl. In order to compare with FeOCl/FeOOH NSs, the FeOCl NSs were firstly prepared through liquid exfoliation of layered FeOCl powder in water via high-intensitive probe sonication. After 12 h of continuous sonication, the FeOCl NSs with the size of 120 nm were fabricated (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>). The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of FeOCl NSs were observed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, and the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) exhibited a distinct interference fringe and <italic>d</italic>-spacing of 0.395 nm corresponding to the plane of FeOCl (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), which provided direct evidence for the successful fabrication of the FeOCl NSs. For the preparation of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs-based interplanar heterojunction, the alkali etching strategy was applied to replace chlorine with hydroxyl. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, the color of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs became orange from the color of wine after alkali etching treatment. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e, f</xref> revealed the morphology of bulk FeOCl/FeOOH, in which the layered structure and a certain degree of curling around the edges of each layer were observed. The EDS mapping provided direct evidence for the replacement of chlorine with hydroxyl during alkali etching (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2j</xref>), in which Fe and O were still homogeneously distributed in whole NSs. However, Cl focused only on the central area of NSs. The replacement of chlorine with hydroxyl during alkali etching might be the main reason for the changes in their morphology. Afterward, a mild probe sonication was applied to exfoliate ultrathin FeOCl/FeOOH NSs from their bulk. After only 4 h of probe sonication at a mild intensity, the ultrathin FeOCl/FeOOH NSs with the size of about 115 nm were obtained (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2b</xref>). Although the conditions and time for exfoliation of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs were much milder and shorter than that of FeOCl NSs, the TEM images of ultrathin FeOCl/FeOOH NSs, exhibited in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>, were much thinner compared with the TEM images of FeOCl NSs from the contrast point of colors. The ultrathin layer of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs also was confirmed by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images, in which the thickness of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs was decreased to about 3 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2k–m</xref>). We attribute this easier-to-peel nature of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs to the alkali replacement reaction, which not only widens the interlayer space but also increases interlayer water molecule infiltration due to the longer hydroxyl bond length and enhanced affinity with water molecules. In order to deeply dig the effect of alkali replacement on the synthesis of this FeOCl/FeOOH NSs-based interplanar heterojunction, spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied. First, the fully optimized structures of the FeOCl and FeOOH NSs are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>. The bond length of Fe-Cl in FeOCl is measured to be 1.72 Å. For FeOOH, the measured bond lengths of Fe–O and O–H are 2.03 and 0.98 Å, respectively. And the bond angle of Fe–O–H is measured to be 111.5°. The calculation results show that the distance between Fe and the outermost atoms (Cl in FeOCl or H in FeOOH) is elongated from 1.72 to 1.83 Å after –Cl was substituted to –OH. Second, to compare the hydrophilic property of FeOCl and FeOOH, the adsorption characteristics of these two substrates towards H<sub>2</sub>O molecule are investigated. The most stable adsorption configurations of H<sub>2</sub>O molecule on FeOCl and FeOOH nanosheets are demonstrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>. Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> contains the equilibrium distance, the intramolecular bond angle and bond length of H<sub>2</sub>O before and after adsorption, the adsorption energy, and charge transfer of each system. The calculated results show that H<sub>2</sub>O molecule binds on the surface of FeOOH with a closer distance than that in FeOCl. Adsorption behavior also leads to significant changes in the bond angle of H<sub>2</sub>O molecule, which decreased and increased by 1.779° and 0.704° in FeOCl and FeOOH systems, respectively. Note that in FeOOH adsorption system, the bond of O–H in H<sub>2</sub>O close to the surface is elongated from 0.972 to 1.101 Å, which makes a hydrogen bond of 1.25 Å formed. The other hydrogen bond with a length of 2.24 Å is contributed by the O in H<sub>2</sub>O and the H in FeOOH. Further, the adsorption energies of FeOCl and FeOOH towards H<sub>2</sub>O molecule are calculated to be −0.13 and −0.83 eV, respectively (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). The corresponding charge transfer is 0.001 and −0.006 respectively (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). The small absolute terms of the adsorption energy and the negligible charge transfer indicate that although the adsorption process could proceed spontaneously, the interaction between FeOCl nanosheet and H<sub>2</sub>O is very weak. While, the obtained absolute term of adsorption energy is remarkably higher, indicating the stable binding between H<sub>2</sub>O and FeOOH. These findings support that FeOOH has stronger hydrophilic properties than FeOCl. The mechanism can be explained as that the sites that form intermolecular hydrogen bonds with H<sub>2</sub>O increase after −Cl was substituted to −OH, which greatly improves the hydrophilic property. In addition, the HRTEM images showed the distinct interference fringe and <italic>d</italic>-spacing of 0.395 nm and 0.291 nm, which corresponded to the plane of FeOCl NSs and FeOOH NSs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Morphology and composition characterization of layered FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs.</title><p>SEM images of layered <bold>a</bold> FeOCl and <bold>e</bold> FeOCl/FeOOH, scale bar = 100 nm.

In the XPS spectra (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>), the specific peaks of Fe 2<italic>p</italic>, O 1<italic>s</italic>, and Cl 2<italic>p</italic> were observed, respectively. The typical high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe 2<italic>p</italic> of FeOCl NSs was exhibited in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>, the spectra were made up of four peaks at 711.75, 725.45, 718.25, and 731.85 eV, which were attributed to Fe<sup>3+</sup> 2<italic>p</italic><sub>3/2</sub>, Fe<sup>3+</sup> 2<italic>p</italic><sub>1/2</sub>, Fe<sup>3+</sup> 2<italic>p</italic><sub>3/2</sub> satellite, and Fe<sup>3+</sup> 2<italic>p</italic><sub>1/2</sub> satellite, respectively. For the typical high-resolution XPS spectra of Fe 2<italic>p</italic> of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs, except for these specific peaks of Fe 2<italic>p</italic> FeOCl NSs, another two specific peaks of Fe 2<italic>p</italic> FeOOH NSs were also observed, including Fe<sup>3+</sup> 2<italic>p</italic><sub>3/2</sub> and Fe<sup>3+</sup> 2<italic>p</italic><sub>1/2</sub> at 712.80 and 726.60 eV, further demonstrated the successful fabrication of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs heterojunction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>). More obvious evidence was exhibited in the high-resolution XPS spectra of O 1<italic>s</italic> and Cl 2<italic>p</italic>. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e, h</xref>, the replacement of chlorine with hydroxyl via alkali etching strategy was observed, in which the intensity of Cl 2<italic>p</italic> in FeOCl/FeOOH NSs dropped dramatically compared to that in FeOCl NSs. Additionally, the peak height and width of O 1<italic>s</italic> in FeOCl/FeOOH NSs were increased, which ascribed that the introduced hydroxyl group replaced Cl (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f, i</xref>). In the XRD spectra of FeOCl NSs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), all the XRD peaks are well-matched with JCPDS card No. 01-0081 corresponding to orthorhombic structured FeOCl nanocrystals, which demonstrated the high purity of synthesized FeOCl. After alkali etching, another respective crystal structures were observed, which corresponded with FeOOH (JCPDS No. 01-0136), illustrating the successful edge decoration. In the Raman spectra (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), the peaks of FeOCl at A<sub>1g</sub> mode (212 cm<sup>−1</sup>) and Eg mode (291 cm<sup>−1</sup>) are related to Fe−O stretching vibration. After alkali etching, the characteristic peaks of FeOOH at 240 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 400 cm<sup>−1</sup> were all exhibited in the spectrum of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs, which further demonstrated the successful edge decoration. Due to the biocompatibility and dispersibility are crucial for biomedical applications, the as-prepared FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs were modified by PEG-NH<sub>2</sub>. PEG(5k)-NH<sub>2</sub> positively charged was absorbed on the negatively charged surface of prepared FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>) via electrostatic attraction. The UV-vis-NIR absorbance spectra exhibited that there was no significant difference before and after PEG modification (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). The amount of PEG(5k)-NH<sub>2</sub> that was coated on the surface of the FeOCl/FeOOH NSs was ≈22.4% (w/w) as measured by thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). PEGylation of FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs possess an enhanced dispersion in water, phosphate buffer saline (PBS), and cell culture medium compared with bare NSs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>). So that, more catalytic active sites of PEGylated nanocatalysts were exposed to substrates than that of aggregated nanocatalysts. In addition, since the catalytic substrates are dissolved in water, PEG modification can effectively increase the surface hydrophilicity of nanomaterials, and thus increase the adsorption of substrate molecules, such as dissolved O<sub>2</sub>, GSH, and H<sub>2</sub>O, on the surface of prepared NSs. Therefore, PEGylation of prepared NSs or other nanocatalysts is necessary for safeguarding their catalytic activity. More important, for intravenously injected nanomedicines, PEG modification is an important means to ensure that nanomedicines are not cleared by immune cells, so as to fully guarantee the circulation time and tumor enrichment of nanomedicines in vivo. Therefore, PEGylation is essential for nanomedicine used in vivo, and all of the catalytic properties, in vitro, and in vivo experiments in this research were carried out after PEGylation of FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs. In addition, the Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) absorption spectra exhibited these specific bands of C=O and –CH at ~1250 cm<sup>−1</sup> and ~2900 cm<sup>−1</sup>, further demonstrated the modification of PEG (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Chemical composition and structure characterization of layered FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> XPS spectra of FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs. <bold>b</bold> XRD spectra of FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs. <bold>c</bold> Raman shift spectra of FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs. <bold>d</bold>, <bold>g</bold> HRXPS spectra of Fe 2<italic>p</italic> in FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs. <bold>e</bold>, <bold>h</bold> HRXPS spectra of Cl 2<italic>p</italic> in FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs. <bold>f</bold>, <bold>i</bold> HRXPS spectra of O 1<italic>s</italic> in FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs.

In this study, methylene blue (MB) was selected as an indicator to detect the ability of ·OH generation of FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs via Fenton reactions. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref> displayed the degradation of MB within 30 min under different treatments with 50 μM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as substrate. For the FeOCl NSs group, there was a gentle decrease in MB content, meaning FeOCl NSs could catalyze the disproportionation reaction of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to generate ·OH. Comparably, a slightly enhanced degradation of MB was observed treated with FeOCl/FeOOH NSs and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which might attribute to the ultrathin layered structure of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs exposing more catalyzing sites compared with FeOCl NSs. Interestingly, a much obvious and faster degradation of MB was exhibited coupling FeOCl NSs with US irradiation, which should be ascribed to the US treatment promotes ionization of Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> and enhances the ·OH generation. Moreover, the fastest degradation of MB was observed in FeOCl/FeOOH NSs + US group. Similar to FeOCl NSs + US group, the promoting ionization of Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> under US irradiation should be one of the reasons for the efficient ·OH generation. We speculated that the improved concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> might be the prime reason for such a great extent improvement of ·OH generation. In order to verify our speculation, the degradation of MB under FeOCl NSs + US and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs + US treatments without extra added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were tested. For FeOCl NSs + US without H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> group, there was negligible degradation of MB, demonstrating the source of ·OH is the extra added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Surprisingly, a very obvious and fast ·OH generation was exhibited under FeOCl/FeOOH NSs + US treatment even without any extra added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. This interesting phenomenon demonstrated the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> self-supplying ability of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs coupling with US irradiation. To further confirm the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> self-supplying ability of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs coupling with US irradiation, the changes of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration in the above reaction system were synchronously detected and recorded with degradation of MB. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c, d</xref>, for these FeOCl NSs group, FeOCl/FeOOH NSs group, and FeOCl NSs + US group with extra added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the decreased H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were identified with the generation of ·OH, which means the extra added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was the only source of ·OH. For FeOCl NSs + US group without extra added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, there was also no H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation, demonstrating the FeOCl NSs exposed to the US cannot generate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> due to unfavorable band position of FeOCl to generate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The significantly slow decreasing of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration in FeOCl/FeOOH NSs + US with extra added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> group and the obvious generation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in FeOCl/FeOOH NSs + US without extra added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> group directly confirmed the excellent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> self-supplying ability of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs coupling with US irradiation. Moreover, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ·OH production data catalyzed by FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs with or without US irradiation and with or without PEGylation were also detected and quantitative analysis. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">b</xref>, the quantitative ·OH and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> production data were identified with the data exhibited in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a, c</xref>. In addition, under the same condition, FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs with PEGylation displayed higher catalytic activity compared to that without PEGylation. The enhanced dispersibility endowed by PEGylation providing much more catalytic active sites should be the main reason. To understand the microscopic mechanism of the hydroxyl radical generation, we calculated the Gibbs free energy change (ΔG) of the H<sub>2</sub>O pathway and the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> pathway, respectively, using DFT method. The ΔG is an effective parameter to character the catalytic activity, which follows the expression below,<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><mml:math id="Equ1_Math"><mml:mo>△</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">G</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>△</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo>△</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">ZPE</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi><mml:mo>△</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">S</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

For the H<sub>2</sub>O pathway, one H<sub>2</sub>O molecule undergoes steps (a) and (b) successively to generate one ·OH molecule. The ΔG of step (a) and (b) are 3.14 eV and −0.27 eV, respectively, meaning that the rate-limiting step to generate ·OH from H<sub>2</sub>O is step (a) with an energy barrier of 3.14 eV. For H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> pathway, one H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> molecule generate one ·OH molecule via step (c) with an energy barrier of 1.57 eV. Although the two proposed catalytic reaction pathways are endothermic processes, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> pathway has a much lower energy barrier and less energy requirement, so a more favorable ·OH generation mechanism is that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> molecules are catalyzed by FeOOH via one-step Fenton reaction.</p><p id="Par13">The redox homeostasis and hypoxia in TME bring about great obstacles for the effect of CDT and apoptosis of cancer cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Here, we intend to evaluate the capacities of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs to modulate the TME, including GSH consumption and O<sub>2</sub> generation. GSH, one of the most important keys to regulate intracellular REDOX equilibrium, was over-expressed in tumor cells. The intratumoral over-expressed GSH (0.32 eV oxidation potential of GSH/GSSG) was also oxidized by other oxidants, such as Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> pairs and separated holes. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>, f and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>, for FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs groups, the ionization of Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> could be the primary reason for the oxidation of GSH. For FeOCl NSs + US and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs + US groups, the excited holes with strong oxidated ability contributed to the other part of the oxidation of GSH. Due to the Fenton reaction recirculates Fe<sup>3+</sup>, FeOCl NSs  + US and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs + US groups with extra added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> also accelerated the consumption of GSH. In addition, because of the high oxidizability of Fe<sup>3+</sup>, a continuous O<sub>2</sub> production was observed in FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs with extra added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> groups (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g, h</xref>). Interestingly, the O<sub>2</sub> generation was greatly enhanced exposed to US irradiation. Coupling with the O<sub>2</sub> generation in NSs + US groups even without added H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the US-excited holes catalyzed water splitting may be the main reason for the continued O<sub>2</sub> generation.</p><p id="Par14">One of the most popular US-mediated catalysis is piezo-catalysis relied on piezoelectric materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. A piezocatalytic reaction is generally due to piezoelectric polarization generated by piezoelectric materials triggering an electrochemical process. Piezoelectric materials with noncentrosymmetric structures possess electric dipoles, which will form an external electric field under mechanical deformation, such as US irradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Hence, in order to dig the mechanism of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs mediated catalysis under US irradiation, the piezoelectric properties of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs were characterized in detail. To probe piezoelectric properties in FeOCl/FeOOH NSs, piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) technique has been employed. A localized point-to-point piezo-response of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs has been probed by applying a probe bias of ±8 V. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">b</xref> represent PFM amplitude and phase signals, respectively. However, amplitude butterfly loop and phase hysteresis, the representative properties of piezoelectric materials, were not observed in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">b</xref>, which illustrated there were no piezoelectric properties in FeOCl/FeOOH NSs and piezo-catalysis might not be the main mechanism behind FeOCl/FeOOH NSs. Another possible mechanism of this reaction is sonodynamic or sonocatalytic effect relied on sonosensitizers or sonocatalysts. The sonosensitizers or sonocatalysts are mainly semiconductors with suitable band structure, which are similar to photosensitizers or photocatalysts. When traveling through a liquid environment or tissue, the US will induce gas-filled microbubbles to oscillate in the acoustic field. This process is called cavitation and with the increase of the acoustic pressure, the microbubbles will finally implode. Upon implosion of the microbubbles, lots of heat and sometimes light (sonoluminescence) is released. Such an energy in a short period of time is able to trigger the separation of electron-hole pairs of sonosensitizers to generate ROS by catalyzing redox reaction with surrounding substrates. Hence, in order to deeply dip the mechanism of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs mediated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> self-supplying under US irradiation, the band structure, including band gaps, conductive band levels, and valence band levels, and the electrostatic potentials, including work functions and Fermi levels, were detected and calculated detailly. Firstly, the band structure of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs was tested and calculated via diffuse reflection absorption and XPS spectra. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>, due to the heterojunction structure, two curves of the diffuse reflection absorption of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs were exhibited. Calculating from their tangent lines, the band gaps (Eg) of FeOCl and FeOOH in FeOCl/FeOOH NSs were detected to be 1.8 and 2.1 eV, respectively. The XPS spectra supplied the VB values of FeOCl and FeOOH of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs, which calculated to be 2.7 and 2.2 eV, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). Then, the CB values of FeOCl and FeOOH were determined to be 0.9 and 0.1 eV, calculated from the difference between Eg and VB. As reported previously, this crossed band structure could induce type II or Z scheme charges transfer in the interface of this heterojunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. For the type-II heterojunction, the photo/sono-excited electrons will aggregate transfer from the high CB of FeOOH to low CB of FeOCl, meanwhile, the photo/sono-excited holes will aggregate to low VB of FeOOH from high VB of FeOCl. As exhibited in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>, the conventional type-II heterojunction-induced interfacial charge transfer would sharply damage the redox force of heterojunction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In addition, the strong Coulomb electrostatic repulsive force between identical charges would hinder the type-II heterojunction-induced interfacial charge transfer. Z-scheme electron transfer is another potential electron transfer route. Basically, the excited electrons in the CB of FeOCl will be combined with the holes in the VB of FeOOH, maintaining stronger reduction/oxidation potentials of separated electrons and holes on the CB of FeOOH and the VB of FeOCl. Hence, this Z-scheme heterojunction seems to be more reasonable from viewpoint of kinetics and beneficial to the subsequent catalytic reaction, than type II heterojunction.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Catalytic mechanism analysis of FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> UV–Vis absorbance spectra and <bold>b</bold> calculated band gap of FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs. <bold>c</bold> Valence band of FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs calculated from XPS spectra.

The electrostatic potentials of FeOCl and FeOOH were shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d, e</xref>, in which the work functions of FeOCl and FeOOH were determined to be 6.68 and 4.83 eV, respectively. Due to the difference of work function, a potential charge transfer at the interface of FeOCl and FeOOH was constructed. The greater work function of FeOCl will give rise to the charge transfer from FeOOH to FeOCl until the Fermi level equilibrium. This charge transfer will lead to the formation of a built-in electric field at their interface. Hence, the FeOOH is positively charged, while the FeOCl is negatively charged at the interface. This result is consistent with the charge transfer from FeOOH to FeOCl as revealed by XPS results. As observed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d–i</xref>, noticeably, the binding energy of Fe 2<italic>p</italic>, Cl 2<italic>p</italic>, and O 1<italic>s</italic> in FeOCl/FeOOH NSs were shifted by 0.2–0.5 eV toward lower binding energy in comparison with those of pristine FeOCl NSs, indicating that the electrons transferred from FeOOH to FeOCl upon hybridization due to the difference of their work functions and Fermi levels. Such electron transfer also demonstrated that a built-in electric field at their interfaces pointing from FeOOH to FeOCl was constructed, facilitating the construction of Z-scheme FeOCl/FeOOH heterojunction without any redox mediator, which would efficiently separate the charge carriers and thus promote the reduction and oxidation reactions catalyzed separated electrons and holes. The built-in electric field facilitated Z scheme charges transfer in this FeOCl/FeOOH-based heterojunction was presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>. In addition, the E<sup>0</sup> of oxidation of H<sub>2</sub>O/O<sub>2</sub> (1.23 eV) and GSH/GSSG (0.3 eV) were lower than the VB of FeOCl. And the E<sup>0</sup> of reduction of O<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (0.69 eV) was lower than that of the CB of FeOOH. Hence, from a thermodynamic point of view, under US irradiation, it is feasible and convenient for H<sub>2</sub>O oxidation to produce O<sub>2</sub> via the holes in the VB of FeOCl, and the produced O<sub>2</sub> is then reduced to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> via the electrons in the CB of FeOOH, realizing the in situ H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation without any limitation from the tumor microenvironment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f, g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Antitumor strategy and biocompatibility in vitro</title><p id="Par16">Next, the TME-modulating and antitumor effect of FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs in vitro were investigated in detail. At first, the cytotoxicity of FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs to normal cells, such as human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) and human normal liver cells (HL-7702) were detected. As exhibited in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>, both the FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs exhibited good biocompatibility and safety to normal cells. By contrast, the FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs showed obviously specific cytotoxicity to cancer cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>). The generated more cytotoxic OH via Fenton reaction resulted from high content of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in TME would be the primary cause for the specific cytotoxicity to cancer cells of FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs. A calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM)/propidium iodide (PI) staining assay was performed to intuitively observe live and dead cells after various treatments. The results exhibited in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref> showed obvious apoptosis in FeOCl NSs group, FeOCl/FeOOH NSs group, and FeOCl NSs + US group, while the maximum amount of apoptosis was observed in FeOCl/FeOOH NSs + US group. Next, for the TME-modulating capacity of FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs, the O<sub>2</sub>-generating, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-generating, and GSH-consuming performance in MCF7 cells was tested by using their corresponding assay kits. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c, d</xref>, a rapid and FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs concentration-dependent GSH-consuming and O<sub>2</sub> evolution performance was exhibited, which attribute to the reaction between Fe<sup>3+</sup> in NSs and GSH or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In addition, the GSH-consuming ability was enhanced coupling with US irradiation, which might result from the excited holes oxidated GSH to GSSG. For the FeOCl NSs + US group, the US irradiation excited holes have a high oxidation potential for catalyzing H<sub>2</sub>O splitting with O<sub>2</sub> evolution from H<sub>2</sub>O. Nevertheless, although the Z-scheme FeOCl/FeOOH NSs heterojunction promotes the separation of US-excited electrons and holes, which may accelerate H<sub>2</sub>O splitting and O<sub>2</sub> evolution, the O<sub>2</sub> concentration was much lower than that of the FeOCl NSs  + US group. The main reason may be the reduction of O<sub>2</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by the US-excited electrons. Meanwhile, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> self-supplying ability of FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs in TME is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>. For the FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs groups, the decrease of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> ascribed to the Fenton reaction mediated by NSs, which is also the major cause for the poor chemodynamic effect of Fenton reaction without replenishing of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. For the FeOCl NSs + US group, the US irradiation accelerating Fenton reaction led to the fast consumption of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. However, with increasing of NSs concentration and chemodynamic effect, the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> nearly maintain a steady concentration, which further confirmed the excellent H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> self-supplying ability of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs under US irradiation.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Biocompatibility and cytotoxicity of FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Relative viability of normal human cells (HL-7702 and HEK293) after incubation with FeOCl NSs or FeOCl/FeOOH NSs for 24 h. <bold>b</bold> Relative viability of MCF7 cells after incubation with FeOCl NSs or FeOCl/FeOOH NSs under different treatments for 24 h. <bold>c</bold> The generation of O<sub>2</sub> of MCF7 cells after incubation with FeOCl NSs or FeOCl/FeOOH NSs under different treatments. <bold>d</bold> The degradation of GSH of MCF7 cells after incubation with FeOCl NSs or FeOCl/FeOOH NSs under different treatments. <bold>e</bold> The consumption of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> of MCF7 cells after incubation with FeOCl NSs or FeOCl/FeOOH NSs under different treatments. <bold>f</bold> FCM images of MCF7 cells after incubation with FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs under different treatments for 12 h.

FeOCl/FeOOH NSs plus US irradiation treatment triggered the strongest green fluorescence signal, due to the self-supplying H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> ability of interplanar heterojunction.

After separating MCF7 tumor-bearing mice into six groups randomly, different treatments were carried out to each group: treatment 1: saline; treatment 2: US; treatment 3: FeOCl NSs; treatment 4: FeOCl/FeOOH NSs; treatment 5: FeOCl NSs + US; and treatment 6: FeOCl/FeOOH NSs + US. The dose of FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs intravenously injected into mice in treatments 3, 4, 5, and 6 were 5 mg/kg. The US treatment (1 MHz, 1 W cm<sup>−2</sup>, 50% duty cycle) in treatments 5 and 6 were performed at 24 h post-injection of NSs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8e–g</xref>, no significant tumor growth inhibition could be observed in the control (treatment 1) or US-only (treatment 2), but to a certain extent curative effect was exhibited in FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs alone treated mice (treatments 3 and 4). The production of ·OH through FeOCl NSs or FeOCl/FeOOH NSs mediating Fenton reaction and consumption of GSH might be the primary cause for this mild inhibition of tumor growth. Treatment 5 exhibited a better therapeutic effect compared to treatment 3, demonstrating the advantages of US irradiation for enhancing chemodynamic effect via improving ionization of Fe<sup>2+</sup>/Fe<sup>3+</sup> in FeOCl NSs. Notably, treatment 6 obtained nearly complete elimination of tumors without recurrence due to the largely enhanced chemodynamic effect via FeOCl/FeOOH NSs-based interplanar heterojunction with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> self-supplying ability. The tumor inhibition rate based on the average volume of tumors exhibited that the tumor inhibition rate of the treatment 6 group was 99.8% (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref>). The excellent therapeutic outcomes of interplanar heterojunction-mediated catalytic therapy were also exhibited in the tumor-bearing mice images (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>). Correspondingly, FeOCl/FeOOH NSs coupled with US treatment were associated with a high survival rate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8h</xref>). Moreover, all treatments showed nearly no side effects (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8i</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>ROS burst in vivo</title><p id="Par21">In order to further confirm the highly efficient catalytic performance, the ROS generation in vivo was investigated by DCFH-DA staining. Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a, b</xref> exhibited similar ROS production detected in vitro. Specifically, a mild ROS accumulation after treatment with FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs alone. Treatment with FeOCl/FeOOH NSs + US showed a strong green fluorescence, indicating the highest chemodynamic efficacy. Next, Cleaved Caspase-3 (C-CAS3) and γ-H2AX, markers for cell apoptosis and DNA double-strand breaks, respectively, were employed to analyze the cell apoptosis and DNA damage levels in vivo. Due to limited substrates in TME, a certain extent of cancer cell apoptosis and irreparable DNA damage were observed in FeOCl NSs and FeOCl/FeOOH NSs-treated mice. Coupling with US irradiation, the tumor section exhibited remarkably high levels of cell apoptosis and irreparable DNA damage, especially for FeOCl/FeOOH NSs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9a, d</xref>). Furthermore, 8-OHdG was investigated to demonstrate this potential mechanism (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9c</xref>). Collectively, these above results demonstrated that the FeOCl/FeOOH NSs-based catalytic therapy could efficiently induce a ROS burst and specifically cancer cell apoptosis.

The UV-vis-NIR absorbance of the residual FeOCl/FeOOH NSs left in the dialysis bag was detected every 2 days during the 14 days dialysis to evaluate the degradation rate. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10a–c</xref>, very slow biodegradation behaviors of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs were observed in PBS and medium solutions, demonstrating a good storage stability. A relatively fast biodegradability behavior of FeOCl/FeOOH NSs was exhibited in serum, which illustrated a desired biodegradability in vivo.

Catalysis, a versatile “tool”, has created a colorful world for human beings’ survival and development over the past several centuries. In the past decade, cross-amalgamation catalysis and medicine, named catalytic medicine or catalytic therapy, have integrated catalytic technology to solve medical problems, providing effective therapeutic strategies for a variety of diseases, especially cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. According to different catalytic mechanisms, catalytic therapy is divided into two categories: exogenous excitation catalysis and nonexogenous excitation catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Among them, exogenous excitation catalytic therapies mainly refer to the catalytic reactions triggered by specific external stimuli, such as light and US. Photodynamic therapy is the most representative light-triggered catalytic therapy, which severely limited by the poor penetration of light. US has been broadly used in clinic for disease diagnosis and treatment based on its noninvasiveness, minor energy attenuation, and high tissue-penetrating capability, such as US imaging, sonodynamic therapy, and piezocatalytic therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Piezocatalytic therapy relying on the piezoelectric polarization generated by piezoelectric materials triggering an electrochemical process, holds great potential in tumor therapy and other biomedical fields. However, the high demand for piezoelectric materials has limited the development of piezocatalytic therapy. Sonodynamic or sonocatalytic therapy mainly refers to the electron-hole pair separation of catalysts under US irradiation, and use the redox capacity of the separated electrons or holes to catalyze a certain redox reaction to produce therapeutic products. The broad spectrum of the catalyst and the deep penetration of US give sonodynamic/sonocatalytic therapy unparalleled advantages.</p><p id="Par24">As one of the most representative nonexogenous excitation catalysis, CDT, applying relatively high expression of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in tumor cells as target and substrate for production of highly cytotoxic ·OH, is a burgeoning and promising cancer treatment strategy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, due to the poor catalytic activity of traditional CDT agents and limited substrate concentration, currently, CDT alone cannot achieve satisfactory efficacy, and is often used as a complementary therapy combined with other therapies. During past decades, despite enormous struggles, engineering CDT agents with high catalytic activity, specific and efficient H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-supplying functionality without being limited to the TME remains a great challenge.</p><p id="Par25">In this work, we presented a collaborative combination, in which 2D interplanar heterojunction FeOCl/FeOOH NSs with high Fenton reaction catalyzing activity and US-triggering H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> supplying ability were fabricated and created a clever combination between CDT and sonodynamic/sonocatalytic therapy. Firstly, a smart wet-chemical method based on alkali replacement reaction was developed to intelligently integrate interplanar heterojunction synthesis and two-dimensional ultrathin heterojunction exfoliation in one step. After PEGylation, the engineering FeOCl/FeOOH NSs functionalized with a characteristic interplanar heterojunction for efficient H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> self-supplying applying H<sub>2</sub>O as the only substrate was developed and exhibited a highly efficient chemodynamic effect. In the interplanar heterojunction FeOCl/FeOOH NSs, FeOCl part and FeOOH part with different Fermi levels and energy band structures contacting with each other induces charges to redistribute at their interfaces on account of the aligning Fermi levels, which mediates the construction of a built-in electric field at their interface. Under US irradiation, the US-excited electrons on the CB of FeOCl will be combined with the holes on the VB of FeOOH guided by the built-in electric field at their interface, leaving stronger reduction/oxidation potentials of separated electrons and holes on the CB of FeOOH and the VB of FeOCl. Meanwhile, a Schottky barrier was formed owing to band bending at their interface, which will prevent the electron flow from FeOOH to FeOCl and enhanced their Z-schemed charges transfer. Hence, a built-in electric field and Schottky barrier facilitated Z-schemed catalytic mechanism was constructed, in which the holes on the VB of FeOCl have a great ability to oxidize H<sub>2</sub>O and produce O<sub>2</sub>, meanwhile, the generated O<sub>2</sub> will be immediately and directly reduced to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by the electrons on the CB of FeOOH. The self-supplying H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> guarantees the continuously and endlessly ·OH generation via the disproportionated reaction catalyzed by both FeOCl and FeOOH. The obtained FeOCl/FeOOH NSs with highly efficient chemodynamic effects exhibited excellent anti-cancer performance both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, this research not only defines an intelligent strategy for the intelligent synthesis of 2D ultrathin heterojunction, but also gives evidence of the proof-of-concept application of the engineering 2D NSs in biomedical applications, which may also provide a certain incentive to make valuable contributions in other possible fields in the future. Since this 2D interplanar heterojunction uses H<sub>2</sub>O as the only needed exogenous substrate and US exposure triggering H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and ·OH generation guarantees the targeting and specificity and this catalytic therapy, 2D interplanar heterojunction FeOCl/FeOOH NSs mediated catalytic therapy should possess huge potentials in other biomedical fields, such as sterilization and anti-infection of the diabetic wound, operative wound, and other infections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par26">Ferric chloride (FeCl<sub>3</sub>), sodiun hydroxide (NaOH), 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), methylene blue (MB), [Ru(dpp)<sub>3</sub>]Cl<sub>2</sub> (RDPP), glutathione, 5,5′-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (30%) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.
