However, large fluctuation of solar energy depending on the length of the daytime is a serious problem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. To utilize solar energy in the night time, solar energy should be stored in the form of chemical energy and used as a fuel to produce electricity. In this context, H<sub>2</sub> has been regarded as the most promising candidate, because H<sub>2</sub> can be produced by photocatalytic water splitting and used as a fuel of H<sub>2</sub> fuel cells to generate electricity with a high efficiency without emission of harmful chemicals. However, the low solar energy conversion efficiency of H<sub>2</sub> production and the storage problem of gaseous H<sub>2</sub> have precluded the practical use of H<sub>2</sub> as a solar fuel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In contrast to gaseous H<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can be produced as an aqueous solution from water and O<sub>2</sub> in the air by the combination of the photocatalytic two-electron reduction of O<sub>2</sub> and the catalytic four-electron oxidation of water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

The energy density of aqueous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (60%) is 3.0 MJ l<sup>−1</sup> (2.1 MJ kg<sup>−1</sup>), which is comparable to the value (2.8 MJ l<sup>−1</sup>, 3.5 MJ kg<sup>−1</sup>) of compressed hydrogen (35 MPa). However, the photocatalytic production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from water and O<sub>2</sub> has yet to be combined with the consumption of the produced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> fuel cell because of the insufficient photocatalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

The onset of photocurrent for the oxidation of water was observed at 0.2 V (versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE)) in water (pH 1.3), which corresponds to the 110 mV of overpotential with respect to the value of flat band potential of WO<sub>3</sub> (0.09 V versus SCE at pH 1.3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. This overpotential is required as a driving force for the migration of the photogenerated electron from conduction band of WO<sub>3</sub> to FTO electrode. When the photocatalysis measurements of m-WO<sub>3</sub>/FTO were performed under the same conditions in seawater instead of pure water, about four times larger photocurrent at 0.3 V (versus SCE) than that in water together with the negative shift of onset potential from 0.2 V (versus SCE) to 0.1 V (versus SCE) was observed (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). In addition, the stability of a photocurrent obtained by applying 0.3 V (versus SCE) was also improved as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM795">Supplementary Fig. 5a</xref>. These improvements in the stability as well as the photocurrent in seawater can be explained by the efficient quenching of the photogenerated hole in VB by the oxidation of Cl<sup>−</sup>, as described above. These are consistent with the enhancement of photocatalytic production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in seawater (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). The Faradaic efficiencies in the photoelectrochemical water oxidation in water and in seawater were determined to be 77% and 93%, respectively, from the simultaneous measurements of O<sub>2</sub> evolution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM795">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>). The effect of Cl<sup>−</sup> on the electrochemical property of Co<sup>II</sup>(Ch)/CP was also studied by measuring cyclic voltammograms using the three-electrode electrochemical cell. The addition of tetra-<italic>n</italic>-butylammonium chloride (0.1 M) to a N<sub>2</sub>-saturated PhCN solution containing Co<sup>II</sup>(Ch) (1 mM) and tetra-<italic>n</italic>-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF<sub>6</sub>; 0.1 M) resulted in the large negative shift of the redox potential for [Co<sup>III</sup>(Ch)]<sup>+</sup>/Co<sup>II</sup>(Ch) from 0.37 to 0.01 V (versus SCE; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM795">Supplementary Fig. 6a,b</xref>). In addition, no catalytic current was obtained for the O<sub>2</sub> reduction in the presence of Cl<sup>−</sup> in an O<sub>2</sub>-saturated PhCN solution containing HClO<sub>4</sub> (10 mM) as a proton source (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM795">Supplementary Fig. 6c</xref>), suggesting that Cl<sup>−</sup> inhibits electron transfer from Co<sup>II</sup>(Ch) to O<sub>2</sub> because of the strong axial coordination of Cl<sup>−</sup> to the reaction centre of Co<sup>II</sup>(Ch) to form 5- or 6-coordinated inactive species. In contrast, the catalytic current for the O<sub>2</sub> reduction with Co<sup>II</sup>(Ch)/CP measured in seawater (pH 1.3) appeared at ca 0.34 V (versus SCE), which is virtually the same onset potential and catalytic current measured in water (pH 1.3), as shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>. This result indicates that the coordination of Cl<sup>−</sup> to Co<sup>II</sup>(Ch) adsorbed on the electrode surface in an aqueous solution is negligibly weak as compared with that in PhCN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Hence, the enhancement of photocatalytic production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is mainly derived from the acceleration of water oxidation at the photoanode.
