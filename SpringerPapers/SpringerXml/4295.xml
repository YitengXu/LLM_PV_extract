The carbon footprint is a measure of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions released into the atmosphere, which increases day by day, causing glaciers to melt and increase sea level, reduce water resources, and global warming. For Turkey, as a country trying to complete its economic development, signed international agreements such as the Paris Climate Agreement and Kyoto Protocol to reduce the carbon footprint give great importance to the studies estimating carbon footprint and making policies to reduce it. For this reason, in this study it is aimed to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions of Turkey in the year 2030 and to determine its damages to the economy. Time series forecasting algorithm in the WEKA data mining software was used for analysis, and population, gross domestic product, energy production, and energy consumption were used as independent variables. As a result of analysis using data from the years 1990–2017, as long as Turkey continues its course of gradually increasing the amount of current greenhouse gas emissions in the year 2030, 728.3016 metric tons of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent will be reached. It appears that these estimates remain below the rate of Turkey’s commitments at the Paris Climate Agreement that is considered to be promising for Turkey. However, the estimations in other studies should not be ignored; policy makers should determine policies accordingly.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Carbon

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Mankind has lived with nature since its creation and has been a part of nature. The protection of the world in which it lives is necessary for the sustainability of human existence. Realizing that environmental problems started to threaten the living conditions with economic development, humanity started to work towards increasing the quality of the environment. The course of these initiatives over the years has been as follows;
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par3"><italic>Stockholm Conference (1972):</italic> By organizing the conference, the United Nations argued that environmental problems and protection of the environment are the duty of all the countries of the world, and therefore the measures to be taken should be guided.

One of these indicators is the ecological footprint resulting from people’s production and consumption activities. Ecological footprint is defined as the fertile water and soil area required to eliminate waste generated by the activities of an individual or community and to reproduce the resources consumed with current technologies. The carbon footprint constitutes 46% of Turkey’s ecological footprint (WWF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>). Carbon footprint is the measure of the carbon dioxide emission that occurs at all stages of production, transportation, use, and degradation of a product. This measure is expressed by the term global hectare (kha), which indicates the production capacity of one hectare of land with a size of approximately 1.5 football fields. The carbon footprint is divided into primary (direct) and secondary (indirect). While the primary footprint refers to the energy consumption resulting from household appliances or the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions released from fossil fuels burned as a result of transportation during the day; the secondary footprint represents damage to nature throughout the entire life cycle. It is possible to learn how much carbon footprint is left to nature with carbon footprint calculation methods. In these calculations, un-harvested forest land that is required to remove every ton of carbon emitted into the atmosphere through photosynthesis is used. If the required forest land is not sufficient to eliminate the carbon emitted in terms of size and yield, it appears in the carbon capture category (Erden Özsoy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2015</xref>). Ultimately, the fact that the world exceeds its carrying capacity causes the ozone layer to perforate, causing the average temperature to rise, melting glaciers, and increasing sea level. All these troubles threaten sustainable world existence.</p><p id="Par8">When the greenhouse gas emissions, including CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, are examined, it is understood that the most important source comes from the energy sector. Unconscious use of sectors such as electricity production and consumption, industrial production, transportation, construction, and agricultural and forestry lands also increase the amount of toxic gas in the atmosphere (Pabuçcu and Bayramoğlu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">Many methods are used for future carbon footprint estimates, but studies using data mining methods have become important in recent years. Data mining methods generally focus on planning and decision making processes such as marketing strategies, and cost estimations. Data mining models can be divided into two categories: one of them is a descriptive model that provides explanatory information about the data set and the other one is a predictive model that tries to estimate the value of the dependent variable in accordance with a target (Ecemiş and Irmak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">Many countries are working on the green economy within the scope of sustainable development models planned with the goal of leaving a habitable world for future generations. Turkey still supplies a large part of its energy needs from environmentally enemy fossil fuels. For this reason, it is important for our country to carry out a measurement and forecasting study for the transition to the green economy and to offer solutions in this direction. The aim of this study is three-fold: to estimate the measurement of the carbon footprint in the 2018–2030 periods by using variables like population, primary electricity consumption, gross domestic product (GDP), and electricity generation based on the 1990–2017 period by using time series data mining methods and determine its damages to the economy and offer solutions.</p><p id="Par11">The article consists of five sections. In “Brief review of literature” section a literature review is presented. In “Methodology” section the research methodology and dataset are all explained in detail. In “Results and discussions” section the results of time series analysis are presented and discussed. The fifth and final section offers the solutions and concludes the paper.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Brief review of literature</title><p id="Par12">With the technological transformation developing in the economic literature, many studies on carbon dioxide emissions have been carried out. Most of these studies are towards reducing carbon emission rates with the transition to renewable energy, and policy recommendations have been developed in this context. Some of these studies are briefly discussed below.</p><p id="Par13">The study of economic growth and income injustice by Simon Kuznets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1955</xref>) became a benchmark for studies that examine the relationship between environmental degradation and income, defined by the Kuznets curve in later years. Kuznets found an inverted <italic>u</italic>-shaped relationship between the income levels of the countries and growth and he upheld that the income injustice will decrease as the income level increases (Kuznets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1955</xref>). Environmental Kuznets curve has been used in environmental studies based on Kuznets’ study, and findings have been reached that environmental degradation will increase as income level increases, but degradation will decrease if an increase continues after a level. The hypothesis that environmental pollution rates are higher compared to high-income countries with the increase in energy demands of developing countries, and the environmental degradation will decrease with the increase in income levels of countries, has been confirmed (Carson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1997</xref>; Halıcıoglu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>). Alam and others have addressed the causal relationship between energy consumption, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and economic growth of India using time series analysis with a dynamic modeling approach. In the study in which GDP, total energy consumption, total workforce, capital stock, and CO<sub>2</sub> emission rate were considered as variable, the period of 1971–2006 was evaluated by time series analysis and causality relationships were revealed. According to the results of the analysis, unlike the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis, there is no long-term relationship between income and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. A bidirectional causality relationship has been determined between energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub>, and no causal relationship has been found between energy consumption and income. For India, as a country consuming energy based on fossil fuels, it is recommended to produce energy-saving policies that can prevent global warming without ignoring the increase in income (Alam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>). Arı and Zeren examined the relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> emission and economic growth with the panel data analysis method. In the study, in which the data of Mediterranean countries for the period 2000–2005 was used to test the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis, an <italic>N</italic>-shaped curve was obtained between per capita income and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. The results of the study show that as the per capita income increases, CO<sub>2</sub> emission increases to a certain level, and the increase in energy use and population density per person increases CO<sub>2</sub> emission. In this context, it is recommended to produce incentive policies for companies to use clean technologies (Arı and Zeren <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par14">Apart from studies examining the income-environment relationship, there are studies conducted with different methods for estimating emission rates. Pabuçcu and Bayramoglu tried to estimate future greenhouse gas emission values of Turkey and selected 28 EU countries (2020–2030) using artificial neural networks. In the study consisting of many variables such as GDP, production and consumption of energy, population, and the energy used for transportation and greenhouse gas emission rates, it is predicted that greenhouse gas emission 1244.13 mt rates in 2030 will be above the promised rate (929 mt CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent) at Paris Climate Convention in case of continuation of the existing conditions in Turkey. The EU average is estimated to be 151.75 mt in 2030. As a result of the study, it is recommended for Turkey to use renewable energy to increase energy efficiency (Pabuçcu and Bayramoğlu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>). Çam et al. conducted their studies on energy efficiency. In the study, gross GDP of the years 1990–2013, capital stock per workforce, energy consumption, and CO<sub>2</sub> emission rates were used as variables and energy efficiency has been estimated with artificial neural network model by using the energy efficiencies obtained by the TOPSIS method. According to the results the most important determinant of Turkey’s energy efficiency has been the total energy consumption through the capital stock per labor. The long-term relationship between the ARDL boundary test and the variables was appointed, and it was found that capital stock per workforce, GDP, and energy consumption positively affect energy efficiency, and CO<sub>2</sub> energy efficiency negatively. It is recommended for Turkey to increase energy efficiency by using renewable energy sources (Çam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>). Hamzaçebi and Karakurt have analyzed Turkey’s CO<sub>2</sub> emission data of the years 1965–2012, by using gray forecasting method based on energy and tried to estimate Turkey’s CO<sub>2</sub> emission values for 2025. The results of the analysis show that the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> released into the atmosphere in 2025 will increase by 64%, reaching 496,404 mt compared to 2010. As a result, the gray estimation method can be used in CO<sub>2</sub> emission estimation both to establish energy policies and to ensure the sustainability of international agreements on climate changes (Hamzaçebi and Karakurt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>). Shaikh et al. has tried to create a framework considering Turkey’s water and carbon footprint consumption of existing and future. Based on the years of 1990–2013, energy production estimation was made for the year 2030 with the ARIMA model, and three different scenarios were established: the continuation of the current situation, the government plan, and the renewable energy development plan. In the continuation of the current situation, the water footprint for 2030 is 6.67 × 1011 gallons, and the carbon footprint is 2.05 × 108 tons, 7.5% less water footprint and 28% less carbon footprint than the first scenario in the government plan scenario. In the renewable energy development plan, there is 31.7% less water footprint and lowest carbon footprint estimation compared to the other two scenarios. It was determined that the strong correlation between water consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emission decreases as we move towards the renewable energy plan. As a result of the study, it is recommended to consider the renewable energy plan scenario for future energy conversion policies in terms of both carbon and water footprints compared to other scenarios (Shaikh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>). Kaya et al. tried to determine the wind energy potential of Kastamonu using artificial neural networks. They have found that some of the wind turbines are better at efficiency and Kastamonu is potentially suitable for building wind turbines. The study is important for feasibility, considering cost (Kaya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">Studies to predict carbon emission trends are a subject of interest to researchers around the world. Rezaei et al. modeled the carbon emission of four Scandinavian countries including Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway using the group method of data handling algorithm (GMDH) of the artificial neural network method. In this study, total primary energy consumption, type of utilized fuels, and GDP from 1990 to 2016 were considered as indicators. As a result of the research, it was found that the group method of data handling algorithm was a suitable method for carbon emission estimation (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.998) and the obtained output was very close to the actual data. In addition, variables considered as inputs were shown to be the most effective factor in estimating these Scandinavian countries (Rezaei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>). Jaforullah and King examined the effect of renewable energy sources on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. In the research in which the data of the United States between 1965 and 2012 were used, the relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> emission, nuclear energy consumption, renewable energy consumption, and real GDP variables were analyzed by using the vector error correction model (VECM). As a result of the analysis, they found that nuclear energy consumption has an insignificant but positive effect on CO<sub>2</sub>; there was a negative relationship between energy prices and emissions, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can decrease significantly by increasing the use of renewable energy sources. In the study conducted in the form of reassessment of previous studies, suggestions are given such as incentive usage of renewable energy instead of nuclear energy and carbon tax enforcement in order to reduce the emission rates (Jaforullah and King <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015</xref>). Wang and Ye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>) tried to estimate the carbon emission rate using fossil-weighted energy consumption between 2014 and 2020. They used ARIMA and non-linear gray prediction model for estimating the impact of low, medium, and rapid economic growth on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and offered solutions (Wang and Ye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>). In a research conducted in China, one of the most greenhouse gas-emitting countries in the world, it was determined that energy intensity has a decreasing effect on CO<sub>2</sub> emission. Zhang et al. analyzed the effect of China’s energy use intensity on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions based on 1991–2006 data and found that economic activities had an impact on greenhouse gas emissions and economic structure contributed little to changes in CO<sub>2</sub> emission intensity (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2009</xref>). Li et al. conducted the carbon emission rate of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, which uses fossil fuel to represent the entire country. They developed a new forecasting method called SVM-ELM which optimized the extreme learning machine algorithm by using kernel of support vector machines. They used gray prediction method for the region’s carbon use estimation and found that energy consumption seriously affects the amount of carbon emissions. Firstly, they estimated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions between 2017 and 2030 with gray prediction method. Then they used forecasting results as input for support vector machines. And thus, they proved that SVM-ELM methods had high accuracy of carbon emission prediction compared to support vector machines (SVM) or extreme learning machines (ELM). They stated that the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emission would be about 97 million tonnes after 2027, so they recommended that the government must be encouraged for clean energy (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2018</xref>). The research of Hertwich and Peters was about measuring the carbon footprint of 73 nations by dividing the world into 14 regions. It was divided into categories such as construction, shelter, clothing, service industry, mobility, and trade. CO<sub>2</sub> and other greenhouse gas emissions were estimated within the scope of the global trade analysis project with the global multiregional input-output model (MRIO). Countries with similar geographical characteristics were taken together and their estimations were stated as weighted averages. Operating result for the per capita carbon footprint that was the amount of about 28 t/yp for African countries, 33 t/yp for American countries, and 4.6 t/yp for Turkey had been detected. While there was a strong correlation between consumption expenditures and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, it was found that the food industry did not have a significant effect on the amount of emissions. Analysis results show that rich countries have low greenhouse gas emission rates compared to poor countries (Hertwich and Peters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>). The estimation study of the carbon footprint presented by Pandey et al. as a qualitative research with the current methods includes a wide literature review and different calculation methods. The study, which also shows the rates of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions made for enterprises, activities, and organizations of many countries, states that different calculations are caused by regional or calculation methods. It has been suggested that supervision is necessary due to the commercialization of carbon footprint calculations, and that the institutions performing these calculations should be encouraged by targeting transparent and sustainable development (Pandey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011</xref>). Vieilledent and his colleagues modeled Madagascar by separating 5 different regions where they examined the effect on deforestation and carbon emissions. For the deforestation and emission estimation of 2030, land cover change of 2000–2010 was divided into seven classes and used as a training dataset. For the future deforestation prediction, the demographic variable obtained from the using population census and the location factors determining the location of deforestation were obtained by logistic regression. With these models, estimation of deforestation was made until 2030. The relationship between this rate and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions was examined and it was found that the annual emission amount depends on the rate of deforestation (Vieilledent et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2013</xref>). Pao et al. analyzed China’s CO<sub>2</sub> emission data of the years 1980–2009, by using non-linear gray Bernoulli model (NGBM) to predict China’s CO<sub>2</sub> emission values for 2009–2020 period. They used energy consumption, real GDP, and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions as indicators. They used three comparative methods to estimate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions like ARIMA, (GM (1, 1)), and NGBM-OP. As a result of the obtained MAPE values in the study, it was found that the NGBM-OP was a stronger predictor than GM and ARIMA. Beside the prediction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, their study showed that there was a long-run equilibrium relationship between emissions, energy consumption, and real GDP (Pao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2012</xref>). In the research conducted by Behrang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>), carbon emission prediction was tried to forecast with multilayer perceptron neural network and bees’ algorithm. In the research, many socioeconomic indicators such as world population, primary energy demands, oil and natural gas trade movements, and GDP were used; an estimated value between 2007 and 2040 was created using the data of 1980–2006 period. For the study consisting of two stages, primarily GDP, population, oil, and natural gas trade movements were used as input variables depending on the bees’ algorithm; oil, natural gas, coal consumption, and primary energy consumption were output. On the second step, CO<sub>2</sub> emission value was tried to be estimated by using the output variables of the first step. Two separate scenarios were used for the first step: in the first scenario, a linear model determined by the fitted polynomial values and in the second scenario, the artificial neural network model that was trained and tested; the predictive results of each input variable were obtained. The estimated CO<sub>2</sub> emission value for the first scenario is 77,027 mt, and for the second scenario it is 75,611 mt. The results show that the two models have been successful for emission rates, fossil fuels, and energy consumption, and that policy makers can engage in energy planning practices using this study (Behrang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>). Jones and Kammen calculated all the variables that cause carbon footprint by categorizing them into energy, transportation, waste, water, food, goods, and services, and calculated by carbon footprint calculation methods, and removing the marginal reduction cost curves, it identified areas where carbon footprint savings can be made in their study about carbon footprint reduction for the American household and society. According to the study, it is stated that carbon savings can be achieved with many small changes such as purchasing fuel-saving vehicles, using eco-driving technique in vehicles, using bicycles or buses instead of individual vehicles, reducing flights by 20%, turning to energy-saving when choosing a refrigerator, and using the thermostat effectively and efficiently (Jones and Kammen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par16">As seen from the previous studies mentioned above, there are a limited number of studies on the greenhouse gas estimation for Turkey. In addition, in most of the studies, it has been observed that the carbon emission rate is tried to be estimated based on only one parameter. Therefore, in this comprehensive study, it is aimed to eliminate this gap by using various parameters that are thought to have an effect on the greenhouse gas emission rate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><p id="Par17">In this section detailed information about the dataset, methods, and evaluation criteria used in this the study is given.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data</title><p id="Par18">The variables used in the study were selected among the strong determinants of CO<sub>2</sub> emission obtained as a result of the literature review.

Time series are divided into two categories as continuous and discrete in the context of time. Continuously recorded series of engineering fields such as electrical signals, voltage, sound vibrations, and measurement of seismic movements are the continuous time series; interest series, sales volume, and production amount are the discrete time series (Can <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>).

These variables are very closely related to each other, for example, unemployment rate, inflation, growth, exports, imports, and investments. It is possible to reveal their structures and predict future values by analyzing each of these variables one by one.

A supervised learning algorithm is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. With supervised learning, output values corresponding to each input and input are given, and the algorithm generates outputs by making generalizations and modeling from examples.

As it has the ability to generalize and classify unobserved data during training, it gives more successful results in many real problems compared to artificial neural networks and decision trees. The SMO algorithm proposed by Platt classifies two-dimensional working sets by repeatedly selecting and optimizing them. SMOreg does this by maximizing the margin between the two classes.

Carson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1997</xref>), Halıcıoglu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>), and Alam et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>) examined the relationship between carbon emissions and income under the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis, while Hamzaçebi and Karakurt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>), Behrang et al.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2017</xref>) tried to estimate emissions by various methods. Zhang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2009</xref>), Jaforullah and King (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015</xref>), and Çam et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2018</xref>) conducted studies examining the relationship between CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and other variables and determined policies in line with these studies.</p><p id="Par36">In this study the greenhouse gas emission estimates of Turkey were obtained by time series mining methods using parameters such as population, GDP, energy production, and consumption variables. When examining the studies for Turkey, it was found that generally artificial neural network algorithms were used. Pabuçcu and Bayramoğlu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>) estimated the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for selected EU countries and Turkey by using artificial neural networks. Although almost the same variables were used in our study, different results were obtained. It is thought that the reason for these results was the use of five years of data in their study. The results of this study were compared to Hamzaçebi and Karakurt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>) the differences in the emission rates were noteworthy. In this study, emission results are estimated based on the energy variable, while considering other related variables in our study makes it possible to accept the difference of the results.</p><p id="Par37">National income per capita in a country gives some clues about the carbon footprint of that country. For this reason, GDP has been considered as a socioeconomic indicator in many studies on carbon emissions in the world. On the other hand, electricity consumption has been included in the studies as the most important independent variable affecting the carbon footprint. In this context, this study was similar to studies of Alam et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>), Behrang et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>), Pao et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2012</xref>), Jaforullah and King (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015</xref>), and Rezaei et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>), who used energy consumption and GDP variables. Since Alam et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2011</xref>) Jaforullah and King (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2015</xref>) conducted a time series analysis; the range of dataset was higher than other forecasting studies.</p><p id="Par38">Our study had similar aspects with the study of Li et al.

Although the examined regions were different, there was strong evidence in both studies that energy consumption increased the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and solutions were presented with this evidence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Conclusions and policy implications</title><p id="Par39">Ecological footprint reduction studies, which are regarded as one of the most important indicators of sustainable development, have reached a different dimension over the years with technological innovations and research and development planning. In this context, reducing the carbon footprint is a great sensitivity for all countries of the world and agreements are made in the international arena today. Under the Paris Climate Agreement which Turkey is a signatory, countries are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emission rates in accordance with adjusted rates. In accordance with this commitment, developed and developing countries determine energy policies by considering economic growth.</p><p id="Par40">Countries decide according to some criteria in determining energy policies. In terms of world countries, it is possible to divide use of energy into two categories as developed and developing countries. Every country, which is trying to realize its economic growth, tries to increase its production while the technology is stable in the first stage, and therefore uses more resources and energy in the production process. Due to the excessive energy and resource usage, the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> released into the atmosphere increases, causing deterioration of environmental quality. This condition, which is also called the effect of scale, takes place in the early stages of growth. As the growth continues, there is a structural transformation in the economy, the transition from labor-intensive production to technology-intensive production is made with the effect of growth, and environmental destruction starts to decrease with the use of technology in the energy sector, which is known as the structural effect. Finally, with the share allocated to R&amp;D investments in developed countries, a technological transformation is experienced and the environmental quality is improved by reducing the carbon footprint by using clean technology. This transformation, which is also called technological effect, continues in the last period in developed countries where per capita income is high (Koçak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par41">G20 countries, which constitute 85% of the world economy, continue to reduce their carbon footprint by increasing their energy efficiency in many sectors with the effect of technological transformation. For example, in the transportation sector, standards for reducing the emission rate arising from fuel consumption are implemented, and thus, up to 20% efficiency is achieved (Civelekoğlu and Bıyık <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2018</xref>). Apart from the transportation sector, there were also major transformations in renewable energy. For example, Tesla founder, Elon Musk, founded Solarcity Company, arguing that the world’s 1-year energy needs could be met by absorbing and storing 1 min of solar energy falling on the earth’s surface. The aim of this company is to meet the energy needs of the houses very cheaply by equipping the houses with solar cells. Solarcity, which was gone to the public in 2012, reduced the solar energy installation cost by 50% to 2.50 dollars per watt (Yılmaz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par42">After the 24th January 1980 decisions, a rapid industrialization process began in Turkey, which established an outward development model and struggled to integrate with the global economy. This process, with the increasing population of our country, has also increased the energy use required to increase production. Energy demand has started to increase with the increasing use of energy, and accordingly, the rate of destruction given to the environment has increased. This result is common, considering that overall economic growth increases environmental degradation in general. It should be remembered that many other variables such as population growth, open trade, and personal income are among the determinants of CO<sub>2</sub> emission besides energy consumption. Therefore, individuals and firms also have duties in the development of environmental quality as well as country policies.</p><p id="Par43">Industry sector which has a high proportion of energy use constitutes 70% of the rates of greenhouse gas emissions. Turkey, which is in the category of developing countries, wants to complete the economic development accompanied by sustainable development policies and has many renewable energy potentials such as hydraulic, solar, wind, and geothermal to achieve this. But it can only use a very small part of this potential. Turkey should first go to reduce energy use in the sector and it should be directed to renewable energy in order to complete the growth by making efficient use of energy with less carbon emissions.</p><p id="Par44">According to the carbon footprint calculations made in recent years, as stated in the 2010 issue of the Living Planet Report, it is estimated that until 2050, the world will be far above its carbon holding capacity and at least two more planets will be needed to survive unless we change our production and consumption habits. Since these planets have not been found yet, protecting the planet lives seems to be the only cure for human beings. For this reason, the studies carried out to develop appropriate strategies by making predictions about the future are important.</p><p id="Par45">In this study, the greenhouse gas emission of Turkey was examined over time changes with the effect of independent variables such as population, GDP, energy production, and energy consumption, and future forecasts were obtained by using time series mining. By looking at the comparison of the actual values and test results, it is seen that the SMOreg model predicts greenhouse gas emission at acceptable error levels. As a result of analysis using the data as long as 1990–2017 years, if Turkey continues the trend today greenhouse gas emissions gradually increasing the amount of 728.3016 was determined as CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent metric in the year 2030. It appears that these estimates remain below the rate of Turkey’s commitments at the Paris climate treaty that is considered to be promising for Turkey. However, the estimates in other studies should not be ignored; policy makers should determine policies accordingly.</p><p id="Par46">Considering the results obtained from the study, it is seen that the variables that affect the amount of emissions most are electricity generation and primary energy consumption. Although Turkey has high energy production potential due to the geographical features, it is an energy-dependent country due to the inability to use this potential efficiently. As Turkey realizes its growth, it must strive to use this potential to the full end. It should develop environmental protection policies in this direction by identifying possible carbon emission targets related to climate change. This target should be to reduce the carbon emission rate to 2010 levels by taking the necessary measures until 2030 according to the Base Path Scenario. Turkey needs to determine by scientific methods its share of global emission reduction, how to implement which low carbon development policies, and the costs and effects of these mitigate policies on the country’s economy. For this reason, a fair share of the global carbon budget should be determined with the Climate Equity Reference Calculator (WWF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2015</xref>). Under the target scenario, a climate policy package consisting of carbon tax, renewable energy investment fund, and energy efficiency tools should be implemented. Accordingly, it is envisaged that the share of wind and sun will be 44% by using the collected carbon taxes as a source for renewable energy applications (WWF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2015</xref>). Although Turkey ranks 12th in the world as the installed power of the wind farm, it still uses little of its potential. In this context, the wind stands can be established by determining potential locations with feasibility analyses. The country’s presence in mild climate and dominance of the sun in all 4 seasons ensures maximum use of the sun. Work on the designs of new solar panels should be encouraged to increase the share of the sun in electricity production. Surrounded by seas on all 3 sides, Turkey can turn this advantage into electrical energy with wave energy systems. This should help reduce Turkey’s energy dependence on the outside. The work of environmental protection organizations in Turkey should be taken into account and people need to be conscious to reduce the secondary footprint.</p><p id="Par47">The most important limitation of this research is that it is unpredictable how much the emission rates will change as a result of the unforeseen global Covid-19 outbreak. The failure to know the normal process of return to life and the end of the economic downturn in the return process may lead to a rapid increase in emission rates.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contribution</title><p>Conceptualization, E.
