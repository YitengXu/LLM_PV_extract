Ultimately, the drift was interpreted as a constant sunward deceleration of each particular spacecraft at the level of <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>P</italic></sub> = (8.74 ± 1.33) × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>. This apparent violation of the Newton’s gravitational inverse-square law has become known as the Pioneer anomaly; the nature of this anomaly remains unexplained. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the physical properties of the anomaly and the conditions that led to its detection and characterization. We review various mechanisms proposed to explain the anomaly and discuss the current state of efforts to determine its nature. A comprehensive new investigation of the anomalous behavior of the two Pioneers has begun recently. The new efforts rely on the much-extended set of radio-metric Doppler data for both spacecraft in conjunction with the newly available complete record of their telemetry files and a large archive of original project documentation. As the new study is yet to report its findings, this review provides the necessary background for the new results to appear in the near future. In particular, we provide a significant amount of information on the design, operations and behavior of the two Pioneers during their entire missions, including descriptions of various data formats and techniques used for their navigation and radio-science data analysis. As most of this information was recovered relatively recently, it was not used in the previous studies of the Pioneer anomaly, but it is critical for the new investigation.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pioneer Anomaly</kwd><kwd>Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs)</kwd><kwd>Anomalous Acceleration</kwd><kwd>Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)</kwd><kwd>Master Data Record (MDRs)</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2010</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ChapterContent</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41114_2016_Article_9095.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/TEX/41114_2016_9095_TEX.tgz</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>TEX</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Classical and Quantum Gravitation, Relativity Theory</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Cosmology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Astrophysics and Astroparticles</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>For generations of researchers our solar system provided opportunities to establish and test fundamental laws of gravity. By studying the motion of planets, their moons, and comets, astronomers learned the basic rules that govern the dynamics of a system of gravitating bodies. Today we apply this knowledge to study the universe around us, expecting that the same laws of gravity govern the behavior of the universe on large scales, from planetary systems similar to our own to galaxies and to the entire cosmos as a whole.</p><p>Astronomers, however, do not normally discover new laws of nature. We are not yet able to manipulate the objects of our scrutiny. The telescopes and detectors we operate are simply passive probes that cannot order the cosmos what to do. Yet they <italic>can</italic> tell us when something isn’t following established rules. For example, take the planet Uranus, whose discovery is credited to the English astronomer William Herschel and dated to 1781 (others had already noted its presence in the sky but misidentified it as a star). As observational data about its orbit accumulated over the following decades, people began to notice that Uranus’s orbit deviated slightly from the dictates of Newton’s gravity, which by then had withstood a century’s worth of testing on the other planets and their moons. Some prominent astronomers suggested that perhaps Newton’s laws begin to break down at such great distances from the Sun.</p><p>This led immediately to the question: What is there to do? Abandon or modify Newton’s laws and come up with new rules of gravity? Or postulate a yet-to-be-discovered planet in the outer solar system, whose gravity was absent from the calculations for Uranus’s orbit? The answer came in 1846, when astronomers discovered the planet Neptune just where a planet had to be for its gravity to perturb Uranus in just the ways measured. Newton’s laws were safe…for the time being.</p><p>Then there is Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun. Its orbit, too, habitually disobeyed Newton’s laws of gravity resulting in an anomalous precession of its perihelion. This anomaly was known for a long time; it amounts to 43 seconds of arc (”) per century and cannot be explained within Newton’s gravity, thereby presenting a challenge for physicists and astronomers. In 1855, the French astronomer Urbain Jean Joseph Le Verrier, who in 1846 predicted Neptune’s position in the sky within one degree, wrote that the anomalous residue of the Mercurial precession would be accounted for if yet another as-yet undiscovered planet — call it Vulcan — revolves inside the Mercurial orbit so close to the Sun that it would be practically impossible to discover in the solar glare, or perhaps it was an entire uncatalogued belt of asteroids orbiting between Mercury and the Sun.</p><p>It turns out that Le Verrier was wrong on both counts. This time he really did need a new understanding of gravity. Within the limits of precision that our measuring tools impose, Newton’s laws behave well in the outer solar system. However, they break down in the inner solar system, where the Sun’s gravitational field is so powerful that it warps space. And that is where we cannot ignore the effects of general relativity. It took another 60 years to solve this puzzle. In 1915, before publishing the historical paper with the field equations of the general theory of relativity (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>]), Albert Einstein computed the expected perihelion precession of Mercury’s orbit. This was not the first time Einstein tackled this problem: indeed, earlier versions of his gravity theory were rejected, in part, because they predicted the wrong value (often with the wrong sign) for Mercury’s perihelion advance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. However, when he obtained the famous 43”/century needed to account for the anomaly, he realized that a new era in gravitational physics had just begun.</p><p>The stories of these two planets, Mercury and Uranus, involve two similar-looking anomalies, yet two completely different solutions.</p><p>Ever since its original publication on November 25, 1915 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>], Einstein’s general theory of relativity continues to be an active area of both theoretical and experimental research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR388">388</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR389">389</xref>]. Even after nearly a century since its discovery, the theory successfully accounts for all solar system observations gathered to date; it is remarkable that Einstein’s theory has survived every test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR418">418</xref>]. In fact, both in the weak field limit evident in our solar system and with the stronger fields present in systems of binary pulsars the predictions of general relativity have been extremely well tested. Such longevity and success make general relativity the <italic>de facto</italic> “standard” theory of gravitation for all practical purposes involving spacecraft navigation, astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR399">399</xref>].</p><p>Remarkably, even after more than 300 years since the publication of Newton’s “Principia” and nearly 100 years after the discovery of Einstein’s general theory of relativity, our knowledge of gravitation is still incomplete. Many challenges remain, leading us to explore the physics beyond Einstein’s theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR388">388</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR389">389</xref>]. In fact, growing observational evidence points to the need for new physics. Multiple dedicated efforts to discover new fundamental symmetries, investigations of the limits of established symmetries, tests of the general theory of relativity, searches for gravitational waves, and attempts to understand the nature of dark matter were among the topics that had been the focus of scientific research at the end of the last century. These efforts have further intensified with the unexpected discovery in the late 1990s of a small acceleration rate of our expanding Universe, which triggered many new activities aimed at answering important questions related to the most fundamental laws of Nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR389">389</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR399">399</xref>].</p><p>Many modern theories of gravity that were proposed to address the challenges above, including string theory, supersymmetry, and brane-world theories, suggest that new physical interactions will appear at different ranges. For instance, this may happen because at sub-millimeter distances new dimensions can exist, thereby changing the gravitational inverse-square law [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Similar forces that act at short distances are predicted in supersymmetric theories with weak scale compactifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], in some theories with very low energy supersymmetry breaking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>], and also in theories of very low quantum gravity scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR304">304</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR366">366</xref>].</p><p>Although much of the research effort was devoted to the study of the behavior of gravity at very short distances, notably on millimeter-to-micrometer ranges, it is possible that tiny deviations from the inverse-square law occur at much larger distances. In fact, there is a possibility that noncompact extra dimensions could produce such deviations at astronomical distances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. By far the most stringent constraints to date on deviations from the inverse-square law come from very precise measurements of the Moon’s orbit about the Earth. Analysis of lunar laser ranging data tests the gravitational inverse-square law on scales of the Earth-Moon distance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR421">421</xref>], so far reporting no anomaly at the level of accuracy of 3 × 10<sup>−11</sup> of the gravitational field strength.</p><p>While most of the modern experiments in the solar system do not show disagreements with general relativity, there are puzzles that require further investigation. One such puzzle was presented by the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft. The radiometric tracking data received from these spacecraft while they were at heliocentric distances of 20–70 astronomical units (AU) have consistently indicated the presence of a small, anomalous, Doppler frequency drift. The drift was interpreted as a constant sunward acceleration of <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>P</italic></sub> = (8.74 ± 1.33) × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup> experienced by both spacecraft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR390">390</xref>]. This apparent violation of the inverse-square law has become known as the Pioneer anomaly; the nature of this anomaly remains unexplained.</p><p>Before Pioneer 10 and 11, Newtonian gravity was not measured with great precision over great distances and was therefore never confirmed. The unique “built-in” navigation capabilities of the two Pioneers allowed them to reach the levels of ∼ 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup> in acceleration sensitivity. Such an exceptional sensitivity allowed researchers to use Pioneer 10 and 11 to test the gravitational inverse square law in the largest-scale gravity experiment ever conducted. However, the experiment failed to confirm the validity of this fundamental law of Newtonian gravity in the outer regions of the solar system. Thus, the nagging question remains: Just how well do we know gravity?</p><p>One can demonstrate that beyond 15 AU the difference between the predictions of Newton and Einstein are negligible. So, at the moment, two forces seem to be at play in deep space: Newton’s law of gravity and the Pioneer anomaly. Until the anomaly is thoroughly accounted for by conventional causes, and can therefore be eliminated from consideration, the validity of Newton’s laws in the outer solar system will remain in doubt. This fact justifies the importance of the investigation of the nature of the Pioneer anomaly.</p><p>However, the Pioneer anomaly is not the only unresolved puzzle. Take the dark matter and dark energy problem. While extensive efforts to detect the dark matter that is believed to be responsible for the puzzling observations of galaxy rotation curves have not met with success so far, modifications of gravitational laws have also been proposed as a solution to this puzzle. We still do not know for sure whether or not the ultimate solution for the dark matter problem will require a modification of the Standard Model of cosmology, but some suggested that new gravitational laws are at play in the arms of spiral galaxies.</p><p>A similar solution was proposed to explain the cosmological observations that indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. There is now a great deal of evidence indicating that over 70% of the critical density of the universe is in the form of a “negative-pressure” dark energy component; we have no understanding of its origin or nature. Given the profound challenge presented by the dark energy problem, a number of authors have considered the possibility that cosmic acceleration is not due to a particular substance, but rather that it arises from new gravitational physics (see discussion in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR389">389</xref>]).</p><p>Many of the models that were proposed to explain the observed acceleration of the universe without dark energy or the observed deviation from Newtonian laws of gravity in the arms of spiral galaxies without dark matter may also produce measurable gravitational effects on the scale of the solar system. These effects could manifest themselves as a “dark force”, similar to the one detected by the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft. Some believe that the Pioneer anomaly may be a critical piece of evidence as it may indicate a deviation from Einstein’s gravity theory on the scales of the solar system. But is it? Or can the Pioneer anomaly be explained by the mundane physics of a previously unaccounted-for on-board systematic effect? In this review we summarize the current knowledge of the anomaly and explore possible ways to answer this question.</p><p>The review is organized as follows. We begin with descriptions of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft and the strategies for obtaining and analyzing their data. In Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> we describe the Pioneer spacecraft. We provide a significant amount of information on the design, operations and behavior of Pioneer 10 and 11 during their entire missions, including information from original project doc umentation, descriptions of various data formats, and techniques used for their navigation. This information is critical to the ongoing investigation of the Pioneer anomaly.</p><p>In Section <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref> we describe the techniques used for acquisition of the Pioneer data. In particular, we discuss the Deep Space Network (DSN), its history and current status, describe the DSN tracking stations and details of their operations in support of deep space missions. We present the available radiometric Doppler data and describe techniques for data preparation and analysis. We also discuss the Pioneer telemetry data and its value for the anomaly investigation.</p><p>In Section <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">4</xref> we address the basic elements of the theoretical foundation for precision spacecraft navigation. In particular, we discuss the observational techniques and physical models that were used for precision tracking of the Pioneer spacecraft and analysis of their data. We describe models of gravitational forces and those that are of nongravitational nature.</p><p>In Section <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">5</xref> we focus on the detection and initial characterization of the Pioneer anomaly. We describe how the anomalous acceleration was originally identified in the data. We continue by summarizing the current knowledge of the physical properties of the Pioneer anomaly. We briefly review the original efforts to understand the signal.</p><p>In Section <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">6</xref> we review various mechanisms proposed to explain the anomaly that use unmodeled forces with origin either external to the spacecraft or those generated on-board. We discuss theoretical proposals that include modifications of general relativity, modified Newtonian gravity, cosmological theories, theories of dark matter and other similar activities. We review the efforts at independent confirmation with other spacecraft, planets, and other bodies in the solar system.</p><p>In Section <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">7</xref>, we describe the results of various independent studies of the Pioneer anomaly. We discuss new Pioneer 10 and 11 radiometric Doppler data that recently became available. This much extended set of Pioneer Doppler data is the primary source for the new investigation of the anomaly. A near complete record of the flight telemetry that was received from the two Pioneers is also available. Together with original project documentation and newly developed software tools, this additional information is now used to reconstruct the engineering history of both spacecraft, with special emphasis on the possible contribution to the anomalous acceleration by on-board systematic effects. We review the current status of these efforts to investigate the anomaly.</p><p>In Section <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">8</xref>, we present our summary and conclusions.</p><p>In Appendices <xref rid="App1" ref-type="app">A</xref>–<xref rid="App4" ref-type="app">D</xref>, we provide additional information on the geometry and design of Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft and describe various data formats used for mission operations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>The Pioneer 10 and 11 Project</title><p>NASA’s Pioneer program began in 1958, in the earliest days of the space age, with experimental spacecraft that were designed to reach Earth escape velocity and perform explorations of the interplanetary space beyond the Earth’s orbit. Several of these launch attempts ended in failure; the five spacecraft that reached space later became known as Pioneers 1–5. These were followed in the second half of the 1960s by Pioneers 6–9, a series of significantly more sophisticated spacecraft that were designed to be launched into solar orbit and make solar observations. These spacecraft proved extremely robust<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> and paved the way for the most ambitious projects yet in the unmanned space program: Pioneers 10 and 11.</p><p>The Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft were the first two man-made objects designed to explore the outer solar system (see details in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR294">294</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR291">291</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR293">293</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR290">290</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR292">292</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR289">289</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR295">295</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR286">286</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR354">354</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR285">285</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR272">272</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR350">350</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR296">296</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR383">383</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR385">385</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR386">386</xref>]). Their objectives were to conduct, during the 1972–73 Jovian opportunities, exploratory investigation beyond the orbit of Mars of the interplanetary medium, the nature of the asteroid belt, the environmental and atmospheric characteristics of Jupiter and Saturn (for Pioneer 11), and investigate the solar system beyond Jupiter’s orbit.</p><p>In this section we review the Pioneer 10 and 11 missions. We present information about the spacecraft design. Our discussion focuses on subsystems that played important roles in the continued functioning of the vehicles and on subsystems that may have affected their dynamical behavior: specifically, we review the propulsion, attitude control, power, communication, and thermal subsystems. We also provide information about the history of these systems throughout the two spacecrafts’ exceptionally lengthy missions.</p><sec id="Sec2.1"><title>The Pioneer 10 and 11 missions</title><p>The Pioneer missions were the first to cross the asteroid belt, perform in situ observations of the interplanetary medium in the outer solar system, and close-up observations of the gas giant Jupiter. Their mission design was characterized by simplicity: a powerful launch vehicle placed the spacecraft on an hyperbolic trajectory aimed directly at Jupiter, which the spacecraft were expected to reach approximately 21 months after launch.</p><p>At the distance of Jupiter, operating a spacecraft using solar panels is no longer practical (certainly not at the level of technology that was available to the designers of the Pioneer missions in the late 1960s.) For this reason, nuclear power was chosen as the means to provide electrical power to the spacecraft, in the form of <sup>238</sup>Pu powered radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs). As even this was relatively new technology at the time the missions were designed, the power subsystem was suitably over-engineered, the design requirement being a completely functional spacecraft capable of performing all planned science observations with only three (out of four) RTGs operating.</p><p>Such conservative engineering characterized the entire design of these spacecraft and their missions, and it was likely responsible for the two spacecrafts’ exceptional longevity, and their ability to deliver science results that far exceeded the expectations of their designers. The original plan envisioned a primary mission of 600–900 days in duration. Nevertheless, following its encounter with Jupiter, Pioneer 10 remained functional for over 30 years; meanwhile Pioneer 11, though not as long lived as its sister craft, successfully navigated a path across the solar system for another encounter with Saturn, offering the first close-up observations of the ringed planet.</p><p>After the Jupiter and Saturn (for Pioneer 11) encounters (see Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">2.1</xref>), the craft followed escape hyperbolic orbits near the plane of the ecliptic on opposite sides of the solar system, continuing their extended missions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>]. (See Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2.2</xref>.) The spacecraft explored the outer regions of the solar system, studying energetic particles from the Sun (solar wind), and cosmic rays entering our portion of the Milky Way.

This was due to a combination of many factors, including the presence of a coherent mode transceiver on board, their attitude control (spin-stabilized, with a minimum number of attitude correction maneuvers using thrusters), power design (the RTGs being on extended booms aided the stability of craft and also reduced thermal effects on the craft; see Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">2.3</xref>), and precise Doppler tracking (with the accuracy of post-fit Doppler residuals at the level of mHz). The exceptional “built-in” acceleration sensitivity of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft naturally allowed them to reach a level of accuracy of ∼ 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>.

The launch marked the first use of the Atlas-Centaur as a three-stage launch vehicle.</p><p>The launch vehicle configuration was an Atlas launch vehicle equipped with a Centaur D upper stage and a TE364-4 solid-fuel third stage that provided additional thrust and also supplied the initial spin of the spacecraft. The third stage was required to accelerate Pioneer 10 to the speed of 14.39 km/s, needed for the flight to Jupiter.</p><p>After a powered flight of approximately 14 minutes, the spacecraft was separated from its launch vehicle; its initial spin ∼ 60 revolutions per minute (rpm) was reduced by thrusters, and then reduced further when the magnetometer and RTG booms were extended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR283">283</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>]. The spacecraft was then oriented to ensure that its high-gain antenna pointed towards the Earth. Thus, the initial cruise phase from the Earth to Jupiter began.</p><p>The first interplanetary cruise phase of Pioneer 10 took approximately 21 months. During this time, Pioneer 10 successfully crossed the asteroid belt, demonstrating for the first time that this region of the solar system is safe for spacecraft to travel through.</p><p>Pioneer 10 arrived at Jupiter in late November, 1973 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>]. Its closest approach to the red giant occurred on 4 December 1973, at 02:25 UTC. It performed the first ever close-up observations of the gas giant, before continuing its journey out of the solar system on an hyperbolic escape trajectory (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2.2</xref>). During the planetary encounter, Pioneer 10 took several photographs of the planet and its moons, measured Jupiter’s magnetic fields, and observed the planet’s radiation belts. Radiation in the Jovian environment, potentially damaging to the spacecraft’s electronics, was a concern to the mission designers. However, Pioneer 10 survived the planetary encounter without significant damage, although its star sensor became inoperative shortly afterwards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR349">349</xref>], a likely result of excessive radiation exposure near Jupiter.</p><p>The encounter with Jupiter changed Pioneer 10’s trajectory as was planned by JPL navigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR404">404</xref>]. As a result, Pioneer 10 was now on an hyperbolic escape trajectory that took it to ever more distant parts of the solar system. Originally, signal loss was expected before Pioneer 10 reached twice the heliocentric distance of Jupiter (the downlink telecommunication power margin was 6 dB at the time of Jupiter encounter); however, continuing upgrades to the facilities of the Deep Space Network (DSN) permitted tracking of Pioneer 10 until the official termination of Pioneer 10’s science mission in 1997 and even beyond.</p><p>Pioneer 10 continued to make valuable scientific investigations until its science mission ended on March 31, 1997. After this date, Pioneer 10’s weak signal was tracked by the NASA’s DSN as part of an advanced concept study of communication technology in support of NASA’s future interstellar probe mission. Pioneer 10 eventually became the first man-made object to leave the solar system.</p><p>During one of the last attempts to contact Pioneer 10, in April 2001, at first no signal was detected; however, the spacecraft’s signal did appear once it detected a signal from the Earth and its radio system switched to coherent mode. From this, it was concluded that the on-board transmitter frequency reference (temperature controlled crystal oscillator) failed, possibly due to the combined effects of aging, the extreme cold environment of deep space, and a drop in the main bus voltage due to the depletion of the spacecraft’s RTG power source. This failure had no impact on the ability to obtain precision Doppler measurements from Pioneer 10.</p><p>On March 2, 2002 NASA’s DSN made another contact with Pioneer 10 and confirmed that the spacecraft was still operational thirty years after its launch on March 3, 1972 (UT). The uplink signal was transmitted on March 1 from the DSN’s Goldstone, California facility and a downlink response was received twenty-two hours later by the 70-meter antenna at Madrid, Spain. At this time the spacecraft was 11.9 billion kilometers from Earth at about 79.9 AU from the Sun and heading outward into interstellar space in the general direction of Aldebaran at a distance of about 68 light years from the Earth, and a travel time of two million years. The last telemetry data point was obtained from Pioneer 10 on 27 April 2002 when the craft was 80 AU from the Sun.</p><p>The last signal from Pioneer 10 was received on Earth on 23 January 2003, when NASA’s DSN received a very weak signal from the venerable spacecraft from the distance of ∼ 82.1 AU from the Sun. The previous three contacts had very faint signals with no telemetry received. At that time, NASA engineers reported that Pioneer 10’s RTG has decayed to the point where it may not have enough power to send additional transmissions to Earth. Consequently, the DSN did not detect a signal during a contact attempt on 7 February 2003. Thus, after more than 30 years in space, the Pioneer 10 spacecraft sent its last signal to Earth.</p><p>The final attempt to contact Pioneer 10 took place on the 34th anniversary of its launch, on 3–5 March 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR397">397</xref>]. At that time, the spacecraft was 90.08 AU from the Sun, moving at 12.08 km/s. The round-trip light time (i.e., time needed for a DSN radio signal to reach Pioneer 10 and return back to the Earth) was approximately 24 h 56 m, so the same antenna, DSS-14 at Goldstone, CA, was used for the track. Unfortunately, no signal was received. Given the age of the spacecraft’s power source, it was clear that there was no longer sufficient electrical power on board to operate the transmitter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR378">378</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2.1.2"><title>Pioneer 11 mission details</title><p>Pioneer 11 followed its older sister approximately one year later. It was launched on 5 April 1973 (on April 6, 1973 at 02:11 UTC), also on top of an Atlas/Centaur/TE364-4 launch vehicle. The second stage used for Pioneer 11 was a Centaur D-1A, while the third stage was a TE364-4 solid fuel vehicle.</p><p>After safe passage through the asteroid belt on 19 April 1974, Pioneer 11’s thrusters were fired to add another ∼ 65 m/s to the spacecraft’s velocity. This adjusted the aiming point at Jupiter to 43,000 km above the cloud tops. The close approach also allowed the spacecraft to be accelerated by Jupiter to a velocity of 48.06 km/s, so that it would be carried across the solar system some 2.4 billion km to Saturn.</p><p>Early in its mission, Pioneer 11 suffered a propulsion system anomaly that caused the spin rate of the spacecraft to increase significantly (see Figure <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">2.16</xref>). Fortunately, the spin rate was not high enough to endanger the spacecraft or compromise its mission objectives.</p><p>Pioneer 11’s first interplanetary cruise phase lasted approximately 20 months. During this time, a major trajectory correction maneuver was performed, aiming Pioneer 11 for a precision encounter with Jupiter. Pioneer 11’s closest approach to Jupiter occurred on 2 December 1974 at 17:22 UTC. This encounter provided the necessary gravity assist to alter Pioneer 11’s trajectory for a planned encounter with Saturn (see Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">2.1</xref>).</p><p>The second interplanetary cruise phase of Pioneer 11’s mission took it across the solar system. Initially, Pioneer 11’s heliocentric distance was actually decreasing as it followed an hyperbolic trajectory taking the spacecraft more than 1 AU above the plane of the ecliptic. This phase of the mission culminated in a successful encounter with Saturn. Pioneer 11’s closest approach to the ringed planet occurred on 1 September 1979, at 16:31 UTC. Still fully operational, Pioneer 11 was able to make close-up observations of the ringed planet.</p><p>After this second planetary encounter, Pioneer 11 continued to escape the solar system on an hyperbolic escape trajectory, and remained operational for many years. Pioneer 11 explored the outer regions of our solar system, studying the solar wind and cosmic rays.</p><p>The spacecraft sent its last coherent Doppler data on October 1, 1990 while at 31.7 AU from the Sun<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref>. In October 1990 a microwave relay switch failed on board Pioneer 11, in its communications subsystem. The most notable consequence of this failure is that it was no longer possible to operate this spacecraft’s radio system in coherent mode, which is required for precision Doppler observations. Therefore, after this event, precision Doppler data was no longer produced by the Pioneer 11 spacecraft.</p><p>The spacecraft continued to provide science observations until the end of its mission in 1995. In September 1995, Pioneer 11 was at a distance of 6.5 billion km from Earth. At that distance, it takes over 6 hours for the radio signal to reach Earth. However, by September 1995, Pioneer 11 could no longer make any scientific observations as its power supply was nearly depleted. On 30 September 1995, routine daily mission operations were stopped. Intermittent contact continued until November 1995, at which time the last communication with Pioneer 11 took place. There has been no communication with Pioneer 11 since. The Earth’s motion has carried our planet out of the view of the spacecraft antenna.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2.1.3"><title>Pioneer 10 and 11 project documentation</title><p>Up until 2005, very little documentation on the Pioneer spacecraft was available to researchers.

Instruments could be commanded on or off by ground control; late in the extended mission, when sufficient power to operate all instruments simultaneously was no longer available, a power sharing plan was implemented to ensure that the power demand on board would not exceed available power levels.</p><p>At the end of its mission, only one instrument on board Pioneer 10 remained in operation; the University of Iowa Geiger Tube Telescope. An attempt was made to power down this instrument, in order to improve the available power margin. It is not known if this command was received or executed by the spacecraft.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2.2.3"><title>Radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs)</title><p>The primary electrical source on board Pioneer 10 and 11 was a set of four radioisotope thermoelectric generators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR350">350</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR384">384</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Each of these RTGs contains 18 <sup>238</sup>Pu capsules, approximately two inches (5.08 cm) in diameter and 0.2 inches (0.51 cm) thick. The total thermal power of each RTG, when freshly fueled, was ∼ 650 W. Each RTG contains two sets of 45 bimetallic thermocouples, connected in series. The thermocouples initially operated at ∼ 6% efficiency; the nominal RTG output is ∼ 4 V, 10 A. The total available power at launch on board each spacecraft was ∼ 160 W (Figure <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">2.14</xref>).</p><p>Excess heat from each RTG is radiated into space by a set of six heat radiating fins. The fins provide the necessary radiating area to ensure that a sufficient temperature differential is present on the thermocouples, for efficient operation.</p><p>The thermal power of the RTGs is a function of the total power produced by the <sup>238</sup>Pu fuel, and the amount of power removed in the form of electrical energy by the thermocouples. The half-life of <sup>238</sup>Pu is 87.74 years. The efficiency of the thermocouples decreased over the years as a result of the decreasing temperature differential between the hot and cold ends, and also as a result of aging. At the time of last transmission, each RTG on board Pioneer 10 produced less than 15 W of electrical power.</p><p>The actual shape of the RTGs is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">2.5</xref>. It is important to note that the RTGs on board Pioneer 10 and 11 were built with the large fins that are depicted in this figure. These enlarged fins are not shown in many drawings and photographs (including Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">2.3</xref>).

There, raw power from the RTGs was fed into a series of electric power supplies that produced 28 VDC for the spacecraft’s main bus, and also other voltages on secondary power buses.</p><p>Electrical power consumption on board the spacecraft was regulated to ensure a constant voltage on the various power buses on the one hand, and an optimal current draw from the RTGs on the other hand. The electrical power subsystem was designed such that the spacecraft could perform its primary mission, namely close-up observations of the planet Jupiter approximately 21 months after launch, using only three RTGs, while operating a full compliment of science instruments. Consequently, in the early years of their mission, significant amounts of excess electrical power were available on both spacecraft. The power regulation circuitry diverted this excess power to a shunt circuit, which dissipated some excess power internally, while routing the remaining excess power to an externally mounted shunt radiator.</p><p>The total power available on board at the time of launch was in excess of ∼ 160 W. This figure decreased steadily throughout the missions, obeying an approximate negative exponential law. The actual amount of power available was a function of the decay of the radioisotope fuel, the decreasing temperature differential between the hot and cold ends of thermoelectric elements, and degradation of the elements themselves. At the end of its mission, the power available on board Pioneer 10 was less than 60 W. (Indeed, a drop in the main bus voltage is the most likely reason that Pioneer 10 eventually fell silent, as the reduced voltage was no longer sufficient to operate the spacecraft’s transmitter.)</p><p>The RTGs generated electrical power at ∼ 4 VDC (Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">2.6</xref>). Power output from each RTG was fed to a separate inverter circuit, producing 61 VAC (peak-to-peak) at ∼ 2.5 kHz. Output from the four inverters was combined and fed to the Power Control Unit (PCU), which generated the 28 VDC main bus voltage, managed the on-board battery, controlled the dissipation of excess power via a shunt circuit, and also provided power to the Central Transformer Rectifier (CTRF) component, which, in turn, supplied power at various voltages (e.g., ± 16 VDC, ± 12 VDC, +5 VDC) to other subsystems and instruments.

The spacecraft had only a small amount of fuel on board, used by their propulsion system designed to control the spacecraft’s spin and orientation, and execute minor course correction maneuvers.</p><p>The propulsion system consisted of three thruster cluster assemblies (see Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">2.8</xref>), each comprising two 1 lb (∼ 4.5 N) thrusters. All thruster cluster assemblies were mounted along the rim of the HGA. One pair of clusters was oriented tangentially along the antenna perimeter, and its two thrusters were intended to be used to increase or decrease the spin rate of the spacecraft. The remaining two pairs were oriented perpendicular to the antenna plane, on opposite sides of the antenna. These two thruster cluster assemblies were used in pairs. If two thrusters pointing in the same direction were fired simultaneously, this resulted in a net change in the spacecraft’s velocity in a direction perpendicular to the antenna plane. If two clusters were fired in the opposite direction, this caused the spacecraft’s spin axis to precess. This latter type of maneuver was used, in particular, to maintain an Earth-pointing orientation of the HGA to ensure good reception of radio signals.

The propulsion system had the capability to adjust the spin rate of the spacecraft, and to precess the spin axis, in order to correct for orientation errors, and to ensure that the spacecraft followed the Earth’s position in the sky as seen from on board.</p><p>The spin axis perpendicular to the plane of the HGA is one of the spacecraft’s principal axis of inertia. A wobble damper mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR292">292</xref>] dampened rotations around any axis other than this principal axis of inertia, ensuring a stable attitude even after a precession maneuver.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2.2.6"><title>Navigation</title><p>The Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft relied on standard methods of deep space navigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">235</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">240</xref>] (see Section <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">4</xref>). The spacecraft’s position was determined using the spacecraft’s radio signal and the laws of celestial mechanics. The radio signal offered a precision Doppler observable, from which the spacecraft’s velocity relative to an Earth station along the line-of-sight could be computed. Repeated observations and knowledge of the spacecraft’s prior trajectory were sufficient to obtain highly accurate solutions of the spacecraft’s orbit.</p><p>The orientation of the spacecraft was estimated from the quality of the radio communication link (i.e., the spacecraft had to be approximately Earth-pointing in order for the Earth to fall within the HGA radiation pattern.) The rate and phase of the spacecraft’s rotation was established by a redundant pair of sun sensors and a star sensor on board. These sensors (selectable by ground command) provided a roll reference pulse that was used for navigation purposes (as explained in the next paragraph) as well as by on-board science instruments. The time between two subsequent roll reference pulses was measured and telemetered to the ground.</p><p>The spacecraft also had minimal autonomous (closed loop) navigation capability, designed to make it possible for the spacecraft to restore its orientation by “homing in” on an Earth-based signal. The maneuver, called a conical scan (CONSCAN) maneuver, utilized a piston mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] with electrically heated freon gas that displaced the feed horn located at the focal point of the high-gain antenna. Unless the Earth was exactly on the HGA centerline, this introduced a sinusoidal modulation in the amplitude of the signal received from the Earth. A simple integrator circuit, utilizing this sinusoidal modulation and the roll reference pulse, triggered firings of the precession thrusters, adjusting the spacecraft’s axis of rotation until it coincided with the direction of the Earth.</p><p>Frequently, instead of CONSCAN maneuvers, “open loop” attitude correction maneuvers were used, calculated to ensure that after the maneuver, the spacecraft was oriented to “lead” the Earth, allowing the Earth to move through the antenna pattern subsequently. This reduced the frequency of attitude correction maneuvers; further, open loop maneuvers generally consumed less propellant than autonomous CONSCAN maneuvers.</p><p>Early in the mission, attitude correction maneuvers had to be executed regularly, due to the combined motion of the Earth and the spacecraft. Late in the extended mission, only two attitude correction maneuvers were needed annually, to compensate for the Earth’s motion around the Sun, and for the spacecraft’s “sideways” motion along its hyperbolic escape trajectory.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2.2.7"><title>Communication system</title><p>The spacecraft maintained its communication link with the Earth using a set of S-band transmitters and receivers on board, in combination with three antennae.</p><p>The main communication antenna of the spacecraft was the 2.74 m diameter high-gain antenna. The antenna’s narrow beamwidth (3.3° downlink, 3.5° uplink) ensured an effective radiated power of 70 dBm, allowing communication with the spacecraft over interplanetary distances. (The original mission design anticipated signal loss some time after Jupiter encounter, but still within the orbit of Saturn; increases in the sensitivity of Earth stations allowed communication with Pioneer 10 up until 2003, when the spacecraft was over 70 AU from the Earth.)</p><p>Mounted along the centerline of the HGA was the horn of a medium-gain antenna (MGA). On the opposite (−<italic>z</italic>) side of the spacecraft, at the bottom of the main compartment was mounted a third, low-gain omnidirectional antenna (LGA). This antenna was used during the initial mission phases, before the HGA was oriented towards the Earth.</p><p>The spacecraft had two receivers and two transmitters on board, switchable by ground command. While one receiver was connected to the HGA, the other was connected to the MGA/LGA. The sensitivity of the receiver was −149 dBm; at the time of the last transmission, the spacecraft detected the Earth station’s signal at a strength of −131.7 dBm.</p><p>The spacecraft utilized two traveling wave tube (TWT) transmitters for microwave transmission. The TWTs were selectable by ground command; it was possible to power off both TWTs to conserve power (such as when CONSCAN maneuvers were performed late in the mission, when the available electrical power on board was no longer sufficient to operate a TWT transmitter and the feed movement mechanism simultaneously.)</p><p>The radio systems operated in the S-band, utilizing a frequency of ∼ 2.1 GHz for uplink, and ∼ 2.3 GHz for downlink. The transmitter frequency was synthesized on board by an independent oscillator. However, the spacecraft’s radio system could also operate in a <italic>coherent mode</italic>: in this mode, the downlink signal’s carrier frequency was phase-coherently synchronized to the uplink frequency, at the exact frequency ratio of 240/221. In this mode, the precision and stability of the downlink signal’s carrier frequency was not limited by the equipment on board. This mode allowed precision Doppler frequency measurements with millihertz accuracy.</p><p>The main function of the spacecraft’s communication system was to provide two-way data communication between the ground and the spacecraft. Data communication was performed at a rate of 16–2048 bits per second (bps). Communication from the ground consisted of commands that were decoded by the spacecraft’s radio communication subsystem. Communication to the ground consisted of measurement results from the spacecraft’s suite of science instruments, and engineering telemetry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2.2.8"><title>Telemetry data and its interpretation</title><p>Communication between the spacecraft and a DSN antenna took place using a variety of data formats; the format selected depended on the type of experiment that the spacecraft was ordered to perform, but typically the format gave precedence to science results over telemetry. However, telemetry information was continuously transmitted to the Earth at all times, using a small portion of the available data bandwidth.</p><p>The telemetry data stream was assembled on board by the digital telemetry unit (DTU), which comprised some ∼ 800 TTL<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> integrated circuits, and was also equipped with 49,152 bits of ferrite core data memory. A total of 10 science data formats (of which 5 were utilized) and 4 engineering data formats, yielding a total number of 18 different valid format combinations, was selectable by ground command. The DTU could operate in three modes: realtime (passing through science measurements as received from instruments), store (storing measurements in the on-board memory) and readout (transmitting measurements previously stored in on-board memory.)</p><p>When one of the engineering data formats was selected, the spacecraft transmitted only engineering telemetry. These formats were utilized, for instance, during maneuvers or spacecraft troubleshooting.</p><p>Most of the time, a science data format was used, in which case most of the bits in the telemetry data stream contained science data. A small portion, called the subcommutator, was reserved for engineering data; this part of the telemetry record cycled through all telemetry data words in sequence.</p><p>The telemetry record size was 192 bits, divided into 36 6-bit words. Depending on the telemetry format chosen, either all 36 6-bit words contained engineering telemetry, or a single engineering telemetry word was transmitted in every (or every second) telemetry record.</p><p>There were 128 distinct engineering telemetry words. Depending on the science format used, the subcommutator was present either in every transmitted record or every second record. Therefore, it may have taken as many as 256 telemetry records before a particular engineering word was transmitted. At the lowest data rate of 16 bits per second, this meant that any given parameter was telemetered to the Earth once every 51.2 minutes.</p><p>An additional 64 telemetry words were used to transmit engineering information from science instruments. These parameters were only transmitted in the subcommutator, and at the lowest available data rate, a particular science instrument telemetry word was repeated every 25.6 minutes.</p><p>The 128 engineering telemetry words were organized into 4 groups of 32 words each; it is customary to denote them using the notation <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>mnn</italic></sub>, where <italic>m</italic> = 1…4 is the group number, and <italic>nn</italic> = 01…32 is the telemetry word.

Changes in the spacecraft properties can affect/induce forces that are both of on-board and of external origin. Therefore, it is of great importance to establish the extent to which any of the spacecraft’s properties might have been changing over time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec2.3"><title>Spacecraft operating history</title><p>The Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft spent about three decades in deep space. Most of what we know about the anomalous acceleration is based on data that was collected when the spacecraft were well into their second and third decades of operation. This raises an obvious question: what are the effects of aging and to what extent may aging be responsible for the anomalous acceleration?</p><p>In this section, we summarize our knowledge about the effects of aging on the spacecrafts’ subsystems.</p><sec id="Sec2.3.1"><title>Spacecraft physical configuration</title><p>The overall shape of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft is not expected to change significantly with age. The spacecraft is fundamentally a rigid body; other than the constant centrifugal force that arises as a result of the spacecraft’s rotation, there are no forces stretching, bending, or otherwise acting on the spacecraft structurally.</p><p>The Pioneer spacecraft had few moving parts. After initial boom deployment, the spacecrafts’ physical configurations remained largely unchanging, with a few notable exceptions.</p><p>Consumption of the fuel load on board resulted in small changes in the spacecrafts’ mass distribution during the large course correction maneuvers early in the Pioneer 10 and 11 missions. As the amount of fuel on board was small, and the fuel tank was situated near the spacecraft’s center-of-gravity, the effects of later attitude correction maneuvers, which consumed minuscule amounts of fuel, were likely negligible.</p><p>Some instruments had moving parts: notably, the Imaging Photopolarimeter (IPP) instrument had a telescope that was mounted on a scan platform, allowing it to be used for Jupiter imaging. Operating this instrument’s small moving parts, however, would have introduced only minute changes in the spacecraft’s mass distribution and thermal properties.</p><p>More notable was the spacecraft’s passive louver system. As discussed in Section <xref rid="Sec2.4" ref-type="sec">2.4</xref>, the louver system was designed to vent excess heat radiatively from the interior of the spacecraft. The state of the louver system can be determined as a function of the electronics platform temperatures. The position of the louver blades can significantly alter the thermal behavior of the spacecraft, by allowing a higher proportion of interior heat to escape through the louver system.</p><p>At large heliocentric distances (beyond ∼ 25 AU), the louver system is always closed, and the spacecraft’s physical configuration remains constant.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2.3.2"><title>Changes in spacecraft mass</title><p>As we discussed in Section <xref rid="Sec2.2.1" ref-type="sec">2.2.1</xref>, the nominal launch mass of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft was ∼ 260 kg, of which ∼ 30 kg was propellant and pressurant.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref> The spacecraft mass slowly decreased, primarily as a result of propellant usage. Additionally, small mass losses may occur due to fuel leaks, pressurant outgassing, He outgassing (<italic>α</italic> particles) from the RTGs and RHUs, and possibly, outgassing from the spacecraft batteries.</p><p>Pioneer 10 used only a moderate amount of propellant, as it performed no major trajectory correction maneuvers. If the propellant used amounted to one quarter of the propellant on board, this means that Pioneer 10’s mass would have decreased to ∼ 250 kg late in its mission (the 2002 JPL study used the nominal value of 251.883 kg). Further, it should be noted that most propellant usage occurred prior to Jupiter encounter; afterwards, Pioneer 10 only used minimal amounts of propellant for precession maneuvers, needed to keep its antenna aimed at the Earth.</p><p>Pioneer 11 performed major trajectory correction maneuvers en route to Jupiter and Saturn. The maneuvers were in order to allow it to follow a precisely calculated orbit that utilized a gravitational assist from Jupiter that was needed to set up the spacecraft for its encounter with Saturn. As a result, Pioneer 11 is believed to have used significantly more propellant than its twin, perhaps three quarters of the total available on board. The spacecraft’s mass, therefore, may have decreased to ∼ 232 kg following its encounter with Saturn (the mass used in the 2002 JPL study was somewhat higher, 239.73 kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]).</p><p>We note that these figures are crude estimates, as the actual amount of propellant on board is not telemetered. Sensors inside the propellant tank did offer temperature and pressure telemetry, but these sensors were not sufficiently reliable for a precise estimate of the remaining fuel on board.</p><p>The spacecraft can also lose mass due to outgassing. Two possible sources of outgassing are helium outgassing from the radioactive fuel on board in the radioisotope thermoelectric generators and radioisotope heater units, and chemical outgassing from the spacecraft’s battery. An upper limit of 18 g on helium outgassing can be established using the known physical properties of the <sup>238</sup>Pu fuel (see Section <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">4</xref>), which is not significant. Similarly, the amount of gas that can escape from the spacecraft’s batteries is small, especially in view of the fact that the batteries performed nominally far longer than anticipated: under no circumstances can it exceed the battery mass, but in all likelihood, and especially in view of the fact that the batteries performed nominally throughout the mission, any outgassing is necessarily limited to a very small fraction of the ∼ 2.35 kg battery mass (see Section <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">4</xref>). Therefore, outgassing cannot have played a major role in the evolution of the spacecraft mass; furthermore, any mass loss due to outgassing is dwarfed by uncertainties in the mass of the remaining fuel inventory.</p><p>Could the spacecraft have gained mass, for instance, by collecting dust particles from the interplanetary medium? In situ measurements by the Pioneer spacecraft themselves provide an upper limit on the amount of dust encountered by the spacecraft. After passing Jupiter’s orbit, the dust flux measured by Pioneer 10 remained approximately constant, at 3 × 10<sup>−6</sup> m<sup>−2</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">178</xref>]. The upper limit on particle sizes is 10<sup>−4</sup> kg. Even assuming that all particles had masses near this upper limit, the total amount of mass that could have accumulated on the spacecraft over the course of 20 years would be no more than ∼ 1 kg. However, given that the spacecraft is moving through interplanetary space at a velocity of 10 km/s or higher, these assumptions on particle size would imply a dust density of ∼ 10<sup>−14</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>, which is many orders of magnitude higher than more realistic estimates (see Section <xref rid="Sec4.3.5" ref-type="sec">4.3.5</xref>). Therefore, the actual dust mass accumulated on the spacecraft cannot be more than a few grams at the most; consequently, this mechanism for mass increase can also be safely ignored.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2.3.3"><title>Instrumentation</title><p>It is not known how on-board instrumentation (i.e., telemetry sensors) respond to aging. What we know is that many sensors stopped providing usable readings when measured values (e.g., temperatures) dropped outside calibrated ranges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR378">378</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR379">379</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR395">395</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR397">397</xref>]. Other sensors continued to provide consistent readings, with no indication of sensor failure.</p><p>However, there were a few sensor anomalies that may be due to age-related sensor defects. Most notable among these are the anomalous readings from the propellant tank of Pioneer 10 (described in Section <xref rid="Sec2.3.6" ref-type="sec">2.3.6</xref>).</p><p>It is also unknown how on-board instrumentation responds when their supply voltage drops below the nominal level. Late in its mission, the electrical power subsystem on board Pioneer 10 no longer had sufficient power to maintain the nominal main bus voltage of 28 VDC. As this coincides with changes in physical sensor readings (e.g., drops in temperature), the extent to which those readings are affected by the drop in voltage is not readily evident.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2.3.4"><title>Electrical system</title><fig id="Fig14"><label>Figure 2.14</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Changes in total RTG electrical output (in W) on board Pioneer 10 (left) and 11 (right), as computed using the missions’ on-board telemetry.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41114_2016_9095_Fig14.jpg" id="MO14"/></fig><p>Insofar as we can determine from telemetry, the electrical subsystems on board Pioneer 10 and 11 performed nominally throughout the missions, so long as sufficient electrical power was available from the RTGs.

Internally, aging causes a degradation of the bimetallic thermocouples, contributing to their loss of efficiency and the decrease in RTG electrical power output. Externally, it has been conjectured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR327">327</xref>] that the RTG exterior surfaces may have aged due to solar bleaching and impact by dust particles. The extent to which such degradation may have occurred (if at all) is unknown. The resulting fore-aft asymmetry may be a significant source of unaccounted-for acceleration in the approximately sunward direction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2.3.6"><title>Propulsion system</title><p>The propellant pressure sensor on board Pioneer 10 began to show anomalous behavior in June 1989. Propellant pressure, which remained steady up to this point, only decreasing slowly as a result of cooling and occasional propellant usage, suddenly began to show a sharp decay, dropping from over 300 psia down to about 150 psia by January 1992 (Figure <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">2.15</xref>). At this time, the propellant pressure instantaneously increased to its pre-1989 value of ∼ 310 psia, after which it began dropping again. There were no corresponding changes or other anomalies in the observed propellant temperature and expellant temperature. Therefore, the most likely explanation for this anomaly is a sensor malfunction, not a real loss of fuel or propellant.

Fortunately, the thruster ceased firing before the spin rate increased to a value that would have threatened the spacecraft’s structural integrity or compromised its ability to carry out its mission.

Continuing spot measurements of the spin rate were made using the Imaging Photo-Polarimeter (IPP) until 1993. The anomalous increase in Pioneer 11’s spin rate early in the mission was due to a failed spin thruster. Continuing increases in the spin rate were due to maneuvers; when the spacecraft was undisturbed, its spin rate slowly decreased, as seen in Figure <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">2.17</xref>.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41114_2016_9095_Fig16.jpg" id="MO16"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2.3.7"><title>Attitude control and spin</title><p>Encounter with the intense radiation environment in the vicinity of Jupiter damaged the star sensor on board Pioneer 10.

Later, spin could be precisely adjusted and corrected by the spin/despin thrusters.</p><p>On Pioneer 11, due to the spin thruster anomaly described in the previous section, the spacecraft’s spin remained at an abnormally high value.

Spin was measured on board using one of several sensors, namely a star sensor and two sun sensors. The purpose of these sensors was to provide a roll reference pulse that could then be used to synchronize other equipment, including the IPP instrument and the navigational system.</p><p>The sun sensors required a minimum angle between the spacecraft’s spin axis and the spacecraft-Sun line. Further, they required that the spacecraft be within a certain distance of the Sun, in order for a reliable roll reference pulse to be generated. For these reasons, the sun sensors could not be used to provide a roll reference pulse once the spacecraft were more than ∼ 30 AU from the Sun.</p><p>There were no such limitations on the star sensor; however, the star sensor on board Pioneer 10 ceased functioning shortly after Jupiter encounter, probably due to radiation damage suffered while the spacecraft traversed the intense radiation environment in the gas giant’s vicinity.</p><p>As a result, Pioneer 10 lost its roll reference source when its distance from the Sun increased beyond ∼ 30 AU. Although the roll reference assembly continued to provide roll reference pulses at the last “frozen in” rate, this rate no longer matched the actual rate of revolution of the spacecraft.</p><p>Nevertheless, it was important to know the spin rate of the spacecraft with reasonable precision, in order to be able to carry out precession maneuvers reliably, and also because the spacecraft’s spin affected the spacecraft’s radio signal and the Doppler observable. For this reason, the IPP was reused as a surrogate star sensor, its images of the star field providing a reference that could then be used by the navigation team to compute the actual spin rate of the spacecraft on the Earth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR349">349</xref>]. It was during the time when the IPP instrument was used to compute the rate of spin that a spin anomaly was detected.

However, a close look at detailed plots of the spin rate reveal a more intricate picture. It seems that Pioneer 11’s spin rate was actually <italic>decreasing</italic> between maneuvers, when the spacecraft was undisturbed; however, each precession maneuver increased the spacecraft’s spin rate by a notable amount. The rate of decrease between successive maneuvers was not constant, suggesting that fuel leaks played a more significant role in Pioneer 11’s spin behavior than in Pioneer 10’s.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec2.4"><title>Thermal control subsystem</title><p>A quick look at the Pioneer spacecraft (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">2.3</xref>) is sufficient to see that the spacecraft’s thermal radiation pattern may be anisotropic: whereas one side is dominated by the high-gain antenna, the other side contains a thermal louver system designed to vent excess heat into space.

(Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">2.4</xref> shows the internal arrangement of components.) From a thermal perspective, nearly all electrical systems on board perform only one function: they convert electrical energy into waste heat. The one exception is the spacecraft’s radio transmitter, converting some electrical energy into a directed beam of radio frequency energy.</p><p>Early in the missions, the RTGs produced more electrical power than what was needed on board. The main bus voltage on board was maintained at a constant value by a power supply circuit, while excess electrical power was converted into heat. The shunt regulator controlled a variable current, which flowed through the regulator itself and an external radiator plate. The external radiator plate acted as an ohmic resistor, and the power radiated by it can be easily computed from the shunt current telemetry (Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">2.7</xref>). The shunt radiator is mounted such that its thermal radiation is primarily in a direction that is perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis.</p><p>Some electrical heat is generated outside the spacecraft body: notable items include electrical heaters for the fuel lines that deliver fuel to the thruster cluster assemblies along the antenna rim, an electrical heater for the spacecraft battery, and some scientific instruments.</p><p>Most of the electrical power not radiated away by the spacecraft antenna or the shunt radiator is converted into heat inside the spacecraft body. As the spacecraft is very close to a thermal steady state, all the electrical heat produced internally must be radiated into space. This thermal radiation is likely to cause a measurable sunward acceleration, for several reasons. First, the spacecraft body is heavily insulated by multilayer thermal insulation; however, at the bottom of the spacecraft body is the thermal louver system designed to vent excess heat. Even in its closed state, the effective emissivity of this louver system is much higher than that of the multilayer insulation, so this is the preferred direction in which heat escapes the spacecraft. Second, the spacecraft body is situated behind the high-gain antenna; even if the thermal radiation pattern of the spacecraft body were isotropic, the back of the HGA would preferentially reflect a significant portion of this heat in the aft direction.</p><p>Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">2.7</xref> also indicates how the power consumption by various pieces of equipment on board can be computed from telemetry.</p><p>The thermal state of the interior of the spacecraft is characterized in a redundant manner. In addition to the thermal power of various components that can be computed from telemetry, there exist numerous temperature sensors on board, most notably among them six platform temperature sensors, which are the most likely to measure ambient temperatures (as opposed to sensors that, say, are designed to measure the temperature of a specific electrical component, such as a transistor amplifier.)</p><p>Much less is known about heat escaping the interior of the spacecraft through other routes. The spacecraft’s science instruments utilize various holes and openings in the spacecraft body in order to collect information from the environment. Design documentation prescribes that no instrument can lose more heat through the opening than its own power consumption plus 0.5 W; however, the actually heat loss per instrument is not known.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2.4.3"><title>Radioisotope heater units</title><p>A further source of continuous heat on board is the set of radioisotope heater units (RHUs) placed at strategic locations to maintain operating temperatures. These RHUs are capsules containing a small amount of <sup>238</sup>Pu fuel, generating ∼ 1 W of heat (Figure <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">2.18</xref>).

This heat was radiated into space as the assemblies cooled down to their pre-maneuver temperatures after a thruster firing event over the course of several hours.</p><p>However, the uncertainty in the magnitude of velocity change caused by the thruster event itself dwarfs any acceleration produced by the radiation of this residual heat. For this reason, heat from the propulsion system does not need to be considered when accounting for thermal recoil forces.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2.4.5"><title>The energy radiated in the radio beam</title><p>To complete our discussion of thermal radiation emitted by the spacecraft, we must also consider the spacecraft’s radio beam, for two reasons. First, any energy radiated by the radio beam is energy that is not converted into heat inside the spacecraft body. Second, the radio beam itself produces a recoil force that is similar in nature to the thermal recoil force.</p><p>The nominal power of the radio transmitter is 8 W, and the radio beam is highly collimated by the high gain antenna. Nevertheless, some loss occurs around the antenna fringes, and the beam itself also has a spread. Assuming that ∼ 10% of the radio beam emitted by the feedhorn misses the antenna dish, at an approximate angle of 45°, we can calculate an efficiency of ∼ 0.83 at which the antenna converts the emitted radio energy into momentum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR327">327</xref>].</p><p>The actual power of the radio beam may not have been exactly 8 W. The output of the traveling wave tube oscillator that generated this microwave energy was measured on board and telemetered to the ground (Figure <xref rid="Fig19" ref-type="fig">2.19</xref>). Especially in the case of Pioneer 10, we note the variability of the TWT power near the end of mission. This corresponds to the drop in main bus voltage when the power available on board was no longer sufficient to maintain nominal voltages. It is unclear, therefore, if the measured drop in output power is an actual drop or a sensor artifact.

While this figure represents a snapshot of the spacecraft’s state at a particular moment in time, this information is available for the entire duration of both Pioneer missions.</p><p>The thermal state of the spacecraft body can be verified using the readings of six temperature sensors that were located at various points on the electronics platform: four in the main compartment, two in the adjacent compartment that housed science instruments (see locations 1–6 in Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">2.9</xref>). The temporal evolution of these temperature readings agrees with expectations: outlying sensors show consistently lower temperatures, and all temperatures are dropping steadily, as the distance between the spacecraft and the Sun increases while the amount of power available on board decreases (Figures <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">2.20</xref> and <xref rid="Fig21" ref-type="fig">2.21</xref>).

However, these temperature sensors measured the internal temperatures of on-board equipment and science instruments. One example is the hot junction temperature sensor inside the RTGs, measuring the thermocouple temperature at its hot end. These readings may be of limited use when assessing the overall thermal state of the spacecraft. Nevertheless, they are also available in the telemetry.</p><p>The thermal behavior of the spacecraft was an important concern when Pioneer 10 and 11 were designed. Going beyond a general description [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR292">292</xref>], much of the work that was done to ensure proper thermal behavior is documented in a review document of the Pioneer 10 and 11 thermal control subsystem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR385">385</xref>]. Specifically, this document provides detailed information about the thermal properties of components internal to the spacecraft, and about the anticipated maximum heat losses through various spacecraft structural and other components.</p><p>Detailed information about the SNAP-19 RTGs used on board Pioneer 10 and 11 is also available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR350">350</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2.4.7"><title>Surface radiometric properties and thermal behavior</title><p>It has been suggested (see, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR327">327</xref>]) that the material properties of these surfaces may have changed over time, introducing a time-dependent anisotropy in the spacecraft’s thermal properties. For instance, solar bleaching may affect spacecraft surfaces facing the Sun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], while surfaces facing the direction of motion may be affected by the impact of interplanetary dust particles.</p><p>Note that through most of their operating lives, the high-gain antennas of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft were always pointing in the approximate direction of the Sun. Therefore, the same side of the spacecraft: notably, the interior surfaces of their HGAs and one side of each RTG, were exposed to the effects of solar light, including ultraviolet radiation, and charged particles. It is not unreasonable to assume that this continuous exposure may have altered the visible light and infrared optical properties of these surfaces, introducing in particular, a fore-aft asymmetry in the thermal radiation pattern of the RTGs. On the other hand, any such effects would be mitigated by the fact that the spacecraft were receding from the Sun very rapidly, and spent most of their operating lives at several AUs or more from the Sun, receiving only a fraction of the solar radiation that is received, for instance, by Earth-orbiting satellites of comparable age.</p><p>Another possible effect may have altered the infrared radiometric properties of spacecraft surfaces facing in the direction of motion (which, most of the time, would be surfaces facing away from the Sun.) As the spacecraft travels through the interplanetary medium at speeds in excess of 12 km/s, impact by charged particles and dust may have corroded these surfaces. Once again, this may have introduced a fore-aft anisotropy in the infrared radiometric properties of the spacecraft, most notably their RTGs.</p><p>NASA conducted several experiments to investigate the effect of space exposure on the thermal and optical properties of various materials. One investigation, called the Thermal Control Surfaces (TCS) experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR411">411</xref>], examined the long-term effects of exposure of different materials placed on an external palette on the International Space Station. Although results of this test are quite important, the near-Earth environment is quite different from that of deep space. Concerning solar bleaching, although the spacecraft spent decades in space, most of the time was spent far away from the Sun, resulting in a low number of “equivalent Sun hours” (ESH). The cumulative exposure to solar radiation of the Sun-facing surfaces of Pioneer 10 and 11 is less than the amount of solar radiation test surfaces were exposed to during the TCS experiment, in which test surfaces were also exposed to the atomic oxygen of the upper atmosphere, which is not a consideration in the case of the Pioneer spacecraft.</p><p>The most pronounced effect on coatings in the deep space environment is due to exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The ESH for the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft is approximately 3000 hours, most of which (&gt; 95%) were accumulated when the spacecraft were relatively close (&lt; 15 AU) to the Sun. The exterior surfaces of the RTGs were covered by a zirconium coating in a sodium silicate binder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR350">350</xref>]. For similar inorganic coatings, the most pronounced effect of prolonged solar exposure is an increase (Δ<italic>α</italic> ∼ 0.05) in solar absorptance. No data suggest a noticeable change in infrared emittance.</p><p>The effects of exposure to dust and micrometeoroid impacts in the interplanetary environment do not result in significant optical damage, defined in terms of changes in solar absorptance or infrared emittance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. This is confirmed by the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft that had unprotected camera lenses that were facing the direction of motion, yet suffered no observable optical degradation. This fact suggests that the optical effects of exposure to the interplanetary medium on the spacecraft are negligible (see discussion in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR392">392</xref>]).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Pioneer Data Acquisition and Preparation</title><p>Discussions of radio science experiments with spacecraft in the solar system require a general knowledge of the sophisticated experimental techniques used by NASA’s Deep Space Network<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn7">7</xref> (DSN).

One also needs an understanding of how spacecraft telemetry is collected at the DSN, distributed and used to assess the state of the spacecraft systems at a particular epoch.</p><p>Since its beginnings in 1958, the DSN underwent a number of major upgrades and additions. This was necessitated by the needs of particular space missions<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn8">8</xref>. The history of the Pioneer 10 and 11 projects is inextricably connected to that of DSN. Due to the continuing improvements of the entire network, Pioneer 10 was able to communicate with the project team for over 30 years — far beyond the originally planned operational life of 3 years or less.</p><p>In this section, we discuss the history of the DSN, its current status, and describe the DSN antennas and operations in support of deep space missions. We also review the methods and techniques implemented in the radio science subsystem of the DSN that is used to obtain the radio tracking data, from which, after analysis, results are generated.</p><sec id="Sec3.1"><title>The Deep Space Network</title><p>Conceived at the dawn of the space era in the late 1950s, the DSN is a collection of radio tracking stations positioned around the globe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR374">374</xref>], along with ground data transfer and data processing systems, designed to maintain continuous two-way communication, including commands and telemetry, with a variety of deep space vehicles located throughout the solar system.</p><p>The first DSN complex was constructed near the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), in Goldstone, California. It was here that the first large (26 m) DSN antenna, DSS-11 “Pioneer” (named after, unsurprisingly, the early Pioneer program) was constructed.</p><p>The first overseas DSN location was in Woomera, Australia, about 350 km north of Adelaide. DSS-41, another 26 m antenna, was constructed there in 1960. The second overseas DSN complex was built near Johannesburg, South Africa. The 26 m antenna of DSS-26 was constructed there in 1961. Together, Goldstone, Woomera and Johannesburg made it possible to initiate and maintain continuous communication with distant spacecraft at any time of the day<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn9">9</xref>, marking the beginning of the DSN.</p><p>Today, three locations — Goldstone, California; Madrid, Spain; and Canberra, Australia — form the backbone of the DSN.

The DSN can send, or uplink, command instructions and data, and it can receive, or downlink, engineering telemetry and scientific observations from instruments on board these spacecraft.</p><p>The DSN can also be used for precision radio science measurements, including measurements of a signal’s frequency and timing observations. These capabilities allow the DSN to perform, for instance, Doppler measurements of line-of-sight velocity, ranging measurements to suitably equipped spacecraft, occultation experiments when a spacecraft flies behind a planetary body, and planetary radar observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>The antennas of the DSN are capable of bidirectional communication using a variety of frequencies in the L-band (1–2 GHz), S-band (2–4 GHz), X-band (8–12 GHz) and, more recently, K-band (12–40 GHz). Early spacecraft used the L-band for communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR241">241</xref>] but within a few years, S-band replaced L-band as the preferred frequency band. The Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft used S-band transmitters and receivers. X-band and, more recently, K-band is used on more modern spacecraft.</p><p>In addition to the permanent DSN complexes that presently exist at Goldstone, California, Madrid, Spain, and Canberra, Australia, and the now defunct complexes in Woomera, Australia and Johannesburg, South Africa, occasionally, non-DSN facilities (e.g., the Parkes radio observatory in Australia) were also utilized for communication and navigation. During the long lifetime of the Pioneer project, nearly all the large antennas of DSN tracking stations and also some non-DSN facilities participated in the tracking of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft at one time or another.</p><p>The capabilities of the DSN evolved over the years. By the time of the launch of Pioneer 10, the DSN was a mature network comprising a number of 26 m tracking stations at four locations around the globe, a new 64 m tracking station in operation at Goldstone, California, and two more 64 m tracking stations under construction in Australia and Spain. The Goldstone facility was connected to the then new Space Flight Operations Facility (SFOF) built at the JPL via a pair of 16.2 kbps communication links (Figure <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">3.1</xref>), allowing for the real-time monitoring of spacecraft telemetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR241">241</xref>].

Not the least of these improvements was an increase in antenna size, when the DSN’s 64 m antennas were enlarged to 70 m, and many of the 26 m antennas (notably, DSS-12, DSS-42, and DSS-61 from Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">3.1</xref>) were enlarged to 34 m.</p><p>In addition to the stations used initially (see Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">3.1</xref>) for communication with Pioneer 10 and 11, over the years many other stations were utilized, which are listed in Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">3.3</xref>.

These improvements were a result of other mission requirements, but the Pioneer project benefited: far beyond the predicted range of 22 AU, it was possible to maintain communication with Pioneer 10 when it was at an incredible 83 AU from the Sun. (The same DSN complex is now used to communicate with Voyager I spacecraft from heliocentric distances of over 110 AU.)</p><p>The receiver can contribute to a tracking station’s sensitivity in three different ways. First, the bandwidth of the receiver (loop bandwidth) can be reduced, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio. Two additional improvements, lowering the system noise temperature and eliminating other sources of signal attenuation, not only increase the signal-to-noise ratio but also decrease the bit error rate.</p><p>The “Block III” DSN receivers in use at the time of the launch of Pioneer 10 and 11 had an S-band system noise temperature of 28 K, and a receiver loop bandwidth of 12 Hz. These receivers were replaced in 1983–1985 by “Block IV” receivers in which the S-band system noise was reduced to 14.5 K in receive only mode, and the receiver loop bandwidth was reduced to 3 Hz. Further improvements came with the all-digital “Block V” receivers (also known as the Advanced Receivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>]) installed in the early 1990s that had, under ideal circumstances, an S-band system noise of only 12.9 K, and a receiver loop bandwidth of 0.1 Hz.</p><p>Together with the enlarged 70 m antenna, these improved receivers made it possible to receive the signal of Pioneer 10 at 83 AU with a bit error rate of ∼ 1%. This error rate was reduced further by the convolutional code in use by Pioneer 10 and 11, which amounted to a 3.8 dB improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio, resulting in an error rate of about one in 10<sup>4</sup> bits.</p><p>During planetary encounters, the rapidly changing velocity of the spacecraft can result in a Doppler shift of its received frequency. During Pioneer 11’s close encounter with Jupiter, this rate could be as high as <italic>df</italic>/<italic>dt</italic> = 0.52 Hz/s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Such a rapid change in received frequency can exceed the capabilities of the DSN closed loop receivers to remain “in lock”. To maintain continuous communication with such spacecraft, a “ramping” technique was implemented that allowed the tuned frequency of the DSN receiver to follow closely the predicted frequency of the spacecraft’s transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">182</xref>]. This ramping technique was used successfully during the Pioneer 10 and 11 planetary encounters. Later it became routine operating procedure for the DSN. (As late as Pioneer 11’s 1979 encounter with Saturn, ramp frequencies at DSS-62 were tuned manually by relays of operators, as an automatic tuning capability was not yet available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR241">241</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3.1.4"><title>DSN transmitters</title><p>To maintain continuous communication with distant spacecraft, the DSN must be able to transmit a signal to the spacecraft.

For a two-way Doppler experiment, for instance, that involves transmitting a signal to a distant spacecraft and then receiving a response perhaps several hours later, long-term stability of tracking station oscillators is essential. Furthermore, if more than one tracking station is involved in an observation (e.g., “three-way” Doppler in which case one station is used to uplink a signal to the spacecraft, and another station receives the spacecraft’s response), frequency and clock synchronization between the participating tracking stations must be very precise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p>Originally, the DSN used crystal oscillators. In the 1960s, these were replaced by rubidium or cesium oscillators that offered much improved frequency stability, and made precision radio-tracking of distant spacecraft possible. Rubidium and cesium oscillators offered a frequency stability of one part in ∼ 10<sup>12</sup> and one part in ∼ 10<sup>13</sup>, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR241">241</xref>], over typical Doppler counting intervals of 10<sup>2</sup>–10<sup>3</sup> seconds. (This is in agreement with the expected Allan deviation for the S-band signals.)</p><p>A further improvement occurred in the 1970s, when the rubidium and cesium oscillators were in turn replaced by hydrogen masers, which offered another order of magnitude improvement in frequency stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR241">241</xref>]. Today, the DSN’s frequency and timing system (FTS) is the source for the high accuracy mentioned above (see Figure <xref rid="Fig25" ref-type="fig">3.4</xref>). At its center is a hydrogen maser that produces a precise and stable reference frequency. These devices have Allan deviations (see Section <xref rid="Sec5.3.6" ref-type="sec">5.3.6</xref>) of approximately 3 × 10<sup>−15</sup> to 1 × 10<sup>−15</sup> for integration times of 10<sup>2</sup> to 10<sup>3</sup> seconds, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR374">374</xref>]. These masers are good enough that the quality of Doppler-measurement data is limited by thermal or plasma noise, and not by the inherent instability of the frequency references.

During the 1980s, hydrogen maser frequency standards were required to have Allan deviations of less than 10<sup>−14</sup> over time scales of 3–12 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. This corresponds to a Doppler frequency noise of 2 × 10<sup>−5</sup> Hz.</p><p>For three-way Doppler analysis, where the transmitting and receiving stations are different, the frequency offset between stations is the relevant quantity. During the 1980s, station frequencies were controlled to be the same, to a fractional error of 10<sup>−12</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR308">308</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR356">356</xref>]. This corresponds to a Doppler frequency bias of up to 2 × 10<sup>−3</sup> Hz between station pairs. Station keepers did maintain frequency offset knowledge to a tighter level, but for the most part this knowledge is not available to analysts today.</p><p>Three-way Doppler analysis is weakly sensitive to clock offsets between stations. By 1968, the operational technique for time synchronization was the “Moon Bounce Time Synch” technique, in which a precision-timed X-band signal from DSS-13 (which served as master timekeeper) was transmitted to overseas stations by way of a lunar reflection, achieving a clock accuracy of 5 <italic>µ</italic>s between stations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR241">241</xref>]. Such timing offsets would produce Doppler errors of less than 10<sup>−6</sup> Hz.

This is then sent to the Exciter Assembly. The Exciter Assembly multiplies the TSF by 96 to produce the S-band carrier signal at ∼ 2.2 GHz. The signal power is amplified by Traveling Wave Tubes (TWT) for transmission. If ranging data are required, the Exciter Assembly adds the ranging modulation to the carrier. The DSN tracking system has undergone many upgrades during the 34 years of tracking Pioneer 10. During this period internal frequencies have changed (see Section <xref rid="Sec3.1.1" ref-type="sec">3.1.1</xref>).</p><p>This S-band frequency is sent to the antenna where it is amplified and transmitted to the spacecraft. The onboard receiver tracks the up-link carrier using a phase lock loop. To ensure that the reception signal does not interfere with the transmission, the spacecraft (e.g., Pioneer) has a turnaround transponder with a ratio of 240/221 in the S-band. The spacecraft transmitter’s local oscillator is phase locked to the up-link carrier. It multiplies the received frequency by the above ratio and then re-transmits the signal to Earth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3.2.3"><title>Receiver and Doppler extractor</title><p>When the signal reaches the ground, the receiver locks on to the signal and tunes the Voltage Control Oscillator (VCO) to null out the phase error. The signal is sent to the Doppler Extractor. At the Doppler Extractor the current transmitter signal from the Exciter is multiplied by 240/221 (or 880/241 in the X-band) and a bias of 1 MHz for S-band or 5 MHz for X-band is added to the Doppler. The Doppler data is no longer modulated at S-band but has been reduced as a consequence of the bias to an intermediate frequency of 1 or 5 MHz.</p><p>The transmitter frequency of the DSN is a function of time, due to ramping and other scheduled frequency changes. When a two-way or three-way (see Section <xref rid="Sec3.2.5" ref-type="sec">3.2.5</xref>) Doppler measurement is performed, it is necessary to know the precise frequency at which the uplink signal was transmitted. This, in turn, requires knowledge of the exact light travel time to and from the spacecraft, which is available only when the position of the spacecraft is determined with precision. For this reason, DSN transmitter frequencies are recorded separately so that they can be accounted for in the orbit determination programs that we discuss in Section <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">5</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3.2.4"><title>Metric data assembly</title><p>The intermediate frequency (IF) of 1 or 5 MHz with a Doppler modulation is sent to the Metric Data Assembly (MDA). The MDA consists of computers and Doppler counters where continuous count Doppler data are generated. From the FTS a 10 pulse per second signal is also sent to the MDA for timing. At the MDA, the IF and the resulting Doppler pulses are counted at a rate of 10 pulses per second. At each tenth of a second, the number of Doppler pulses is recorded. A second counter begins at the instant the first counter stops. The result is continuously-counted Doppler data. (The Doppler data is a biased Doppler of 1 MHz, the bias later being removed by the analyst to obtain the true Doppler counts.) The range data (if present) together with the Doppler data are sent separately to the Ranging Demodulation Assembly. The accompanying Doppler data is used to “rate-aid” (i.e., to “freeze” the range signal) for demodulation and cross correlation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3.2.5"><title>Radiometric Doppler data</title><p>Doppler data is the measure of the cumulative number of cycles of a spacecraft’s carrier frequency received during a user-specified count interval. The exact precision to which these measurements can be carried out is a function of the received signal strength and station electronics, but it is a small fraction of a cycle. Raw Doppler data is generated at the tracking station and delivered via a DSN interface to customers.</p><p>When the measured signal originates on the spacecraft, the resulting Doppler data is called one-way or F1 data. In order for such data to be useful for precision navigation, the spacecraft must be equipped with a precision oscillator on board. The Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft had no such oscillator. Therefore, even though a notable amount of F1 Doppler data was collected from these spacecraft, these data are not usable for precision orbit determination.</p><p>An alternative to one-way Doppler involves a signal generated by a transmitter on the Earth, which is received and then returned by the spacecraft. The Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft were equipped with a radio communication subsystem that had the capability to operate in “coherent” mode, a mode of operation in which the return signal from the spacecraft is phase-locked to a signal received by the spacecraft from the Earth. In this mode of operation, the precision of the frequency measurement is not limited by the stability of equipment on board the spacecraft, only by the frequency stability of ground-based DSN stations.</p><p>When the signal is transmitted from, and received by, the same station, the measurement is referred to as a two-way or F2 Doppler measurement; if the transmitting and receiving stations differ, the measurement is a three-way (F3) Doppler measurement.</p><p>Knowing the frequency of a signal received at a precise time at a precisely known location is only half the story in the case of two-way or three-way Doppler data: information must also be known about the time and location of transmission and the frequency of the transmitted signal.</p><p>The frequency of the transmitter, or the frequency of the receiver’s reference oscillator may not be fixed. In order to achieve better quality communication with spacecraft the velocity of which varies with respect to ground stations, a technique called ramping has been implemented at the DSN. When a frequency is ramped, it is varied linearly starting with a known initial frequency, at a known rate of frequency change over unit time.</p><p>Thus, a Doppler data point is completely characterized by the following:

(“Open loop” data is recorded to tape but not tracked by phase lock loop hardware.) There are basically two types of data: Doppler (frequency) and range (time of flight), recorded at the tracking sites of the DSN as a function of UT Ground Received Time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. During their missions, the raw radiometric tracking data from Pioneer 10 and 11 were received originally in the form of Intermediate Data Record (IDR) tapes, which were then processed into special binary files called Archival Tracking Data Files (ATDF, format TRK-2-25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]), containing Doppler data from the standard DSN tracking receivers (Figure <xref rid="Fig26" ref-type="fig">3.5</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn15">15</xref>. Note that the “closed-loop” data constitutes the ATDFs that were used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="Fig26" ref-type="fig">3.5</xref> shows a typical tracking configuration for a Pioneer-class mission and corresponding data format flow.

They are derived from Intermediate Data Records by NAV and contain all radiometric measurements received from the DSN station including signal levels (AGC = automatic gain control in dB), antenna pointing angles, frequency (often referred to simply as “Doppler”), range, and residuals. Each ATDF consists of all tracking data types used to navigate a particular spacecraft (Pioneers had only Doppler data type) and typically include Doppler, range and angular types (in S-, X-, and L-frequency bands), differenced range versus integrated Doppler, programmed frequency data, pseudo-residuals, and validation data. (Unfortunately there was no range capability implemented on Pioneer 10 and 11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Early in the mission, JPL successfully simulated range data using the “ramped-range” technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">182</xref>]. In this method, the transmitter frequency is ramped up and down with a known pattern. One round trip light time later, this same pattern appears at the DSN receiver, and can be used to solve for the round trip light travel time. Later in the mission, this technique became unusable because the carrier tracking loop bandwidth required to detect the carrier became too narrow to track the ramped frequency changes.) Also, ATDFs contain data for a single spacecraft, for one or more ground receiving stations, and for one or more tracking passes or days.</p><p>After a standard processing at the Radio Metric Data Conditioning group (RMDC) of JPL’s Navigation and Mission Design Section, ATDFs are transformed into Orbit Data Files (ODF, format TRK-2-18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]). A program called <bold>STRIPPER</bold> is used to produce the ODFs that are, at this point, the main product that is distributed to the end users for their orbit determination needs (see more discussion on the conversion process in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]). At JPL, after yet additional processing, these ODFs are used to produce sequentially formatted input/output files in <bold>NAVIO</bold> format that is used by navigators while working with the JPL Orbit Determination Program. (Note that the <bold>NAVIO</bold> input/output file format is used only at JPL; other orbit determination programs convert ODFs to their particular formats.)</p><p>Each ODF physical record is 2016 32-bit words in length and consists of 224 9-word logical records per data block. The ODF records are arranged in a sequence that consists of one file label record, one file identifier logical record, orbit data logical records in time order, ramp data logical records in time order, clock offset data logical records in time order, data summary logical records in time order and software/hardware end-of-file markers. Bit lengths of data fields are variable and cross word boundaries. An ODF usually contains most types of records, but may not have them all. The first record in each of the 7 primary groups is a header record; depending on the group, there may be from zero to many data records following each header.

This task proved much harder than anticipated, due to antiquated file formats, missing data, and corrupted files (see discussion below and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR397">397</xref>]).</p><p>Below we discuss these two sets of Pioneer 10 and 11 Doppler data.</p><sec id="Sec3.3.1"><title>Pioneer Doppler data available in 2002</title><p>The anomalous acceleration of the Pioneer spacecraft was first reported in 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

In this study, a significantly expanded set of Doppler data was utilized. For Pioneer 10, the data set covered the period between January 3, 1987 and July 22, 1998. This corresponds to heliocentric distances between 40 and 70.5 AU. The data set contained 19,403 Doppler data points. For Pioneer 11, the data set was smaller: the trajectory of the spacecraft between January 5, 1987 and October 1, 1990 was covered, corresponding to heliocentric distances between 22.42 and 31.7 AU, with 10,252 Doppler data points.</p><p>The 2002 JPL study was also the first to combine Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 results.

Even physically locating the data proved to be a difficult task, as incomplete holdings were scattered among various archives.

Similarly, for Pioneer 11, good data is available from mid-1978 until the loss of coherent mode in late 1990. Further details will be reported as appropriate upon the conclusion of this initial data analysis.</p><p>To summarize, there exists more than 20 years of Pioneer 10 and more than 10 years of Pioneer 11 data, a significant fraction of which had never been well studied for the purposes of anomaly investigation. This new, expanded data set may make it possible to answer questions concerning the constancy and direction of the anomalous acceleration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3.4"><title>Doppler observables and data preparation</title><p>The Doppler observable can be predicted if the spacecraft’s orbit is known. Given known initial conditions and the ephemerides of gravitating sources, a dynamic model can be constructed that yields predictions of the spacecraft’s position as a function of time. An observational model can account for the propagation of the signal, allowing a computation of the received signal frequency at a ground station of known terrestrial location. The difference between the calculated and observed values of the received frequency is known as the Doppler residual. If this residual exceeds acceptable limits, the dynamic model or observational model must be adjusted to account for the discrepancy. Once the model is found to be sufficiently accurate, it can also be used to plan the spacecraft’s future trajectory (see Figure <xref rid="Fig27" ref-type="fig">4.1</xref> and relevant discussion in Section <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">4</xref>).

(In the Pioneer Doppler experiments, the stability of the fractional drift at the S-band is on the order of Δ<italic>ν</italic>/<italic>ν</italic><sub>0</sub> ≃ 10<sup>−12</sup>, for integration times on the order of 10<sup>3</sup> s.) Doppler measurements provide the “range rate” of the spacecraft and therefore are affected by all the dynamical phenomena in the volume between the Earth and the spacecraft.</p><p>Expanding upon what was discussed in Section <xref rid="Sec3.2" ref-type="sec">3.2</xref>, the received signal and the transmitter frequency (both are at S-band) as well as a 10 pulse per second timing reference from the FTS are fed to the Metric Data Assembly (MDA). There the Doppler phase (difference between transmitted and received phases plus an added bias) is counted. That is, digital counters at the MDA record the zero crossings of the difference (i.e., Doppler, or alternatively the beat frequency of the received frequency and the exciter frequency). After counting, the bias is removed so that the true phase is produced.</p><p>The system produces “continuous count Doppler” and it uses two counters. Every tenth of a second, a Doppler phase count is recorded from one of the counters. The other counter continues the counts. The recording alternates between the two counters to maintain a continuous unbroken count. The Doppler counts are at 1 MHz for S-band or 5 MHz for X-band. The wavelength of each S-band cycle is about 13 cm. Dividers or “time resolvers” further subdivide the cycle into 256 parts, so that fractional cycles are measured with a resolution of 0.5 mm. This accuracy can only be maintained if the Doppler is continuously counted (no breaks in the count) and coherent frequency standards are kept throughout the pass. It should be noted that no error is accumulated in the phase count as long as lock is not lost. The only errors are the stability of the hydrogen maser and the resolution of the “resolver.”</p><p>Consequently, the JPL Doppler records are not frequency measurements. Rather, they are digitally counted measurements of the Doppler phase difference between the transmitted and received S-band frequencies, divided by the count time.</p><p>Therefore, the Doppler observables to which we will refer have units of cycles per second or Hz. Since total count phase observables are Doppler observables multiplied by the count interval <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>, they have units of cycles. The Doppler integration time refers to the total counting of the elapsed periods of the wave with the reference frequency of the hydrogen maser. The usual Doppler integrating times for the Pioneer Doppler signals refers to the data sampled over intervals of 10 s, 60 s, 600 s, 660 s, or 1980 s.</p><p>In order to acquire Doppler data, the user must provide a reference trajectory and information concerning the spacecraft’s RF system to JPL’s Deep Space Mission System (DSMS), to allow for the generation of pointing and frequency predictions. The user specified count interval can vary from 0.1 s to tens of minutes. Absent any systematic errors, the precision improves as the square root of the count interval. Count times of 10 to 60 seconds are typical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>], as well as intervals of ∼ 2000 s, which is an averaging interval located at the minimum of the Allan variance curve for hydrogen masers. The average rate of change of the cycle count over the count interval expresses a measurement of the average velocity of the spacecraft in the line between the antenna and the spacecraft. The accuracy of Doppler data is quoted in terms of how accurate this velocity measurement is over a 60 second count.</p><p>It is also possible to infer the position in the sky of a spacecraft from the Doppler data. This is accomplished by examining the diurnal variation imparted to the Doppler shift by the Earth’s rotation. As the ground station rotates underneath a spacecraft, the Doppler shift is modulated by a sinusoid. The sinusoid’s amplitude depends on the declination angle of the spacecraft and its phase depends upon the right ascension. These angles can therefore be estimated from a record of the Doppler shift that is (at least) of several days duration. This allows for a determination of the distance to the spacecraft through the dynamics of spacecraft motion using standard orbit theory contained in the orbit determination programs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3.4.2"><title>Data preparation</title><p>In an ideal system, all scheduled observations would be used in determining parameters of physical interest. However, there are inevitable problems that occur in data collection and processing that corrupt the data. So, at various stages of the signal processing one must remove or “edit” corrupted data. Thus, the need arises for objective editing criteria. Procedures have been developed, which attempt to excise corrupted data on the basis of objective criteria. There is always a temptation to eliminate data that is not well explained by existing models, to thereby “improve” the agreement between theory and experiment. Such an approach may, of course, eliminate the very data that would indicate deficiencies in the <italic>a priori</italic> model. This would preclude the discovery of improved models.</p><p>In the processing stage that fits the Doppler samples, checks are made to ensure that there are no integer cycle slips in the data stream that would corrupt the phase. This is done by considering the difference of the phase observations taken at a high rate (10 times a second) to produce Doppler. Cycle slips often are dependent on tracking loop bandwidths, the signal-to-noise ratios, and predictions of frequencies. Blunders due to out-of-lock can be determined by looking at the original tracking data. In particular, cycle slips due to loss-of-lock stand out as a 1 Hz blunder point for each cycle slipped.</p><p>If a blunder point is observed, the count is stopped and a Doppler point is generated by summing the preceding points. Otherwise the count is continued until a specified maximum duration is reached. Cases where this procedure detected the need for cycle corrections were flagged in the database and often individually examined by an analyst. Sometimes the data was corrected, but nominally the blunder point was just eliminated. This ensures that the data is consistent over a pass. However, it does not guarantee that the pass is good, because other errors can affect the whole pass and remain undetected until the orbit determination is done.</p><p>To produce an input data file for an orbit determination program, JPL has a software package known as the Radio Metric Data Selection, Translation, Revision, Intercalation, Processing and Performance Evaluation Reporting (RMD-STRIPPER) program. As we discussed in Section <xref rid="Sec3.4.1" ref-type="sec">3.4.1</xref>, this input file has data that can be integrated over intervals with different durations: 10 s, 60 s, 600 s, 660 s, and 1980 s. This input orbit determination file obtained from the RMDC group is the data set that can be used for analysis. Therefore, the initial data file already contained some common data editing that the RMDC group had implemented through program flags, etc. The data set we started with had already been compressed to 60 s. So, perhaps there were some blunders that had already been removed using the initial <bold>STRIPPER</bold> program.</p><p>The orbit analyst manually edits the remaining corrupted data points. Editing is done either by plotting the data residuals and deleting them from the fit or plotting weighted data residuals. That is, the residuals are divided by the standard deviation assigned to each data point and plotted. This gives the analyst a realistic view of the data noise during those times when the data was obtained while looking through the solar plasma. Applying an “<italic>N</italic>−<italic>σ</italic>” (<italic>σ</italic> is the standard deviation) test, where <italic>N</italic> is the choice of the analyst (usually 4–10) the analyst can delete those points that lie outside the <italic>N</italic>−<italic>σ</italic> rejection criterion without being biased in his selection.</p><p>A careful analysis edits only very corrupted data; e.g., a blunder due to a phase lock loss, data with bad spin calibration, etc. If needed or desired, the orbit analyst can choose to perform an additional data compression of the original navigation data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3.4.3"><title>Data weighting</title><p>The Pioneers used S-band (∼ 2.2 GHz) radio signals to communicate with the DSN. The S-band data is available from 26 m, 70 m, and some 34 m antennas of the DSN complex (see baseline DSN configuration in the Figure <xref rid="Fig25" ref-type="fig">3.4</xref>). The dominant systematic error that can affect S-band tracking data is ionospheric transmission delays. When the spacecraft is located angularly close to the Sun, with Sun-Earth-spacecraft angles of less than 10 degrees, degradation of the data accuracy will occur. S-band data is generally unusable for Sun-Earth-spacecraft angles of less than 5 degrees.</p><p>Therefore, considerable effort has gone into accurately estimating measurement errors in the observations. These errors provide the data weights necessary to accurately estimate the parameter adjustments and their associated uncertainties. To the extent that measurement errors are accurately modeled, the parameters extracted from the data will be unbiased and will have accurate sigmas assigned to them. Typically, for S-band Doppler data one assigns a standard 1−<italic>σ</italic> uncertainty of 1 mm/s over a 60 s count time after calibration for transmission media effects.</p><p>A change in the DSN antenna elevation angle also directly affects the Doppler observables due to tropospheric refraction. Therefore, to correct for the influence of the Earth’s troposphere the data can also be deweighted for low elevation angles.

Due to the star sensor failure on board Pioneer 10 (see Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref>), once the spacecraft was more than ∼ 30 AU from the Sun, no on-board roll reference was available. Until mid-1993, a science instrument (the Infrared Photo-Polarimeter) was used as a surrogate star sensor, which allowed the accurate determination of the spacecraft spin rate; however, due to the lack of available electrical power on board, this instrument could not be used after 1993. However, analysts still could get a rough spin determination approximately every six months using information obtained from the conscan maneuvers. No spin determinations were made after 1995. However, the archived conscan data could still yield spin data at every maneuver time if such work was approved. Further, as the phase center of the main antenna is slightly offset from the spin axis, a very small (but detectable) sine-wave signal appears in the high-rate Doppler data. In principle, this could be used to determine the spin rate for passes taken after 1993, but it has not been attempted.</p><p>The changing spin rates of Pioneer 10 and 11 can be an indication of gas leaks, which can also be a source of unmodeled accelerations.

But how good is the data? Over forty billion bytes were received by the DSN, processed, copied to tape, copied from tape to magneto-optical disks, then again copied over a network connection to a personal computer. It is not inconceivable that the occasional byte was corrupted by a transmission or storage error. There are records that contain what is apparently bogus data, especially from the later years of operation. This, plus the fact that the record structure (e.g., headers, synchronization sequences) is intact suggests reception errors as the spacecraft’s signal got weaker due to increasing distance, and not copying and/or storage errors.</p><p>The MDRs contain no error detection or error correction code, so it is not possible to estimate the error rate. However, it is likely to be reasonably low, since the equipment used for storage and copying is generally considered very reliable. Furthermore, any errors would likely show up as random noise, and not as a systemic bias. In this regard, the data should generally be viewed to be of good quality insofar as the goal of constructing an engineering profile of the spacecraft is considered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3.5.2"><title>Interpreting the data</title><p>MDRs are a useless collection of bits unless information is available about their structure and content. Fortunately, this is the case in the case of the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 MDRs.</p><p>The structure of an MDR is shown in Appendix <xref rid="App3" ref-type="app">C</xref> (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR402">402</xref>]). The frame at the beginning and at the end of each 1344-bit record contained information about the DSN station that received the data, and included a timestamp, data quality and error indicators, and the strength of the received signal. The middle of the record was occupied by as many as four consecutive data frames received by the spacecraft.</p><p>The MDR header is followed by four data frames (not all four frames may be used, but they are all present) of 192 bits each. Lastly, an additional 8 words of DSN information completes the record. The total length of an MDR is thus 42 words of 32 bits each.</p><p>The 192-bit data frames are usually interpreted as 64 3-bit words or, alternatively, as 32 6-bit words. The Pioneer project used many different data frame formats during the course of the mission. Some formats were dedicated to engineering telemetry (accelerated formats). Other formats are science data formats, but still contain engineering telemetry in the form of a subcommutator: a different engineering telemetry value is transmitted in each frame, and eventually, all telemetry values are cycled through.</p><p>The Pioneer spacecraft had a total of 128 6-bit words reserved for engineering telemetry. Almost all these values are, in fact, used. A complete specification of the engineering telemetry values can be found in Section <xref rid="Sec3.5" ref-type="sec">3.5</xref> (“Data Handling Subsystem”) of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR292">292</xref>]. When engineering telemetry was accelerated to the main frame rate, four different record formats (C-1 through C-4) were used to transmit telemetry information. When the science data formats were in use, an area of the record was reserved for a subcommutator identifier and value.</p><p>The formats are further complicated by the fact that some engineering telemetry values appear only in subcommutators, whereas others only appear at the accelerated (main frame) rate.</p><p>In the various documentation packages, engineering data words are identified either by mnemonic, by the letter ‘C’ followed by a three-digit number that runs from 1 through 128, or most commonly, by the letter ‘C’ followed by a digit indicating which ‘C’ record (C-1 through C-4) the value appears in, and a two-digit number between 1 and 32: for instance, C-201 means the first engineering word in the C-2 record.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3.5.3"><title>Available telemetry information</title><p>Pioneer 10 and 11 telemetry data is very relevant for a study of on-board systematics.

Most of these investigations of on-board systematics were not very precise. This was due to a set of several reasons, one of them is insufficient amount of actual telemetry data from the vehicles. In 2005, this picture changed dramatically when this critical information became available.</p><p>Table <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table">3.6.</xref> summarizes all available telemetry values in the C (engineering) and E (science) telemetry formats.

temperature, voltage, current readings; other analog readings; various binary counters, values, and bit fields; and readings from science instruments. Temperature and electrical readings are of the greatest use, as they help to establish a detailed thermal profile of the spacecrafts’ major components. Some binary readings are useful; for instance, thruster pulse count readings help to understand maneuvers and their impact on the spacecrafts’ trajectories. It is important to note, however, that some readings may not be available and others may not be trusted. For example, thruster pulse count readings are only telemetered when the spacecraft is commanded to send readings in accelerated engineering formats; since these formats were rarely used late in the mission, we may not have pulse count readings for many maneuvers. Regarding reliability, we know from mission status reports about the failure of the sun and star sensors; these failures invalidate many readings from that point onward. Thus it is important to view telemetry readings in context before utilizing them as source data for our investigation.</p><p>On-board telemetry not only gives a detailed picture of the spacecraft and its subsystems, but this picture is redundant: electrical, thermal, logic state and other readings provide means to examine the same event from a multitude of perspectives.</p><p>In addition to telemetry, there exists an entire archive of the Pioneer Project documents for the period from 1966 to 2003. This archive contains all Pioneer 10 and 11 project documents discussing the spacecraft and mission design, fabrication of various components, results of various tests performed during fabrication, assembly, pre-launch, as well as calibrations performed on the vehicles; and also administrative documents including quarterly reports, memoranda, etc. Information on most of the maneuver records, spin rate data, significant events of the craft, etc. is also available.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Navigation of the Pioneer Spacecraft</title><p>Modern radio tracking techniques made it possible to explore the gravitational environment in the solar system up to a level of accuracy never before possible.

We also discuss effects acting on the radio signal sent to, or received from, the spacecraft.</p><sec id="Sec4.3.1"><title>Solar radiation pressure</title><p>Most notable among the sources for the forces external to the Pioneer spacecraft is the solar pressure. This force is a result of the exchange of momentum between solar photons and the spacecraft, as solar photons are absorbed or reflected by the spacecraft. This force can be significant in magnitude in the vicinity of the Earth, at ∼ 1 AU from the Sun, especially when considering spacecraft with a large surface area, such as those with large solar panels or antennas. For this reason, solar pressure models are usually developed before a spacecraft is launched. These models take into account the effective surface areas of the portions of the spacecraft exposed to sunlight, and their thermal and optical properties. These models offer a computation of the acceleration of the spacecraft due to solar pressure as a function of solar distance and spacecraft orientation.</p><p>The simplest way of modeling solar pressure is by using a “flat plate” model. In this case, the spacecraft is treated as a flat surface, oriented at same angle with respect to incoming solar rays. The surface absorbs some solar heat, while it reflects the rest; reflection can be specular or diffuse. A flat plate model is fully characterized by three numbers: the area of the plate, its specular and its diffuse reflectivities. This model is particularly applicable to Pioneer 10 and 11 throughout most of their mission, as the spacecraft were oriented such that their large parabolic dish antennas were aimed only a few degrees away from the Sun, and most of the spacecraft body was behind the antenna, not exposed to sunlight.</p><p>In the case of a flat plate model, the force produced by the solar pressure can be described using a combination of several force vectors. One vector, the direction of which coincides with the direction of incoming solar radiation, represents the force due to photons from solar radiation intercepted by the spacecraft. The magnitude of this vector <bold>F</bold><sub>intcpt</sub> is proportional to the solar constant at the spacecraft’s distance from the Sun, multiplied by the projected area of the flat plate surface: <disp-formula id="Equ16"><label>4.8</label><alternatives><tex-math id="Equ16_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

In the case of the historical Doppler data of Pioneer 10 and 11, the purpose is not to navigate a live spacecraft, but to provide a model of as large a segment of the spacecraft’s trajectory as possible, using a consistent set of parameters and minimizing the model residual. Several, independent efforts to analyze the trajectories of the two spacecraft have demonstrated that this can be accomplished using multi-year spans of data with a root-mean-square model residual of no more than a few mHz.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4.7"><title>Orbit determination and parameter estimation</title><p>The Pioneer anomaly has been verified using a variety of independent orbit determination codes. The code that was used for the initial discovery of the anomaly, JPL’s Orbit Determination Program (ODP), is probably also the most comprehensive and best tested among these, as it is the primary code that is being used to navigate US and many international spacecraft anywhere in the solar system, especially in very deep space. ODP is a complex engineering achievement that includes many thousands of lines of code that were built during the last 50 years of space exploration. The physical models in ODP draw on fundamental principles and practices developed during decades of deep space exploration (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">204</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">235</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">240</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR348">348</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR374">374</xref>]). In its core, ODP relies on a program called “<bold>Regress</bold>” that calculates the computed values of Doppler (and other) observables obtained at the tracking stations of the DSN. <bold>Regress</bold> also calculates media corrections and partial derivatives of the computed values of the observables with respect to the solve-for-parameter vector-state.</p><p>An orbit determination procedure first determines the spacecraft’s initial position and velocity in a data interval. For each data interval, we then estimate the magnitudes of the orientation maneuvers, if any. The analysis uses models that include the effects of planetary perturbations, radiation pressure, the interplanetary media, general relativity, and bias and drift in the Doppler and range (if available). Planetary coordinates and solar system masses are obtained using JPL’s Export Planetary Ephemeris DE<bold>nnn</bold>, where DE stands for the Development Ephemeris and <bold>nnn</bold> is the current number. (Earlier in the study, DE200 and DE405 were used, presently DE412 is available.)</p><p>Current versions of ODP implement computations in the J2000.0 epoch. Past versions used B1950.0. (See [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR361">361</xref>] for details on the conversion of positions and proper motions between these two epochs.)</p><p>Standard ODP modeling includes a number of solid-Earth effects, namely precession, nutation, sidereal rotation, polar motion, tidal effects, and tectonic plates drift (see discussion in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]). Model values of the tidal deceleration, nonuniformity of rotation, polar motion, Love numbers, and Chandler wobble are obtained observationally, by means of lunar and satellite laser ranging (LLR, SLR) techniques and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). Currently this information is provided by way of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF). JPL’s Earth Orientation Parameters (EOP) is a major source contributor to the ICRF.</p><p>Since the previous analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], physical models for the Earth’s interior and the planetary ephemeris have greatly improved. This is due to progress in GPS, SLR, LLR and VLBI techniques, Doppler spacecraft tracking, and new radio science data processing algorithms. ODP models have been updated using these latest Earth models (adopted by the IERS) and also are using the latest planetary ephemeris. This allows for a better characterization of not only the constant part of any anomalous acceleration, but also of the annual and diurnal terms detected in the Pioneer 10 and 11 Doppler residuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR274">274</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR390">390</xref>].</p><p>During the last few decades, the algorithms of orbital analysis have been extended to incorporate a Kalman-filter estimation procedure that is based on the concept of “process noise” (i.e., random, nonsystematic forces, or random-walk effects). This was motivated by the need to respond to the significant improvement in observational accuracy and, therefore, to the increasing sensitivity to numerous small perturbing factors of a stochastic nature that are responsible for observational noise. This approach is well justified when one needs to make accurate predictions of the spacecraft’s future behavior using only the spacecraft’s past hardware and electronics state history as well as the dynamic environmental conditions in the distant craft’s vicinity. Modern navigational software often uses Kalman-filter estimation since it more easily allows determination of the temporal noise history than does the weighted least-squares estimation.</p><p>ODP also enables the use of batch-sequential filtering and a smoothing algorithm with process noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Though the name may imply otherwise, batch-sequential processing does not involve processing the data in batches. Instead, in this approach any small anomalous forces may be treated as stochastic parameters affecting the spacecraft trajectory. As such, these parameters are also responsible for the stochastic noise in the observational data. To characterize these noise sources, we split the data interval into a number of constant or variable size batches with respect to the stochastic parameters, and make assumptions on the possible statistical properties of the noise factors. We then estimate the mean values of the unknown parameters within the batch and their second statistical moments. (More details on this “batch-sequential algorithm with smoothing filter” in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">240</xref>]). ODP is permanently being updated to suit the needs of precision navigation; the progress in the estimation algorithms, programming languages, models of small forces and new navigation methods have strongly supported its recent upgrades.</p><p>There have been a number of new models developed that are needed for the analysis of tracking data from interplanetary spacecraft that are now an integral part of the latest generation of the JPL’s ODP. These include an update to the relativistic formulation of the planetary and spacecraft motion, relativistic light propagation and relevant radiometric observables (i.e., Doppler, range, VLBI, and Delta Differential One-way Ranging or ΔDOR), coordinate transformation between relativistic reference frames, and several models for nongravitational forces.

For attitude control, the spacecraft were spin-stabilized, requiring a minimum number of attitude correction maneuvers, further reducing navigation noise.

Anderson from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Starting in 1979, the team led by Anderson began a systematic search for unmodeled accelerations in the trajectories of the two spacecraft. The principal aim of this investigation was the search for a hypothetical tenth planet, Planet X. Later, Pioneer 10 and 11 were used to search for trans-Neptunian objects; the superior quality of their Doppler tracking results also yielded the first ever limits on low frequency gravitational radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>The acceleration sensitivity of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft was at the level of ∼ 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>.

Eventually, a proposal was made to NASA to initiate a formal study. The proposal argued that the anomaly is evident in the data of both spacecraft; that no physical model available can explain the puzzling behavior; and that, perhaps, an investigation with two independent software codes is needed to exclude the possibility of a systematic error in the navigational software. NASA supported the proposed investigation and, in 1995, the formal study was initiated at JPL and, independently, at the Aerospace Corporation, focusing solely on the acceleration anomaly detected in the radiometric Doppler data of both spacecraft Pioneer 10 and 11.</p><p>Acceleration estimates for Pioneer 10 and 11 were developed at the JPL using the Orbit Determination Program (ODP). The independent analysis performed by The Aerospace Corporation utilized a different software package called Compact High Accuracy Satellite Motion Program (CHASMP). This effort confirmed the presence of the anomalous acceleration, excluded computational systematics as a likely cause, and also indicated a possible detection of a sunward acceleration anomaly in the Galileo and Ulysses spacecrafts’ signals.</p><p>Standard navigational models account for a number of post-Newtonian perturbations in the dynamics of the planets, the Moon, and spacecraft.

(The acceleration due to the solar wind is roughly a hundred times smaller than this.)</p><p>The initial results of both teams (JPL and The Aerospace Corporation) were published in 1998 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The JPL group concluded that there is indeed an unmodeled acceleration, <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>P</italic></sub>, towards the Sun, the magnitude of which is (8.09 ± 0.20) × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup> for Pioneer 10 and (8.56 ± 0.15) × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup> for Pioneer 11. The formal error is determined by the use of a five-day batch sequential filter with radial acceleration as a stochastic parameter, subject to white Gaussian noise (∼ 500 independent five-day samples of radial acceleration). No magnitude variation of <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>P</italic></sub> with distance was found, within a sensitivity of 2 × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup> over a range of 40 to 60 AU.</p><p>To determine whether or not the anomalous acceleration is specific to the spacecraft, an attempt was made to detect any anomalous acceleration signal in the tracking data of the Galileo and Ulysses spacecraft. It soon became clear that in the case of Galileo, the effects of solar radiation and an anomalous acceleration component cannot be separated. For Ulysses, however, a possible sunward anomalous acceleration was seen in the data, at (12 ± 3) × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>. Thus, the data from the Galileo and Ulysses spacecraft yielded ambiguous results for the anomalous acceleration. Nevertheless, the analysis of data from these two additional spacecraft was useful in that it ruled out the possibility of a systematic error in the DSN Doppler system that could easily have been mistaken as a spacecraft acceleration.</p><p>The systematic error found in the Pioneer 10/11 post-fit residuals could not be eliminated by taking into account all known gravitational and nongravitational forces, both internal and external to the spacecraft.

The power needed to explain the anomalous acceleration is ∼ 65 W. Nonetheless, anisotropically emitted thermal radiation was not seen as a likely explanation, for two reasons: first, it was assumed, after an initial analysis of the spacecraft’s geometry, that the thermal radiation would be largely isotropic, and further, the observed acceleration did not appear to be consistent with the decay rate of the radioactive fuel.</p><p>As a result of this work, it became clear that a detailed investigation of the Pioneer anomaly was needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5.2"><title>The 2002 formal solution for the anomalous acceleration</title><p>The most definitive study to date of the Pioneer anomaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] used Pioneer 10 data from January 3, 1987 to July 22, 1998, and Pioneer 11 data from January 5, 1987 to October 1, 1990 (at this time, Pioneer 11 lost coherent mode capability, as described in Section <xref rid="Sec2.2.7" ref-type="sec">2.2.7</xref>).

The existence and magnitude of the anomalous acceleration has been confirmed by several independent researchers. Others have attempted to model the thermal behavior of the spacecraft, arguing that the magnitude of thermal recoil forces might have been underestimated by the 2002 study. The recovery of essentially all Pioneer 10 and 11 telemetry, as well as large quantities of archived project documentation, raised hope that it might be possible to construct a sufficiently accurate thermal model of the spacecraft using modeling software, and properly estimate the magnitude of the thermal recoil force.

The explanations targeted the effect with the properties presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR390">390</xref>] and summarized in Section <xref rid="Sec5.6" ref-type="sec">5.6</xref>. These key properties include i) the magnitude and the apparent constancy of the anomalous acceleration, ii) its nearly Sun-pointing direction, and iii) the apparent “onset” of the anomaly. This set of “known” properties was used to analyze the mechanisms that were put forward in numerous attempts to identify the origin of the effect. Although the proposals are all very different and include conventional and new physics ideas, it is possible to place them into several broad categories. In this section we review some of these proposed mechanisms.</p><p>First, there are attempts to explain the anomaly using unmodeled conventional forces with an origin external to the spacecraft (Section <xref rid="Sec6.1" ref-type="sec">6.1</xref>), which may be both gravitational or nongravitational in nature. Some authors considered the possibility that the anomalous effect may be due to a new physics mechanism indicating, for instance, modification of gravity (Section <xref rid="Sec6.2" ref-type="sec">6.2</xref>), or may have a cosmological origin (Section <xref rid="Sec6.3" ref-type="sec">6.3</xref>). On the other hand, the fact that the Pioneer anomaly was observed in the radiometric Doppler signal opens up the possibility that the anomaly is not a dynamical effect on the trajectories of the probes but instead is due to an unmodeled effect on their radio signal (Section <xref rid="Sec6.4" ref-type="sec">6.4</xref>). We also consider proposals that attempt to explain the anomaly using unmodeled forces of on-board origin (Section <xref rid="Sec6.5" ref-type="sec">6.5</xref>). Lastly, we review miscellaneous mechanisms (Section <xref rid="Sec6.6" ref-type="sec">6.6</xref>) and some common misconceptions before moving on to a discussion of independent observational confirmations (Section <xref rid="Sec6.7" ref-type="sec">6.7</xref>) and proposals for dedicated space experiments (Section <xref rid="Sec6.8" ref-type="sec">6.8</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec6.1"><title>Unmodeled forces external to the spacecraft</title><p>The trajectory of the Pioneer spacecraft, while governed primarily by the gravity of the solar system, is nevertheless a result of a complex combination of gravitational and nongravitational forces, all of which must be taken into account for a precision orbit determination. What if some of those forces were not properly accounted for in the model, resulting in an unmodeled acceleration of the observed magnitude? Several authors considered this possibility.</p><sec id="Sec6.1.1"><title>Gravitational forces due to unknown mass distributions and the Kuiper belt</title><p>Of course, one of the most natural mechanisms to generate a putative physical force is the gravitational attraction due to a known mass distribution in the outer solar system; for instance, due to Kuiper belt objects or interplanetary dust. Anderson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] have considered such a possibility by studying various known density distributions for the Kuiper belt and concluded these density distributions are incompatible with the discovered properties of the anomaly. Even worse, these distributions cannot circumvent the constraint from the undisturbed orbits of Mars and Jupiter.</p><p>The possibility of a gravitational perturbation on the Pioneer paths has also been considered by the authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR253">253</xref>], who studied the possible effects produced by different Kuiper Belt mass distributions, and concluded that the Kuiper Belt cannot produce the observed acceleration.</p><p>Nieto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR253">253</xref>] studied several models for 3-dimensional rings and wedges whose densities are either constant or vary as the inverse of the distance, as the inverse-squared distance, or according to the Boss-Peale model. It was demonstrated that physically viable models of this type can produce neither the magnitude nor the constancy of the Pioneer anomaly. In fact, the results emphasized the difficulty in achieving a constant acceleration within a finite cylindrically-symmetric distribution of matter. The difficulties are even stronger if one considers the amount of mass that would be needed to mimic the Pioneer anomaly.</p><p>The density of dust is not large enough to produce a gravitational acceleration on the order of <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>P</italic></sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR253">253</xref>] and also it varies greatly within the Kuiper belt, precluding any constant acceleration. In particular, Bertolami and Vieira [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] obtained the largest acceleration when the Kuiper belt was represented by a two-ring model. In this case, the following magnitude of a radial acceleration <italic>a</italic><sub>rad</sub> could be obtained (using spherical coordinates (<italic>r</italic>, <italic>θ</italic>, <italic>Φ</italic>)): <disp-formula id="Equ77"><label>6.1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="Equ77_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

In particular, the authors considered this idea by taking into account the known properties of dust in the solar system, which is composed of thinly scattered matter with two main contributions:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>Interplanetary Dust (IPD)</italic>: a hot-wind plasma (mainly <italic>p</italic> and <italic>e</italic><sup>−</sup>) within the Kuiper Belt, from 30 to 100 AU with a modeled density of <italic>ρ</italic><sub>IPD</sub> ≲ 10<sup>−21</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>; and</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Interstellar Dust (ISD)</italic>: composed of fractions of interstellar dust (characterized by greater impact velocity).

In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR262">262</xref>] these properties were used to estimate the effect of dust on Pioneer 10 and 11 and it was found that one needs an axially-symmetric dust distribution within 20–70 AU with a constant, uniform, and unreasonably high density of ∼ 3 × 10<sup>−16</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup> ≃ 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> (<italic>σ</italic><sub>IPD</sub> + <italic>σ</italic><sub>ISD</sub>). Therefore, interplanetary dust cannot explain the Pioneer anomaly.</p><p>One may argue that higher densities are present within the Kuiper belt. IR observations rule out more than 0.3 Earth mass from Kuiper Belt dust in the trans-Neptunian region. Using this figure, the authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] have noted that the Pioneer measurement of the interplanetary dust density is comparable to the density of various Kuiper belt models. Nonetheless, the density varies greatly within the Kuiper belt, precluding any constant acceleration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6.2"><title>Possibility for new physics?

This is an interesting conjecture, even though the probability is that some standard physics or some as-yet-unknown systematic will be found to explain this acceleration. Being more specific, one may ask the question, “Is it dark matter or a modification of gravity?” Unfortunately, as we discuss below, it is not easy for either of these solutions to provide a satisfactory answer.</p><sec id="Sec6.2.1"><title>Dark matter</title><p>Various distributions of dark matter in the solar system have been proposed to explain the anomaly, e.g., dark matter distributed in the form of a disk in the outer solar system with a density of ∼ 4 × 10<sup>−16</sup> kg/m<sup>3</sup>, yielding the wanted effect. However, it would have to be a special kind of dark matter that was not seen in other nongravitational processes. Dark matter in the form of a spherical halo of a degenerate gas of heavy neutrinos around the Sun [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">244</xref>] and a hypothetical class of dark matter that would restore the parity symmetry, called the <italic>mirror matter</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>], have also been discussed. However, it would have to be a special smooth distribution of dark matter that is not gravitationally modulated as normal matter so obviously is.</p><p>It was suggested that the observed deceleration in the Pioneer probes can be explained by the gravitational pull of a distribution of undetected dark matter in the solar system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Explanations of the Pioneer anomaly involving dark matter depend on the small scale structure of Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) haloes, which are not known. <italic>N</italic>-body simulations to investigate solar system size subhalos would require on the order of 10<sup>12</sup> particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR246">246</xref>], while the largest current simulations involve around 10<sup>8</sup> particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>]. As a consequence of this lack of knowledge about the small scale structure of dark matter, the existence of a dark matter halo around the Sun is still an open question.</p><p>It has been proposed that dark matter could become trapped in the Sun’s gravitational potential after experiencing multiple scatterings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR300">300</xref>], perhaps combined with perturbations due to planets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Moreover, the birth of the solar system itself may be a consequence of the existence of a local halo. The existence of dark matter streams crossing the solar system, perhaps forming ring-shaped caustics analogous to the dark matter ring postulated in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>], has also been considered by Sikivie [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR346">346</xref>]. Considering an NFW dark matter distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR247">247</xref>], de Diego et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>] show that there should be several hundreds of earth masses of dark matter available in the solar system.</p><p>Gor’kavyi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>] have shown that the solar system dust distributes in two dust systems and four resonant belts associated with the orbits of the giant planets. The density profile of these belts approximately follows an inverse heliocentric distance dependence law [<italic>ρ</italic> ∝ (<italic>R</italic> − <italic>k</italic>)<sup>−1</sup>, where <italic>k</italic> is a constant]. As in the case of dark matter, dust is usually modeled as a collisionless fluid as pressure, stresses, and internal friction are considered negligible. Although dust is subjected to radiation pressure, this effect is very small in the outer solar system. Gravitational pull by dark matter has also recently been considered also by Nieto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254">254</xref>], who also mentioned the possibility of searching for the Pioneer anomaly using the New Horizons spacecraft when the probe crosses the orbit of Saturn.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6.2.2"><title>Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)</title><p>The anomalous behavior of galaxy rotational curves led to an extensive search for dark matter particles. Some authors considered the possibility that a modification of gravity is needed to address this challenge. Consequently, there were many attempts made at constructing a theory that modifies Newton’s laws of gravity in the regime of weak gravitational fields. Presently, these efforts aim at constructing a consistent and stable theory that would also be able to account for a range of puzzling phenomena — such as flat galaxy rotational curves, gravitational lensing observations, and recent cosmological data — without postulating the existence of nonbaryonic dark matter or dark energy of yet unknown origin. Some of these novel theories were used to provide a cause of the Pioneer anomaly.</p><p>One approach to modify gravity, called Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), is particularly well studied in the literature.

The tests were motivated to explore the acceleration scales implied by several astrophysical puzzles, such as the observed flatness of galactic rotation curves (with MOND-implied acceleration of <italic>a</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1.2 × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s), the Pioneer anomaly (with <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>P</italic></sub> ∼ 9 × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>) and the natural scale set by the Hubble acceleration (<italic>a</italic><sub><italic>H</italic></sub> = <italic>cH</italic> ∼ 7 × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>). Gundlach et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>] reported no violation of Newton’s second law at accelerations as small as 5 × 10<sup>−14</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>. The obtained result does not invalidate MOND directly as the formalism requires that the measurement must be carried out in the absence of any other large accelerations (i.e., those due to the Earth and our solar system). However, the test constrains theoretical formalisms that seek to derive MOND from fundamental principles by requiring that formalism to reproduce <bold>F</bold> = <italic>m</italic><bold>a</bold> under laboratory conditions similar to those used in the experiment.</p><p>Finally, there were suggestions that rather then modifying laws of gravity in order to explain the Pioneer effect, perhaps we needs to modify laws of inertia instead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">214</xref>].

Therefore, even a small anisotropy in the spacecraft’s thermal radiation pattern may be sufficient to produce the observed acceleration. Further, the amount of heat generated on-board decreased slowly, consistent with the quoted error bounds of the acceleration. In their reply, Anderson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] reasoned that due to the geometrical features of the Pioneer spacecraft such a mechanism would produce an acceleration much smaller than that observed in the Pioneer Doppler data.</p><p>Murphy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">245</xref>] brought attention to the fact that the louver system on the back of the Pioneer spacecraft is not a Lambertian emitter, and the electrical heat produced on-board may not have been declining steadily with time, as the spacecraft body contained mostly components that had to be powered at all times. In their reply, Anderson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] argued that by the time Pioneer 10 reached the distances of ∼ 40 AU (i.e., the beginning of the data interval used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]), all louvers on the spacecraft were closed, thus forcing the remaining and decreasing heat to escape nonpreferentially.</p><p>Scheffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR325">325</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR327">327</xref>] asserted that the 2002 study may have seriously underestimated the role of the thermal recoil force, and that up to 70 W of collimated thermal radiation, corresponding to an acceleration of 9.3 × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>, may have been present on board the two Pioneer spacecraft. Using the data on the electrical status of the Pioneer 10 spacecraft available prior to 2002, Anderson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] argued that such a mechanism would produce a significant decrease in the magnitude of the anomalous acceleration as a response to the decreasing supply of the radio-isotopic fuel. In fact, for the Pioneer 10 data interval used in the 2002 study, the amount of electrical energy decreased by nearly 30%, implying a similar decrease in the magnitude of the anomalous acceleration. Such a decrease was not observed in the data.</p><p>Given the later recovery of i) the telemetry records of Pioneers 10 and 11 for the entire duration of their respective missions and ii) documentation detailing the design of the Pioneer F/G spacecraft (both completed in 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR397">397</xref>]), further investigation into the contribution of the thermal recoil force as the source of the Pioneer anomaly is well founded.

The errors associated with mismodeling of the maneuvers could be large enough to seriously affect the acceleration estimates.

This claim is not true. The Milky Way, as most spiral galaxies, if approximated as a point mass using a nominal value of <italic>r</italic><sub>gal</sub> ≃ 8, 000 pc as the distance from the Earth to the galactic bulge, and a nominal mass of <italic>M</italic><sub>gal</sub> ≃ 4 × 10<sup>11</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub>, yields an acceleration of 8.75 × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>, a number that is almost identical to <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>P</italic></sub>.

But a large error here would cause inconsistencies with the overall planetary ephemeris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>More interestingly, the authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] have investigated the effect of an ever-present, uniform Pioneer-like force on the long-period comets. The authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR278">278</xref>] proposed to use comets and asteroids to assess the gravitational field in the outer regions of the solar system and thereby investigate the Pioneer anomaly.</p><p>Furthermore, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] concluded that available planetary ranging data limit any unmodeled radial acceleration acting on Earth and Mars to less than 0.1 × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>. Consequently, if the anomalous radial acceleration acting on spinning spacecraft is gravitational in origin, it is <italic>not</italic> universal. That is, it must affect bodies in the 1000 kg range more than bodies of planetary size by a factor of 100 or more. As the authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] said: “This would be a strange violation of the Principle of Equivalence”.</p><p>Attempts to detect observable evidence of unexpected gravitational effects acting on the orbits of the outer planets have not yielded any positive results yet. Hence, the authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR306">306</xref>] used parametric constraints to the orbits of Uranus and Neptune and found that the reduced solar mass to account for the Pioneer anomaly would not be compatible with the measurements. A similar result was obtained in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>] based on the Gauss equations to estimate the effect of a gravitational perturbation in terms of the time rate of change on the osculating orbital elements. These authors argue that the perturbation would produce long-period, secular rates on the perihelion and the mean anomaly, and short-period effects on the semimajor axis, the eccentricity, the perihelion and the mean anomaly large enough to be detected. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR368">368</xref>] also considers the effect on the path of the outer planets of a disturbance on a spherically-symmetric spacetime metric, and rules out any model of the anomaly that implies that the Pioneer spacecraft move geodesically in a perturbed spacetime metric. A recent test of the orbits of 24 Trans-Neptunian Objects using bootstrap analysis also failed to find evidence of the anomaly in these objects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR407">407</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, the absence of support for a perturbation of the planetary orbits in the outer solar system is weak and inconclusive (primarily due to the lack of precision range measurements). For example, the authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR277">277</xref>] conclude that such anomalous gravitational disturbances would not be detected in the orbits of the outer planets. Therefore, efforts to find a gravitational explanation continue, as in the case of a recent paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR271">271</xref>] that proposes an azimuthally symmetric solution to Poisson’s equation for empty space to explain qualitatively the Pioneer anomaly. This solution results in a gravitational potential dependent on the distance and the polar angle, and it also has implications for the planetary orbits, albeit not yet tested with ephemeris data yet.</p><p>Many of these considerations are based on simplified models. As such, they must be contrasted with efforts that incorporate a radial acceleration into computations of planetary ephemerides.</p><p>Using the planetary ephemerides, Standish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR358">358</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR357">357</xref>] investigated modifications to the laws of gravitation that can explain the anomaly and still be compatible with the known motion of the planets from Saturn and outward. Out of five different acceleration models, four were shown to be not viable.</p><p>Using radiometric tracking data from the Cassini spacecraft, Folkner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>] established an upper bound on Saturn’s radial acceleration as less than 10<sup>−14</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>. This is around just one tenth the anomalous acceleration of Pioneer 10 and 11.</p><p>Using the latest INPOP08 planetary ephemerides, Fienga et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>] determined that a radial acceleration greater than 1/4 times the observed Pioneer anomaly at distances beyond 20 AU is not consistent with planetary orbits.</p><p>These investigations represent serious challenges to any attempt to explain the Pioneer anomaly using unseen mass distributions in the solar system or modifications of the theory of gravity. Such attempts, in addition to accounting for the anomalous acceleration of the two spacecraft, must also be able to explain why an acceleration of the same magnitude is <italic>not</italic> readily seen in the orbit of Saturn and in the known ephemerides of the outer planets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6.7.2"><title>Attempts to confirm the anomaly using other spacecraft</title><p>One reason that the Pioneer anomaly generated so much interest is that two spacecraft on very different trajectories yielded similar anomalous acceleration values. However, the two spacecraft are nearly identical in design, and although their trajectories are different, they both follow hyperbolic escape trajectories. This raises the obvious question: is it possible to confirm the presence of an anomalous acceleration using i) different spacecraft, or ii) spacecraft on different trajectories?</p><p>The Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft are sensitive to such a small, anomalous acceleration term because they are very far from the Sun, and therefore, the effects of solar radiation pressure are much smaller than the anomalous acceleration. For spacecraft located in the inner parts of the solar system (e.g., within the orbit of Jupiter), solar radiation pressure is significant; for Pioneer 10 and 11 at 5 AU, solar radiation results in an acceleration that exceeds the anomalous acceleration by nearly a full order of magnitude. This is a clear indication that the only candidates for investigating accelerations as small as the Pioneer anomaly are spacecraft in deep space, preferably at or beyond the orbit of Jupiter.</p><p>The most obvious choice that comes to mind are the twin Voyagers. Voyager 1 and 2, like Pioneer 10 and 11 before them, are traveling on hyperbolic escape trajectories after encounters with the gas giants in the outer solar system. Unfortunately, unlike Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2 are not spin stabilized. The three-axis stabilization employed by these spacecraft requires the use of small attitude stabilization thrusters several times a day. The noise produced by unmodeled small accelerations that arise as a result of uncertainties in the magnitude and exact duration of thruster firings and possible leakage afterwards reduce the sensitivity of these spacecraft to small accelerations such that an anomalous acceleration of order 10<sup>−9</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup> is completely undetectable.</p><p>Next on the list was Galileo. This spacecraft, designed to orbit Jupiter, featured an innovative design comprising a spinning and a nonspinning section. However, due to mechanical problems between the two sections, the spacecraft was often configured to use the all-spinning mode. The malfunction of Galileo’s high gain antenna opening mechanism put this antenna out of commission, and therefore, Galileo communicated with the Earth using an omnidirectional low-gain antenna at much lower than planned data rates, at a very low signal-to-noise ratio. Despite these difficulties, navigational data was obtained from this spacecraft with sufficient accuracy for precision orbit estimation. A combined analysis of Doppler and ranging data by The Aerospace Corporation from a 113-day period beginning shortly before Galileo’s second Earth encounter (Galileo flew a complicated series of flyby orbits before it achieved a transfer orbit that took it to Jupiter) does show the presence of a possible acceleration term of the correct magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Ulysses, a joint project between NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), flew on a highly elliptical heliocentric orbit tilted about 80° from the plane of the elliptic. Although Ulysses flew relatively close to the Sun and therefore, solar radiation had a significant effect on its trajectory, its varying distance from the Sun, combined with variations in the Earth-spacecraft-Sun angle make it possible in principle to separate the effects of solar radiation from any anomalous acceleration. This is how an estimate of (12 ± 3) × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup> was obtained using JPL’s ODP software. Although this value remains highly correlated with solar radiation pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], it is compatible with the value of <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>P</italic></sub> measured for Pioneer 10 and 11.</p><p>Yet another deep-space craft, Cassini, is three-axis stabilized like Voyager 1 and 2. Nevertheless, the sophisticated tracking capabilities of this spacecraft could offer a potential contribution to the research of the anomalous acceleration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>The recently (2006) launched New Horizons mission to Pluto is potentially a better candidate for researching the anomalous acceleration. Like Pioneer 10 and 11, New Horizons is spin stabilized, using only infrequent thruster maneuvers for attitude stabilization. Unfortunately, current mission plans call for New Horizons to spend much of the time between Jupiter and Pluto in “hibernation” mode, with only infrequent communications with the Earth. Therefore, during the flight to Pluto, little or no precision Doppler data may be collected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254">254</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR380">380</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR391">391</xref>].</p><p>As a result, attempts to verify the anomaly using other spacecraft have proven disappointing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR260">260</xref>], because the Voyager, Galileo, Ulysses, and Cassini spacecraft navigation data all have their own individual difficulties for use as an independent test of the anomaly. In addition, many of the deep space missions that are currently being planned will not provide the needed navigational accuracy and trajectory stability of under 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6.7.3"><title>Possible future spacecraft searches</title><p>The acceleration regime in which the anomaly was observed diminishes the value of using modern disturbance compensation systems for a test. For example, the systems that are currently being developed for the LISA (Laser Interferometric Space Antenna) and LISA Pathfinder missions are designed to operate in the presence of a very low frequency acceleration noise (at the mHz level), while the Pioneer anomalous acceleration is a strong constant bias in the Doppler frequency data. In addition, currently available accelerometers are a few orders of magnitude less sensitive than is needed for a test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR260">260</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR263">263</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR391">391</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR394">394</xref>]. To enable a clean test of the anomaly there is also a requirement to have an escape hyperbolic trajectory. This makes a number of other currently proposed missions less able to directly test the anomalous acceleration.</p><p>A number of alternative ground-based verifications of the anomaly have also been considered; for example, using VLBI astrometric observations. However, the trajectories of Pioneers, with small proper motions in the sky, make it presently impossible to use VLBI in accurately isolating an anomalous sunward acceleration of the size of <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>P</italic></sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6.8"><title>A mission to explore the Pioneer anomaly</title><p>The apparent inability to explain the anomalous behavior of the Pioneers with conventional physics has contributed to growing discussion about its origin.

Mission studies conducted in 2004–2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>] have identified two options: i) an experiment on a major mission to deep space capable of reaching acceleration sensitivity similar to that demonstrated by the Pioneers and ii) a dedicated mission to explore the Pioneer anomaly that offers full characterization of the anomaly. Below we discuss both of these proposals.</p><sec id="Sec6.8.1"><title>A Pioneer instrument package</title><p>A way to confirm independently the anomaly is to fly an instrumental package on a mission heading to the outer regions of the solar system. The primary goal is to provide an independent experimental confirmation of the anomaly. One can conceive of an instrument placed on a major mission to deep space. The instrument must be able to compensate for systematic effects to an accuracy below the level of 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>. Another concept is a simple autonomous probe that could be jettisoned from the main vehicle, such as the proposed Interstellar Probe<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn27">27</xref>, presumably further out than at least the orbit of Jupiter or Saturn.

At the same time, it is clear that to explore the anomaly one needs to travel beyond the orbit of Jupiter. Furthermore, an acceleration sensitivity at the level of ∼ 10<sup>−12</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup> would be preferable, which can be done only with a dedicated mission, as discussed in Section <xref rid="Sec6.8.2" ref-type="sec">6.8.2</xref> below.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6.8.2"><title>A dedicated mission concept</title><p>The available knowledge of the Pioneer anomaly lead to the following science objectives for a dedicated mission to explore the Pioneer anomaly: i) investigate the origin of the anomaly with an improvement by a factor of 1,000; ii) improve spatial, temporal, and directional resolution; iii) identify and measure all possible disturbing and competing effects; iv) test Newtonian gravity potential at large distances; v) discriminate amongst candidate theories explaining <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>P</italic></sub>, and vi) study the deep-space environment in the outer solar system.</p><p>A viable concept would utilize a spacecraft pair capable of flying in a flexible formation (see Figure <xref rid="Fig30" ref-type="fig">6.1</xref>). The main craft would have a precision star-tracker and an accelerometer and would be capable of precise navigation, with disturbances, to a level less than ∼ 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup> in the low-frequency acceleration regime. Mounted on the front would be a container holding a probe — a spherical test mass covered with corner cubes. Once the configuration is on its solar system escape trajectory and will undergo no further navigation maneuvers, and is at a heliocentric distance of ∼ 5–20 AU, the test mass would be released from the primary craft. The probe will be passively laser-ranged from the primary craft with the latter having enough capabilities to maneuver with respect to the probe, if needed. The distance from the Earth to the primary would be determined with either standard radiometric methods operating at Ka-band or with optical communication. Note that any dynamical noise at the primary would be a common mode contribution to the Earth-primary and primary-probe distances. This design satisfies the primary objective, which would be accomplished by the two-staged accurate navigation of the probe with sensitivity down to the 10<sup>−12</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup> level in the DC of extremely low frequency bandwidth.

Answering these questions requires further in-depth analysis. This is especially true before any serious discussion of a dedicated experiment can take place.

After some hesitation there was an agreement among the researchers that a thorough investigation of the anomaly is needed. The main question remained: What is the nature of the Pioneer anomaly? Is this a manifestation of new physics? Or a representation of some unmodeled conventional physics mechanism? Furthermore, it became clear that before the Pioneer anomaly can be fully accepted as a novel physical effect, the issue of the on-board heat redistribution must be fully addressed.</p><p>Ultimately, the search for the origin of the Pioneer anomaly came down to one principal question: “Is it the heat or not the heat?” Multiple community efforts are now guided by this question. In addition to the teams from JPL and The Aerospace Corporation, several independent teams and researchers have confirmed the existence of the anomalous acceleration in the Pioneer Doppler data; the new analyses also studied temporal behavior of the anomaly, establishing limits on the temporal change of anomalous acceleration. As a result of these extensive multi-year efforts, our understanding of the Pioneer anomaly improved significantly (see Section <xref rid="Sec7.1" ref-type="sec">7.1</xref>).</p><p>Meanwhile, a team at JPL along with C.B.

To what extent is this heat responsible for the anomalous acceleration?</p></list-item></list></p><p>In the following subsections, we review these unresolved questions in detail, including information that has become available since 2002 as a result of the on-going efforts of several teams.</p><sec id="Sec7.2.1"><title>Direction</title><p>The direction of the anomalous acceleration vector has been the subject of many discussions. If this direction was precisely known, it would allow one to establish the possible cause(s) of the anomaly; at present, all causes must be considered.</p><p>The canonical value of <italic>a</italic><sub><italic>P</italic></sub> = (8.74±1.33) × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup> was developed using the <italic>hypothesis</italic> that the anomalous acceleration of the two spacecraft is Sun-pointing, and it finds that the hypothesis is consistent with the data. However, this does not exclude the possibility that equally good solutions can be obtained by postulating an hypothetical acceleration vector in some other direction.</p><p>Thus, we must consider at least four possible directions for the anomaly (see Figure <xref rid="Fig34" ref-type="fig">7.4</xref>), all indicating a different physical mechanism. Because these directions differ by at most a few degrees during the period of time from which Doppler data was studied, they cannot be distinguished easily. However, each of these four directions implies very different physics.

As seen on the left of Figure <xref rid="Fig34" ref-type="fig">7.4</xref>, the corresponding directional signatures of these four directions are distinct and could be easily extracted from the data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR260">260</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR391">391</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR397">397</xref>].</p><p>The navigation of the Pioneer spacecraft relied on an S-band radio-Doppler observable (no ranging capabilities!), which is not very accurate for the purposes of a 3-dimensional orbit reconstruction. To maintain communications with the Earth using the narrow beam of their HGA, an Earth-pointing attitude was necessary. During the flight through the inner solar system, this required frequent attitude correction maneuvers to re-orient the spin axis. At this time, the Sun-craft-Earth angle was relatively large, as was the angle between these and the direction of motion (Figure <xref rid="Fig34" ref-type="fig">7.4</xref>). Even so, the Pioneer data from distances up to 27 AU indicate an approximately sunward directional anomaly for both craft. However, at distances farther than 40 AU, both the Sun and the Earth were within the 3° of the antenna radiation pattern (set by 10 dbm range in the antenna gain), thus limiting accuracy in directional reconstruction.</p><p>Given the importance of the direction of the anomalous acceleration, it is perhaps surprising that this direction has not yet been established. This is due to the fact that the data that has been investigated to date is from the late cruise phase of the Pioneer 10 and 11 missions, when Pioneer 10 was over 40, and Pioneer 11 was over 22 AU from the Sun. From this distance, the Earth-spacecraft-Sun angle is less than 3°. The angle between the spacecraft spin axis and the Earth-spacecraft line is also small, as the spacecraft was always oriented towards the Earth in order to maintain continuous radio communication. Lastly, at these distances from the Sun the hyperbolic orbits of the spacecraft are nearly asymptotic, and the direction of motion corresponds closely with the Sun-spacecraft direction.</p><p>The discussion above indicates that the true direction of the Pioneer anomalous acceleration still remains poorly determined. Based on the Pioneer data analyzed to date, a more correct statement about the direction would be that the anomaly is directed towards the <italic>inner</italic> part of the solar system — the region that includes both the Sun and the Earth.

However, by about 1980 the Doppler navigational data had began to indicate the presence of an anomaly. At first this was considered to be only an interesting navigational curiosity. But even so, samples of data a few months long in duration were periodically examined by different analysts. By 1992 an interesting string of data-points had been obtained; they were gathered in a JPL memorandum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and are shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig28" ref-type="fig">5.1</xref>. (More details on this issue are in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR392">392</xref>].)</p><p>For Pioneer 10, an approximately constant anomalous acceleration seems to exist in the data as close in as 27 AU from the Sun. For Pioneer 11, beginning just after Jupiter flyby, the early navigational data show a small value for the anomaly during the Jupiter-Saturn cruise phase in the interior of the solar system. But right at Saturn encounter, when the craft passed into an hyperbolic escape orbit, there was an apparent fast increase in the anomaly, whereafter it settled into the canonical value.</p><p>The data, therefore, indicate the possibility that there was an “onset” of the anomaly at around this time, as the anomalous acceleration component was much smaller prior to Saturn encounter. However, this is likely a premature conclusion. The observations shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig28" ref-type="fig">5.1</xref> do not represent a systematic set of measurements obtained using a consistent, common editing strategy. The apparent onset of the anomaly that is seen in Figure <xref rid="Fig28" ref-type="fig">5.1</xref> has been used to justify theoretical work that predicted a modification of gravity or other nongravitational forces that affect only objects at sufficient distance from the Sun, or objects in hyperbolic orbits. Yet it must be emphasized (as indeed, the authors of the 2002 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] emphasized in a footnote) that this early detection data cannot be viewed as a measurement; confirmation of the onset of the anomaly requires re-analysis of early Doppler data using a consistent editing strategy.</p><p>Other factors, such as the greater frequency of maneuvers, also put into question the extent to which one can rely on the apparent pattern represented by the first few data points in Figure <xref rid="Fig28" ref-type="fig">5.1</xref>. Also, during this time period, solar radiation pressure produced an acceleration that was several times larger than the anomaly. Scheffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR325">325</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR327">327</xref>] pointed out that the onset that is seen in the data may, in fact, be an artifact of solar model calibration. If an anomalous sunward acceleration was present but not accounted for at the time the solar model coefficients were measured when the spacecraft were still near the Sun (i.e., if the anomalous acceleration was absorbed into estimates of solar model coefficients), later, as solar radiation decreased, one would observe an apparent onset as a result of this miscalibration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7.2.4"><title>Annual/diurnal terms</title><p>As indicated in Section <xref rid="Sec5.5.4" ref-type="sec">5.5.4</xref>, even after a best fit solution is obtained, the resulting residuals contain clearly discernible annual and diurnal signatures. These small, approximately sinusoidal contributions do not affect the determination of the (approximately constant) anomalous acceleration, as they are uncorrelated with it. However, the origin of these sinusoidal terms remains unknown.</p><p>The authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR390">390</xref>] expressed the belief that these terms are due to orbital mismodeling, notably mismodeling of the orbital inclination of the spacecraft to the ecliptic plane. Other possibilities also exist: for instance, the annual term may be related to mismodeling of the effects of solar plasma on the radio signal, whereas the diurnal term may be related to atmospheric effects on the signal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7.2.5"><title>Radio beam reaction force</title><p>Among the effects considered by the authors of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], the radio beam reaction force produced the largest bias to the result (see Section <xref rid="Sec5.4.4" ref-type="sec">5.4.4</xref>). This bias is due to the fact that the spacecraft are continuously transmitting a <italic>P</italic><sub>radio</sub> = ∼ 8 W highly collimated radio beam in the direction of the Earth, and as a result, experience a proportional recoil force, resulting in an acceleration of <italic>a</italic><sub>radio</sub> = <italic>P</italic><sub>radio</sub><italic>/mc</italic> ≃ −1.10×10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>. As the force exerted by the radio beam necessarily points away from the Earth and the Sun (as indicated by the negative sign in the preceding equation), the correction of the measured data increases the amount of the observed anomalous attractive force and makes the Pioneer effect larger.</p><p>Two open questions remain concerning the actual magnitude of the radio beam recoil force. First, according to the recovered flight telemetry, the radio beam reaction force might not have been constant. Flight telemetry indicates that during much of the mission, the radio beam was more powerful than the nominal 8 W, exceeding the nominal value by 1 W and more. Near the end of Pioneer 10’s mission, however, the transmitter power may have decreased by as much as 3 W (see Figure <xref rid="Fig19" ref-type="fig">2.19</xref>). As this apparent decrease coincides with a drop in the main bus voltage on board (due to the depletion of the spacecraft’s <sup>238</sup>Pu power supply), the decrease may be an artifact of a failing telemetry system (see also Section <xref rid="Sec2.4.5" ref-type="sec">2.4.5</xref>).</p><p>Second, Scheffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR327">327</xref>] argues that assuming a typical antenna design, as much as 10% of the power emitted by the high gain antenna (HGA) feed would have missed the parabolic dish altogether, and would have produced a reaction force in the opposite direction, at an approximately 45° angle. Although the HGA is discussed in detail in the recovered project documentation, no attempt has yet been made to establish more precise estimates on the efficiency with which the transmitter’s power is converted into a recoil force.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7.2.6"><title>The Pioneer spin anomaly</title><p>The spin rates of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft, nominally 4.8 revolutions per minute (rpm), were in fact changing with time. As we showed in Section <xref rid="Sec2.3.7" ref-type="sec">2.3.7</xref>, the two spacecraft exhibited markedly different behavior, with unique features.</p><p>Pioneer 10 was slowly spinning down, with three discernible phases in its spin history, described in detail in Section <xref rid="Sec2.3.7" ref-type="sec">2.3.7</xref>. The changes in Pioneer 10’s spin rate approximately coincide with unexplained readings from its propulsion tank (see Section <xref rid="Sec2.3.6" ref-type="sec">2.3.6</xref>).</p><p>Meanwhile, Pioneer 11 was spinning up, although a detailed examination of its spin history reveals that spin-up events coincided with attitude correction maneuvers, and between maneuvers the spacecraft was spinning down, albeit at varying rates (see Section <xref rid="Sec2.3.7" ref-type="sec">2.3.7</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that a constant or near constant rate of spin change is of thermal origin: if thermal radiation is emitted by the spacecraft not just anisotropically but also asymmetrically with respect to the spacecraft’s center-of-gravity, a torque acts on the spacecraft.</p><p>No convincing explanation has yet been offered for the anomalous change in the spin change rate during the history of Pioneer 10. The approximate coincidence of this change with the anomalous change in fuel tank pressure readings may be significant; on the other hand, it must be emphasized that this coincidence is only approximate, and may very well be accidental.</p><p>In contrast, the spin rate change of Pioneer 11 exhibits no dramatic changes, and appears to be a combination of three effects: A spindown that may be similar to that of Pioneer 10 and may be of thermal origin, instantaneous spinups that occur at each maneuver and may be a result of a small thruster misalignment, and a third effect that changes the spindown rate after each maneuver, and may be related to thruster leaks and outgassing.</p><p>It should be noted that these considerations are qualitative in nature, and no detailed study of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spin history has taken place to date. In particular, we do not know if the spin rate change is related to the anomalous acceleration of these spacecraft.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7.2.7"><title>Thermal recoil forces</title><p>The effect of rejected thermal radiation was the second largest bias/uncertainty that has been the most critical systematic bias to quantify (see Section <xref rid="Sec4.4.3" ref-type="sec">4.4.3</xref>). If heat generated by the on-board power sources was asymmetrically reflected by the body of the craft, an acceleration along the spin axis could be produced causing the measured anomaly.</p><p>The Pioneer spacecraft were powered by SNAP-19 (Space Nuclear Ancillary Power) RTGs mounted on long extended booms (designed to protect the on-board electronics from heat and radiation impact) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It was recognized early that, in principle, there was more than enough heat available on the craft to cause the anomaly (see Section <xref rid="Sec2.4" ref-type="sec">2.4</xref>). In addition to heat from the RTGs, additional waste heat was produced by electrical instrumentation, Radioisotope Heater Units (RHUs), and the propulsion system.</p><p>However, it was assumed that the spacecraft’s spin-stabilized attitude control, special design of the RTGs and the length of the RTG booms that resulted in a relatively small spacecraft surface available for the preferential heat rejection significantly minimized the amount of heat for the mechanism to work. These considerations led to an estimated acceleration not exceeding <italic>a</italic><sub>hr</sub> = (−0.55±0.55) × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup>. This result is now being reconsidered, in view of on-going work on Pioneer thermal modeling, which suggests that the acceleration due to asymmetrically reflected heat from the RTGs may have been several times this value.</p><p>As the spacecraft is in an approximate thermal steady state, heat generated on board must be removed from the spacecraft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR380">380</xref>]. In deep space, the only mechanism of heat removal is thermal radiation: the spacecraft can be said to be radiatively coupled to the cosmic background, which can be modeled by surrounding the spacecraft with a large, hollow spherical black body at the temperature of ∼ 2.7 K.</p><p>The spacecraft emits heat in the form of thermal photons, which also carry momentum <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>γ</italic></sub>, in accordance with the well known law of <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>γ</italic></sub> = <italic>hν/c</italic>, where <italic>ν</italic> is the photon’s frequency, <italic>h</italic> is Planck’s constant, and <italic>c</italic> is the velocity of light. This results in a recoil force in the direction opposite to that of the path of the photon. For a body that emits radiation in a spherically symmetric pattern, the net recoil force is zero. However, if the pattern of radiation is not symmetrical, the resulting anisotropy in the radiation pattern yields a net recoil force.</p><p>The magnitude of this recoil force is a subject of many factors, including the location and thermal power of heat sources, the geometry, physical configuration, and thermal properties of the spacecraft’s materials, and the radiometric properties of its external (radiating) surfaces.</p><p>The total thermal inventory on board the Pioneer spacecraft exceeded 2 kW throughout most of their mission durations. The spacecraft were in an approximate steady state: the amount of heat generated on-board was equal to the amount of heat radiated by the spacecraft.</p><p>The mass of the Pioneer spacecraft was approximately 250 kg. An acceleration of 8. 74 × 10<sup>−10</sup> m/s<sup>2</sup> is equivalent to a force of ∼ 0.22 <italic>µ</italic>N acting on a ∼ 250 kg object. This is the amount of recoil force produced by a 65 W collimated beam of photons. In comparison with the available thermal inventory of 2500 W, a fore-aft anisotropy of less than 3% can account for the anomalous acceleration in its entirety. Given the complex shape of the Pioneer spacecraft, it is certainly conceivable that an anisotropy of this magnitude is present in the spacecrafts’ thermal radiation pattern.</p><p>The possibility that heat from the RTGs can be responsible for the Pioneer anomaly was first proposed by Katz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]. Murphy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">245</xref>] pointed out the potential significance of anisotropic rejection of electrically generated heat. Scheffer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR325">325</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR327">327</xref>] attempted to account for all possible sources of the thermal recoil force and estimated that the total recoil force is more than sufficient to produce an anomalous acceleration of the observed magnitude. Unfortunately, none of these studies benefited from detailed information about the spacecrafts’ design or from thermal and electrical telemetry. These data became available for study in 2005.</p><p>Key questions concerning the thermal recoil force that have been raised during the study of the Pioneer anomaly include [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">245</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR327">327</xref>]:

This much extended set of Pioneer Doppler data is the primary source for the new ongoing investigation of the anomaly. In addition, the entire record of flight telemetry files received from Pioneer 10 and 11 is also available (see Section <xref rid="Sec3.5" ref-type="sec">3.5</xref>). Together with original project documentation (see Section <xref rid="Sec2.1.3" ref-type="sec">2.1.3</xref>) and newly developed software codes and trajectory analysis tools, this additional information is now used to reconstruct the engineering history of both spacecraft with the aim to establish the nature of the Pioneer anomaly. Below we review the current status of these efforts.</p><p>The primary objective of the new investigation is to determine the physical origin of the Pioneer anomaly and identify its properties. To achieve this goal, a study of the recently recovered radiometric Doppler and telemetry data has begun, focusing in particular on improving our understanding of the thermal behavior of the spacecraft and the extent to which radiated heat can be responsible for the acceleration anomaly.</p><p>The objectives of this new investigation of the Pioneer anomaly are sixfold:

These objectives are not entirely independent of each other; by putting them on this list, we are identifying the main areas that are the focus of the on-going new investigation of the anomaly. Below we will discuss these objectives in more detail.</p><sec id="Sec7.3.1"><title>Analysis of the earlier trajectory phases</title><p>One objective of the new investigation is the study of the early parts of the trajectories of the Pioneers with the goal of determining the true direction of the Pioneer anomaly and possibly its origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR260">260</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR391">391</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR393">393</xref>]. The much longer data span is expected to improve the ability to determine the source of the acceleration. In particular, with data from much closer to the Earth and Sun, one should be able to better determine whether the acceleration is i) in the sunward direction, ii) in the Earth-pointing direction, iii) in the direction along the velocity vector, or iv) along the spin axis direction (see Section <xref rid="Sec7.2.1" ref-type="sec">7.2.1</xref>). Analysis of the earlier data is critical in helping to establish a precise 3-dimensional time history of the effect, and therefore to find out whether it is due to a systematic or new physics.

Navigational data collected for Pioneer 11, beginning just after Jupiter flyby, show a small value for the anomaly during the Jupiter-Saturn cruise phase in the interior of the solar system. However, right at Saturn encounter, when Pioneer 11 passed into a hyperbolic escape orbit, there was an apparent fast increase in the anomalous acceleration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR255">255</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR393">393</xref>], but this has not yet been confirmed by rigorous analysis (see Section <xref rid="Sec7.2.3" ref-type="sec">7.2.3</xref>).</p><p>Doppler data covering Pioneer 11’s encounter with Saturn are available. A successful study of the data surrounding the encounter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR391">391</xref>] would lead to an improved understanding of the apparent onset of the anomalous acceleration.

Radiometric observables, notably Doppler, are sensitive in the line-of-sight direction, but are insensitive to small changes in the spacecraft’s orbit in a direction that is perpendicular to the line-of-sight. The lack of a range observable on Pioneer 10 and 11 also reduces the accuracy with which the orbit can be determined in three dimensions. Nevertheless, these problems can be addressed and the on-going analysis should be able to yield the true direction of the anomaly and its origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR255">255</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR391">391</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR393">393</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7.3.3"><title>Study of the temporal evolution of the anomaly</title><p>JPL’s 2002 analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] found that the anomalous acceleration is approximately constant.

The now available extended data set, which includes over 20 years of usable Pioneer 10 data, may be sufficient to demonstrate unambiguously whether or not a jerk term is present in the signal, and if it is compatible with the temporal behavior of the on-board thermal inventory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR378">378</xref>]. We note, however, the difficulty of the task of disentangling such a jerk term from the effects of solar radiation pressure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7.3.4"><title>Analysis of the individual trajectories for both Pioneers</title><p>The trajectories of Pioneer 10 and 11 were profoundly different. After its encounter with Jupiter, Pioneer 10 continued on a hyperbolic escape trajectory, leaving the solar system while remaining close to the plane of the ecliptic. Pioneer 11, in contrast, proceeded from Jupiter to Saturn along a trajectory that took it closer to the Sun, while outside the ecliptic plane. After its encounter with Saturn, Pioneer 11 also proceeded along a hyperbolic escape trajectory, but once again it was flying outside the plane of the ecliptic. In the end, the two spacecraft were flying out of the solar system in approximately opposite directions.</p><p>Nonetheless, the limited data set that was available previously precluded a meaningful comparison. The individual solutions for the two spacecraft were obtained from data segments that not only differed in length (11.5 and 3.75 years), but were also taken from different heliocentric distances (see Section <xref rid="Sec5.6" ref-type="sec">5.6</xref>).</p><p>From the recovered telemetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR397">397</xref>] we now also know that the actual thermal and electrical behavior of the two spacecraft was different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR378">378</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR379">379</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR397">397</xref>]. These facts underline the importance of studying and comparing the behavior of both spacecraft, as this may help determine if the anomaly is of on-board origin or extravehicular in nature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7.3.5"><title>Investigation of on-board systematics</title><p>The availability of telemetry information makes it possible to conduct a detailed investigation of the on-board systematic forces as a source of the anomalous acceleration.</p><p>Previously, all known mechanisms of on-board systematic forces were examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">245</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR327">327</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR397">397</xref>] (see Table <xref rid="Tab12" ref-type="table">5.2</xref>). Current efforts are designed to improve our understanding of the contribution of on-board heat — notably, heat from the RTGs reflecting off the spacecraft, and electrical heat generated within the spacecraft — to the anomalous acceleration. The available telemetry also helps refine estimates of the radio beam reaction force. (Other effects, such as the differential emissivity of the RTGs, helium expulsion from the RTGs, propulsive gas leaks, were also analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR379">379</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR397">397</xref>] but were found to be insignificant.)</p><p>As pointed out in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], any thermal explanation should clarify why either the radioactive decay (if the heat is directly from the RTGs/RHUs) or electrical power decay (if the heat is from the instrument compartment) is not seen. One reason could be that previous analyses used only a limited data set of only 11.5 years when the thermal signature was hard to disentangle from the Doppler residuals or the fact that the actual data on the performance of the thermal and electrical systems was not complete or unavailable at the time the analyses were performed.</p><p>The present situation is very different. Not only do we have a much longer Doppler data segment for both spacecraft, we also have the actual telemetry data on the thermal and electric power subsystems for both Pioneers for the entire lengths of their missions. The electrical power profile of the spacecraft can be reconstructed with good accuracy using electrical telemetry measurements (see Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref>, and also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR397">397</xref>]).

A quantitative estimate was first offered by Scheffer in 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR327">327</xref>], who calculated a total of 52 W of directed thermal radiation (not including his estimate on asymmetrical radiation from the RTGs), or about 80% of the thrust required to account fully for the anomalous acceleration. In 2007, Toth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR376">376</xref>] presented an argument for expressing the combined recoil force due to electrical and RTG heat as a linear combination of the RTG thermal power and electrical power on board; his coefficients (0.012 for the RTGs, 0.36 for electrical heat) yield a figure of ∼ 55 W of directed thermal radiation in the mid-1980s, which, after accounting for the heat from the RHUs (4 W) and the antenna beam (−7 W) as Scheffer did, translates into a result that is similar to Scheffer’s.</p><p>Benefiting from the extensive discussions of the topic of thermal recoil force during the meetings of the Pioneer Explorer Collaboration at ISSI<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn32">32</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR400">400</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR328">328</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR329">329</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR376">376</xref>], several researchers tried to model effects of this force on a Pioneer-like spacecraft using various computer tools. In 2008, Bertolami et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] made an attempt to develop a methodology using point-like Lambertian sources to estimate the thermal recoil force on the Pioneer spacecraft, and obtained an acceleration estimate that corresponds to ∼ 67% of the Pioneer anomaly, or ∼ 45 W of directed thermal radiation. In addition, in 2009, Rievers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR311">311</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR312">312</xref>] used finite element modeling and ray tracing algorithms to compute an acceleration that corresponds to ∼ 48 W of directed heat in the mid-1980s.</p><p>These recent results support claims that the contribution of the thermal recoil forces to the Pioneer anomaly was previously (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]) underestimated. However, the estimates above used only rough values for on-board thermal and electrical power and are valid only for a particular point in Pioneers’ missions. As such, these estimates can provide only an overall magnitude of the effect and say little on its temporal behavior. On the other hand, the now available telemetry and recovered spacecraft design documentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR397">397</xref>] makes it possible to develop a comprehensive thermal model capable of estimating thermal recoil force throughout the entire mission of both Pioneers.

Some of this power was radiated into space directly by a shunt radiator plate, some power was consumed by instruments mounted external to the spacecraft body, and some power was radiated away in the form of radio waves; however, most electrical power was converted into heat inside the spacecraft body. This heat escaped the spacecraft body through three possible routes: a passive thermal louver system, other leaks and openings, and the spacecraft walls that were covered by multilayer thermal insulation blankets. While the distribution of heat sources inside the spacecraft body was highly inhomogeneous, there is little temporal variation in the distribution of heat inside the spacecraft body, and the exterior temperatures of the multilayer insulation remain linear functions of the total electrical heat.

First, there are 11 radioisotope heater units (RHUs) on board, each of which generated 1 W of heat at launch, using <sup>238</sup>Pu fuel with a half-life of 87.74 years. Second, the propulsion system, when used, can also generate substantial amounts of heat.</p><p>Nonetheless, these heat sources can be ignored. The total amount of heat generated by the RHUs is not only small, most of the RHUs themselves are mounted near the edge of the high-gain antenna (see Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">2.8</xref>), and a significant proportion of their heat is expected to be emitted in a direction perpendicular to the spin axis. As to the propulsion system, while it can generate substantial quantities of heat, these events are transient in nature and are completely masked by uncertainties in the maneuvers themselves, which are responsible for this heat generation. These arguments can lead to the conclusion that insofar as the anomalous acceleration is concerned, only the heat from the RTGs and electrical equipment contribute noticeably.</p><p>As discussed in Section <xref rid="Sec7.4.1" ref-type="sec">7.4.1</xref> above, knowledge of the physical properties (thermal properties and geometry) of the spacecraft and its internal heat sources is sufficient to compute heat, and thus momentum, transfer between the spacecraft and the sky. This can be accomplished using direct calculational methods, such as industry standard finite element thermal-mechanical modeling software. The availability of redundant telemetry (in particular, the simultaneous availability of electrical and thermal measurements) makes it possible to develop a more robust thermal model and also establish reasonable limits on its accuracy. Such a model has recently been developed at JPL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref>] and is yielding valuable results. The results of this analysis will be published when available (see also Figures <xref rid="Fig37" ref-type="fig">7.7</xref> and <xref rid="Fig38" ref-type="fig">7.8</xref>).</p><p>It is also possible to conduct a simplified analysis of the Pioneer spacecraft. First, taking into consideration the spacecraft’s spin means that the thermal recoil force only needs to be calculated in the spin axis direction (see Section <xref rid="Sec4.4" ref-type="sec">4.4</xref>). Second, it has been argued in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR380">380</xref>] that for these spacecraft, the total recoil force can be accurately modeled as a quantity that is proportional to some linear combination of the thermal power of the two dominant heat sources, the RTGs and electrical equipment.

However, there also exists another possible approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR380">380</xref>]: after incorporating the force model Equation <xref rid="Equ119" ref-type="disp-formula">(7.11)</xref> into the orbital equations of motion, orbit determination software can solve for these parameters, fitting their values, along with the spacecraft’s initial state vector, maneuvers, and other parameters, to radiometric Doppler observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR380">380</xref>]. While this approach seems promising, its success depends on the extent to which orbit determination code can disentangle the thermal recoil force, solar pressure, and a possible anomalous contribution from one another based on radiometric Doppler data alone.</p><p>A further complication arises from the fact that although late in their mission, the physical and thermal configuration of the Pioneer spacecraft were constant in time, this was not always the case. Earlier in their mission, when the spacecraft were closer to the Sun, their internal temperatures were regulated by a thermal louver system located on the aft side (i.e., the side opposite the high-gain antenna; see Figure <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">2.10</xref>). When these louvers were partially open (see Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">2.11</xref>), the effective thermal emissivity of the aft side was significantly higher, and varied as a function of internal temperatures (see Figures <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">2.12</xref> and <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">2.13</xref>). While this effect is difficult to model analytically, it can be incorporated into a finite element thermal model accurately.</p><p>These recent studies and on-going investigations made it clear that the figure published in 2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] is likely an underestimation of the thermal recoil force; far from being insignificant, the thermal recoil force represents a substantial fraction of the force required to generate the anomalous acceleration seen in Pioneer data, and may, in fact, account for all of it. This possibility clearly demands a thorough, in-depth analysis of the thermal environment on-board the Pioneers. Meanwhile, all the needed thermal and power data exist in the form of on-board telemetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR378">378</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR379">379</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR397">397</xref>].

The analysis now approaches its most exciting part.</p><p>If the anomaly, even in part, is of thermal origin, its magnitude must decrease with time as the on-board fuel inventory decreases (see Figure <xref rid="Fig39" ref-type="fig">7.9</xref>, for example). Therefore, a thermal model will necessarily predict a decreasing trend in the anomaly. To what extent will this trend contradict the previously reported “constancy” of the effect? Or will it support trends already seen as the jerk terms reported by independent verifications (Section <xref rid="Sec7.1" ref-type="sec">7.1</xref>)? To that extent we emphasize that the primary data set for the new investigation of the Pioneer anomalous acceleration is the much extended set of radiometric Doppler tracking data available for both spacecraft (Section <xref rid="Sec3.3" ref-type="sec">3.3</xref>). It is clear that if the anomaly was found in the navigational data, it must be re-evaluated using data of the same nature. This is why the new set of Doppler data that recently became available, in conjunction with the newly built tools to evaluate thermal recoil forces discussed above, is now being used to evaluate the long-term temporal behavior, direction and other important properties of the Pioneer anomaly (Section <xref rid="Sec7.2" ref-type="sec">7.2</xref>).</p><p>Finally, after a period of tedious preparatory work conducted during 2002–2009, the study of the Pioneer anomalous acceleration enters its final stages; the results of this work will be reported.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The Pioneer anomaly entered the phenomenology of modern physics at a time when researchers have mounted significant efforts to investigate two other observational anomalies: the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies and the accelerated expansion of the universe. Although the true origin of the anomalous acceleration of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft is yet to be reported, its existence has already helped us deepen our understanding of gravity. Unlike the other two anomalies, the Pioneer anomaly is “local” in character, taking place within our own solar system, involving a spacecraft of our own making. As a result, the Pioneer anomaly has led to increasing interest in space-based fundamental physics research focusing on solar system tests of gravity. This renewed interest is, perhaps, the most significant contribution of the Pioneer effect to modern physics to date.</p><p>The presence of the unexpected acceleration signal in the Pioneer radiometric Doppler data has led to a re-evaluation of theoretical frameworks used to test gravity in the solar system. It has also motivated the development of new physical mechanisms to explain the effect. The anomaly has necessitated a re-analysis of many physical concepts, resulting in studies of the behavior of gravitationally bound systems in an expanding universe, investigations of gravity modification mechanisms, and efforts to detect the anomaly with other spacecraft, planets, and other bodies in the solar system. The anomaly has also motivated the development of new methods to improve the accuracy of spacecraft navigation, including methods of accounting for the effect of thermal recoil forces.</p><p>In this review we describe the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft. We provide a significant amount of information on the design, operations and behavior of the two Pioneers during their entire missions. This includes information from original project documentation and descriptions of various data formats and techniques that were used for acquisition of the Pioneer data. We describe the radiometric Doppler data and techniques for data preparation and analysis. We also discussed the Pioneer telemetry data and its value for the anomaly investigation. We review the observational techniques and physical models that were used for precision tracking of the Pioneer spacecraft. We summarize the current knowledge of the physical properties of the Pioneer anomaly and review various mechanisms proposed for its explanation.</p><p>October 5, 2009 marked the eleventh anniversary of the first announcement of the Pioneer anomaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR390">390</xref>]). In the decade that followed, the existence of the anomalous acceleration in the radiometric Doppler data received from the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft was confirmed by several independent researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">179</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR274">274</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR377">377</xref>]. Thus, the existence and approximate magnitude of the anomaly can be considered established fact. However, the direction of the acceleration remains unclear: the four principal directions (sunward, earthward, along the spin axis, or along the velocity vector) fall within a few degrees of each other and based on available data, cannot be distinguished easily. The temporal behavior of the anomaly has been put into question by studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR377">377</xref>] that demonstrate the presence of a jerk term. Meanwhile, other studies (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR400">400</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR328">328</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR329">329</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR376">376</xref>], followed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR311">311</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR312">312</xref>]), indicate that the magnitude of acceleration due to thermal recoil forces of on-board origin may be significantly larger than previously estimated. As a result, the question of the origin of the Pioneer anomaly remains open, but hopefully not for long.</p><p>A comprehensive investigation of the anomaly has recently begun. The new study relies on the much-extended set of radiometric Doppler data for both spacecraft in conjunction with the entire record of the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft telemetry files and large archive of project documentation. This unique information has already led to the development of new software tools capturing all aspects of the in-flight behavior of the Pioneer vehicles throughout their missions. These efforts may soon reveal the origin of the anomaly. Our review provides the necessary background for the new results to appear in the near future. Such an anticipated development makes the study of the Pioneer anomaly a good subject for <italic>Living Reviews</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to express our gratitude to our many colleagues who have either collaborated with us on this manuscript or given us their wisdom.

Scientific measurements are extracted, packaged in the appropriate form, and sent to the corresponding experimenters for further processing and evaluation. Engineering telemetry is used by the spacecraft operations team to control and guide the spacecraft. MDRs are not necessarily considered worth preserving once the scientific data has been extracted, and the engineering telemetry is no longer needed for spacecraft operations. Indeed, the MDR retention schedule prescribed that the tapes be destroyed after 7 years.
