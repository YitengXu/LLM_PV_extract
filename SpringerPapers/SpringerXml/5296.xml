For conjugated polymer/fullerene BHJ solar cells, state of the art power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of exceeding 9% (9.11%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, 9.21%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and 9.35%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>) for single junction cell and up to 10.6%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> for tandem junction cell have been achieved.</p><p>To reach high PCE, one has to use low band gap polymer as donor with deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level for harvesting more sunlight (and thus higher short circuit current (Jsc)) and higher open circuit voltage (Voc) and to use interlayer or electrode modification for effective collection of charges. Among the reported effective low band gap polymers, the series of copolymers composed of the two basic fused rings comonomer units, benzodithiophene (BDT) and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TT), are of particular interest since they offer high PCE (7–8%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> resulting from high Jsc and Voc.</p><p>For improvement in electron and hole collections for further PCE enhancement, insertions of interlayers between the active layer and the electrodes have been made. PEDOT:PSS is usually used as anode interlayer in conventional PSC (c-PSC). However, prolonged exposure of this kind of device to air can lead to an oxidation of the air sensitive metal cathode, resulting in a degradation of PSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In order to alleviate this problem, an approach involved an invertion of the device architecture (i-PSC) is employed, in which a less air-sensitive high work function metal (Ag, Au) is used as the back hole collecting electrode and ZnO (metal oxide) is used as the electron collecting interlayer between ITO and active layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The ZnO is an n-type material with wide band gap (3.3 eV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, in which intrinsic defects such as excess zinc at the interstitial position and oxygen vacancy make ZnO n-type<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The conductivity of its thin film depends on temperature and atmosphere of thermal treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. When doped with other dopants Al, In or Ga, the conductivity is enhanced by extrinsic defects and can be as high as 50 S cm<sup>−1</sup> for sol–gel processed indium doped ZnO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Such Indium doped ZnO film also has high transparency and can be used as transparent charge collecting electrode in solar cell. In i-PSC, it was reported that use of Mg doped ZnO thin film as the cathode buffer layer with an active layer PTB7:PC<sub>71</sub>BM gave improvement in PCE from 7.11% to 8.35%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, the inorganic electron collecting electrode could have poor interfacial contact with organic active layer resulting in a poor electron extraction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> in i-PSC. Thus the cathode interface modification is a crucial issue for i-PSC, requiring high transparency, high electron mobility and appropriate energy level for matching with lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of acceptor.</p><p>In i-PSC, introducing cathode interlayer for improvement of PCE has been demonstrated, such as self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of fullerene derivatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, crosslinkable fullerene derivative<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and polyelectrolytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Recently, it was reported that the use of fullerene derivative (PCBE-OH) doped ZnO as the cathode for i-PSC with low band gap polymer PTB7-Th gave the PCE as high as 9.35%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This cathode provides dual functionalities for enhanced electron collection, including producing a fullerene-derivative-rich cathode surface and high surface conductivity.</p><p>Here we report high efficiency and stable inverted PSCs (i-PSC) by employing sol-gel processed simultaneously doped ZnO by Indium and fullerene derivative (BisNPC60-OH) (denoted as InZnO-BisC60) film as cathode interlayer and PTB7-Th:PC<sub>71</sub>BM as the active layer (where PTB7-Th is a low bandgap polymer we proposed previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>). This dual-doped ZnO, InZnO-BisC60, film shows dual and opposite gradient dopant concentration profiles, being rich in fullerene derivative at the cathode surface in contact with the active layer and rich in In at the cathode surface in contact with the ITO surface. Such doping in ZnO not only gives improved surface conductivity by a factor of 270 (from 0.015 to 4.06 S cm<sup>−1</sup>) but also provides enhanced electron mobility by a factor of 132 (from 8.25*10<sup>−5</sup> to 1.09*10<sup>−2</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>). The resulting i-PSC exhibits the improved PCE 10.31% relative to that with ZnO without doping 8.25%. This PCE 10.31% is the best result among the reported values so far for single junction PSC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>ZnO-BisC60 and ZnO nano-films (40 nm) were prepared by spin-casting from the solution of 1.5 wt% BisNPC60-OH and 98.5 wt% Zn(Ac)<sub>2</sub> (1g, total) and from the same solution but without BisNPC60-OH in the mixture of THF/2-methoxyethanol (1:4, v/v, 10 ml) and ethanolamine (0.252 g) on top of ITO and then sintering at 180°C, respectively. The InZnO and InZnO-BisC60 nano-films (40 nm) were also prepared in accordance with the above method but to the solutions, 1 atom% InCl<sub>3</sub> were added in addition. The procedure for preparation of ZnO-BisC60 nano-film is different from that in our previous report for ZnO-C60 nano-film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> since the structure of the fullerene derivatives used are different. Here the fullerene derivative used was based on bis-functional phenol group on C60 BisNPC60-OH (solubility = 1.5 mg/ml) (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>) which has better solubility than that with functional alcohol group PCBE-OH (solubility = 0.5 mg/ml) both in the mixed solvent of THF/2-methoxyethanol (1:4, v/v). The resulting InZnO-BisC60, InZnO, ZnO-BisC60 and ZnO films on ITO were then rinsed with carbon disulfide (CS<sub>2</sub>) and THF to remove the nonbonding residual BisNPC60-OH on the surface and subsequently dried for further characterization by contact angle measurement, X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS and UPS), ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-vis) and charge transport measurement.

The doping of BisNPC60-OH into InZnO and ZnO leads to improved hydrophobicity as reflected in the contact angle increasing from 30° to 67° and from 25° to 55°, respectively. Refering to the contact angle of C60-SAM ranging from 40° to 60°<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, it can be infered that the surfaces of InZnO-BisC60 and ZnO-BisC60 are mostly covered with the fullerene derivative. We also prepared the samples of fullerene doped ZnO and InZnO as ETL coated on ITO glass for AFM morphology measurement as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S2</xref>. The surface roughness of ZnO and InZnO are 2.28 nm and 2.67 nm, respectively and those of the fullerene doped films ZnO-BisC60 and InZnO-BisC60 films are 6.63 nm and 3.54 nm, respectively. These roughness results indicate that those with fullerene doping have significantly increased roughness, which also support that their surfaces are rich in fullerenes.</p><p>XPS measurement for binding energy (BE) spectra of various types of carbon on the surfaces of cathode interlayer nano-films are shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, in which each of ZnO and InZnO shows a major peak and a very weak peak, the former contributing from the carbons of C-O-R<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> for ZnO (285.2 eV) and for InZnO (285.2 eV), while the latter from the carbons of carbonyl group (288.9 eV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. When InZnO and ZnO are doped with the fullerene derivative (BisNPC60-OH), as expected, their intensities of C 1s BE peaks are both stronger than those without doping, since the fullerene derivative (BisNPC60-OH) is primarily composed of carbon atoms. The major C 1s peaks grow dramatically and shift to 285.6 eV (InZnO-BisC60) and 285.7 eV (ZnO-BisC60) contributing from the fullerene derivatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> and the minor C 1s peaks (288.9 eV) are from the carbons of carbonyl group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The C 1s BE intensities for InZnO-BisC60 and ZnO-BisC60 are much stronger than those of our previous ZnO-C60 due to the better solubility of the fullerene derivative BisNPC60-OH (solubility = 1.5 mg/ml) in the THF/methoxyethanol (1:4, v/v) than that of PCBE-OH (solubility = 0.5 mg/ml) allowing more BisNPC60-OH (1.5 wt%) to be added than PCBE-OH (0.5 wt%).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>XPS analysis on cathode interlayer: (a) carbon (285.2 eV (C1s)); (b) Zinc (1023.0 eV (2p<sub>3/2</sub>) and 1046.0 eV (2p<sub>1/2</sub>));(c) Indium (444.6 eV (2d<sub>5/2</sub>) and 452.4 eV (2d<sub>3/2</sub>)); (d) Oxygen (531 eV (O 1s)) BE; and (e) depth profiles of the atom ratios C/Zn and In/Zn in InZnO and InZnO-BisC60.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep06813_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>Further analysis of XPS results on BE spectra for zinc, indium and oxygen atoms at the surfaces of the cathode interlayers shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b, 2c and 2d</xref> are given below to reveal that ZnO in InZnO, ZnO-BisC60 and InZnO-BisC60 are doped either by indium or BisNPC60-OH or by both. As can be seen, the BE peaks of InZnO (Zn 2p<sub>1/2</sub> (1022.7 eV) and 2p<sub>3/2</sub> (1045.7 eV)), are both lower by 0.3 eV than those of ZnO (Zn 2p<sub>1/2</sub> (1023.0 eV) and 2p<sub>3/2</sub> (1046.0 eV)). In the cases of InZnO-BisC60 and ZnO-BisC60, both pairs of the BE peaks of the former (Zn 2p<sub>1/2</sub> (1022.5 eV) and 2p<sub>3/2</sub> (1045.5 eV)) and those of the latter (Zn 2p<sub>1/2</sub> (1022.3 eV) and 2p<sub>3/2</sub> (1045.3 eV)) are lower by 0.5 eV and 0.7 eV than those of ZnO, respectively. The indium spectra BE in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref> exhibit two significant peaks at 444.6 (In 3d<sub>3/2</sub>) and 452.4 eV (In 3d<sub>5/2</sub>) which can be attributed to In-O in In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> by shifting to higher energy by 0.7 eV relative to the pristine In (3d<sub>3/2</sub> 443.9 eV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The peak of In 3d<sub>5/2</sub> peak at 444.9 eV contributed from InCl<sub>3</sub> was not observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, suggesting that dopant InCl<sub>3</sub> is completely decomposed during the sol–gel or annealing process. The BE peaks of O 1s in the ZnO are 532.5 eV and 531.2 eV for O-H<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and Zn-O<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, respectively; while those in the InZnO also give two peak at 532.8 eV and 531.5, which can be attributed to O-H<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> and Zn-O<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> in ZnO by shifting to higher energy by 0.3 eV relative to the pristine ZnO. The peak of BE O 1s at 532.5 eV (OH) disappears in the ZnO-BisC60 and InZnO-BisC60, indicating that the defect with O-H on the ZnO surface is eliminated after the doping, which would also contribute partially to the enhancement in electron extraction efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Since the fullerene content in the total solid of the precursor is only 1.5 wt% and the surface is fullerene rich, it is necessary to examine the atom content profiles along the InZnO-BisC60 layer. It can be clearly observed from <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> that at the surface, C/Zn atom ratio of ZnO-C60 (0.98) is higher than that of ZnO (0.23) by 0.75 (or a factor of 4.13), which is also higher than that of unsintered homogeneous case (0.25) by a factor of 3 (because the C/Zn of unsintered InZnO-BisC60 is calculated to be 4.25 and that of ZnO is 4). This indicates that the surface of InZnO-BisC60 is rich in fullerene derivative. Whereas In/Zn atom ratio profile in InZnO-BisC60 cases is nearly zero before the sputtering time at about 800s and appears a small increasing peak at sputtering time 900s in the range 800–1020s, which would indicate that the sputtering time 1020s is equivalent to the thickness of InZnO-BisC60 layers, 40 nm and the sputtering time from 800 to 1020s is mainly located within the dopant indium rich region. For the InZnO case, the depth profile of In/Zn would indicate that the sputtering time 1260s is equivalent to the thickness of InZnO layer, 40 nm; and the increase in In-content after 1260s is contributed from In in ITO layer in ITO glass. The C/Zn atom ratio profile of InZnO-BisC60 (0.98 at the surface) is reduced rapidly to 0.22 at the sputtering time 300s, indicating that the fullerene derivative in InZnO-BisC60 is mainly located within the interfacial region 11.8 nm (or 12 nm) as estimated by assuming a linear variation of sputtering time with thickness. Therefore the gradient distribution of fullerene content can be depicted as <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>. This InZnO-BisC60 manifests a new dual doping of zinc oxide nano-film (as interlayer with ITO cathode) by Indium and novel fullerene derivative, which results in a dual gradient concentration profiles with opposite distributions of the two dopants, being rich in fullerene derivative at the surface and rich in indium at the interface with the ITO cathode.</p><p>To investigate if ZnO in the bulk of InZnO, ZnO-BisC60, or InZnO-BisC60 is also doped by Indium, fullerene, or both, we examined their UV-vis spectra (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3a</xref>) before doping. The pristine film ZnO has absorption edge at about 400 nm, but after the dopings, the three doped ZnO shows additional absorption in the range 400 to 550 nm, indicating the occurrence of doping in the bulk by which additional electronic states are generated in the band gap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. We then turn to determine the electronic energy levels (HOMO and LUMO levels of ZnO, InZnO, ZnO-BisC60 and InZnO-BisC60) using UPS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S1</xref>) (the detail measurement is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supplementary information</xref>). The HOMO levels of ZnO-BisC60 and InZnO-BisC60 (6.7 eV and 6.7 eV) are lowered by 0.5 eV and 0.4 eV relative to those of ZnO and InZnO (7.20 eV and 7.1 eV). Note that such change is due to the n-doping rather than interfacial dipole as evidenced by the generation of additional optical absorption indicated above. The LUMO levels of ZnO, InZnO, ZnO-BisC60 and InZnO-BisC60 can then be determined by subtracting optical optical band gaps determined from the optical absorption spectra in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3a</xref> from the HOMO levels to give 2.91, 2.48, 2.21 and 2.25 eV, respectively. The resulting LUMO levels are 4.29 eV (ZnO), 4.62 eV (InZnO), 4.49 eV (ZnO-BisC60) and 4.45 eV (InZnO-BisC60). The doping creates a new transport pathway for electrons. The energy levels so determined along with those of the other materials are summarized in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>.</p><p>In InZnO, ZnO-BisC60 and InZnO-BisC60, the created electronic states by doping would allow an improvement in conductivity relative to ZnO as expected. We measured electron mobility (µ) across these films by applying single carrier space charge limited conduction (SCLC) on the electron-only device, ITO/cathode interlayer/Ca/Al and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S2</xref>. All of the electron mobilities for these films are significantly higher than those without doping and the electron mobility decreases in the sequence InZnO-BisC60 (1.09*10<sup>−2</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) &gt; InZnO (9.51*10<sup>−3</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) &gt; ZnO-BisC60 (6.21*10<sup>−3</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) &gt; ZnO (8.25*10<sup>−5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) (the value for ZnO is close to the reported value 8.4*10<sup>−5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> in the same device)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In addition the InZnO-BisC60 shows the highest electron mobility among all the materials. Furthermore, we also measured the surface conductivities for all these materials using the four probe method and found that the surface conductivity increases in the sequence from 0.015 (ZnO) to 2.03 (ZnO-BisC60) to 4.06 (InZnO-BisC60) to 8.51 (InZnO) S cm<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S3</xref>).</p><p>We then apply the doped ZnO films by spin-coating of their precusors on ITO and then subject to sintering at 180°C as the cathode interlayer for i-PSC with the device structure ITO/cathode interlayer/PTB7-Th: PC<sub>71</sub>BM/MoO<sub>3</sub>/Ag. The device performances were measured under simulated 100 mW cm<sup>−2</sup> AM 1.5G illumination as shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> and their characteristic values are listed in <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. For the devices with doped ZnO's (including InZnO, ZnO-BisC60 and InZnO-BisC60), the PCE (maximum) enhances significantly from 8.25% (pristine ZnO) to 9.11% (InZnO), 9.71% (ZnO-BisC60) and to 10.31% (InZnO-BisC60). External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements for the devices with InZnO-BisC60, ZnO-BisC60 and InZnO show overall enhancement in the entire absorption range (400 to 750 nm) when the doped cathodes are used to replace ZnO as the cathode interlayer (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>), which implies that the increase of current density results from more efficient electron collection by doped ZnO's than ZnO. With BisNPC60-OH-doped interlayer InZnO-BisC60 and ZnO-BisC60, the EQEs from 500 to 700 nm and 375 to 500 nm of the former are in the range 68–80% and 53–73% and of the latter in 64–77% and 57–72%, which are much higher than those with InZnO 63–74% and 50–68%, with ZnO 58–69% and 46–61%, respectively. The additional electron collection enhancement can also be manifested by the calculations of series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) from reciprocals of the slopes of the J-V curves at I = 0 and V = 0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. For the devices with ZnO, InZnO, ZnO-BisC60 and InZnO-BisC60, these calculations show a significant drop in Rs from 10.12 to 4.56, 3.76 and 2.12 Ω cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively and a drastic rise in Rsh from 1120 to 1290, 1520 and 1610 Ω cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S4</xref>). These indicate that the devices with fullerene or Indium doped cathode actually give a reduced Rs by promotion of electron transport at the interface and in the bulk of the cathode. In addition to charge transport, charge recombination also affects the charge collection efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. To investigate charge recombination, we measured the J-V curves of the devices (ITO/ZnO, InZnO or InZnO-BisC60/active layer/MoO<sub>3</sub>/Ag) under various light intensity ranging from 100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> to 4.32 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and plotted Jsc versus illumination intensity (I) as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S5(a–c)</xref>.

This power law relationship describes the charge recombination kinetics at short circuit for BHJ PSC; as α = 1, no recombination occurs and deviation from 1 indicates an extent of charge recombination. For the ZnO, InZnO, InZnO-BisC60 devices, the α increases from 0.94 to 0.96 and to 0.98. InZnO-BisC60 has the highest α value 0.98, which implies that the extent of charge recombination is extremely low. This is correlated with the observed increase in Rsh and thus charge collection probability at short circuit. This decreased sequence in Rs and increased in Rsh of the devices with ZnO, InZnO and InZnO-BisC60 are in consistent with the promoted sequence of FF.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Photovoltaic performance of i-PSC based on PC<sub>71</sub>BM with the device structure ITO/Cathode interlayer (40 nm)/PTB7-Th:PC<sub>71</sub>BM (1:1.5 w/w,100 nm)/MoO<sub>3</sub> (10 nm)/Ag (100 nm).

Therefore the chance for electron/hole recombination at the interface is reduced by cutting off the chance of direct contact of polymer with ZnO or InZnO, facilitating a more effective collection of electrons from the bulk. The devices with InZnO-BisC60 (10.31%) and ZnO-BisC60 (9.71%) provide higher PCE than those without fullerene doping (InZnO and ZnO) by about 1.20% and 1.46%, respectively. Therefore the improvement in PCE from 8.25% (ZnO) to 10.31% (InZnO-BisC60) mainly results from the promotion of controllable fullerene distribution on the surrface and bulk conductivity by dual functional doped specises to provide dual functionality based on organic and inorganic compounds in the ZnO. Overall this work proposes dual functional doping of ZnO (one by fullerene derivative and the other by InCl<sub>3</sub> doping) for the device with the active layer PTB7-Th:PC<sub>71</sub>BM, which lead to a great improvement in PCE from 8.25% to 10.31%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we present a simple and novel method for modification of ZnO as the cathode interlayer for i-PSC by dual doping with the novel fullerene derivative (BisNPC60-OH) and indium (InCl<sub>3</sub>) simultaneously.
