We discover that, as shown in the simulation, water can exist in both the liquid and vapor phases depending on the confining geometry and compressibility ratio. We also pay attention to how stable the interacting liquid is in relation to the pressure of compression that is perpendicular to the graphene sheets. To build this system and analyze its surface interface properties, we also used analytical and electronic scale modeling approaches. The impact of nanoconfinement on internal pressure may be seen in water, and this can be used to create interfacial materials for the creation of environmentally friendly solar cell materials. Our research highlights the intricate, seemingly random behavior of nanoconfined water—behavior that is difficult for graphene to understand. The results obtained offer crucial direction for system design and configuration of materials at the graphene/water interface that can be utilized as a benchmark for other future designs.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>MD (molecular

properties of graphene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] have drawn a lot of interest to next-generation graphene-based materials since the discovery of exfoliated graphene. According to Balandin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and Akaishi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], these materials are expected to be used in a variety of applications, including thermoelectric devices and semiconducting devices. To create practical applications, it is important to comprehend how these materials bind to water in ambient air hypothesis that graphene is hydrophobic has since been disproved by additional experimental findings. Graphitic surfaces with experimentally established hydrophobicity are partially caused by contamination of the surface by airborne particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, later studies revealed that the hydrophilicity of graphene surface has a profound impact on the interactions between graphene and water. For instance, the purest form of monolayer graphene is thought to be hydrophilic, but as the number of layers grows, the graphene becomes more hydrophobic. Because graphene is two-dimensional and hydrophobic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], it must be put on a substrate for most applications. Graphene is only partially transparent to the wetting characteristics of the underlying substrate as demonstrated in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As a result, graphene’s wetting transparency is compromised when it is applied to superhydrophobic. Changes in the local carrier concentration and work function can significantly alter the wetting characteristics and, consequently, the water adsorption of graphene when only a few layers (i.e., 1–3 LG) are involved. Given that water is the most prevalent dipolar adsorbate in ambient circumstances and that graphene thickness often varies, it is essential to consider how water molecules interact with various thickness domains and how charge transfer is controlled by various substrates.</p><p id="Par3">Significant work has been put into understanding the water-graphene interaction up until this point through theoretical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and experimental studies of water on graphitic surfaces. This raises the issue of whether graphene surfaces are naturally hydrophilic or hydrophobic. A surface’s hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity is typically connected with how moist it is. This issue further extends to the development of studies in materials such as solar cells where lower production costs and increases in power conversion efficiency have always been the aims of research on solar cells. Around 90% of silicon is found as crystalline silicon.</p><p id="Par4">The bulk of solar cells is produced via market-based methods, according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Due to the substantial expense incurred in manufacturing a highly efficient solar panel, the efficiency has achieved up to 22% of the solar panels currently on the market, with still between 14 and 16% in favor. It is imperative to keep in mind that most of the sun’s remaining energy is converted to heat in the solar cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], rather than electricity. The power conversion efficiency of the solar cell will suffer because of this rise in temperature, which will also shorten the cell’s lifespan and destroy it. This necessitates controlling the temperature of the solar cells by eliminating excess heat, and this issue has been thoroughly researched. A solar cell’s temperature can be decreased by up to 15 °C with the addition of a passively cooled heat sink, increasing the power production by roughly 7% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. One factor preventing heat from traveling between the surfaces of the heat sink and the solar cell is the inter-facial thermal resistance. The two adjacent surfaces’ tiny defects, which cause tiny air gaps between them, are the cause of this. Because air is known to be a rather poor thermal conductor, it would be a great idea to fill these air gaps with a material that has a substantially higher thermal conductivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This material, or paste, is referred to as a “thermal interface material” (TIM). Most of this research focuses on using top-notch fillers like graphene to improve the thermal conductivity of commercial TIMs that are already on the market.</p><p id="Par5">Graphene is interesting for usage in a range of applications due to its unique properties. The high sensitivity of graphene to the local environment has shown to be both advantageous and detrimental for graphene-based devices like transistors and sensors, because the graphene resistance would alter due to humidity variations. Graphene and graphene oxide have also been demonstrated to be good materials for water desalination, opening the door to the availability of pure water in remote regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Water interacts with graphene by changing its electrical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Graphene is a conductor that can become exceedingly thin, transparent, flexible, and mechanically strong. Its conductivity can be altered over a broad range by either chemical doping or an electric field. The remarkable mobility of graphene is useful in high-frequency electrical applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Recent technological developments have made it possible to create large graphene sheets. Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] used processes that are almost industrial to produce sheets that are 70 cm wide. Since graphene is a transparent conductor, it can replace the more fragile and expensive indium-tin oxide in technologies like solar cells, touch screens, and light panels (ITO).</p><p id="Par6">The goal of this research is to understand the inter-molecular interactions between water confined in-between graphene sheets, using computational modeling techniques based on both inter-atomic potentials and analytical methods, to further explore the viability of the graphene-water interface materials for use in developing solar cells.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>System modeling and simulation</title><p id="Par7">To elucidate the interaction of graphene with water, Melios et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] reviewed recent theoretical and experimental advances, particularly in modeling of water-graphene interaction and the effects of water on the local and global electronic properties of graphene. The atomistic system that describes the graphene-water interaction was designed using the Lennard–Jones potential and the Coulombic force field, in LAMMPS (large-scale atomic molecular massively parallel simulator) which helps in describing the kinetics at different perturbation levels of the system during the compression process, most importantly without negating its thermodynamic parameters. The MD software used to develop the system is called LAMMPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] which is used to model atoms and design mesoscopic systems; it has potentials for solid-state materials (semiconductors) and soft-matter systems (biomolecules and polymers). This software requires parameter files and data files that contain the electronic configuration of the system; the parameter file was developed using MATLAB scripts. The use of other Python libraries was employed to explore the concept of the system; these included DFTB (PYBINDING) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and materials project (PYMATGEN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Molecular dynamics of the system</title><p id="Par8">The molecular dynamics (MD) structure employed in this study closely follows the work of Ranathunga et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, in this study, we carry out MD simulations on water molecules confined between graphene slabs/walls (consisting of 3 layers) above and below. The system consists of approximately 7751 atoms, with run steps of 7000. The TIP4P2005 four-point rigid water model was selected because it extends the transition of the TIP3P model by increasing the sites which are usually mass-less, where the charges associated with the oxygen atoms are placed. This site M is located at a fixed distance part from the HO-H bond angle, which mostly has a bond style of harmonics. This investigation uses the cut-off long-range model and Coulombic solver in order to understand the FFT-based particle–particle meshing, which is crucial in accurately modeling the compression activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Simulation details</title><p id="Par9">In this simulation, the PBC (periodic boundary conditions) were applied in the three coordinates and the Verlet algorithm which is a popular algorithm (numerical methods used to integrate the equations of motion) with a time step of 0.1 fs. The Lennard–Jones interactions were then truncated at 8 Å, and the long-range electrostatics were treated with the particle–particle and particle-mesh (PPM) solver with a k-space cut-off of 12 Å. Using a NVE thermostat, the temperature of the system was kept at 300 K, for a fixed number of water molecules. We designed the initial structure for free-energy calculations extracted from equilibrium ensemble created by several iterations of running the MD simulations.</p><p id="Par10">The velocities of the water molecules were estimated at an initial run, at a Boltzmann distribution of 350 K, the system also comprises special bonds, which include angles and dihedrals, which describe the presence of the carbon atoms in the system. The interaction of the carbon and water molecules is initiated by shaking the system using the FIX SHAKE command which applies the bond and angle constraints to the specified special bonds in the simulation. Since the water molecules were confined in between the carbon walls (top and bottom), each simulation was run until more than 85% of the system has undergone relaxation. The corresponding log and output file usually a dump (dummp.lammpstrj) file is generated using some internal system setting commands in the LAMMPS input script. Furthermore, the data from the log file is extracted using a Python script to obtain all specified parameters such as the total energy and kinetic energy into a csv file which can easily be read for further exploratory data analysis using Python to give both analytical and descriptive insight to the system. The dump file which contains the inherent system model is then visualized using OVITO software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and a few analyses were made. In order to have a holistic view of this investigation, another software was used to simulate the system; these are PYMATGEN and PYBINDING. PYMATGEN is a python package developed by the materials project, which is an open-source library for materials analysis. It was used to analyze the carbon–water interaction using the phase and Pourbaix diagram to determine the stability of the system. PYBINDING which is a Python library used for numerical tight-binding calculations in solid-state physics is employed to understand the interaction of the system at its fundamental level, from the perspective of the crystal lattice structure and geometry of the graphene walls. The energy parameters were obtained from the simulation, and time-averaged steps are recorded as a function of the z-direction during the simulation at a constant temperature, which has a large influence on the graphene surface. The total interaction of energies between the dynamic confines of the region and the carbon atoms is then computed with time. From the simulation data, the time steps averaged the total energy interactions of the system, which is then used in plotting other systems’ parameters.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par11">The results obtained from the analysis of the data extracted from the LAMMPS run, using exploratory data analysis methods with Python and the visualization of the structure using the open-source OVITO software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], to describe the kinematic positioning of atoms in the system and analysis were made using Voronoi and coordination modifiers. Also, outputs from the PYBINDING and PYMATGEN libraries which describe the system both in electronic and analytical scale modeling are presented in this section. The 3D presentation of the simulation results has been recorded in an.avi format movie as a supplemental information file.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>OVITO visualization and modification</title><p id="Par12">Studying the rate of interacting fixed water molecules confined between two graphene slabs at a constant temperature, it can be observed that the compression process is an ostensible homogeneous nucleation process, which occurs at frequent shifts in the sites of the water molecules.

The rate of water interaction with the graphene surface was studied using a fixed amount of water and at a constant temperature. The water interaction was linked to properties that were dependent on the interacting surface, compressibility, inter-facial thermal properties, and energy accumulation. During the simulation, the formation of different bonds and interface reactions were investigated. Understanding the prevalent bond in the system, which is the hydrogen bond network, provides insight into the reacting elements of the system and explained the stability and structural arrangement of water as a function of its surface chemistry. It was observed that the graphene surface exhibited a hydrophobic behavior, due to the weak interacting energies, water molecules that encounter the graphene surface tend to form different bonds, which serves as a potential homogeneous nucleation site. When the molecules are large enough, it is then captured by the graphene surface upon collision and assumed a hemispherical shape. Therefore, the repulsive interaction energy regions with the graphene structures indicate a solid/liquid-like interface which is caused by water molecules depleting at hydrophobic interfaces. Also, using computational modeling tools such as PYMATGEN and PYBINDING to describe the similar structure and system configurations at a microscopic level gives valuable insight into the working intermolecular mechanisms that help in developing more efficient materials. Taking all the results of this investigation into account, we can give a more holistic molecular-level insight into water confined under two graphene sheets using MD and computational modeling approach to design and evaluate the kinematics of the system under compression and its microscopic inter-facial characterization. The provided insight into the water and graphene behavior as a function of compressible force can be used to improve the design of solar cells that use graphene materials, for offshore co-location purposes.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Open Access funding provided by the IReL Consortium.
