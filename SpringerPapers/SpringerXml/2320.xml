An innovative conception for a non-destructive self-powered writable-readable data sheet is presented which can pave the way towards new type of stress induced current harvesting devices. A localized forced deformation of the interface has been enacted by pressing the atomic force microscopic probe against the polymer surface, allowing charge transfer between materials interfaces. The process yields a well-defined charge pattern by transmuting mechanical stress in to readable information. The average of output current increment has been influenced from 0.5 nA to 15 nA for the applied force of 2 nN to 14 nN instead of electrical bias. These results underscore the importance of stress-induced current harvesting mechanism and could be scaled up for charge patterning of polymer surface to writable-readable data sheet. Time evolutional current distribution (TECD) study of the stress-induced patterned PANI surface shows the response of readability of the recorded data with time.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep19514.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep19514" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep19514</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Charge transfer phenomenon at the metal-polymer interface by contact electrification is among the most exciting physical phenomena, both as a source of information on materials physics and also due to its huge scope in nanoelectronics and device applications. Contact electrification, which was discovered around 600 BC, is still a subject of intense research on the basis of fundamental materials research and also for an alternative way of harvesting energy in newly emerging fields of mechano-electronics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Contact electrification can be considered as a phenomenon of charge transfer and back transfer (which may be a single type of mobile ions, electrons or a mixture of ions and electrons) between the surface of two different materials through the Fermi level energy barrier when they are brought into contact and separated (with or without intentional rubbing or frictional contact)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Depending on the height of the energy levels charge carriers are accepted or donated from the metal surface. However, the effect has been regarded as one of the factors for undesirable power dissipation in electronic circuits, but recent ideologists in materials science are studying this outcome in contextual applications like painting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, particle separation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, polymerizations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> mechano-electrical data storage and energy harvesting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> etc. Contact electrification can be classified according to the type of the solid surfaces involved: metal-metal, metal-insulator and metal-semiconductor system. Though in comparison to the metal-semiconductor system, the first two systems have been extensively used in contact electrification mechanism or in terms of triboelectrification for the last two decades. Here, we propose a conceptually new design to write and read of memory bits on polymer surface using mechano-electrical response instead of applying any electrical bias. Through converting mechanical stress into readable information powered by contact electrification mechanism (CEM), such polymer surface could be scaled up as a nanoscopic writable-readable data sheet.</p><p>Towards exploring these mechano-electrical energy harvesters, especially for polymer based systems, one major issue is the selection of material. Polymer material comprises significant advantages over the conventional inorganic material based electronics due to its attractive features including miniaturized dimension and feasible improvisations in physical properties through molecular design and chemical synthesis. In particular, among all the polymers, much attention has been paid to conjugated polymers (also known as organic semiconductors or conducting polymers) for organic based electronic devices (OED) due to their interesting opto-electronic configuration, which can be varied from insulator to metal like behaviour<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. A central issue in the physics of these π-conjugated polymers (and the corresponding oligomers) is the strong coupling between electronic, geometric and chemical structures, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the bonding pattern of atoms in the molecular system. It is increasingly clear that the electronic properties of conjugated polymers depend sensitively on the physical conformation of the polymer chains and the way the chains pack together in films. Among these conjugated polymers, polyaniline (PANI) is one of the most investigated because of its facile synthesis, excellent electronic properties and high environmental stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. A distinctive feature of PANI is the reversibly tunable redox characteristics that allow the control of electrical conductivity over a wide range by protonation and charge-transfer doping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Eventually, the polaronic structure in protonated emeraldine form of PANI makes it interesting to study as a conducting polymeric material. The presented work has evidenced unique contact electrification of this polymeric film at its metal-polymer interface. The signification of this article is to offer a deep insight into this phenomenon using polaron based charge transfer mechanism of PANI and to further evolve this idea into the formation of polymer based mechano-electrical nanoscopic writable-readable data sheet.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Polyaniline thin films were deposited on ITO coated glass substrate by a chemical oxidative polymerization method. The localized electron transport behaviour has been investigated based on contact electrification mechanism at metal-polymer-metal interfaces, where ITO acted as a bottom electrode and <italic>Pt-Ir</italic> coated AFM probe was used as localized top electrode. CEM has been explored by <italic>in-situ</italic> atomic force microscope technique in contact mode by using a metal coated probe with different applied forces. Detailed fabrication method of PANI thin films on ITO electrode is given in Experimental Section. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(a)</xref> shows a field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) image of the thin film surface, revealing that PANI forms a tiny network cross-linked with adjacent nanostructures. A close look at the nanostructure growth shows a compact PANI film. Confirmation of PANI has been described extensively by FTIR analysis, given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S1(a) in supplementary information</xref>. Also all the deposited forms of polyaniline films were amorphous in nature. The corresponding XRD of different form of PANI films have been displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S1(b) in supplementary information</xref>. In order to develop mechano-electrical response based on metal-polymer interface CEM, we have first studied the <italic>I-V</italic> characteristics of the PANI thin film at a particular point by AFM probe using different probe-surface contacting forces. The AFM probe was calibrated before each measurement with all the factors that affect the data acquisition kept fixed. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(b)</xref> exhibits the <italic>I-V</italic> characteristics for an applied voltage range from +0.4 to −0.4 V with increasing probe-surface contacting force. The corresponding semi-logarithmic plot of which in the inset of <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(b)</xref> clearly demonstrates a current generation at 0 V applied field (can be claimed as short circuit current, <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>SC</italic></sub>). According to the conventional theory of CEM, when the top electrode lands on the polymer surface, a localized stress is developed on the contact surface area, generating different charge distributions within the polymer-metal interface. The stretched surface exhibited localized charges (shown in the scheme in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(c)</xref>) compared with the un-stretched surface, initiating charge carriers (electrons or ions) to transfer from metal to polymer or vice-versa, due to the difference in Fermi energy level of two materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Contact charging has been considered as a non-equilibrium two-step mechanism, consisting of instantaneous bond-breaking process and bond-forming process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Interestingly, our study actualizes the fact of charge transfer and back transfer mechanism at the metal-polymer interface at the time of contact. However, the dynamics of charge transfer mechanism for a semiconducting polymer like polyaniline is a subject of intense research. An explicit investigation on the current characteristics shows that, other than the emeraldine salt (ES) form, there was no short circuit current (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>SC</italic></sub>) for other different forms of polyaniline, i.e., fully reduced (leucoemeraldine base; LB) and fully oxidized (pernigraniline base; PNB) systems based on CEM. This contextual outcome imparts that contact charging is not solely due to the transfer of charge carriers (i.e. electrons, ions or both) between the Fermi levels of two surfaces, but entails spatially certain electronic structure of polyaniline in conducting form.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) FESEM image of the polyaniline thin film deposited on ITO coated glass substrate.

Previous experimental studies found that the maximum in π-π<sup>*</sup> optical absorption spectrum in the LB form is 3.8 eV, which is far wide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. As the intrinsic redox states associated with the nitrogen atoms are unique to PANI and act as a prevailing role on the doping behaviour which further attributing to the charge transfer properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Thus the current generation due to contact electrification has been shown for protonated emeraldine base PANI <italic>i.e.</italic> ES-PANI. As synthesized PANI consists of alternating reduced (amine group; <inline-formula id="IEq1"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep19514_IEq1_HTML.gif"/></inline-formula>) and oxidized (imine group; −<italic>N</italic>=) repeat units, known as the emeraldine base (EB) form. However, after the treatment with sufficient acid dopant (HX), EB-PANI becomes protonated and transforms into the conductive ES form. The protonation of this form create polarons, the charge carriers able to travel along the macromolecule backbone or even to move on neighboring macromolecules through variable range hopping (VRH) mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, protonation of PANI led to a significant increase in charge transfer mechanism. Therefore, electrons that reside on the amine group of ES-PANI, may gain enough energy to surmount the localized interaction and initiate to transfer to the nearest lower energy band. A schematic of the mechanism has been illustrated in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(c)</xref>. The number of electron transfer will increase with the increasing localized stress on the polymer surface induced by the metal probe. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(d)</xref> shows the dependence of short circuit current (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>SC</italic></sub>) on different applied forces by AFM probe on the PANI surface. The <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>SC</italic></sub> exhibits an increasing order of value with the raise in applied force, <italic>i.e</italic>., with the increasing amount of stress developed at the PANI surface for protonated EB or ES form (namely, PANI-1). The experimental data shows that the PANI surface exhibited an 11.4% increment in <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>SC</italic></sub> for an applied force ranging from 1.5 nN to 5.5 nN. Further enhancement in applied force yields a sharp increment in <italic>I</italic><sub><italic>SC</italic></sub>. Result shows that the electric output is strongly related to the contact force, yielding higher output with larger force. But the same behaviour was not observed for more oxidized form of EB (namely, PANI-2). <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(e)</xref> depicts a characteristic <italic>I-V</italic> of the PANI-2 film for different probe bias, yielding no current generation at 0 V. Above results impact on the polaronic structure of PANI, which is almost unavailable for over oxidized sate of PANI (due to the formation of more bipolaronic structures in polymer chains). <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> shows the UV-Vis spectroscopy of these two samples with different oxidation states, PANI-1 and PANI-2. A small satellite has been detected at 434 nm and the broad peak near 782 nm is attributed to the formation of cation radicals (polarons), indicating the doped state of the sample. The broadening at 782 nm arises due to electronic delocalization which may lead to the charge transfer. The red shift of the broad peak with absence of satellite peak indicates the absence of delocalized electronic structures in the second sample, which can be signified to the increase in oxidation level of PANI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Also the FTIR of two samples agreed with the UV-Vis spectra. This leads to our assumption that the contact electrification was initiated for the PANI thin film due to the delocalized electronic structure. Moreover, this form of PANI leads to some defects which may also generate the electron transfer. As both the PANI-1 and PANI-2 films are amorphous in nature, hence the crystallinity does not play any significant role to affect in electron transfer mechanism.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>UV-Vis spectra of the protonated form of PANI (PANI-1) and the more oxidised form of PANI (PANI-2).</p><p>Spectrum of PANI-1 shows two bands with λ<sub>max</sub> = 332 and 782 nm, which are assigned to the π-π<sup>*</sup> transition of the benzenoid rings and the excitation absorption of the quinoid rings, respectively.

The corresponding current peaks (blue in figure) can be observed for the particular stress period (~0.1 s), which has been applied to PANI surface by AFM probe. When the stress is released current sharply reduces to zero. We have controlled the contact electrification characteristic system for 10 consecutive repetitive landing of AFM probe on the polymer surface for different time spans. With each landing of AFM probe, the surface of contact is getting stretched and released accordingly and current outputs are recorded respectively. The probe sample contact area is typically less than 20 nm in radius, so switching can be highly localized, allowing charge transfer at the native domain to the metallic probe where no voltage is applied during mechanical switching. The typical electrical outputs were in average approximately 1.8 nA. Each and every localized hit by the AFM probe at the contact area generates current by initiating the electron transfer. This phenomenon of current generation through the application of stress on the polymer surface is part of mechano-electrical effect. The electrical outputs were also tested for the short period of the stress-hold-release states. During the stressed process, the average current output was about 3 nA for 5.5 nN applied force. Interestingly, observed current outputs in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(b)</xref> are intermittent in nature. A close look at the deflection of AFM probe (green slice in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(b)</xref>) indicates a sinusoidal drifting. Fluctuations of about 2 nm of wavelet amplitude in probe deflection during the contact between AFM probe and polymer surface has been observed. A probable explanation can be exerted to both, molecular vibration during electron tunneling at metal-polymer interface and the vibrations in local structure due to inter-molecular electron transition (HOMO to LUMO) within the polymer. These fluctuations in turn cause an effect on mechano-electrical process at the interface layer by nanoscopic resolution with discrete output of generating current spectra.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Exhibits successive performance of current output from the PANI surface for each contact with AFM probe under an applied force of 5.5 nN.

The pull-off (adhesion) force is measured as the minimum tension required to detach the tip from the sample surface.

In addition, as the applied probe force is constant throughout the mapping, AFM-determined adhesion behaviour of these polymeric materials may be due to the increased area of interaction between the tip and the probed surface, resulting from localized surface deformation of the polymer surface. First approach to the localized map of PANI surface sites had the objective of recording arrays of force curves in the <italic>x,y</italic> plane using a metal coated probe and measuring the corresponding current outputs. Typically, a 32 × 32 matrix was recorded throughout areas of 2 × 2 μm<sup>2</sup> in size. The measurements were conducted using a step pixel size of 40 nm. At each point, the current response was recorded as a function of the probe stress. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(c,d)</xref> depict the map of force experienced by the PANI surface with the corresponding stress-induced harvesting of current respectively. The stronger adhesion regions are displayed by the greenish colour where some of the areas are indicated by circles in blue (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(c)</xref>), that represent regions with higher stress. When the probe is close to the elevated face of the PANI surface, the contact area interacting with the tip increases which develops a stretching in the localized domain resulting in an enhancement in the measured force of adhesion. The presence of such features highlights the complementary nature of output current measurements. The mapping of corresponding regions also illustrates the high current regions in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(d)</xref> (some of the selected similar areas are indicated by blue circles). By similar reasoning, closely associated areas of low adhesion (reddish area in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(c)</xref>) may be attributed to the comparatively lesser stretching surface, that witnessed low current (in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(d)</xref>). It appears that the overall current output intensities of the surface of the PANI films are associated with the strength of surface adhesion, indicating stress-induced current harvesting nature of PANI thin films. These outcomes are in well agreement with the <italic>I-V</italic> measurements. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref> shows a systematic investigation on current outputs for incessant contact mode (~5 s) throughout different values of applied force. Different applied forces show different output currents, which is an indication of the tendency of current generated by the PANI surfaces to increase with a similar increase in the contact force triggered by the probe. The average of output current has been increased from 0.5 nA to 15 nA when the applied force was increased 2 nN to 14 nN. Additional data has been displayed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S2 of supplementary information</xref>.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The measured electrical response for typical three different contacting forces of 2, 8 and 14 nN.</p><p>Each applying force was conferring for 5 s.

In our indicative experiment, the first approach was to plough a 5 × 5 μm<sup>2</sup> area of a PANI thin film with an AFM probe in contact mode with different contacting forces. The experiment was performed while the back electrode (ITO) was grounded and the AFM probe was acting as the top electrode. During the scanning by AFM probe with particular contact force on the surface area of PANI, contact electrification mechanism has been developed, yielding of current which was recorded simultaneously through the metal-polymer-metal interface structure. The harvesting of current during the ploughing has been illustrated in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(a)</xref> (white arrow in the figure indicates the scanning direction). The contact force applied on the polymer surface during the ploughing was gradually increased in five steps from 0.5 nN to 7.4 nN along the scanning direction (<italic>i.e.</italic>, the scanning was started with lower contact force and increased gradually after each 1 μm step in the vertical direction). Profile of the corresponding image in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(b)</xref> exhibits an increment of the harvesting current with an increase of contact force. In pursuit of this stress-induced CEM towards the writing ability on this polymer surface, we have scanned the PANI thin film with a larger area (10 × 10 μm<sup>2</sup>) keeping the ploughed area within. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5(c)</xref> shows a clear change in current distribution throughout the scanned area which sprouts the ploughed area as readable stuff. This scanning image was taken just after <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(a)</xref>. The image reflects that the ploughed area yields scanty current harvesting (~0.5 nA) where the neighbour yields much more current (~1.8 nA). Both the ploughed and non-ploughed areas are showing a distinguished current distribution that can be employed as a data recorder. The phenomenon can be explained by CEM. When the metal coated AFM probe was brought into contact with the PANI surface by specific contact force, the electrons bound on the amine (<inline-formula id="IEq2"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep19514_IEq2_HTML.gif"/></inline-formula>), getting sufficient energy to transfer to the metal through polymer-metal interface layer, thus harvesting current without any applied voltage. The equilibrium in Fermi level energy at the interface and thermal agitation due to localized stress may also attribute to the notion. Now, if an electron is removed (transfer) from the PANI surface at the localized interface position (metal-polymer), the scarcity of charges (electron) will create an electric field in the space between the polymer surface and the metal electrode, which may have impeded further carrier tunneling at the metal-polymer interface. Consequently, the factor of current harvesting at the ploughed area will be diminishing in nature. With time the scarcity of these charges at the ploughed area will be filling up by several ways: (a) the backflow resulting from the redistribution of charges due to the conjunction carrier transportation within conducting polymer, (b) back-charge transfer from metal to polymer layer or (c) intra-charge transfer within the polymer from HOMO to LUMO. Distribution of electrical outputs in the ploughed area is also affected by the strain. From the profile of the same cross section of <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(b)</xref> as shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(e)</xref> (curve in pink colour), a well-like distribution of electrical outputs was observed. The explicit steps of electrical outputs have been displayed at extent of ploughed (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub>) and non-ploughed (<italic>I</italic><sub><italic>np</italic></sub>) area. We can term this electrical output ratio as <inline-formula id="IEq3"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep19514_IEq3_HTML.gif"/></inline-formula> applied over the steps. Stress from lower to higher (indicated by S<sub>L</sub> and S<sub>H</sub> respectively in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(e)</xref>), <italic>δI</italic> of 3.3 and 6.8 were experimentally measured. The electrical output distribution over the same area has been recorded after 4 h, shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(d)</xref>. Corresponding profile analysis shows <italic>δI</italic> of 1.0 and 2.9 respectively from lower to higher applied strain (blue in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(e)</xref>). The time dependent comparison of two profiles indicates that the current harvesting from the ploughed area is both stress and time dependent. Taking this into account, here we have proposed a conceptually new design of stress-induced electrically controllable polyaniline based self-powered data sheet, where writable and readable data has been recorded by controlling the current harvesting from the polymer surface through a stress dependent CEM.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Exhibits an accumulation of currents from the PANI-1 surface while ploughing by AFM probe in contact mode.

Time evolutional current distribution (TECD) after recording in four different areas (1 ×1 μm<sup>2</sup>) with different stresses has been shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. TECD has been visualized for t = 0 to 4 h, with interval of 1 h. Each TECD figure has its corresponding topographical image at the bottom. From the recorded scanning image it has been displayed that there is no topographical alteration with time changing form t = 0 to 4 h. This suggests that the polymer surface topography has not been distorted during the contact electrification mechanism and therefore can be inferred that the entire mechanism is related with the electronic dynamics within the polymer and polymer-metal interface barrier. In <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, the TECD image elucidates that each area is individualized by the current distribution disintegration between ploughed and non-ploughed areas. Regions of red (in colour) in TECD images indicate lesser current distribution, alluding different information which has been recorded through CEM with the AFM probe by applying different forces.

Recorded data on the polyaniline surface has been differentiated by the applied force during contact electrification. As the surface itself harvests energy, it can be claimed that the system behaves as a self-powered nanoscopic writable-readable device. TECD study shows the response of readability of the recorded data with time. These results not only underscore the importance of stress-induced patterning of polymer surface, but also the way out to scale up the self-powered device. All the measurements have been reported by exerting <italic>in-situ</italic> method to quantitatively characterize the contact electrification at nanoscale on polymer surface via a combination of AFM and conductive AFM in contact mode. We have systematically investigated the <italic>in-situ</italic> charge transfer through metal-polymer interface, the efficiency of current harvesting with respect to applied stress on the polymer by AFM probe, charge mobilization and scarcity from time evolutional multi-scanning.
