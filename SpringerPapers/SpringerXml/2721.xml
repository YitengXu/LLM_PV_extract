This facilitates the direct reaction of carbon in carbon-saturated aluminum with alumina under dispersed-contact high-intensity conditions. A conceptual design for one million tonnes per annum (1 Mtpa) aluminum production from Bayer alumina is developed. Freestanding graphite reactors and an ancillary plant encapsulated by inert gas are totally unconstrained within refractory-lined shells. Electrical conductive heating and melt circulation in closed loops, employing a 10 vol pct dispersion of fine carbon particles in aluminum (slurry), transports sensible heat to a single pressurized metal-producing reactor (MPR) to satisfy the endothermicity. In the proposed plant, an MPR at 0.28 MPa (2.8 bar) and 2433 K (2160 °C) with a hearth 2-m-wide × 190-m-long leads the melt <italic>via</italic> a barometric leg back to essentially atmospheric pressure, for further in-line processing. The impeller-stirred assimilation of fine carbon particles is followed by multistage gas-lift pumping to provide a 5.4-m total head, as required by two parallel straight-line melt-conductive heaters 1 m in diameter × 226 m in length. Overall energy-consumption figures 28.7 pct lower than today’s more recently installed Hall–Heroult electrolytic plants are predicted, with 51.3 pct less purchased electricity, supplemented with 1.10 times the stoichiometric elemental carbon.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Lower Heating Value</kwd><kwd>Mtpa</kwd><kwd>Pipe Heater</kwd><kwd>Candle Filter</kwd><kwd>Fine Carbon Particle</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>THE MINERALS, METALS &amp;

As an alternative to the Hall–Heroult process, carbothermic offers potential energy cost and environmental advantages, if solutions to critical technical problems identified by previous research, could be developed.” The key issues are listed as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>efficient delivery of energy to attain 2000 °C to 2200 °C;</p></list-item><list-item><p>recovery of mass and energy values associated with volatile aluminum-containing species;</p></list-item><list-item><p>effective decarbonization of the Al-C metal phase; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>recovery of energy values in the byproduct CO, to reduce net energy consumption.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The challenges identified by Bruno listed here are accepted and potentially viable solutions proposed and rigorously evaluated. However, there is total rejection of the conclusion drawn by Welch,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] who claims that “...carbothermic processing on an energy analysis is extremely poor.” On the other hand, a new approach is definitely called for and, in this regard, the strongly held view is that what is needed is an evaluation of how conductive heating and melt circulation can be mustered to provide the framework for overcoming the critical technical issues.</p><p>By operating above atmospheric pressure, the adverse energy implications associated with the concurrent evolution of aluminous vapors (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(<italic>g</italic>)</sub>, Al<sub>(<italic>g</italic>)</sub>) can be reduced to manageable proportions. This suggests that operating a pressurized reactor containing a homogeneous single-liquid phase of carbon-saturated aluminum fed with preheated alumina is a technically feasible option, whereas at atmospheric pressure, the losses would be totally unacceptable. Modern iron blast furnaces operate at top pressures as high as 3.2 atmospheres absolute (3.24 bar).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] On the other hand, avoidance of excessively high temperatures is thermodynamically favored by lower pressures. Accordingly, after assessment of a range of operating pressures, 2.8 bar was selected as a compromise between the evolution of volatile species and the upper temperature limitations.</p><p>Certain simple design precepts related to melt-circulation systems in general need to be enunciated, as compliance with these is absolutely essential for the new technology about to be explored.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>All parts of a melt-circulation loop or circuit need to be capable of being heated to the melting point, to facilitate startup and, indeed, restarting after a prolonged shutdown. If electrical conductive heating (<italic>i.e.</italic>, direct-resistance heating) is envisaged in the process under steady-state operation, it is necessary to ensure that sufficient energy can be provided to all parts of the melt-circulation loop to stop the melt from freezing in the event of a temporary shutdown.</p></list-item><list-item><p>For longer-term shutdown, the melt within the loop must be removed before freezeup, to prevent damage to the melt-containment structural components on remelting. The corollary to this is that the holdup of melt within an operating loop must be kept as small as possible, consistent with the essential process-engineering requirements.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Melt circulation is proposed as the key to lower-energy aluminum production. It opens up the potential for truly continuous processing with minimal labor intensity and without the adverse environmental issues associated with the existing Hall–Heroult technology. There are neither fluoride emissions, anode baking emissions, nor problems associated with spent pot-lining disposal. All the endothermic requirements for producing aluminum are provided by conductive heating in external pipe melt-circulation loops carrying large alternating currents. The metal-producing reactor (MPR) and in-line ancillaries have independent electrical circuits designed to ensure adequate conductive heat input, to prevent freezeup in the event of departure from normal steady-state continuous operation.</p><p>The reaction zone within the MPR and associated downsteam in-line units operate at a maximum temperature of 2160 °C. However, within the external pipe melt-circulation loops, the temperature reaches 2200 °C. These figures need to be viewed in relation to the mechanical strength of industrial-grade synthetic graphites. Above a temperature of about 2400 °C, there is a dramatic reduction in graphite strength, and excessive thermal creep sets in. Up to this temperature, the strength of graphite increases markedly above room-temperature values, as the temperature is progressively increased. Because of the anticipated, very extensive backmixing within the MPR reaction zone, the operating temperature effectively drops immediately to the exit temperature, which by design is set at 2160 °C. Downstream from the circulating carbon-saturated Al, the temperature continues to fall toward the region in which carbon saturation is replaced by Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> saturation, a condition that must not be allowed to occur. The relevant part of the phase diagram, according to Qui <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] shows the lower temperature limit as 2160 °C. A slightly lower temperature of 2156 °C is given by Olden and McClune.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] It is essential to have the melt-circulation rate high enough to accommodate this critical requirement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Process Description</title><p>To overcome the inevitable attack of high-temperature alumina slag on graphite, conditions must be selected in which only a carbon-saturated metallic aluminum melt is thermodynamically stable. To achieve this objective, operation at a 2.8-bar total pressure (0.28 MPa) requires a reactor temperature of at least 2160 °C (2433 K). Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref> reproduces the HSC4[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] evaluation of the chemical equilibria for this case. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> is the corresponding HSC4 equilibrium diagram showing that Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> melts containing Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> are not stable under the conditions selected. The input raw materials are Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 1.514 mol, C 245 mol dissolved in aluminum, and free C 248 mol dispersed in carbon-saturated aluminum. These input data are those for a melt-circulation system containing carbon-saturated aluminum with about 10 vol pct dispersed carbon particles; these are typical of a circulating melt entering the MPR at just under 2200 °C and, due to extensive backmixing, dropping almost immediately to the uniform reaction temperature of 2160 °C. This temperature drop takes into account not only the sensible heat transferred but also the chemical regular-solution thermal consequences of the melt-saturation carbon content dropping from saturation at 2200 °C to saturation at 2160 °C. The solid feed in this example is preheated to 1950 °C, and, although the basis for the evaluation is the steady-state formation of 2 mol Al from 1 mol new calcined Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> in the feed, the actual input to the reaction zone evaluated is 1.514 mol Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which reflects the sum of the new feed Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> plus that reverted <italic>via</italic> the chemical reactions occurring in the quench zone involving Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(<italic>g</italic>)</sub> and Al<sub>(<italic>g</italic>)</sub> with CO<sub>(<italic>g</italic>)</sub> as the temperature decreases.

conductive heating in the external melt-circulation loops includes not only the increase in the sensible heat but also that associated with the additional carbon dissolving in the melt to maintain saturation as the temperature increases up to just below 2200 °C. Again, thermodynamic regular-solution behavior can be assumed, but, of course, this heat of solution added to the melt in the pipe heaters is returned to the system when the circulating slurry enters the MPR. Thus, the heat-of-solution effect decreases the actual maximum temperature of the melt required in the external pipe heaters. In other words, without the beneficial effect of the heat of solution and a total reliance on sensible heat, supplying the endothermicity would require a greater temperature differential, Δ<italic>T</italic>. This means that, rather than a Δ<italic>T</italic> of 50 °C being required on sensible heat grounds alone, a Δ<italic>T</italic> of approximately 40 °C is adequate.</p><p>The HSC evaluation shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref> gives the endothermicity of the chemical reactions taking place in the reaction zone as being 2047 kJ. Downstream from the chemical reaction zone, further thermal demands have to be added to this figure when evaluating total energy requirements. These are the following: (1) within the decomposer sump, Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> coated pellets are returned to the melt at 2050 °C and the graphite pellets are subsequently removed at 2160 °C, which consumes about 64.8 kJ/2 mol Al; and (2) the addition of fine carbon particles preheated to 2000 °C, which are further heated to 2160 °C by the melt with a thermal demand of 12.0 kJ/2 mol Al. These additional thermal loads must be added to the chemical reaction endothermicity of 2047 kJ shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref>, to give a total demand of 2124 kJ/2 mol Al.</p><p>In fully backmixed reactor systems, such as those discussed by the author for the coproduction of steel and titanium in melt-circulation loops of “swimming-pool” dimensions,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] it is feasible to conduct very-high-temperature processes close to thermodynamic equilibrium such that the melt phases involved can be contained within unmelted shells of material of the solidus composition, to provide permanent linings, which can be replenished at will, with minimal disruption to operation. Clearly, this approach is not an option for melts comprised of aluminum, which has a melting point of 660 °C.</p><p>The carbothermic reduction of alumina thus requires the introduction of a totally new approach. It recognizes that graphite/carbon reactors can be based reliably on simple kinetic factors at very high temperatures, where transport phenomena are all important. The stability of the graphite/carbon containment in contact with near-to-carbon-saturated aluminum melts is ensured by providing a very much more favorable diffusion-controlled alternative to graphite/carbon wall dissolution. This guarantees an operation very close to carbon saturation without ever putting the wall at risk, and is readily available to turbulent melt-circulation systems. The melt being circulated is no longer a single-liquid phase but rather a homogenous two-phase solid/liquid system or slurry in which the dispersed solid particles, graphite or carbon in the liquid aluminum case, remain in suspension throughout the reaction system. The concentration and particle size of the dispersed solid are vitally important, and it is essential that the relative rates of dissolution of particles to wall material strongly favor particle dissolution, making attack on the wall virtually negligible.</p><p>El-Kaddah and Chang[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] evaluated the viscosity of high-volume-percentage dispersions (up to 18 vol pct) of silicon carbide fine particles (25 to 105 <italic>μ</italic>m, with an average of 50 <italic>μ</italic>m) in molten aluminum. Measured viscosities at 850 °C were well represented by Einstein’s theoretical equation. At 10 vol pct of dispersed particles, the relative viscosity increased to only about 1.3 times that of the pure liquid. Accordingly, the adoption of, for example, a 10 vol pct dispersion of fine carbon particles in liquid aluminum as the circulating melt is seen not to introduce any problems, in terms of flow characteristics or dispersion stability.</p><p>Alumina solid feed to the pressurized MPR is comprised of refined alumina such as “sandy” Bayer alumina (90 pct + 45 <italic>μ</italic>m) and reverted Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> recovered on cooling the MPR off-gas. There would appear to be strong parallels between the projected functioning of the MPR and a process for the gasification of coal in a liquid iron bath, as reported by Barin <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] The kinetics of the gasification process were investigated by analyzing and assessing the basic reactions for a bottom-blowing reactor. The bath turbulence induced by the injected gas and by the product gas results in the intense mixing and dispersion of the reactants and their intermediate products. The authors point out that these phenomena create extremely large mass-transfer areas and extend the retention time of the reactants in the liquid iron bath, resulting in high conversion rates relative to the volume of the reactor. The author reaches the same conclusion for the complex physical interactions pertaining to the MPR. The prevailing turbulence will cause liquid Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to be transported into the bulk liquid, facilitating the key metal-producing reaction between the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and the carbon dissolved in the liquid aluminum by Reaction [1]: <disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

This type of problem is well recognized in other high-temperature processes; one established method for dealing with it is to employ what are termed “fluid-wall” configurations. For example, Weimer <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] advocate that to combat deposition on reactor walls and plugging of the reactor leading to eventual shutdown of the process, the inside wall is at least partially fabricated with a porous refractory material through which a compatible fluid-wall gas is forced to flow inward. This provides a blanket of gas that prevents the deposition of particles on the inside wall.</p><p>In the present case, the reactor off-gas needs to be quenched from temperatures as high as 2160 °C down to around 1950 °C. This requires a substantial amount of quench gas to be forced through a porous wall and, thus, the adverse energy consumption associated with the required pressure drop to overcome friction. The undue energy consumption is exacerbated by the exothermicity of Reactions [2] and [3]. Accordingly, fluid-wall configurations are not tenable and a more direct methodology is required. The off-gas is forced to leave the reactor upward as a turbulent axisymmetric jet that entrains cooled quench gas in a chamber or plenum containing the lower-temperature quench gas. The refractory walls are well removed from the jet until the temperature is reduced by entrainment and sufficient residence time is given for the aerosol liquid particles to solidify and become nonsticky. The fundamental aspects for this approach are covered in the now classic work of Ricou and Spalding,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] who quantified entrainment by axisymmetric turbulent jets.</p><p>Attention has been drawn in patent literature[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] to problems associated with liquid aluminum contaminated with aluminum carbide (Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub>). It is stated: “...a primary difficulty in the carbothermic production of aluminum is caused by the substantial solubility of the carbon in the metal, about 20 atom % C, when the metallic melt is in equilibrium with solid carbon.” It is further stated: “...a severe practical difficulty arises in attempting to purify aluminum contaminated with Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> in significant amounts, because the mixture becomes non-pourable unless extremely high temperatures are maintained. Accordingly, aluminum scrap is added as solid coolant to reduce the temperature from above 2000 °C down to about 900 °C to 1000 °C.” By this treatment, it is claimed that Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> is precipitated and removed by filtration, decanted, or fluxed with a salt, to yield an aluminum metal product containing 5 wt pct or less Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub>. However, this level of residual Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> is unacceptable if a refined grade of aluminum metal product is desired. An alternative approach would be to begin overcoming the problem at its source, <italic>i.e.</italic>, while the molten aluminum is still at an extremely high temperature.</p><p>An analogous approach to a nickel carbonyl pellet decomposer is proposed for decarbonization of the melt. Carbon-saturated aluminum, if contacted with slightly cooler graphite pellets countercurrently as the continuous phase moving upward in a packed bed of pellets moving slowly downward with the melt, will deposit carbon initially on the pellets. Then Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> will be deposited as the aluminum melt is cooled to the temperature at which Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> becomes thermodynamically stable, provided homogeneous nucleation is avoided and heterogeneous diffusional growth is promoted. By the time the melt discharges from the top of the moving packed-bed reactor, a very-low-carbon aluminum product is assured.</p><p>Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> identifies the locations of the various gas and entrained solid streams listed in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">II</xref>, which have been the subject of HSC4 equilibrium calculations with energy and materials balances. The hot gas emerging from the MPR is A and the preheated solids comprised of calcined alumina and reverted Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, along with elemental carbon arising principally from reactions in the quench zone, is B. The streams B to D emerging from the cyclones with a relatively high content of solids, in comparison with the very dilute suspended solid/gas within the entrained contactors, are considered to be in thermal and chemical equilibrium with the cleaned gas leaving the cyclones E to G. The initial feed of calcined alumina is introduced at H <italic>via</italic> a screw feeder or similar device from a pressure-lock hopper system. Streams B to D flow opposed to the static pressure gradient and thus require the use of loop or siphon seals or similar devices. The exit gas G finally leaving the system goes to a heat-recovery steam generator (HRSG) before being filtered. Some of the gas is recycled for entrainment into the turbulent axisymmetric jets leaving the MPR. The balance of the gas proceeds to a shift reactor in advance of the combustor of a gas turbine for combined-cycle power generation, involving a second HRSG, probably based on supercritical steam generation, for addition to that from the other HRSG and elsewhere in the heat-recovery circuit.

As the sole energy input is conductive heating from hydro, nuclear, or geothermal power, all attention must be focused on the dissolution of graphite walls and hearths by molten carbon-containing aluminum. In theory, provided the overall system is fully backmixed and essentially isothermal in operation, carbon saturation is a realistic target.</p><p>However, to transmit sensible heat into the reactor, a finite temperature difference needs to be established between the liquid melt entering the external loops and that returning to the MPR. A temperature differential of 40 °C has been chosen in this article for a preliminary engineering evaluation before optimization studies are attempted. Clearly, the smaller this temperature difference is in practice, the less the risk is that carbon dissolution can threaten the nominally permanent graphite reactor containment structures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Protection of Graphite Pipe and Wall Surfaces</title><p>The use of fine carbon in addition to recirculated carbon particles, up to, for example, 0.05 mm in diameter, is believed to offer a reliable mechanism to secure virtually permanent graphite reactor walls.

In terms of the protection of carbon surfaces, the value 9.51 × 10<sup>−8</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s for the interdiffusivity is central to the evaluation. Therefore, detailed and transparent derivation is considered justified.</p><p>The strategy of circulating a dilute dispersion of fine carbon particles can be tested by evaluating the relative dissolution rate, which is the ratio of the carbon particle dissolution to the wall dissolution. For example, consider an ideal case in which a 10 vol pct C particle population is maintained at steady state such that a uniform particle size of 50 <italic>μ</italic>m is established. The plant conditions under assessment relate to two identical parallel melt-circulation loops, each one comprised of a single straight-line graphite pipe heater 1 m in internal diameter and 225 m in length, connected at both ends to the main production line of MPR, <italic>etc</italic>., as the nonheated melt return path for both loops. For a temperature differential of 40 °C (2200 °C to 2160 °C), the total estimated melt-circulation requirement is 9.50 m<sup>3</sup>/s, or 4.75 m<sup>3</sup>/s per external melt loop, giving a slurry velocity of 6.05 m/s and Re = 2.78 × 10<sup>7</sup>.

Disregarding the fact that the wall temperature will be very close to but nonetheless very slightly lower than that in the bulk of the melt, because of the heat-loss flux, the same value of ΔC is also applicable to the diffusion process involved in particle dissolution. Accordingly, the relative dissolution rate is given simply by Eq.

Dissolved carbon above the saturation level is freely available for the diffusive growth of particles within the backmixed reaction zone of the MPR. Also, very fine particles will disappear first in the melt-circulation loops as the temperature of the melt is gradually increased. A detailed mathematical model of the complex interactions involved would be required to establish the actual size distribution of the steady-state population of dispersed carbon particles under proposed operating conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Drawing Down and Dispersion of Fine Carbon Particles</title><p>The dispersion of very fine powder into molten metals is known to be difficult when the metal does not wet the powder. Kobashi <italic>et al.</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] for example, state that it is impossible to incorporate SiC particles into molten aluminum if the particle size is less than 0.1 <italic>μ</italic>m, whereas the dispersion of ultrafine ZrC was not a problem because of good wettability. However, wetting or nonwetting is only an issue for ultrafine particles. Clearly, steps must be taken so that nanosized carbon is in an agglomerated condition on initial admission to the melt circuit, with release back to discrete particles once the agglomerates have been drawn down into the turbulent flowing carbon-saturated aluminum.</p><p>A good example of how an analogous problem of dealing with nanosized particles has been overcome is to be found in the new technology for the plasma spraying of coatings derived from nanocrystalline powders (particles with grain sizes less than 100 nm). Nanostructured (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>–13 wt pct TiO<sub>2</sub>) powders with mean diameters of 50 and 70 nm, respectively, were blended by Goberman <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] to produce a powder mixture. The mixed powders were then “reconstituted” to form agglomerates (40 to 70 <italic>μ</italic>m). In other words, the outer diameters were increased 1000 times. The process of reconstitution involves the spray drying of a water slurry mixture and, in the work described by Goberman <italic>et al.</italic>, subsequent heat treatment.</p><p>More recently, Chang-sheng Zhai <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] have reported rheological studies on Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/nano-TiO<sub>2</sub> slurries and the characteristics of powders prepared by what they call “spray pelletization.” The slurry had the lowest viscosity when the contents of dispersant and binder were a mere 0.3 and 1.0 wt pct of the solids content. A centrifugal spray dryer conducted the reconstitution process with an inert gas inlet temperature of 320 °C and an outlet temperature of 110 °C to 120 °C. The spray pelletization of 60 wt pct solids slurry produced reconstituted agglomerates of spherical shape, typically about 60 <italic>μ</italic>m in diameter. It was stated that these were fit for the thermal spraying process without further heat treatment.</p><p>Sukawa and Iguchi[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] recently conducted water model experiments with poorly wetted 30- to 50-<italic>μ</italic>m particles. The particles were placed uniformly on a water surface and then drawn down with two different types of impellers under various conditions. The best results were obtained in a vessel with a centrally located impeller and one cylinder partly immersed near the wall of the mixing vessel acting as a baffle. Only particles with a single density of 40 kg/m<sup>3</sup> were studied. Intuitively, it seems obvious that such low-density fine particles are inherently more difficult to draw down into water than are similarly sized nonwetted particles of carbon being dispersed into carbon-saturated aluminum, where the density difference involved is considerably smaller. The experimental results by Sukawa and Iguchi with their 30- to 50-<italic>μ</italic>m-diameter particles are qualitatively very similar to earlier work with very much larger floating particles with a range of densities. This earlier work was conducted in vessels of a size much closer to that envisaged for the aluminum process.

Insofar as is possible, the fundamental foundations or proven commercial practice behind the design will be identified.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Pressurization Aspects</title><p>Pressurization, even to a relatively modest degree, dramatically reduces the plant footprint. The MPR pressure vessel and the pellet decomposer sump operate at 2.8 bar absolute. Barometric legs connect to other ancillary plants within the overall melt-circulation loop and are all at close-to-atmospheric pressure, including the two vitally important conductive-heating external pipe loops. This core assembly can be contained within a rectangle 16 × 265 m. For a three-phase-mains electricity supply, the ideal arrangement for phase balancing would clearly be three production lines in parallel, nominally occupying, for example, 50 × 265 m, to produce annually 3 Mtpa Al. A plan view for 1 Mtpa is given in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, which omits the ancillaries related to the gas quench, initial-preheating alumina and carbon, gas booster for the gas-quench recycle, and advanced power plant. Also excluded are the solids-storage and lock-hopper feeding systems. These latter components all comprise adaptations of current commercial practice.</p><p>The large pressure vessel 6.5 m in diameter and around 190 m in length shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> encases a graphite rectangular channel for producing 1 Mtpa Al. This size vessel is within the bounds of established commercial practice. Refractory brick-lined rotary kilns up to 7.6 m in diameter by 190 m in length are already in existence. Approximately ten years ago, a radiant syngas cooler (RSC) was transported from Italy to Florida to be the centerpiece in the Tampa Electric Polk Power Station integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) project. The trade literature gives its dimensions as 7.6 m in diameter by 42 m, and weighing 470 tons. The RSC pressure vessels operate at a 32-bar pressure and are of single-shell construction with refractory lining. Conditions within a RSC are arguably very much more aggressive than in any scenario likely to be met for the MPR.</p><p>In the time since the Polk County IGCC project, further parallel developments have taken place in pressurized fluidized bed combustion (PFBC) for power generation, necessitating pressure vessels, which dwarf the RSC referred to here. For example, the Karita PFBC project in Japan commissioned in the year 2000 has a pressure vessel 16 m in diameter × 52 m, operating at an 18-bar pressure. The norm for a PFBC is to contain the fluidized combustors freestanding within pressure vessels and to pressurize the gas space therein with air from the main air turbocompressor to exceed the pressure of the plant contained within the pressure vessel, so that external leakage cannot occur but, instead, an ingress of air takes place if a leakage develops.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Gas-Lift Pumping</title><p>Using gas-lift pumping, as outlined in many previous technical articles by the author, the forced circulation of carbon-saturated aluminum containing 10 vol pct of dispersed fine carbon particles does not introduce any special problems and should be relatively straightforward. All that is needed is the creation of a homogeneous two-phase zone of inert gas/aluminum melt within a compartment formed by an underflow weir across the channel and an overflow weir adjacent to it, both constructed of graphite and each spanning across the full width of the flow path. Pumping molten aluminum using graphite-submerged centrifugal pumps or by electromagnetic means is well established in both the primary and secondary aluminum industries, so this technology is immediately available for startup purposes, switching over to gas-lift pumping at higher temperatures once the whole system is completely charged with molten aluminum and functioning according to design.</p><p>An overall melt-circulation system employing four stages of gas lift pumping is shown schematically in the sectional elevation given in Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. Carbon or graphite blocks are used to fabricate a series of underflow and overflow weirs with connecting passages arranged in series to create a multistage gas-lift pumping system. Vertical graphite lances admit inert gas to the melt at the base of the two-phase gas/liquid region, through a sparger of high permeability or a similar arrangement involving numerous small-diameter holes connected to a central pipe running the length of the lance. The arrangement employs techniques developed for the assembly of column graphite electrodes for electric arc furnaces, to provide the length needed to satisfy the submergence requirements associated with gas-lift pumping in general. Normally, submergence twice the liquid head to be developed per stage is specified.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Sectional elevation of a four-stage gas-lift pumping arrangement</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11663_2008_9134_Fig5_HTML.gif" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p>The cross section in Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> shows a single lance in each of the four two-phase compartments or regions comprised of bubbles of inert gas flowing homogeneously with the melt slurry to effect density reduction. The head developed over the four stages as illustrated, for example, is the difference in height of the melt slurry at exit level minus that at inlet. Contingent upon laboratory testing, rows of lances in addition those shown in this cross section may need to be deployed to satisfy the endothermicity of the alumina reduction to metal with a predetermined drop in slurry melt temperature.</p><p>The whole of the assembly shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> must be free to move to accommodate thermal expansion, so the individual stages are effectively graphite structures freestanding on refractory foundations insulated by rigid graphite felt boards, to drop the temperature from around 2160 °C to at least 1800 °C and preferably to around 1650 °C to 1700 °C. To prevent oxidation of the graphite or carbon structures, the provision of a protective inert gas atmosphere is essential. Insulating refractory-lined shells (not shown) are used to limit the heat losses, but, since the maximum graphite temperature is safely below the recommended 2200 °C upper limit recommended for graphite rigid felt insulation, there is no necessity for implementing a controlled-heat-loss strategy. The gas pressure is preferably slightly above the atmospheric pressure, to preclude air infiltration into the inert protective gas contained within the shell enclosure or enclosures.</p><p>To progress with the conceptual design for 1 Mtpa Al, an estimate of the energy consumption for melt circulation is required, but, intuitively, because of the low frictional head and relatively low melt-circulation ratio, as defined by the melt-circulation rate divided by the volumetric rate of aluminum production, the energy requirement can reasonably be expected to be minimal. The volumetric flow per loop is 4.75 m<sup>3</sup>/s. There are two loops involved in the design, so the total flow is 9.50 m<sup>3</sup>/s, which corresponds to about 18,860 kg/s. The total frictional loss and velocity head losses are 5.4 m, so the theoretical work input required per second for gas-lift melt circulation is given by <italic>W</italic> = (18,860)(5.4)(9.81) = 999,090 J/s = 1.0 MW. This corresponds to about 0.08 pct of the total theoretical power input for the process.</p><p>The actual inert gas injection from the overhead lance system shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> can now be specified. When inert gas (probably argon) is injected into the homogeneous two-phase flow compartment, bubbles continue downward initially and heat is transferred very rapidly. Assume that dispersed gas is virtually at bath temperature by the time bubbles begin to rise and as “hydrostatic” pressure decreases. The dispersed gas effectively expands isothermally throughout most of the two-phase gas/liquid region. The theoretical energy input per unit mass of inert gas is thus given by <disp-formula id="Equ19"><label>19</label><alternatives><tex-math id="Equ19_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Such a material may not be porous enough for the candle filters prescribed for removing carbon particles from the carbon-saturated melt, but the pore size is suitable.

To this figure, the pressure for first infiltration must be added; it must also be born in mind that the exit static pressure of the filtered Al immediately on emergence from the filter medium must be at least equal to the first intrusion pressure.

Thus, the allowance for the overall pressure drop must be (0.92) + (1.88) = 2.8 MPa; accordingly, if the exit pressure from the filter medium must be greater than the pressure for first infiltration, the pressurization to be exerted by the compressed argon admitted to the unit  = (2.8 + 1.88) = 4.68 MPa. The static pressure of the molten aluminum leaving the candle filter unit assembly is still at 1.88 MPa, so release of this pressure to the required inlet pressure for melt into the pellet decomposer must be safely undertaken <italic>en route</italic> to the pellet decomposer.</p><p>Ideally, a virtually constant stream of carbon-saturated melt is forwarded to the base of the pellet decomposer. It is important to recognize that the carryover of fine particles is undesirable, because these will act as nuclei for subsequent solids deposition. Accordingly, it may be necessary to conductively heat the melt above the saturation temperature, as it proceeds to the pellet decomposer, downstream from the candle filter elements, so that a prescribed portion of any fines carryover is redissolved in the melt before entry into the decomposer.</p><p>At the base of the decomposer, substantial temperature gradients can be expected and, depending on the temperature of the external surface of the pellets, either carbon or Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> will plate out on the pellets.

For example, if 3-cm-diameter pellets are employed within a 1.5-m-diameter moving bed packed to a height of 3.5 m, the exit aluminum can be expected to contain no more than 10 ppm C. Similarly, using Reynold’s analogy and Eqs. [<xref rid="Equ22" ref-type="disp-formula">22</xref>] and [23], the required heat transfer by countercurrent contacting of the pellets with recirculated argon, for an approach temperature of 50 °C, can be obtained using a contactor 4.5 m in diameter packed to a height of 5 m, involving a pressure drop of 0.8 bar. In other words, if the pellets enter at 2160 °C, the argon leaves the top of the packed bed at about 2110 °C. This recirculated argon provides the means for preheating carbon make-up to 2000 °C <italic>via</italic> a relatively simple countercurrent contactor involving gas-phase-controlled indirect heat transfer through graphite heat-conducting walls into the fine carbon particles moving along in the reverse direction to the argon flow by means of a graphite screw conveyor.

Both approaches relate to the production of 1 Mtpa Al; both employ graphite hearth channels 2 m in width for transporting the slurry melt some 150 m for (1) and about 190 m for (2). In both cases, the refractory hearths are enclosed within refractory-lined pressure vessels maintaining an inert gas pressure slightly greater than 2.8 bar, with the total pressure within the MPR nominally 2.8 bar, to prevent the egress of aluminous vapor out into the refractory lining. In both configurations, the off-gas is first quenched by the entrainment of cooled quenched gas <italic>via</italic> perforated refractory enclosures to which is admitted the quench gas through inlet ports. Cooled quenched gas is recycled from the off-gas stream after sensible heat recovery and charge solids preheating duties, with the remainder proceeding to a shift reactor in advance of gas-turbine-based combined-cycle power generation.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison in sectional elevation of two alternative approaches for quenching hot gas from the MPR reaction zone</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11663_2008_9134_Fig9_HTML.gif" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p>In (1), the off-gas leaves the MPR reaction zone extending over most of the vessel initially as six round jets, each 1.46 m in diameter with a velocity of 20 m/s, whereas in (2) a single-slot jet 0.75 × 40 m in length discharges the entire off-gas at a velocity of 6.7 m/s into a gas-quench plenum. The Reynolds numbers <italic>N</italic><sub>Re</sub> for each are &gt; 2.5 × 10<sup>4</sup> and the off-gas is quenched from 2160 °C to 1955 °C. The entrainment length for each is about the same, because the mean hydraulic radius × 4 of the slot is almost the same as the diameter of the circular jet. For the single-slot jet, discharge takes place into a gas-quench plenum, which is a refractory-lined vessel of similar diameter to the MPR itself and extending for a length of greater than 40 m, so that the expanded jet is accommodated until it is quenched to 1955 °C, after which it flows into a header leading to an alumina preheating system. Clearly, if an entrained Venturi-type contactor coupled to an adjacent cyclone separator is used for both (1) and (2), the volumetric flow in (2) is 6 times larger; thus, for the same gas velocity of 5 m/s in the entrainment contactor, for example, the diameter has to be 2.45 times that of the multiple units employed with the round-jet alternative. The multiple units need to be about 5 m in diameter internally, which means the corresponding single-slot-jet equivalent requires a 12.25-m diameter. In (1), the partially heated calcined alumina is admitted into the quench jet at the level corresponding to the location at which its temperature has dropped to 1955 °C by a downcomer from the preceding cyclone separator, and heat recovery begins immediately. There are many interactions involving complex issues to be resolved in making a firm choice between (1) and (2); thus, for the present purpose, both are viewed as equally acceptable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Pipe Conductive Heaters</title><p>A very significant issue to be solved for the carbothermic production of aluminum, according to Bruno,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] is how to deliver energy efficiently enough to attain temperatures of 2000 °C to 2200 °C. In this article, the reaction zone, at 2160 °C, is within this range, but elsewhere within the pipe conductive heaters, it is assumed that a maximum temperature of 2200 °C can be tolerated. This latter temperature can, of course, be reduced at the expense of an increased melt-circulation rate, as it has already been shown that the melt-circulation energy requirement is of minor significance in comparison to the endothermicity of the chemical reactions involved.</p><p>The design now being proposed reflects the sizes of graphite commercially available from UCAR (now Graftech) and the material currently posted on the Internet by the SGL Carbon Group concerning the use of rigid graphite felts for the thermal insulation of high-temperature furnaces. It is noted in particular that Sigratherm RFA rigid felt composite is stable under inert atmospheres up to 3000 °C, but above 2200 °C, its physical properties will change, <italic>i.e.</italic>, the thermal conductivity will increase and the material will shrink. This upper temperature limit of 2200 °C is, therefore, taken very seriously, and the design offered is, in fact, dominated by this upper temperature limit.</p><p>The proposed means for assembling the graphite external pipe heaters for conductively heating the circulating melt slurry is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>. This employs a series connection of individual graphite modules, which are joined together, one after the other, to form a conduit for the circulation of the melt external to the MPR. The technology developed for the construction of columns of large graphite electrodes (up to 800 mm in diameter × 2800 mm in length) for electric arc furnaces, which are assembled into columns (usually three to a column), can be adapted to joining the individual modules to each other, analogous to the tapered sockets and double-tapered machine-threaded nipple arrangement used in electrode column assembly. Although a relatively small fraction of the total electric current flows through the graphite wall of the module, in comparison to the major current flow in the melt slurry, which is mainly within the so-called “penetration depth” associated with alternating current (AC), it is still important for the stability of the operation that the electrical circuit integrity is preserved by appropriate graphite-jointing techniques.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Basic design in cross-sectional elevation of one of the modular units used in graphite pipe heaters</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11663_2008_9134_Fig10_HTML.gif" id="MO10"/></fig></p><p>Notwithstanding electric current aspects, the over-riding concern is to ensure that the joints are leakproof. For this, the adaptation of the joint sealing methods and materials currently used in aluminum electrolytic cells is clearly the basis for the preferred approach. Hollow cylinders of rigid graphite felt thermally insulate the conductively heated modules, but careful design is essential, so that the rigid felt composite made from graphite fibers and a carbon binder does not have electrical contact with the heater modules. For pipe heaters, which may be well in excess of 200 m in length, differential thermal expansion must be addressed from the outset. An arrangement of rail-track wheels is provided, to permit lateral movement along the straight length of the heater, which is transmitted to the metal pool/snorkel configuration to be introduced in Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>. The rigid graphite felt hollow cylinders are also provided with rollers or wheels or, alternatively, are skid mounted to simplify construction. The rail system clearly has to be supported on a secure refractory foundation, which is contiguous with the insulating firebrick, or perhaps with monolithic refractory material, which lines the containment vessel, running the length of the assembled pipe heater. This maintains the protective inert gas atmosphere at a predetermined pressure, normally close to atmospheric pressure. All components shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> are of graphite or carbon-fiber reinforced-graphite construction, except perhaps the rails, which, subject to experimental evaluation, may be fabricated from ceramic material.<fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig. 11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Graphite snorkel and melt-pool arrangement for accommodating differential thermal expansion between pipe heaters and central MPR processing units</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11663_2008_9134_Fig11_HTML.gif" id="MO11"/></fig></p><p>The components shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> are all installed asymmetrically within a refractory-lined shell, to permit access by personnel for inspection and maintenance along the full length of the pipe heaters.

With the heavy current input located at the center of both external straight-line arms, each about 226 m in length, in effect, the conductive heating takes place in four identical resistors or four so-called “pipe heaters,” each contributing one quarter of the electrical load to satisfy the endothermicity of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> reduction to Al. The MPR line is at earth potential during normal operation, and it is only during temporary shutdowns that independent low voltage/heavy current systems are applied locally within the circuit, to maintain the contained melt above 2150 °C, to prevent Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> formation.</p><p>For electric circuit calculations, each pipe heater is 113 m in length, with an inside diameter of 1 m. The total thermal load in the MPR for the proposed operating conditions is detailed in the HSC4 equilibrium calculations shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref>. For the production of 2-mol Al, the reaction enthalpy is shown to be 2124 kJ, assuming 100 pct recovery. For 1 Mtpa Al (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 1.174 kmol/s), an electrical power input of 2171 × 1.174/2.0 = 1246.8 MW, in the absence of any heat losses.

Since the estimated power input required per pipe heater is about 312 MW, the amperage required is nominally about 881 kA.</p><p>Thermal expansion must be taken into account for pipe loops installed initially at ambient temperature and then experiencing temperatures up to 2200 °C in steady-state operation. It is suggested that overall and differential changes in length may be accommodated using sumps containing the melt into which there are immersed pipe inlets or “snorkels” with the freedom to move in all directions, with adequate clearance of melt around them. The system illustrated in Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> permits the differential thermal expansion in excess of 2 m to be accommodated by movement in a melt pool just after the gas-lift pumping arrangement. The floating end for expansion provision is rather like a conventional siphon, requiring a reduced pressure to be applied to initiate flow to or from the pool of liquid metal. The graphite pipe modules, which make up the flow conduits of the external pipe heaters, are joined to a graphite bridge, with the cross-sectional area for flow being gradually increased by a divergent channel (included an angle &lt;7 deg), in advance of three right-angled bends that permit a graphite snorkel to be immersed in a pool of the melt slurry. The arrangement shown is necessary in order to avoid unacceptably large head losses incurred for fluid flow through 90-deg short elbows. An arrangement similar to that shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> can be provided at both ends of the straight-line pipe heaters, where the flow through the assembled modules joins the mainstream common flow circuit of the MPR and ancillaries. The movement of snorkels in the melt pools takes up thermal expansion in the long, straight pipe heaters. The arrangement shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> is connected to the melt discharged from the gas-lift pumping system shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The final pumping stage discharges melt directly into the liquid pool. At the other end of the pipe heater, where the melt returns to the MPR, a barometric leg (not shown) from the pressurized MPR is connected to an analogous snorkel/melt pool system, again to take up thermal movement of the straight-line pipe heaters, one on each side of the MPR. With this arrangement, the centers of the straight-line pipe heaters are in fixed positions for electrical current introduction <italic>via</italic> hubs (not shown).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Heavy Current Distribution</title><p>Current distribution is based solely on an aluminum bus system with molten pure aluminum at one end of the current distribution launders at, for example, 700 °C, and by controlled heat removal to generate process steam, and with solid aluminum at the other end, cooled to around 300 °C. Conventional aluminum busbars are welded directly to the solidified Al in the launders and, thus, virtually eliminate contact resistance altogether.</p><p>To prevent the passage of carbon-saturated melt by convection and to counter the molecular diffusion of carbon back into the hub and the subsequent accumulation of precipitated Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> in the cooler regions, leading to blockage and the serious restriction of current flow, a very small flow of aluminum must be established in the reverse direction. This can be achieved by melting scrap in the hub or, alternatively, by using existing electromagnetic or submerged centrifugal pump technology to return a small “reflux” of the molten aluminum product to the hub. In both cases, to protect the graphite lining of the very short launder connecting the hub to the principal melt circulation, it will be necessary to incorporate some fine carbon particles into the melt using a single impeller draw down. This is not to be seen as extra carbon consumption, but rather the diversion of a small fraction of the make-up carbon away from the principal addition region.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Saltation Velocity of Carbon Particles</title><p>For the horizontal transport of dispersed solids, the minimum fluid velocity for keeping all solid particles in suspension is referred to as the saltation velocity. If the melt-circulation velocity is reduced to the saltation velocity, the largest particles begin either to settle or to float out of the dispersed state. To a first approximation, the carbon particles can be expected to have a density of about 2150 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, whereas the density of carbon-saturated aluminum at 2160 °C is estimated to be 1978 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, in which case carbon particles will begin to sink to the bottom of a melt flowing in an open channel, such as the MPR, once the velocity is reduced below the saltation velocity.</p><p>The appropriated saltation velocity was evaluated using the empirical procedures outlined by Kunii and Levenspiel.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] With the MPR at a mean temperature of 2160 °C for spherical particles 50 <italic>μ</italic>m in diameter, the critical saltation velocity in a 6.35-cm-diameter pipe is a value of 0.0286 m/s, which corresponds to a velocity of 0.161 m/s for a channel with an equivalent hydraulic diameter of 4.8 m. This is based on the relationship given by Kunii and Levenspiel,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] in which the critical velocity is proportional to (diameter)<sup>0.4</sup>. It is assumed that the equivalent diameter (<italic>i.e.</italic>, 4 <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>h</italic></sub>) is applicable and that the dispersion of inert fine solid particles of carbon in carbon-saturated aluminum does not affect the Newtonian flow and physical properties of the melt. Furthermore, in the absence of a known particle-size distribution, only single-particle behavior was considered.</p><p>In the event of concern about the large particles dominating the particle-size distribution of the dispersed carbon particles, some location in the overall circuit would need to be designed such that the cross-sectional area of the melt channel is increased, to reduce the velocity down to the saltation velocity for carbon particles 50 <italic>μ</italic>m in diameter, for example, and then sufficient residence time provided at the lower velocity to permit the required number of the largest particles to settle out, to form a bottom layer or sludge. The sludge would be continuously thickened, possibly with mechanical assistance. An appropriate amount of solids in the sediment bed of the coarser particles would be withdrawn, in association with a predetermined amount of aluminum melt, probably corresponding to the product aluminum make. External milling of the larger carbon particles would be necessary in this scenario, before the equivalent mass of carbon in slurry form is returned to the melt circuit.</p><p>None of the actions in the preceding paragraph needs to be implemented, if, in fact, the actual or mathematically modeled particle-size distribution remains adequate for the protection of graphite surfaces. A decision on this, therefore, has to be deferred at this stage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>In-plant Power Generation</title><p>Let us now consider the recovery of energy from the byproduct CO in the cooled off-take gas from the MPR. It is customary in gasification and similar studies to assume that gas phase equilibria involving CO and CO<sub>2</sub> are frozen by the time gases are cooled to 1000 °C; therefore, the same basis has been used here. In theory, the cooled gas contains 98.1 vol pct CO and 1.9 vol pct CO<sub>2</sub> and, at first sight, may appear a premium fuel for combined-cycle gas-turbine (CCGT) power generation. The lower heating value (LHV) of CO is 283 kJ/mol compared with the LHV of hydrogen at 242 kJ/mol. However, combustion of CO is far from straightforward and is limited by serious kinetic constraints, which preclude comparison with H<sub>2</sub> and even dismiss altogether pure CO as a gas-turbine fuel unless it is mixed with H<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>On the other hand, many experts are continuing to predict that fuel cells will find widespread use in the conversion of chemical to electrical energy, as they offer very high efficiencies. The solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is the most relevant; notable in the present context is its ability to use essentially pure CO as a fuel[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and to directly produce CO<sub>2</sub> ready for immediate disposal without incurring the cost of a conventional oxygen plant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] However, further consideration of emerging SOFC technology relevant to carbothermic aluminum smelting is not pursued, because the impression must not be given that the proposed aluminum process is reliant on future SOFC developments. Therefore, a conventional approach to advanced power generation using well-established technology has been used to evaluate the in-house power generation for assessment of the total energy requirements.</p><p>From what has already been said, it is obvious that the process off-gas comprised principally of carbon monoxide has to be modified to incorporate H<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O or, in other words, shift-reaction chemistry has to be introduced into the flowsheet by equilibrating CO with superheated steam in a shift reactor, using a standard shift catalyst for this purpose. Advanced double-reheat steam-turbine power generation with steam conditions 320 bar/620 °C/620 °C/620 °C was selected, because high-chrome ferritic steels are superior on a cost basis to austenitic stainless steels, and the conditions chosen are approaching the current upper limit for ferritic steels. The design calculations were based on the component performance factors and reference plant conditions listed by Bannister <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] in their final report on hydrogen-fueled combustion-turbine power generation. These authors assumed HRSG operation at atmospheric pressure producing supercritical steam, 93 pct isentropic efficiency with 99.2 pct generator efficiency for turbomachinery with 0.6 pct bearing losses (percent of shaft power), pumps with 85 pct adiabatic efficiency, and 98 pct electric motor efficiency. Some of the key parameters are given in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">IV</xref> for the production of 1 Mtpa Al.

Whatever the primary aluminum process, carbon emissions are inevitable, so carbon capture and storage (CCS) must be considered in forward planning. It is inconceivable that CCS can be undertaken cost effectively on a small scale. Economies of scale are vital for the future of the primary aluminum industry; hence, the focus in this article has been on a nominal production of 1 Mtpa Al with an implied total of 3 Mtpa Al, if electric power phase balancing is an issue. Production facilities based on electric furnace technology using graphite electrodes and mini mills are clearly viable for secondary aluminum, but climate change and global warming probably negates such an approach for the primary industry.</p><p>Throughout the conceptual design, it has been assumed that the creep of graphite structural components is not an overwhelming issue at the selected operating temperatures. The proposed maximum has been set at 2200 °C, which is reached just before the circulating melt discharges from the external graphite-lined pipe heaters immediately prior to entry into the backmixed MPR reactor, where the temperature drops effectively to 2160 °C throughout. The temperature then falls to around 2158 °C within the gas-lift multistage pumping system before being readmitted to the external graphite pipe heaters. By increasing the melt-circulation rate, the 2200 °C figure can be reduced at the expense of increased energy consumption. For example, increasing the melt flow by a factor of 2 would drop the maximum temperature to 2180 °C while maintaining the MPR temperature at 2160 °C.</p><p>The practicality of the conceptual design depends critically on the ability to physically contain the melt at the very high temperatures involved without mechanical failure or leakage. Thermal expansion issues must also be addressed from the outset. Perhaps in certain areas, it may be necessary to accept a degree of leakage with graphite runoff channels provided in association with barometric legs, to return the melt to strategically located atmospheric sumps at essentially atmospheric pressure with protective atmosphere provision. These runoff channels would need to be independently conductively heated to ensure essentially isothermal operation, in order to prevent solids deposition and subsequent blockage.</p><p>In comparing the total energy requirements for various processes, Kellogg[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] introduced the concept of the process fuel equivalent (PFE). With the availability of nuclear, hydro, or geothermal power, the evaluation of PFE is simply the addition of electrical input plus the LHV of the fuel used directly in the process. If, however, fuel is combusted to generate electricity, the inherent cycle thermodynamic limitations must be taken into account; this requires assessment of the net energy conversion efficiency as well as transmission losses, if combustion occurs in a power station some distance from the metallurgical process.</p><p>According to Welch,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] in the 1980s, a number of articles were published on the Hall–Heroult process, claiming achieved energy-consumption figures less than 12.5 kWh/kg Al; since then, however, the emphasis has been on a shift to high-amperage technologies that are less energy efficient but more cost effective. For example, 400 kA cells were introduced in Russia in January, 2006, with current efficiency expected to exceed 94 pct and power consumption less than 13.8 kWh/kg Al.</p><p>The expansion of the traditional Hall–Heroult process, stemming from the diversification away from oil resources in certain Gulf countries in favor of the greater use of natural gas for aluminum production, in particular, has surged and is ongoing. For example, aluminum production at a single site has reached 840,000 tpa, using the world’s longest potline (1.2 km in length), employing some 336 cells. Also, in April, 2007, it was announced that an integrated “mine-to-metal” aluminum project, including bauxite mining, alumina refining, power generation, and aluminum smelting, was being planned for the region. The ultimate scale of this project is stated to be 2 Mtpa Al. Assuming that electricity is generated by state-of-the-art 1500 °C-Class gas turbines with a net efficiency of 60 pct, the electrolysis energy consumption is 13.8 kWh per kg aluminum, and the overall carbon consumption is 453 kg per ton aluminum, as derived from figures given by Bruno,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] the PFE for these projected Hall–Heroult potlines in going from refined Bayer alumina to aluminum metal is 97.65 MJ per kg Al. However, the availability of nuclear, hydro, or geothermal power for the Hall–Heroult process offers lower energy consumption for processing Bayer alumina to primary aluminum metal with a minimum PFE value of 64.53 MJ/kg Al, using the same electricity and carbon consumption as described here, but excluding any ancillary power requirements.</p><p>At the present time, Russia has the two largest hydroelectric-based plants with annual outputs in 2006 of 984,000 and 948,000 tons of primary aluminum. In October 2007, it was announced that the world’s biggest aluminum smelter with a capacity of 1.05 million tons per year may be built in Russia’s Saratov region, complete with two nuclear reactors for the power required.</p><p>In the longer term, to combat global warming, a hydrogen economy may be deemed necessary, in which hydrogen is used for transport and other purposes requiring mobility, while large stationary industrial plants continue to use fossil and biomass fuel in association with carbon dioxide CCS. Some experts foresee that decarbonization of natural gas as the best way forward for the production of hydrogen, in which case elemental carbon (carbon black) would become available at prices competitive with other sources of energy. Under these conditions, the carbothermic production of aluminum would have clear advantages over other technologies. The CCS would probably be mandatory in this scenario and economies of scale would be needed to offset the additional costs involved.</p><p>At first sight, because of concerns about climate change and global warming, it may seem inappropriate to be promoting carbon-based technology at the present time. But a more detailed appraisal in light of the rapidly advancing progress in carbon dioxide CCS worldwide, together with a possible move toward a hydrogen economy in the longer term, highlights the benefits of the newly proposed aluminum technology and puts the matter in a somewhat different perspective. The over-riding factors in the longer term are sustainability and economic viability. Clearly, carbon can be biomass based and, thus, carbon neutral. Also, accelerating developments in solar-energy-based methane (natural gas) thermal decomposition to produce hydrogen and elemental carbon (carbon black) as a byproduct could have a substantial beneficial effect on the primary aluminum industry.</p><p>There is, of course, a trade-off between electricity and carbon as the energy source used, but if low-cost carbon is available, savings in electricity consumption must be of paramount importance. The new technology outlined in this article requires an input of electricity from external sources of 6.72 kWh/kg Al. In comparison with the 13.8 kWh/kg Al for the 400 kA cell technology, this represents a saving of 51.3 pct.</p><p>The electrolytic route still has to contend with greenhouse gas emissions and, because of the nature of the Hall–Heroult process, the CCS for this is not going to be straightforward. In contrast, the higher-temperature carbothermic route initially produces CO, as opposed to CO<sub>2</sub> in Hall–Heroult. The total carbon consumption for Hall–Heroult is in the region of 0.45 kg/kg Al, whereas the new carbon input for the carbothermic route under discussion is about 0.67 kg/kg Al. However, this increased carbon input is more than compensated for by the fact that the CCS for the new technology is expected to be considerably more straightforward. In particular, having liquid CO<sub>2</sub> ready for immediate disposal underground is potentially within reach without a major energy penalty, when starting from virtually pure CO, as promised by the SOFC technology[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] now in an advanced stage of development.</p><p>Hall–Heroult has environmental problems arising from the anode effect in relation to formation of perfluorocarbons, as pointed out by Bruno.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] The estimated greenhouse equivalent CO<sub>2</sub> emission due to this phenomenon is 2.20 kg CO<sub>2</sub>/kg Al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] This brings an equivalent carbon emission of 0.6 kg C, making the total 1.05 kg C/kg Al, which is then larger than the estimated value of 0.67 kg C/kg Al for the proposed carbothermic process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The new approach is focused on an aluminum MPR system, in which aluminum oxide reacts directly with molten carbon-saturated aluminum under highly intensive dispersed-contact conditions such that aluminum carbide (Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub>) is thermodynamically unstable as an intermediate. The oxide and dissolved carbon in the liquid aluminum react directly together to produce aluminum metal and carbon monoxide gas at temperatures typically in the region of 2160 °C at 2.8 bar absolute pressure. For closed-loop melt circulation, provided the temperature and pressure is selected so that melts of Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> cannot form, carbon or graphite structures can be used indefinitely with an appropriate protective melt-circulation medium. Stable slurries of fine carbon particles dispersed in carbon-saturated aluminum fulfill this essential requirement.</p><p>There are no major difficulties in feeding fine carbon into the melt and for particles 20 to 30 <italic>μ</italic>m or so in diameter. Nonwetting is not an issue for particles of this size. Impeller-assisted incorporation of fine carbon particles into the circulating melt requires very little energy input in comparison to the endothermicity of the smelting reduction reaction itself. If differential expansion is adequately provided for and the maximum temperature is no more than 2200 °C, melt circulation in two closed loops of graphite pipe 1 m in diameter does not present any identifiable demanding practical problems. The pipes need to be fully supported, but with complete freedom to expand longitudinally. The friction head of less than 5 m can be overcome readily by four in-line stages of simple gas-lift pumping, again with minimal energy input.</p><p>Except in the pellet decomposer, where the aluminum product melt is cooled, the whole circuit must be maintained above 2150 °C to 2160 °C, to prevent Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> formation; issues related to the formation of Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> elsewhere are theoretically irrelevant. The nickel industry has reliable pellet decomposers in which nickel carbonyl in the fluid phase is decomposed to nickel on recirculated nickel pellets acting as heat transfer media. By analogy, Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>3</sub> deposition on recirculated carbon or graphite spherical pellets acting as heat-transfer media under transport-controlled conditions can be rigorously quantified and shown to be a viable solution to the carbide problem normally associated with carbothermic aluminum production as well as potentially delivering a final aluminum product with an extremely low carbon content and significant energy savings.</p><p>Carbothermic reduction under a modest pressure of 2.8 bar absolute is sufficient to contain chemical energy losses associated with evolution of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(<italic>g</italic>)</sub> and Al<sub>(<italic>g</italic>)</sub> to acceptable proportions. Pressurization to 2.8 bar is limited to the principal metal-producing chemical reactor and its associated gas-quench system, but elsewhere, the incorporation of barometric legs in the flow circuit permits the system to be operated at essentially atmospheric pressure. To provide the driving force for the inert gas movement and the simplification of energy recovery aspects, an absolute pressure of 1.3 bar has been chosen, rather than atmospheric pressure.</p><p>There is no suggestion that the melt can be contained anywhere with a frozen ledge. The energy losses would be enormous. The whole melt-circulation circuit is saturated with carbon throughout, so graphite containment is the obvious solution. Very detailed consideration has been given to the strategy of using a slurry of dispersed carbon particles in carbon-saturated aluminum, to protect graphite surfaces from dissolution. No theoretical or practical impediment has been discovered. A 10 vol pct dispersion of fine carbon particles is put forward initially, but this clearly requires optimization. Saltation effects cannot be disregarded just because the flow is turbulent, so due regard is given to this phenomenon, to ensure stability throughout the almost horizontal melt-circulation loops.</p><p>The use of elemental carbon as the reductant in association with electrical conductive heating, based on the availability of nuclear, hydro, or geothermal power, yields a PFE of 48.22 MJ/kg Al for a MPR at 2.8 bar and 2160 °C, as detailed in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">V</xref>. This PFE is not burdened with the various energy-consumption terms associated with forming and baking anodes, cathode replacement, chemicals (electrolyte), and environmental control, which collectively add an estimated 3.15 MJ/kg Al to the figure of 64.53 MJ/kg Al already identified, making the total Hall–Heroult process 67.68 MJ/kg Al for 1380 kWh/kg cells. On these grounds, it would appear that there are potential overall energy savings in the proposed technology of 28.75 pct, in comparison to the higher-amperage, cost-effective potlines currently in vogue.
