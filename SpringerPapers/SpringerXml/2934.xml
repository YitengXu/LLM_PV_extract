We developed a novel sub-200 femtosecond time-resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopy scheme combined with potentiostatic control to study various solar cells in fully operational condition. We studied performance optimized devices based on liquid redox electrolytes and opaque TiO<sub>2</sub> films, as well as other morphologies, such as TiO<sub>2</sub> fibers and nanotubes. Charge injection from the Z907 dye in all TiO<sub>2</sub> morphologies was observed to take place in the sub-200 fs time scale. The kinetics of electron-hole back recombination has features in the picosecond to nanosecond time scale. This observation is significantly different from what was reported in the literature where the electron-hole back recombination for transparent films of small particles is generally accepted to occur on a longer time scale of microseconds. The kinetics of the ultrafast electron injection remained unchanged for voltages between +500 mV and –690 mV, where the injection yield eventually drops steeply. The primary charge separation in Y123 organic dye based devices was clearly slower occurring in two picoseconds and no kinetic component on the shorter femtosecond time scale was recorded.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep24465.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep24465" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep24465</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are promising candidates for solar energy conversion applications. These devices do not rely on rare or expensive materials, so they could be more cost-effective than cells based on silicon and thin-film technologies. Recently, DSCs device efficiency has reached a maximum power conversion efficiency of over 12% using donor- bridge - acceptor (D-π-A) zinc porphyrin dye in combination with a cobalt-based redox mediator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p>The performance of DSCs is based on kinetics competition between the electron injection from the sensitizer to an electron collecting material, usually TiO<sub>2</sub>, regeneration of the oxidized dye with redox electrolyte and unwanted back reactions of injected electrons recombining with oxidized dye molecules or oxidized species of redox electrolyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. A challenge in this field is that the kinetics of charge carriers may be altered in complete devices showing top performances. A deep understanding of many parameters controlling the overall performance is crucial for achieving improvements in performance. Despite numerous studies, there is still a debate on the electron injection time scale for the optimized solar cells and according to the proposed “kinetics redundancy”, the optimized solar cells might not have ultrafast electron injection kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Existing studies are mainly based on the classical pump-probe transient absorption spectroscopy, which is widely used to measure the kinetics of electron injection processes. Since optical transparency is required, to perform transient absorption studies, only model systems based on a transparent TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film sensitized with various dyes and semiconductors in different environments (solid samples or in solution) were investigated so far<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. It should, however, be noted that the most efficient liquid-based solar cell devices are not transparent. Indeed, these devices are based on a double layer of TiO<sub>2</sub> film, which contains a scattering layer made of 400 nm TiO<sub>2</sub> particles deposited on top of a mesoporous transparent layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The resulting light transmittance of the cell is less than 15% in the visible region and, hence, conventional transient absorption spectroscopy in transmission mode cannot be applied in this case. Despite the importance of the subject, the kinetics of electron injection in actual optimized, opaque dye-sensitized solar cell devices under working conditions has not so far been reported.</p><p>We aim here to investigate the dynamics of charge carriers directly in fully functional devices, using potential control and state-of-the-art pump-probe diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. Despite the great potential of the latter technique, only a few studies can be found in literature investigating its implementation and application. We aim to demonstrate that diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is of great value for time-resolved analysis of photophysical processes in opaque or highly absorbing materials. Time-resolved diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was first reported by Wilkinson <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> in microsecond time regime in 1981 followed by Bowman <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and Asahi <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The technique was utilized on scattering systems like powders of organic microcrystals and by Furube <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> on DSCs under open circuit condition. Here we have developed an ultrafast time-resolved pump-probe diffuse reflectance spectrometer with a sub-200 femtoseconds time-resolution. This required application of novel optical design for the collection of diffuse reflected light. In addition and for the first time, we combined the femtosecond time-resolved diffuse reflectance laser spectroscopy with potential control and photovoltage measurements.</p><p>Furthermore, the technique has enabled us to investigate the charge separation kinetics in DSCs based on photoanodes of other TiO<sub>2</sub> film morphologies. For example, we studied samples of anodized nanotubes on Ti foil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and nanostructured fibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. These samples have exhibited promising behavior in cell performance but are not optically transparent and are not suitable for investigation with pump-probe transmission based transient absorption technique.</p><p>Our studies reveal that the charge separation dynamics in Ru-based dye in the complete device is ultrafast and is indeed affected by the morphology of the TiO<sub>2</sub> film. We observed an early charge recombination in scattering TiO<sub>2</sub> particles, TiO<sub>2</sub> fibers and anodized TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes. These recombinations had different amplitudes and were not previously reported for small particles and are rationalized in terms of different electron mobility and trapping states in different TiO<sub>2</sub> films. Under an applied voltage bias condition from +500 mV up to –690 mV, the kinetics of the electron injection from the dye excited-state into the oxide remains ultrafast. However, the injection yield decreases at the bias point of –690 mV. In contrast to Ru-complex based dye, the organic D-π-A dye Y123 exhibited slower charge injection kinetics. The excited-state lifetime of Y123 dye is measured to be 50 ps. The time constant of the electron injection process is measured being 1.1 ps. While this classifies as ultrafast, it is about one order of magnitude slower than for Ru-based dyes, which was measured to have features in femtosecond time scale.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussions</title><p><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> shows the schematics of the standard optimized high-performance liquid solar cell. In the conventional DSC scheme, the mesoporous layer is made of 20 nm-diameter interconnected TiO<sub>2</sub> particles. Although this structure offers a large surface area for dye adsorption, Rayleigh scattering with this size of TiO<sub>2</sub> particles is small, resulting in high transparency of the dye-sensitized film in a broad spectral region. A significant amount of light (70% in the near infrared region) is transmitted without interacting with dye molecules in the cell. The working electrode applied in highly efficient devices is based on a TiO<sub>2</sub> double layer film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, sensitized with dye molecules on top of a TiCl<sub>4</sub>-treated conductive glass. The structure of these samples is shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>. The first layer is a transparent mesoporous anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> film, consisting of interconnected spherical nanoparticles (20 nm). Another layer made of 400 nm-diameter TiO<sub>2</sub> particles is deposited on top of the transparent layer. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1b</xref> shows the total transmittance, total reflectance and total absorptance of the Z907 dye-sensitized TiO<sub>2</sub> double layer film based DSC photoanode. The 400 nm particles act as light scattering centers enhancing light absorption by increasing the light pathway within the film. Consequently, the total transmittance of the cell in the visible and near-infrared region is less than 15% as it can be seen in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>. This suggests that the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is the only versatile optical laser spectroscopy technique capable of studying such devices. The Kubelka-Munk function, F(R) spectra is derived from diffuse reflectance of the film according to <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">equation (3)</xref>, presented in the method section. The F(R) spectrum is compared with the absorptance spectrum of the opaque photoanode in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>. As it is seen, the Kubelka-Munk spectrum follows the shape of the absorptance curve and the similarity in both spectra is observed. The peak around 520 nm corresponds to the Z907 dye ground state absorption that serves as an absorbing medium. The shoulder at 380 nm corresponds to the absorption of TiO<sub>2</sub> substrate that serves as the scattering media in Kubelka-Munk theory.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Device architecture and optical properties of complete photoanode.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the optimized highly efficient liquid DSC based on single layer and double layer TiO<sub>2</sub> films.

This is significantly smaller than the number of adsorbed dye molecules on the microscopic surface of TiO<sub>2</sub> film, within the irradiated area which is 9.8 × 10<sup>16</sup> (assuming one monolayer of adsorbed dye molecules).

Interestingly, these time constants are consistent with the kinetics fit values of measurements at 840 nm monitoring oxidized dye molecules. Taken together, the observed decay kinetics at 840 nm and the mirror kinetics at 1200 nm are due to an early back recombination of photo-injected electrons with the oxidized dye molecules anchored on the surface of TiO<sub>2</sub> particles.</p><p>Therefore, a significant observation in our measurements of the DSC devices based on scattering particles and all other TiO<sub>2</sub> morphologies (as it is discussed below), is that the kinetics of electron back recombination with oxidized dye molecule has features in the picosecond to nanosecond time scale. This observation is remarkably different to what is normally stated in the literature for model systems of transparent films made of small particles. The small particles based films are the only morphology that has been studied to date. In earlier studies of small TiO<sub>2</sub> particles sensitized with Ru dyes based on transient absorption spectroscopy at visible or NIR region or by 2D-IR spectroscopy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, such electron back recombination was not observed and the oxidized dye molecule was accepted to be stable until much longer time scale of microseconds. We observe that the kinetics is accelerated in full device relative to what is so far accepted for small particles. In a complementary study, presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>, the photovoltaic, optical and structural characteristics of the transparent and double layer based devices are depicted. The value of photocurrent normalized to the light absorptance of the scattering layer is about 30% less than that for transparent layer based device. This indicates that in big particles some fraction of photoelectrons are lost and is consistent with the early back recombination of electrons and oxidized dye molecules observed in laser spectroscopy measurements.</p><p>In addition, the pump-probe diffuse reflectance technique has also enabled us to investigate the electron injection profiles in many other DSC devices. These studies include measurements of different opaque nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> films such as TiO<sub>2</sub> nanofibers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes.

It is interesting that in all measurements the electron injection is still in the ultrafast regime and recombination features with different amplitudes comparable to that of double layer film is present.

The observed difference in early back recombination of photoelectrons in the TiO<sub>2</sub> films of nanoparticles and anodized nanotubes is rationalized in terms of morphological parameters of the two films such as trap state distribution.</p><p>We hypothesize that photo-injected electrons may get trapped in the TiO<sub>2</sub> particle surface states where they form geminate pairs with holes (oxidized dye molecules) and result in the observed early fast recombination in different TiO<sub>2</sub> morphologies with different amplitudes. It should be noted that, our control studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S3</xref>) shows that at low excitation intensities of 0.25 sun irradiance at AM1.5, the excited dyes inject more than 3.8 × 10<sup>16</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> electrons into the TiO<sub>2</sub>, which is much smaller than the trap state density (10<sup>18</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> to 10<sup>20</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>) reported for TiO<sub>2</sub> films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. One should also consider the energetic distribution of these traps. For instance, the trap state distribution in the anodized nanotubes is measured using macroscopic techniques like charge extraction experiments by Hagfeldt <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The nanotubular electrodes have a trap state distribution significantly different from nanoparticulate electrodes. Nanotubes possess relatively deeper traps with a characteristic energy of the exponential distribution more than twice than that of nanoparticulate electrodes. Throughout time-resolved terahertz studies, Schmuttenmaer <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> have claimed that the low mobility in polycrystalline TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes is not only due to scattering from grain boundaries or disorders as is in other nanomaterials but instead results from a single sharp resonance from exciton-like trap states. These observations are in good agreement with our spectroscopy studies. Indeed, electrons can get more localized in energetically deeper traps in nanotubes films and, therefore, less early back recombination with oxidized dye molecule is observed in these films in comparison with nanoparticles based films.</p><p>Our observations show direct evidence of an ultrafast electron injection occurring in a complete Ru-dye based DSC device. This has not been confirmed so far for DSCs having all components like scattering layer, electrolyte, conductive glass, etc. Charge injection from the amphiphilic Ru<sup>II</sup>(bipyridyl) Z907 dye in all different TiO<sub>2</sub> morphologies was observed to take place in the sub-200 fs time scale. We observed that the kinetics of charge separation is indeed influenced by the morphological parameters of the TiO<sub>2</sub> substrate. The photo-injected electron in TiO<sub>2</sub> fibers, nanotubes and 400 nm particles shows prompt back recombination kinetics with oxidized dye molecules in the picoseconds-nanoseconds time scale after excitation. Electronic parameters like density of trap states and energetic of trapped electrons, i.e. how deep electrons are trapped and consequently the mobility of electrons, might play a vital role in the behavior of photo-injected electrons after initial interfacial charge separation.</p><p>We have combined the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy with potentiometric techniques to monitor the electron injection process in DSC standard device under working condition. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5a</xref> shows the photovoltaic characteristics of the Z907 sensitizer and iodide based redox electrolyte device. The photovoltaic parameters of the device at full sunlight are; short circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, open circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 698 mV, fill factor (FF) of 0.71 and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.6%. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5b</xref> presents the typical transient absorptance of the cell in short circuit condition and under different bias voltages of +500 mV, −500 mV (close to max power point) and −690 mV. Transient absorptance traces are not easily distinguishable. All traces in this figure can be fitted by exponential function with close fitting parameters; a component with a lifetime of 50–70 ps and the flat behavior until hundred picoseconds, which is shown in inset. By raising the bias to −690 mV close to open circuit condition, the amplitude of the observed signal is almost half of the others while the kinetics remain similar. In other words, as the amplitude of the pump-probe signal is proportional to the number of oxidized dye molecules, with increasing the applied bias voltage the quantum yield of electron injection is reduced.

By taking account of this voltage drop, the respective amount of the cell photocurrent measured at bias voltages up to −500 mV and at −690 mV is consistent with the respective amplitude of the pump-probe signals.

In the Y123 dye, the electron donor part is the triphenylamine unit and the acceptor orbitals are located on the cyanoacrylate group. Cyclopentadithienophene (CPDT) is working as a π-bridge between the donor and acceptor parts for the conjugation of electrons. This bridge helps increasing the dipole moment and enhancement in the molar extinction coefficient of the dye molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Our results suggest that the relaxation of the excited-state is fast with a time constant of 52 ps. This process competes with electron injection into the lower lying conduction band of TiO<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, non-adiabatic charge transfer from a molecular electronic excited state into a continuum of acceptor levels constituted by the conduction band of a semiconductor can be described by Fermi’s golden rule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Due to the very high density of acceptor levels, the nuclear factor in the equation tends to a constant value.

Also, the interfacial charge separation in different dye-sensitized opaque TiO<sub>2</sub> nanostructured interfaces was determined. We showed that this technique could be a powerful and sensitive tool for measurements of opaque and highly absorbing materials. Coupling diffuse reflectance spectroscopy with potentiometric characterization tools gives a unique possibility to study charge carriers in devices under real operational conditions. In Ru-complex based solar cells, the kinetics of electron injection is confirmed to be ultrafast and is not affected by the bias voltage. In standard opaque and other TiO<sub>2</sub> morphologies based devices, after ultrafast electron injection, an early recombination of photo-injected electrons with oxidized dye molecules is observed with features in the picosecond to nanosecond time scale. The respective amplitude of this recombination process is influenced by morphological parameter i.e. trap states in TiO<sub>2</sub> films. We found that the ultrafast electron injection kinetics is not influenced by trap state filling upon increasing forward bias up to −500 mV. By applying a higher voltage close to open circuit conditions and shifting the Fermi level of TiO<sub>2</sub> closer to the dye excited-state level, the electron injection is less efficient but the injection kinetics is still ultrafast. For a DSC with a Y123 organic dye, the dynamic of the excited-state of the dye and the kinetics of electron injection process significantly differ from Ru-base dyes. The excited-state relaxation in the Y123 dye molecule competes with electron injection into TiO<sub>2</sub>. In contrast to Ru-complex based dyes, which show ultrafast electron injection in femtoseconds time scale, the electron injection for the Y123 dye is precisely monitored to occur within 2 ps after excitation of the dye.</p><p>Finally, the technique proposed here will be an excellent tool to be implemented for studies on highly absorbing materials, such as the new emerging perovskite based devices and can open up a new avenue of characterization research.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Pump-probe femtosecond diffuse reflectance spectrometer</title><p>In principle, the configuration of the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy is similar to the traditional transient absorption in transmission mode.

The other advantage of using parabolic mirrors over lenses is that no further dispersion is introduced to the pulses; therefore, a better time-resolution is expected. Indeed, in this configuration, the time-resolution is limited by the time broadening of the beam in the diffusive sample. This time broadening is typically measured as about 30 fs in our samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. For the transient absorption measurements, the pump beam at a defined wavelength is produced using a two-stage non-collinearly phase-matched optical parametric amplifier (NOPA). It is modulated using a synchronized chopper at a frequency of 0.5 kHz, which is half the repetition frequency of the laser. It is focused onto the sample at an angle of about 60° from normal. The pump beam has a diameter of 500 μm at the surface of the sample and typical energy of about 100–200 nJ/pulse. The probe beam is provided by a second NOPA having less energy than the pump on the sample to avoid multiple excitations and is focused having the spot size of around half of that of the pump. The polarization between the pump and probe beams is at the magic angle (54.7°). The transient response of the sample is measured by collecting the diffuse reflected pulses of the probe. The light scattered by the sample is focused onto the detector (photodiode: Nirvana detector, New Focus, model 2007). The signal of the detector is amplified by use of a lock-in amplifier. Lock-in parameters are set as integration time 1s, dwell time 4s, time constant 1s for measurements. A power supply (Weir) is used to apply a fixed bias voltage on the solar cell for diffuse reflectance measurements on the cell under voltage bias condition. The bias voltage between the two electrodes is changed from −690 mV to +500 mV and time-resolved diffuse reflectance of the device is measured at each applied bias. In these measurements, the pump and probe beam are irradiated to the cell from the backside (photoanode side), similar to the photovoltaic measurements. All the rest experimental details of experiments are similar to that previously explained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Time-resolution of diffuse reflectance setup and linearity tests</title><p>The time-resolution of the setup is defined by using optical Kerr gating technique. In this technique pump and probe beams are focused and spatially overlapped on a non-linear media (SF10 crystal or glass substrate). The cross-correlation of pump and probe beam on a Kerr-media is measured at an angle of 45° between the polarization of pump and probe. We performed the cross-correlation experiment in the diffuse reflectance mode. As the Kerr- media once the SF10 crystal and another time the scattering sample with cover glass is used. The reason is to compare the broadening of the cross-correlation peak when the diffuse reflectance is measured on these types of substrates. The time-resolution of the setup is sub- 200 fs. It should be noted that the time-resolution of this technique is limited by the time broadening of the beam in the sample due to the scattering effect. This time broadening is measured to be 120 fs for our samples. This is in contrast with the transmission based transient absorption technique in which the time-resolution is solely determined by the pulse duration of pump and probe and their cross-correlation. The setup has an unprecedented sensitivity as it enables measurements of transparent, non-reflective samples (see green curve in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) with a reasonable signal to noise ratio. In order to check the linearity of measurements, the intensity of the pump beam is changed over a broad range of energy from 0.047 μJ/pulse to a high intensity of 0.950 μJ/pulse. The diffuse reflectance of dye-sensitized sample at a fixed time delay (i.e. 50 ps) is measured. Both absorptance and Kubelka-Munk formalism show a very good linear fit to the measurements over the whole intensities of excitations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figures S2 and S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data acquisition and treatment</title><p>In the configuration of reflectance measurements, the transient absorptance <inline-formula id="IEq1"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep24465_IEq1_HTML.gif"/></inline-formula> change can be measured and corrected by determining the absolute amount of diffuse reflected light with and without pump beam. This is practically achieved by chopping the pump pulse at half repetition frequency of the laser.

The pumping beam is generated using an NOPA tuned to 600 nm to generate pulses of approximately 8 μJ, that are then compressed in an SF10-glass prism pair down to duration of less than 60 fs (at FWHM). At the sample, the excitation pulse energy is decreased to a few hundred nJ. The probe beam is a white light continuum generated in a sapphire plate and splits before the sample into signals and reference beams in order to account for intensity fluctuations. Both beams were recorded shot by shot with a pair of 163 mm spectrographs (Andor Technology, SR163) equipped with 512 × 58 pixels back-thinned CCD cameras (Hamamatsu S07030-0906). The polarization of pump and probe pulses was set at a magic angle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Solar cell fabrication</title><p>Dye-sensitized solar cells were fabricated using a double-layered photoanode made of mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> film. A transparent, 9 μm- thick layer of 20 nm particles was screen-printed onto an FTO glass plate (NSG-10, Nippon Sheet Glass). Subsequently, a 5 μm- thick layer of scattering particles (400 nm diameter) was deposited by screen-printing. The surface area of TiO<sub>2</sub> film was 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. The TiO<sub>2</sub> film was sintered up to 500 °C by a stepwise heating program. Prior and after TiO<sub>2</sub> deposition a TiCl<sub>4</sub> treatment was performed on the samples. The BET surface area of the mesoporous transparent film and scattering film were 85 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> and 27 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>. The values of the two films porosity were 70% and 65% for transparent film and scattering film respectively. Prior to dye loading, photoanodes were sintered again at 480 °C for 30 minutes. Afterward, substrate was cooled down to 80 °C and immersed in the dye solutions for overnight. After rinsing with the acetonitrile, the stained substrates were sealed with pieces of thermally platinized electrode. The platinized electrode was made using a solution of H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> on FTO glass (TEC15, Pilkington) and served as a counter electrode. The working and counter electrodes were separated by 25 μm-thick hot melt ring (Surlyn, DuPont) and sealed by heating.
