sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Semiconductor nanowires have attracted great attention owing to their submicron ultimate feature size, to the expected original electrical and optical properties and the potential applications in the field of nanoelectronics, high-speed field effect transistors, bio- and chemical sensors, and light-emitting devices with low power consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Silicon nanowires (SiNWs) are of special interest, because silicon is the basic material in microelectronics. The big demand for building powerful devices and the limits of the present approaches based on lithographic techniques to achieve few nanometer size components require the development of new methods. Control of the synthesis and the surface properties of SiNWs may open new opportunities in the field of silicon nanoelectronics and use the SiNWs as nanocomponents to build nano-circuits and nano-biosensors. Thanks to their nanometric dimensions, and the possible quantum confinement effect, the nanowires have interesting electronic, optical, chemical, and thermal properties.</p><p id="Par4">The thermal stability of one-dimensional nanostructures has a major importance to its use in electronic and protonic circuits. It is well established that the melting point of a solid material can be greatly reduced when the size is reduced to the nanometer scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Yang and coworkers studied the melting and recrystallization of germanium nanowires encapsulated by a carbon film. Two important phenomena have been observed: the first is the low value of the melting point, which is inversely proportional to the diameter of the nanowire. The second phenomenon concerns the large hysteresis associated with recrystallization-fused ring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Wang, Lee and colleagues found that the silicon nanostructures of various morphologies are formed at different temperatures after thermal evaporation of a mixture Si / SiO2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition to silicon nanowires, they observed several other silicon nanostructures with significant returns. They also found that the formation and annealing temperatures have played important roles in determining the relative ratios of these nanostructures in the final mixture. It is possible to achieve a good control over the morphology and crystallinity of the silicon nanostructures simply by varying the temperature. This result represents an important step towards the design and controlled synthesis of nanostructures knowing their thermal stability. The remarkable reduction of the melting point associated with the diameter of the nanowires has several implications. First, the annealing temperature necessary for the synthesis of a nanowire without defects could be a small fraction of the annealing temperature required for solid. It is thus possible to perform refining of the nanowires at relatively low temperatures. Second, reducing the melting point allows connecting and disconnecting the nanowires at relatively low temperatures. These opportunities can provide a new tool to integrate these dimensional nanostructures into devices and circuits. Finally, when the size of the nanowires is reduced, they can become extremely sensitive to environmental change and in particular to the fluctuation of temperature and the residual variation of the mechanical stresses.</p><p id="Par5">Unlike extensive studies on the transport of electrons, research on phonon transport in one-dimensional nanostructures was discussed only recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Phonons are the equivalent in quantum mechanics of a particular category of vibratory movements known as normal modes of vibration in classical mechanics. Given that the size of a one-dimensional nanostructure is reduced to the range of the phonon mean free paths, the thermal conductivity will be reduced, due to the dispersion caused by the defects. Theoretical studies have suggested that in nanowires with a diameter less than 20 nm, the phonon dispersion relation may be changed (due to the confinement of phonons) such that the speed of a group of phonons would very significantly well below their speed in the bulk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Molecular dynamic simulations have also shown that the thermal conductivities of the silicon nanowires may be two times smaller than those of a silicon substrate at room temperature. The reduction in thermal conductivity is desirable in certain applications such as cooling and thermoelectric power generation, but are not preferred for other applications such as electronics and photonics.</p><p id="Par6">The quantum confinement plays an important role in determining the energy levels in nanowires once their diameter is reduced below the critical value (i.e., the Bohr radius). One of the most popular terms in the nano world is quantum confinement effect which is essentially due to changes in the atomic structure as a result of direct influence of ultra-small length scale on the energy band structure. The length scale corresponds to the regime of quantum confinement ranges from 1 to 25 nm for typical semiconductor groups of IV, III-V and II-VI. In which the spatial extent of the electronic wave function is comparable with the particle size. As a result of these “geometrical” constraints, electrons “feel” the presence of the particle boundaries and respond to changes in particle size by adjusting their energy. This phenomenon is known as the quantum-size effect. Quantization effects become most important when the particle dimension of a semiconductor near to and below the bulk semiconductor Bohr exciton radius which makes materials properties size dependent.</p><p id="Par7">Korgel and colleagues found that the absorption edge of light silicon nanowires (synthesized in a supercritical fluid solvent such as hexane) was significantly shifted from the “indirect gap” of the silicon of about 1.1 eV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The origin of this photoluminescence produced by light excitation of some solid pigments is probably due to the quantum confinement effect, although the surface condition may also make additional contributions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is important to note that the change in the growth direction of the silicon nanowires leads to different optical responses. For example, oriented nanowires {100} showed a more intense luminescence than that observed with {110} oriented nanowires. Furthermore, the excitement of {100} oriented nanowires require more energy than that required for {110} oriented nanowires.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Fabrication of nanowires</title><p id="Par8">Due to the highly importance and a large utilization of silicon nanowire we will focus on this type of nanowire. Several methods of synthesis of silicon nanowires have been proposed in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this section, the most used methods will be detailed.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Physical evaporation of a silicon powder</title><p id="Par9">The first synthesis of silicon nanowires by evaporation techniques was proposed by Yu and Co. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The method includes sublimating a mixture of Fe/Si at 1200 °C under an Ar pressure of 100 torr. Using this simple method, silicon nanowires with a diameter of about 15 nm and a length of between 10 and 100 μm were obtained. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a and b</xref> show images in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of nanowires obtained by this method. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> shows silicon nanowires wrapped with an oxide layer of about two nanometers. The diffraction pattern shows the crystalline nature of the nanowires. This is similar to that of a bulk silicon. The oxide layer may be chemically etched in hydrofluoric acid (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). The size of silicon nanowires increases with increasing pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This technique allows, moreover, carrying out localized growth of nanowires. Indeed, iron deposition on a silicon substrate by lithography, followed by a thermal evaporation leads to synthesis of the located silicon nanowires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The thermal evaporation of a mixture of Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> in the absence of a catalyst has also led to the production of silicon nanowires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The nanowires are made of a crystalline core with a high density of defects surrounded by an amorphous oxide matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Transmission electron microscopy images of silicon nanowires of (<italic>a</italic>) 15 nm and (<bold>b</bold>) 10 nm after dissolution of the oxide matrix in the HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10832_2016_37_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">The nanowires prepared by this method are long and well oriented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

The fundamental process is based on metal catalyst directed chemical vapor deposition of silicon. According to this mechanism showed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the anisotropic crystal growth is promoted by the presence of liquid alloy/solid interface. This technique is carried out in the presence of gold (Au) or other metal nanoparticles catalysts at high temperature. Based on Si-Au binary phase diagram, Si (from the decomposition of SiH<sub>4</sub>) and Au form a liquid alloy when the temperature is higher than the eutectic point (363 °C). The liquid surface has a large accommodation coefficient and is therefore a preferred deposition site for incoming Si vapor. After the liquid alloy becomes supersaturated with Si, Si nanowire growth occurs by precipitation at the solid-liquid interface. In principle, the diameter, the length, the composition and the electronic properties of SiNWs can be controlled during the synthesis.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Scheme illustrated the vapor liquid solid mechanism</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10832_2016_37_Fig3_HTML.gif" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par12">The VLS technique was applied by several groups for the synthesis of SiNWs in a controlled fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this process, the diameter of the nanowires is determined by the diameter of the catalyst particles and therefore, the method provides an efficient means to obtain uniform-sized nanowires. SiNWs with narrow size distribution were obtained by using well defined catalysts (e.g., gold nanoparticles). It was possible to tune the electronic properties of the nanowires by including doping precursors in the silane gas. Boron and phosphorus-doped silicon nanowires were obtained this way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Controlling the growth orientation is important for the applications of nanowires. Nanowires generally have preferred growth directions. For example, silicon nanowires grow along the {111} direction when grown by the VLS process, but can be made to grow along the {112} or the {110} direction by the oxide-assisted growth mechanism. These results demonstrate a clear preference for growth along the {1 1 0} direction in the smallest SiNWs and along the {1 1 1} direction in larger SiNWs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Direct evidence for germanium nanowire growth mechanism in a VLS process has unambiguously been confirmed by conducting real-time in situ TEM studies at high temperature as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The experiment result shows clearly three growth stages: formation of Au-Ge alloy, nucleation of Ge nanocrystal and elongation of Ge nanowire. This observation demonstrates the validity of the VLS mechanism for nanowire growth. The establishment of VLS mechanism at the nanometer scale is very important for the rational control of inorganic nanowires, since it provides the necessary underpinning for the prediction of metal solvents and preparation conditions.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TEM images (<bold>a</bold>-<bold>f</bold>) real-time observation by TEM of growing a germanium nanowire at high temperature by the VLS technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10832_2016_37_Fig4_HTML.gif" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par13">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, metallic nanoparticles play an important role in the growth of the nanowires via the VLS technique. They catalyze the growth and determine the diameter of the resulting nanostructures. The physical and chemical properties of metal particles largely determine the final properties of the nanowires. So it can be used as catalyst in the growth, the active metal must be physically and chemically stable. The choice of catalyst metal is made after examination of the phase diagram for choosing materials that lead to the formation of a liquid alloy with the desired nanowire material.</p><p id="Par14">In the VLS process, Gibbs-Thomson law sets a lower limit on the diameter, which can be obtained under certain given conditions.

The silicon atoms then diffuse towards the bottom and create a nucleation adatoms on the surface of the catalyst particle.

Since the size of the nanowires is usually comparable or in most cases, much smaller than the wavelength of visible light, conventional optical microscopy techniques are usually limited in the characterization of morphology and the surface of nanowires. Electron microscopy techniques play, therefore, a dominant role in the characterization of nanoscale objects. The two most used techniques are the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Information on the general structure of the nanowires, such as length, diameter, and crystallinity, can be easily determined using the TEM. The composition of the nanowires can be evaluated using analysis of energy dispersion X-ray (EDX). A complete characterization includes determining the direction of growth, the cross section, the external morphology, dislocations and stacking faults. The determination of the nanowire growth direction and the cross section is important for understanding the surface energy and crystal formation mechanisms using a catalyst based synthesis process.

The change in charge density on the surface controls the conductance of the nanowire. As the silicon nanowire was p-type, the conductance increases with the addition of negative charges at the surface of the nanowire.

The first example to detect biomolecular interactions between proteins (biotin/streptavidin) in solution was demonstrated by Lieber’s group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In this device, the biotin molecule has been grafted onto the surface of p-type silicon nanowire oxidized and exposed to a solution containing streptavidin. This device has high sensitivity and can detect the attachment of a streptavidin with concentration less than 10 pico molar (10<sup>−12</sup> moles). Figure <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17a</xref> illustrates the principle of operation and detection of the biotin / streptavidin interaction. Figure <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17b</xref> shows the curve of the conductance as a function of the modified silicon nanowire time. Regions 1, 2 and 3 respectively correspond to the exposure of the surface to a buffer solution, a solution of streptavidin (250 nmolar) and a buffer solution (rinse). When a solution of streptavidin is brought to the nanowires biotin modified, it is seen that the conductance increased rapidly until it reaches a constant value. This result is explained by the negative charge contributed by streptavidin, (due to the pH of the medium in which the experiment was performed) thereby inducing a charge carrier accumulation in the nanowire (p-type). Figure <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17c</xref> shows a conductance curve in function of time of a silicon nanowire by unmodified biotin molecules. Regions 1 and 2 are the same as in curve B.

Nanowires can be as long as needed to absorb all the light and thinner than the minority–carrier diffusion length.
