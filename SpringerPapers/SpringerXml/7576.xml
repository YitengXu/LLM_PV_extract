algae production on non-arable land in the al-Wusta region of the Sultanate of Oman was evaluated. Pre-cleaned production water (pPW) from the oil production was enriched with nutrients and used as growth medium. The indigenous isolate <italic>Scenedesmus</italic> sp. MKB was grown in open ponds under semi-continuous conditions. A productivity of 16.1 g/m<sup>2</sup>/day in 2013 and 15.4 g/m<sup>2</sup>/day in 2014 was reached during four different experiments during March and April of 2013 and 2014. Thereby, no influences of light intensity (maximum daily values in between 2400 and 3050 µmol photons/m<sup>2</sup>/s) or temperature (maximum daily temperatures were between 29.9 and 41.9 °C) on productivity were observed (correlation coefficient below ±0.5). Weed algae, mainly Cyanobacteria and diatoms were detected microscopically in all cultures by the first to seventh day of growth. The increase in weed algae had a negative influence on the maximum photosynthetic efficiency (<italic>Y</italic>). <italic>Y</italic> decreased after a weed algae concentration of ca. 2 % (cell/cell) was reached.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd><italic>Scenedesmus</italic></kwd><kwd>Open pond</kwd><kwd>Arid environment</kwd><kwd>Produced water</kwd><kwd>Weed algae</kwd><kwd>PAM</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Federal Ministry of Education and Research of Germany (BMBF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">FHprofUnt 17003X11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winckelmann</surname><given-names>Dominik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Islamic Azad University</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40071_2015_Article_107.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Marine &amp;

A high annual temperature regime, low cloud coverage, and a maximum light exposure, which are typical for semi-arid regions, together with an already existing infrastructure are said to be favorable factors to increase the probability of economical viable microalgal production processes (Grobbelaar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2009</xref>). Algae capable of growing in brackish and non-potable water can be used as production strain, and such a choice would result in a reduced water footprint and therefore might result in an increase in potable or agriculturally usable water (Guieysse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>). However, the use of brackish water might lead to an increase in salt concentration due to evaporation which may cause possible salt stress (Winckelmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">One of the major issues with the growth of microalgae is the possibility of a sudden and inevitable culture collapse (Hamilton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2014</xref>), which can be caused by different means beginning with grazers (Becker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1994</xref>; Tillmann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2004</xref>), contaminations and pathogens (Gachon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>), and climatological factors (Grobbelaar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>). Another reason for the loss of revenue are weed algae overgrowing the algae to be produced. Weed algae are indigenous algae more suitable for the conditions at the production site (Becker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1994</xref>). Depending on the final use of the algae biomass, even small amounts of foreign algae can render an algae culture unsuitable for further processing (Gilroy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2000</xref>; Gantar and Svirčev <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">The use of indigenous species as production strains is said to reduce the risk of culture loss. Their origin at the same climate as the production site will reduce the risk of culture crash due to climatological and other abiotic factors, and it is assumed that they will be able to outcompete or at least suppress other indigenous algae (Mutanda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>; Odlare et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>; Rawat et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">The aim of this study was to test if indigenous algae grown in industrial waste water can be grown on non-arable land in an arid region.</p><p id="Par6">The crude oil production in the al-Wusta region of the Sultanate Oman results in 800,000 m<sup>3</sup> production water per day (Breuer and Al-Asmi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>). A fraction of approximately 100,000 m<sup>3</sup> is treated in a reed bed water treatment plant in Nimr. Uses for the resulting hydrocarbon-free brackish water (pPW) to increase revenue are sought for and the location of Nimr being a semi-arid region led to the consideration to establish an algae production facility.</p><p id="Par7">In February 2014, an open pond culture of <italic>Cyanobacterium aponinum</italic> grown in Nimr was invaded by green algae. The algae used for this study, <italic>Scenedesmus</italic> Sp. (SC) strain MKB, was isolated from the mixed culture.</p><p id="Par8">To evaluate the stability of the production process, SC was grown in 2013 and 2014. The productivity and the overall efficiency of photon capture (Grobbelaar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2009</xref>) were chosen as an indicator for the efficiency of the production process. The introduction of weed algae might lead to unwanted competition for nutrients and sunlight. It was monitored microscopically and using a multi-channel pulse-amplitude-modulation chlorophyll fluorometer [PAM; (Kolbowski and Schreiber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1995</xref>)].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Analytical methods</title><p id="Par9">Temperature (°C), wind velocity (m/S), and light intensity (W/m<sup>2</sup>) were measured by an adjacent weather station (data kindly provided by Bauer Nimr LLc). Light (µmol photons/m<sup>2</sup>/s) was measured using a Mini Quantum Sensor MQS-B (Heinz Walz GmbH, Germany). 
A conversion factor from W/m<sup>2</sup> to µmol photons/m<sup>2</sup>/s of 2.9 was calculated. The mass transfer coefficient for oxygen [k<sub>L</sub>a(O<sub>2</sub>)] of the open ponds was determined using the dynamic method (Doran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR01">1995</xref>). The k<sub>L</sub>a(O<sub>2</sub>) can be used to quantify the oxygen transfer from the liquid phase to the surrounding air. It is also used to calculate the k<sub>L</sub>a(CO<sub>2</sub>) using the equations from Talbot et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1990</xref>). Flow velocity inside an open pond was measured using a current meter (C2 with a 30 mm blade (gradient 0.1) and counter Z30 OTT Hydromet GmbH, Germany).</p><p id="Par10">The biomass was measured by means of optical density at 660 nm (Lovibond MaxiDirect photometer, Tintometer GmbH, Germany). Culture composition was determined microscopically (using a Zeiss Axiostar Plus light microscope, Carl Zeiss GmbH, Germany) and a Thoma Neu chamber with a depth of 0.1 mm (Paul Marienfeld GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Germany). For the determination of bio dry weight (dw), part of a culture was washed and filtered. The filter was dried at 105 °C until the weight was constant. Increase of salinity was measured by means of conductivity (Water quality meter U-52, Horiba Ltd., Japan). The photosynthetic yield (<italic>Y</italic>) and all photosynthetic parameters were measured using a phyto-PAM with phyto-EDF (Heinz Walz GmbH, Germany) as described previously (Winckelmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2014</xref>). Rapid light curves (Ralph and Gademann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2005</xref>), the illumination of a sample with increasing light intensities, were measured to estimate the photosynthetic performance.

This is accounted to the lack of a suitable filtration system for treatment of the pPW. The change in biomass composition from the end of the experiment in March 2013 and the beginning culture composition of the experiment performed in April 2013 showed that a significant amount of diatoms was removed from the culture via sedimentation. In 2014, diatoms were not detected (April 2014) or the earliest after 3 weeks of growth (March–April 2014), while single-celled cyanobacteria were detected in small amount during most parts of the experiments. The possible use of photosynthetic characteristics for the detection of weed algae was examined in more detail. The maximum values of NPQ decreased when the culture matured and the maximum NPQ of the experiment in April 2014 stayed around 2.5; the NPQ of all other experiments declined. An axenic culture of <italic>Cyanobacterium aponinum</italic> grown under the same circumstances had a NPQ of 0.5 which increased with invading green algae and diatoms (Paper submitted for publication). During times when the NPQ did not increase as high as before, the photosynthetic yield decreased as well. The photosynthetic yield (<italic>Y</italic>) was proven to be influenced by numerous different factors like nutrients (Lippemeier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2001</xref>), light, culture density (Schreiber and Klughammer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2013</xref>), and salt stress (Lu and Vonshak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2002</xref>) and culture composition (Kolbowski and Schreiber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1995</xref>). Since measurements were taken daily at the same time, we do not consider the difference of daylight intensity between measurement days to be a considerable influence. The culture density and the salt content of the experiment conducted April 2014 alternated in between OD 0.5 and 1.3 and 15–25 mS/cm, respectively, but no significant change in <italic>Y</italic> was monitored, it was therefore concluded that cell density and salinity seem to have only a small influence at best. Nutrients were added after every dilution and it is assumed that they were available in abundance. <italic>Y</italic> is influenced by toxic substances as well (Schmitt-Jansen and Altenburger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2008</xref>; Peña-Vázquez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2010</xref>), and algae cultures are suspected to accumulate physiological products inside the medium, which might inhibit growth (Gustavs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>). It was concluded that, since the change in Y during the trial conducted in March–April 2014 occurred after 34 days, the build-up of inhibiting physiological byproducts will be neglected. Cyanobacteria and diatoms showed during laboratory studies (Winckelmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2014</xref>) a maximum <italic>Y</italic> of 0.45 and 0.6, respectively. The change in <italic>Y</italic> occurred within 2 days of the microscopically detected weed algae, it is thought the lower capability of cyanobacteria and diatoms to use light energy for fluorescence might lead to a quenching of the overall <italic>Y</italic>.</p><p id="Par29">The use of the phyto-PAM for the detection of weed algae and overall stress in an open pond as a stand-alone method is not advised. While it would be possible to establish an online sensor, it would be influenced by a range of different factors and the growth system to be monitored has to be well understood. A well-trained operator might be capable to distinguish the influence of nutrient deprivation from the afternoon photoinhibition(Lu and Vonshak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1999</xref>), but the sensitivity is insufficient to detect weed algae in an early stage. While it was possible to detect cyanobacteria concentration of 5 × 10^3 cells/mL cells/mL in 2.5 × 10^6 cells/mL with a microscope, the phyto-PAM started to detect cyanobacteria at 5 × 10^4 cells/mL. Other techniques for the detection of weed algae and even non-photosynthetic organisms like grazers can be applied (Havlik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2013a</xref>). Flow cytometry was found to detect weed algae with a concentration as low as 0.01 % (Fulbright et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2014</xref>), and even capable to monitor algae; which change shape during their growth cycle (Havlik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013b</xref>). Real-Time quantitative PCR (qPCR) could be used to monitor production systems as well; qPCR systems were able to detect known possible contaminants at levels of 0.00001 % (Fulbright et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">Grazers were only detected in matured cultures living in the biofilm; the abundance was too low to be quantified.

However, the culture’s Y usually declined over the course of the day (data not shown) indicating light inhibition or damage. An alteration of the pond design might lead to a decrease in light inhibition and thereby increasing the productivity(Vonshak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2013</xref>), also the ability to cope with excess light of high intensity varies over the experiment. After the inoculation and dilution, the NPQ was below 0.5 but increased up to 3 before the next dilution. The drop in NPQ can be explained by the dilution and the decreased biomass concentration reducing the cultures self-shading (Küster et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>).</p><p id="Par34">It is hypothesized that the high pH plays a major role in the limitation of growth. The availability of carbon as substrate for photosynthesis is crucial. The maximum concentration of carbon dioxide in liquid with a salt content of 1 % w/v is 1.2 g/L at 30 °C (Duan and Sun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2003</xref>). With the measured k<sub>L</sub>a(O<sub>2</sub>), not only would be all oxygen produced during photosynthesis be transferred out of the media, but the high k<sub>L</sub>a(CO<sub>2</sub>) would be sufficient to supply a constant stream of carbon. On the supposition of a gradient favoring the transition of CO<sub>2</sub> from air to liquid and using the calculations provided by Talbot et al.

See Badger and Price for a review regarding the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrating mechanism (Badger and Price <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1992</xref>). Six different green algae have shown to stop photosynthesis at a pH above 10 (Shiraiwa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1993</xref>) at which most of the dissolved inorganic carbon has the form of CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup> (Markou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>). pKa of CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup> is 10.3 at 25 °C but decreases with increasing temperature (Rabinowitch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1945</xref>). CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup> is unavailable for most microalgae (Markou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>). While it is known that <italic>Scenedesmus</italic> and some marine algae are capable of thriving at pH of 8–9, it is unknown how the excess CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup> influences the growth (Shiraiwa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1993</xref>).</p><p id="Par36"><italic>Scenedesmus obliquus</italic> showed an increase of lipid content after addition of 5 g/L NaCl (Gorain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR02">2013</xref>) but were also negatively influenced by further increased NaCl level (Affenzeller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2009</xref>; Salama et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2013</xref>).

Under different conditions, lipid accumulations as high as 53 % (dw) were reported (Xin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2010</xref>). The lipid composition of Scenedesmus sp. has been reported to be suitable for biodiesel production (Gouveia and Oliveira <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009</xref>; Makarevi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011</xref>; Jena et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2012</xref>). If <italic>Scenedesmus</italic> sp. grown in pPW would have the same composition as shown after growth in modified BG-11 media(Laurens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>), it would be possible to harvest 9500 L of lipids (assuming a density of 800 g/L) leading to 7600 L of biodiesel per hectare per year (Chisti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2007</xref>). This would be only a fraction of the 58,700 L/ha/year predicted, but still higher than the oil yield reported for palm oil (Chisti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2007</xref>). There are multiple possibilities to increase productivity and to make the production of green algae on site more sustainable. The biomass residues not sold can be digested for biogas, which can be used as CO<sub>2</sub> and energy source, while the residues can be used instead of fertilizer (Chisti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>). A change in the mixing system will change the productivity; the use of a centrifugal pump as opposed to a paddle wheel will lead to a well-mixed culture and a high turbulence which is stated to prevent algal sedimentation, nutritional gradients, and to expose the algae to variations in the quantity and quality of light (Grobbelaar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>). But it is also less energy efficient. The floating of algae flocks at times of pump failure showed that there was a biofilm formation. The biofilm mainly consisted of diatoms and dust particles and was stronger in areas with less turbulence. It is strongly suggested that the biofilm formation is influenced by the amount of dust, the turbulence of the culture, and the roughness of the pond liner. A change in pond design or mixing might lead to less biofilm formation and thereby reduce the risk of product contamination. It was shown that wave formation inside of a pond led to an increased productivity and a better nitrogen uptake (Chiaramonti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2013</xref>). If wave formation would be obtained by intermittent reduction of the pumps delivery rate, a decrease in energy consumption might be achieved.</p><p id="Par38">A final statement of economic feasibility is not possible at this stage.
