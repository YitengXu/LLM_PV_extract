However, it has been difficult to accurately measure the physiological signals in tears, and the use of external power source has also hindered the future applications. Here, we demonstrated an organic electrochemical transistor based multiplexed sensors self-powered by the organic solar cells (OSCs). The integrated device was fabricated via simple process including solution blade-coating and thermal evaporation. OSCs were optimized to provide optimal operation voltage for the sensors that exhibit semilog-linear response to the glucose and calcium ions in tear fluids without any peripheral circuits. The sensing signals can be transmitted to the laptop wirelessly through a near filed communication unit. This integrated self-powered multiplexed sensing device will provide real-time monitoring of the biomarkers in tears, prospected to be installed on the smart contact lens for the early detection and diagnosis of diabetes.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (21704082, 21875182), Key Scientific and Technological Innovation Team Project of Shaanxi Province (2020TD-002), 111 project 2.0 (BP2018008)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>77</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41528_2022_Article_211.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Optical and Electronic Materials</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Polymer Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry and Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Bioelectronic devices capable of real-time monitoring health status and biomedical information of human body have been widely investigated over the past decades as a key of next-generation wearable electronics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Numerous wearable devices have been developed successfully in electrocardiography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, photoplethysmography, pulse oximetry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and glucose monitoring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, yet still limited by the rigid circuit, terminal connection and power supply. Organic semiconducting devices, such as organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), organic photodetectors (OPDs) and organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), have shown great potential in wearable devices due to their inherent light-weight, flexibility, and biological compatibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Great progress has been made in in-vitro wearable devices by integrating the OECTs and OPDs with biofuel cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, lithium batteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and wireless communication units<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> to achieve the monitoring of signals from sweat and other physiological signals in the past years.</p><p id="Par3">Among various wearable bioelectronics, smart contact lenses have attracted commercial attention for in-vivo health monitoring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Tears could serve as a convenient and noninvasive object to monitor the physiological conditions in human body which can be collected in the contact lens naturally and used to assess various biomarkers such as glucose, sodium ions, potassium ions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Thus, a contact lens equipped with sensors provide a noninvasive sensing method to monitor metabolites from in tears. For numerous biomarkers, glucose is a characteristic signal for the diagnosis and management of diabetes. Presently, for diabetes patients, the finger prick method has to be used every day to monitor the glucose level in blood. To achieve convenient and painless detection, Google collaborated with Novartis proposed the Google Lens for the diagnosis of diabetic patients in 2014. However, this program has been terminated 2 years later since the lens cannot establish the response to the blood glucose level accurately. In addition to the concentration change of glucose, many concurrent physiological components change in the body fluids of patients. For example, calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) have been reported to be related with the release of the insulin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. The elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are associated with impaired glucose metabolism, which means a higher risk of diabetes. Under this consideration, developing multiplexed sensing of diverse biomarker in tears could provide more precise early warning and diagnosis of diseases. However, up to now, most of the commercial ion detection instruments are based on the chromatographic method that requires large volumes of liquids (about 10 mL). Compared to the chromatographic methods, OECT sensors combining ions selective membrane have been reported widely<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and succeeded in ion detection in small amount of sweats, which provides the equipment foundation for ion detection in tears.</p><p id="Par4">Power supply is one other key limiting factors of wearable bioelectronics. Batteries have been used as the primary power source for current vitro wearing devices which suffer from the risk of insufficient long-term availability and uncomfortableness for in vivo electronics. For next-generation bioelectronics, the self-powering functionality should be equipped while the bulky external power supplies and wirings should be avoided. So far, numerous instances on the nanogenerators and biofuel cells have been reported for wearable and implantable bioelectronic devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. However, due to the low energy conversion efficiency and unstable energy sources, these power supplies are hard to satisfy the energy demand of complex sensing and signal transmission system. By contrast, solar cells provide a higher power output even under the indoor illumination conditions. Among all the photovoltaic cells, organic solar cells (OSCs) have exhibited advantages in output management and flexible devices since the output voltage and current can be modulated readily by photovoltaic materials modification and matching. Thus, the output of power sources can be controlled according to the requirement of flexible biosensors to realize the high capability of sensing and monitoring without the usage of resistance and other circuit elements. However, to achieve controllable power supply of OSCs to the sensors, complicated processes such as photoetching are needed. A scalable method for the easy realization of integrated power sources should be developed.</p><p id="Par5">To address these problems, here, we report a flexible and self-powered integrated OECT sensor for multiplexed sensing of glucose and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in tears. Poly(2,3-dihydrothieno-1,4-dioxin)-poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) based OECT sensors with high transconductance were optimized to enhance the response to the biomarkers in tears. The output of OSCs were adjusted by the photovoltaic material matching to meet the demands of glucose and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors. The gate and drain electrodes of both sensors are powered separately by four OSCs processed by patterned sequential blade-coating methods. The integrated system works well under normal LEDs illumination and displays nearly semilog-linear response to the concentration of glucose and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Furthermore, by connecting with a commercial RFID board, the information about the marker concentration can be transmitted to the portable devices like laptops wirelessly. Finally, the integrated multiplexed devices were implemented successfully to monitor the level changes of glucose and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in tears, collected at different time points in a day. This integrated device is expected to be installed on the contact lens to achieve self-powered in-vivo wearable devices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Electrical characterization and morphology optimization of PEDOT:PSS based OECT sensors</title><p id="Par6">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> illustrates the layout of the integrated system of the OSCs-powered multiplexed sensing devices for glucose and Ca<sup>2+</sup> monitoring. This system consists of two parts, (i) two groups of OSCs including one inverted cell working as the power supply for the gate electrode and one conventional cell powering for the drain electrode while the bottom electrodes of OSCs are connected to the source electrodes of sensors, and (ii) two separated PEDOT:PSS based OECT (p-OECT) sensors. For Ca<sup>2+</sup> selective monitoring, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> selective membrane is coated on the PEDOT:PSS channel (Ca<sup>2+</sup> OECT, c-OECT); for glucose sensing, the platinum gate is modified by the mixture of chitosan and glucose oxidase (glucose OECT, g-OECT). Enzymes immobilized on the gate electrode catalyze the glucose to produce peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and the electrochemical oxidation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is catalyzed by the platinum electrode when a positive bias is applied. The oxidation process results in the transfer of electrons to the gate electrode and changes the electrical double layer at the gate/electrolyte interface, which reduces the voltage drop at the gate/electrolyte interface and hence increases the potential that is applied to the active channel and decrease the drain current.

The ethylene glycol (EG) treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> is a commonly used method for fabricating p-OECTs as it promotes the phase segregation of surplus PSS and improve the film crystallization. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, with the content of EG increasing to 5% volume fraction, <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub> enhances about twice compared to the device without EG treatment. However, further increasing EG content decreases <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub>. Thermal annealing is another commonly used method to enhance the polymer crystallization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub> increases to about 10 mS with 90 °C annealing treatment first and get decreased as the annealing temperature increases further. The transconductance difference of the p-OECTs with various treatments are further investigated by the grazing wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>, the PEDOT:PSS films show peaks at <bold>q</bold> = 1.38 Å<sup>−1</sup> (known as PSS halo) and ~1.78 Å<sup>−1</sup> in the out-of-plane direction (π-π stacking in PEDOT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. The coherence lengths (CL) of the corresponding peaks are calculated by the Scherrer’s equation and summarized in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>. The PEDOT:PSS film with 5% EG treatment exhibits the largest CL value compared to other films while the film with 90 <sup>o</sup>C annealing treatment also shows enhanced CL value. The enhanced π-π stacking in PEDOT is beneficial to the charge transport in the film, corresponding to the transconductance of p-OECTs.</p><p id="Par8">Devices of g-OECT and c-OECT were fabricated to evaluate the electroanalytical performance by measuring the change of drain current when increasing the concentration of biomarkers. According to literature, the concentration of glucose and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in tears are in the range of 0.1–0.6 mM and 0.4–1.1 mM, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The electrolyte concentration determines the Nernst potential, which affects the effective gate voltage and the consequent drain-source current. In addition, the response current shows a semilog-linear relationship towards the electrolyte concentration. The drain current response to the concentration is exhibited in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>. Both devices show dropped drain current as the concentration increases while the g-OECT responds slowly due to the complex glucose redox reaction. We set the drain current measured at 0.1 mM condition as the reference point. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>, the normalized current response (NCR) increases linearly with the exponential increase of the glucose and Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration. The fitted lines suggested the semilog-linear relationship, corresponding to the reported literatures. Compared to the g-OECT, the lower normalized current response of c-OECT may be attributed to the double electrical layers formed in the interface between the gold electrode and electrolyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, which leads to the decrease of effective gate voltage. Considering the interference of other positive ions in tears, such as potassium and sodium, the selectivity and specificity of the c-OECT is also evaluated. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>, the addition of interfering ions exerts almost no effect on the drain current. Furthermore, the cross detection of glucose and Ca<sup>2+</sup> is also assessed in the mixed artificial liquids. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>, only several dozens of microamperes current variation can be observed. Considering the milliampere-level current changes at different concentrations, the addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not affect the glucose detection, nor does glucose for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> detection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Output characteristics matching between OECT sensors and OSCs</title><p id="Par9">To maximize the response upon specific biomarkers, the sensors should be worked under the optimal operation voltages. For PEDOT:PSS-based OECTs at optimal working conditions, gate voltage is usually positive whereas the drain is negative. Therefore, we adopted OSCs with the inverted structure and normal structure to power the gate and drain, respectively. By sequential blade coating as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, we achieved OSCs with different structures on the same substrate.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Power output matching between OECT sensors and OSCs.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Chemical structures of the materials used for photovoltaic powering and the schematic of layer-by-layer blade coating. <bold>b</bold> Time resolved UV-vis absorption contour of the PEDOT:PSS channel with applied bias. <bold>c</bold><italic>J-V</italic> curves of the gate OSCs under simulator and 1000 lux illumination. <bold>d</bold> The open circuit voltage of PTB7-Th: ITIC OSCs for gate powering under different light densities.

Time resolved UV-vis absorption spectra of the channel layer are carried out (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>). The thin film displays a dominant absorption peak centered around 1000 nm at zero voltage bias, indicating the highly doped PEDOT<sup>+</sup> polaron state. The absorption peaks beyond 1000 nm indicates the presence of higher doped bipolaron state (PEDOT<sup>2+</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. For glucose sensing OECT, the gate voltage must be larger than 0.6 V due to the redox reaction threshold. At 0.6 V gate voltage, the bipolaronic states disappears with the emergence of a dominant absorption peak centered at 650 nm, corresponding to the neutral PEDOT° state, indicating PEDOT<sup>+</sup> and PEDOT<sup>2+</sup> states are effectively de-doped, leading to large <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub> and thus high sensitivity.</p><p id="Par11">For powering the gate electrode, since the gate current in OECTs is only several microamperes, much smaller than the short-circuit current of OSCs (100–200 μA), OSCs powering for gate electrode should work under nearly open-circuit circumstance. Therefore, OSCs with approximate 0.6 V open-circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>) under indoor illumination matches the gate power supply requirement. Here we select the PTB7-Th:ITIC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> system with an inverted structure (ITO or PEDOT:PSS PH1000/ ZnO nanocrystals/PTB7-Th:ITIC/MoO<sub>x</sub>/ Al) as the gate power source. The <italic>J-V</italic> curves of PTB7-Th:ITIC system under simulator and LED illumination are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>. The open-circuit voltages dependent on the illumination power density are summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>. The open-circuit voltages are approaching to 0.6 V when the light density deceases to the indoor illumination density (500–2000 lux, the spectrum of the LED lamp is shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">For powering the drain electrode, we first took the output characteristics of OSCs and p-OECTs into consideration. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>, the operation voltage is decided by both the current of OECTs and OSCs. Since the gate voltage is set to be 0.6 V, or even larger, if the intersection is located at close to the <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> point, the potential between gate and drain electrode will be larger than 1 V, which would cause water electrolysis and is detrimental to glucose test and may also cause eye decease. Although the <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> of OSCs could be modulated to be less than 0.4 V using the interfacial layer with mismatched work-function, the ‘S’ shape <italic>I-V</italic> output characteristic may result in nonlinear current response to various concentrations. Under this consideration, the operation voltage should be modulated at the low voltage region. In this case, a rapid decrease of OSC current may contribute to the high current response in OECT sensors, contrary to the intuition that OSCs with good fill factor is more advantageous. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>, larger current variation can be observed in P3HT:PCBM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> system compared to the highly-efficient PM6:BTP4Cl-C24 system. Sensors powered by these two OSC systems are fabricated to further verify this inference. The current responses to different Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations are exhibited in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref> and the normalized current responses are displayed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>. As expected, a higher normalized current response values for sensor powered by P3HT:PCBM can be observed. The slope near the short-circuit current point in the <italic>J-V</italic> curve is related to the geminate recombination of OSC, which can be regulated by the film thickness. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>, the current response can be enhanced by increasing the film thickness to 200 nm. However, further increase of film thickness cannot keep improving the current response. The relative current change for 300 nm device (0.052) decreases slightly compared to that of 200 nm device (0.054).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Testing of the self-powered integrated devices</title><p id="Par13">The sensors and OSCs are then integrated into one self-powered electronics for further evaluation. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> shows the photo of the real device and the circuit model of the integrated device. The bottom electrodes of the OSCs are connected to the source electrodes of OECT sensors while the top electrodes are connected to gate and drain electrodes, respectively. Different from the reported self-powered OSCs/OECT devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>, here both the gate and drain electrode are self-powered. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>, the gate current of the self-powered system is merely about 20 nA, which is much smaller than the photocurrent at all illumination conditions, ensuring that the gate OSC works under the circumstance close to the open-circuit. Due to the weak current of OSC under indoor illumination, the measured drain current is only about several dozens of microamps, which is the same order of magnitude as the reported OECT devices powered by solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The inset in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> shows the stability of gate voltage, which keeps almost as a constant with trifling spike mutations derived from the environmental shock possibly. The drain current of the PEDOT-OECT remains 98.5% of the initial values after continuous measurement for 30 min in air without any encapsulation, indicating decent stability of the integrated devices. The devices also show good stability over a span of time. After being tested daily for 7 days, the drain current remains over 92% of the initial values (shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>). Furthermore, the test stability is evaluated by switching the LED lamp on and off repeatedly to simulate eyes opening and closing. The spectra of the LED light for integrated device illumination is shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>. Since three different output light density can be tuned by the lamp, we can observe three response current as the light density changes. As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>, the measured drain current under certain light density changes slightly, indicating good test stability of our integrated device. The effect of different light density on the normalized current response was also explored as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>. The drain current increases as the light density raises and semilog-linear relationship between normalized current response and concentration can be observed under different illumination densities. However, the response values under light intensity are slightly larger than those under high light intensities, probably due to the declined output of PCBM based OSCs when exposing to strong light for long time.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Testing of the self-powered integrated devices.</title><p><bold>a</bold> The image of the self-powered integrated device and the equivalent circuit diagram of the integrated device. <bold>b</bold> The stability of the normalized output drain-current powered by OSC.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, the drain current of the g-OECT drops from 19.5 to 17.2 μA as the glucose concentration increases from 0.1 mM to 1 mM. Similarly, the drain current drops from 127.9 to 110.2 μA as Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration increases from 0.1 mM to 10 mM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). The potential measured between the gate and source also changes slightly as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>. The measured gate voltages are closed to the open-circuit voltage of gate OSCs, confirming our previous deduction that gate OSCs work under nearly open-circuit circumstance. We set the respective drain current measured at 0.1 mM as the reference value again and calibrate the normalized current response. As exhibited in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>, both the self-powered sensors show a semilog-linear response to the concentration variations. About 13% average current variation can be observed when the glucose concentration changed by an order of magnitude. Similarly, about 15% average response drain current variation can be observed as Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration increased by two orders of magnitude.

A Si-based logic die (RF430FRK152H, Texas Instruments, USA) NFC chip together with a commercial developing board (MSP-EXP430G2) are linked with the self-powered OECT devices and resistors to digitize the measured data and transmit the information to the laptop. Since the NFC chip can only recognize the voltage signal. Resistors are linked with the drain and source electrode in series to convert the current signals into potential signals. The resistance values are evaluated by the potential between drain and source electrode and the drain current of respective OECT devices. Here the resistors used for g-OECT and c-OECT sensor are 20 kΩ and 3 kΩ, respectively. The radio frequency (RF) identification responses on laptop to the biomarkers with various concentration are exhibited in Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref>. Due to the different potential difference between drain and source electrode for the g-OECT and c-OECT, a larger RF response value can be observed for c-OECT compared to the g-OECT.

We collected the tears from one laboratory member under fasting state when waking up and 1.5 h after breakfast since the glucose variation of tears should be behind than that of bloods. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>, the concentration of glucose in tears is about 0.74 ± 0.03 mM and it raises up to about 0.97 ± 0.05 mM after having breakfast. It has been reported that the glucose concentration in tears is about 0.1–0.3 mM for normal people and about 1 mM for diabetics under fasting state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. The concentration variation after meals should be less than 67% for normal people. The detection concentrations by our device are on the same order of magnitude as the literature reported (0.1–0.6 mM). The slightly higher detection concentration may be attributed to the tears collection method according to the literatures. The contents of Ca<sup>2+</sup> are also tested from the same tears and the calibrated results indicate that the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations are about 1.15 ± 0.01 mM and 0.98 ± 0.01 mM before and after meals, respectively, which is on the same order of magnitude as the literature reported (0.4–1.1 mM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. For normal people, the concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in tears decreases mildly at noon compared to that in the morning. The detection errors possibly come from the response current fluctuation and the calibration error. The collection process and the small sampling size also limit the detection accuracy since we did not measure in eyes directly. In addition, the light density used for measurement as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref> and device variation also contributes to the detection errors. Nevertheless, these results have demonstrated the potential application of the self-powered sensors in future ophthalmic diagnosis.</p><p id="Par17">After the demonstration of self-powered multiplex sensors on the glass substrate, we further fabricated the flexible self-powered devices. We used PH1000 on 200 μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate to replace the ITO/glass substrate. A photograph of the flexible device is shown as the inset in the Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>. The sensing signals towards different biomarkers concentration are shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">22</xref>. Compared to the rigid devices, the drain current response curves are more unstable and smaller. Based on the results, similar normalized current responses are calculated as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>. Due to the unstable current response, large error bars can be observed which is disadvantageous to the detection. One of the reasons for the high noise in the flexible sensors is the weak power supply from the flexible OSCs. In addition, the deformation of the flexible sensors might also contribute to the poor signal quality since the loose contact of the sensors will result in electrical noises. To make the sensors work better, more flexible circuit elements such as rectifying circuits should be integrated into the overall biosensor systems in future works.</p><p id="Par18">In conclusion, we demonstrated a flexible self-powered multiplexed OECT sensing device for monitoring the concentration of glucose and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in tear fluids. The integrated device was fabricated via simple process including solution blade-coating and thermal evaporation, indicating great potential for batch production. The morphology of the OECT channel layer and operation voltage of the sensors are investigated to obtain sensitive responses to the concentration variation of biomarkers under large range of illumination conditions from sun light to indoor light. To meet the powering requirements of OECT sensors, the output of the OSCs is optimized by the matching of photovoltaic active layers and selection of transport interfacial layers without using other circuit elements such as resistors and capacitors. The integrated device can work under the illumination indoor lights, exhibiting good responses to the concentration change of glucose and Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The synergetic measurements of multiple biomarkers will help to the monitoring and diagnosis of diabetes. The sensing information can be transmitted to the portable devices wirelessly by the integrated NFC unit. This self-powered multiplexed sensing device is prospective to be equipped on the contact lens and pave the wave of next-generation wearing bioelectronics for the long-term noninvasive in vivo surveillance and diagnosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par19">PTB7-Th, ITIC, P3HT, PCBM, PM6, and PDINO are purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc.
