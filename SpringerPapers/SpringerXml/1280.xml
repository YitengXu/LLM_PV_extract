id="Par1">ARIEL, the Atmospheric Remote sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large survey, is one of the three M-class mission candidates competing for the M4 launch slot within the Cosmic Vision science programme of the European Space Agency (ESA). As such, ARIEL has been the subject of a Phase A study that involved European industry, research institutes and universities from ESA member states. This study is now completed and the M4 down-selection is expected to be concluded in November 2017. ARIEL is a concept for a dedicated mission to measure the chemical composition and structure of hundreds of exoplanet atmospheres using the technique of transit spectroscopy. ARIEL targets extend from gas giants (Jupiter or Neptune-like) to super-Earths in the very hot to warm zones of F to M-type host stars, opening up the way to large-scale, comparative planetology that would place our own Solar System in the context of other planetary systems in the Milky Way. A technical and programmatic review of the ARIEL mission was performed between February and May 2017, with the objective of assessing the readiness of the mission to progress to the Phase B1 study. No critical issues were identified and the mission was deemed technically feasible within the M4 programmatic boundary conditions. In this paper we give an overview of the final mission concept for ARIEL as of the end of the Phase A study, from scientific, technical and operational perspectives.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>ARIEL</kwd><kwd>Cosmic vision</kwd><kwd>M4</kwd><kwd>ESA</kwd><kwd>Phase a study</kwd><kwd>Exoplanets</kwd><kwd>Transmission and eclipse spectroscopy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature B.V.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>31</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/10686_2018_Article_9604.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>19</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>19</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Astronomy, Observations and Techniques</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Statistics for Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry and Earth Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Physics and Astronomy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">ARIEL is a M4 mission candidate within the Cosmic Vision science programme of ESA. ARIEL was selected in June 2015 to enter an assessment phase (Phase 0/A), and is competing against two other missions (THOR and XIPE) for the M4 launch slot in 2026. The ARIEL mission is the successor of the ESA M3 mission candidate EChO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The science objectives and mission concept have evolved to fit the new M4 programmatic constraints. The main changes are the use of a new European launcher (Ariane 6 instead of Soyuz), a new launch date (2026 instead of 2024) and a slightly reduced cost at completion to ESA. Other programmatic constraints specific to the M-class missions still apply (Technology Readiness Levels, payload and S/C development time).</p><p id="Par3">The Phase 0 study of ARIEL involved the preliminary definition of the science and mission requirements, and an ESA internal Concurrent Design Facility (CDF) study conducted in June/July 2015.The results of this CDF study are presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Following this Phase 0, the Phase A study was kicked-off in early 2016, with two parallel competitive industrial studies as well as a payload study. This study culminated in the Mission Selection Review (MSR) in February–May 2017, with the objective of assessing the technical and programmatic feasibility of all three M4 mission candidates. With a successful conclusion to the review, all three candidate missions are now undergoing an independent scientific evaluation. This process is expected to be concluded in November 2017 with the selection of the M4 mission by the ESA Science Program Committee (SPC).</p><p id="Par5">After November 2017, the selected M4 mission will enter a Phase B1 study that is expected to conclude in mid-2019 with a Mission Adoption Review (MAR).</p><p id="Par6">In this paper we present a summary of the key aspects of the ARIEL phase A study. In section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> we give a brief overview of the science, science requirements and targets of the mission; in section <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">3</xref> we provide an overview of the mission requirements, followed by a description of the mission profile (including operations) in section <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">4</xref>; in sections <xref rid="Sec17" ref-type="sec">5</xref> and <xref rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec">6</xref> we describe the spacecraft design and the assembly/integration/verification/development plan respectively, with a summary of the way in which the Community would be able to access ARIEL given in section <xref rid="Sec28" ref-type="sec">7</xref>. In section <xref rid="Sec29" ref-type="sec">8</xref> we present the findings and recommendations of the MSR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Science requirements and targets</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Background and key science objectives</title><p id="Par7">ARIEL is a survey-type mission concept dedicated to the study of exoplanets through spectral characterisation of their atmospheres. Currently it is predicted that most stars in our Galaxy contain one or more planets, thus in our galaxy alone ~10<sup>11</sup> or more exoplanets likely exist. Today a few thousand exoplanets have been actually identified, displaying huge ranges of masses, sizes and orbits: from rocky Earth-like planets to large gas giants grazing the surface of their host star. However, the essential nature of these exoplanets remains largely unknown: there is no known, discernible pattern linking the presence, size, or orbital parameters of a planet to the nature of its parent star. We have little idea how the chemistry of a planet is linked to its formation environment, or whether the type of host star drives the physics and chemistry of a planet’s birth, and subsequent evolution.</p><p id="Par8">The next step in exoplanet science is to study the planets themselves, both individually and importantly statistically, with a view to attempt to understand what they are, and why they are – and how they have become – what they are. ARIEL is designed as a dedicated survey mission capable of observing a large and well-defined planet sample of transiting exoplanets within its baseline 4-year mission lifetime. The top-level science objectives are to address the fundamental questions:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par9">What are exoplanets made of?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10">How do planets and planetary systems form?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11">How do planets and their atmospheres evolve over time?</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par12">This will be done through the direct measurement of the chemical composition and thermal properties of a large population of exoplanets. The diversity in compositions is expected to be linked to different formation and evolution scenarios. ARIEL will therefore observe spectroscopically approximately 1000 transiting planets of different sizes, masses, densities, equilibrium temperatures, and orbital properties around a variety of stellar types to establish what these planets are made of.</p><p id="Par13">By employing time differential techniques of transit, eclipse, and phase-curve spectroscopy, whereby the signal from a star and planet system is differentiated using knowledge of the planetary ephemerides, it is possible to measure atmospheric signals from the planet at levels of 10–100 ppm (ppm) relative to the star. Particularly bright targets will also allow more sophisticated techniques, such as eclipse mapping, to be employed promising an even deeper insight into the nature of planetary atmospheres. Photometric stability rather than angular resolution is key, and is in fact the most stringent requirement of the ARIEL design driving many engineering design and operational aspects of the mission. For the brightest targets it would be possible to obtain high quality spectra in a single visit; for fainter targets the necessary signal-to-noise would be built up through repeated visits over the mission lifetime.</p><p id="Par14">The instantaneous spectral coverage of the ARIEL design is unique in its breadth, spanning the 1.25 to 7.8 μm range with three contiguous spectrometer bands, and in addition three narrow-band photometry channels in the optical. The spectral range is primarily aimed for the study of warm and hot exoplanets with temperatures ranging from several hundred to over a few thousand Kelvin, taking advantage of their well-mixed atmospheres which should show minimal condensation and sequestration of high-Z materials and thus better reveal their bulk elemental composition (especially C, O, N, S, Si). The wavelength range covers all the expected major atmospheric gases from e.g. H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub> NH<sub>3</sub>, HCN, H<sub>2</sub>S through to the more exotic metallic compounds, such as TiO, VO, and condensed species. Furthermore, the broad instantaneous spectral coverage, importantly including the visible bands, provides an essential means by which to monitor and subsequently correct for the effects of activity of the host star, which could otherwise introduce significant uncertainty into the final exoplanet spectrum and its interpretation.</p><p id="Par15">Progress with the science questions requires a large, unbiased spectroscopic survey of exoplanets. The ARIEL mission would allow scientists to study exoplanets both as a population and as individuals. It is designed to target super-Earths, Neptune-like, and Jupiter-like planets, in the warm to very hot zones (planet temperatures of ~500–3000 K) of F to M-type host stars. The spectroscopic information on the atmospheres of the large, select sample of exoplanets that ARIEL would provide would allow the compositions, temperature profiles, size, diversity and variability to be determined to levels of accuracy and precision never previously attempted.</p><p id="Par16">A much more detailed description of the science case for ARIEL as well as the key science objectives of the mission can be found in chapter 2 of the ESA ARIEL Assessment Study Report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], as well as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and references therein.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Scientific requirements and observational strategy</title><p id="Par17">The high-level science objectives of ARIEL flow down to a number of science requirements, both on the breadth and depth of the survey of exoplanets to be undertaken by ARIEL, as well as on the science requirements for the mission itself, see also chapter 3 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Observational strategy</title><p id="Par18">The ARIEL science objectives call for atmospheric spectra of a large and diverse sample of known exoplanets covering a wide range of masses, densities, equilibrium temperatures, orbital properties and host-star taken at various spectral resolving powers, wavelength intervals and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). This can be achieved through the execution of observation of a large enough well chosen sample of &gt;500 exoplanet targets, with a goal to observe ~1000 exoplanet targets.</p><p id="Par19">The ARIEL observational strategy is to divide the overall survey into three tiers – Reconnaissance survey, Deep survey, and Benchmark planets. The Reconnaissance survey mode will allow rapid, broad characterisation of planets so that decisions can be made about priorities for future observations. For the majority of the targets observed by ARIEL, the necessary performance can be reached in just 1 or 2 transits/eclipses.

With an instantaneous baseline wavelength coverage spanning over 4 octaves, it is necessary to split the waveband in a series of discrete photometer and spectrometer channels. Baseline and goal requirements have been formulated that prioritise the protection of key wavelength intervals.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par27"><bold>Resolving power:</bold> The final spectral resolving power, R (λ/Δλ), and ultimately the spectral resolution actually achieved for any observation, is a trade-off between the desire to resolve as many spectral features as possible and the need to detect these same features at a statistically significant level. It will therefore depend on the brightness of the star, planet/star contrast and the observing time available, as well as the sensitivity of the payload.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par28"><bold>Photometric stability:</bold> Photometric stability is <italic>the</italic> critical requirement of the mission. The objective is to observe exoplanets with contrast ratios between the exoplanet and host star of as low as 10 ppm and typically 100 ppm. To achieve this with the SNR &amp; resolving power combinations in the different survey tiers typically requires the co-addition of data taken over a few to – in exceptional cases –tens of transit/occultation events, depending on the characteristics of the individual exoplanet/host star systems. In order that the co-addition itself does not add a systematic noise component to the data, a stability of no more than 100 ppm (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) would be needed in each transit event. This stability is required over a frequency range defined by the timing of the transit event itself, which is known with high accuracy. The maximum timescale is set by the duration of an observation of an exoplanet known today which has a relatively long transit duration: assuming an equal observing time spent in- and out- of transit, this sets the interval to be around 10 h. The minimum relevant timescale is that required to resolve temporally the exoplanet ingress/egress of ~15 min (GJ436b). These limits together were used to set the baseline frequency intervals; the goal limits are set by the duration of a representative phase curve observation and the shorter cadence time given below.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29"><bold>Sky visibility/source accessibility:</bold> The target list will specify a well-defined set of targets, with repeat visits typically required to build up the SNR of individual target spectra. The maximum duration of a visit to a target system would be ~10 h – the time of the transit itself, plus half that time before and then after the transit. The time between successive transit observations depends on orbital period and scheduling, and could be as little as less than a day, to as long as a few tens of days. In principle, the targets may be in any part of the sky: the satellite needs a large field of regard, with minimal constraints on the direction in which it can be pointed (e.g. Earth/Sun pointing restrictions) (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p></list-item></list><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A plot illustrating the fraction of the year for which a given location in the sky (in equatorial coordinates) is visible to ARIEL, as seen from a representative operational orbit of ARIEL around L2.

These levels do not preclude the observation of brighter or fainter examples, and were only used to set the mission and payload requirements (“sizing” the mission). At the bright end, the stellar flux can potentially impact on the maximum sampling time for the detector readout, and also on the pointing stability requirements of the satellite itself; at the faint end, the target host stars play an important role in defining the performance requirements for the telescope, instruments and detectors and determines the accuracy of the fine pointing.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33"><bold>Calibration:</bold> Calibration (amplitude and wavelength) of spectra can be both relative and absolute.

Relative calibration between the various channels of the instrument is however critical.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>The target list</title><p id="Par34">Establishing the pool of potential targets from which the actual ARIEL target list would ultimately be drawn has been a key activity of the science team during the study. A static radiometric model was used to determine the signal-to-noise achievable for transit and occultation observations of individual and samples of targets. Based on conservative assumptions of the achievable mission/instrument performance, as appropriate to study phase, it was shown that the requirements on the numbers and diversity of targets in the ARIEL core sample could readily be met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Known targets already make up a diverse sample of exoplanets and host stars, with a pool from which the targets could be drawn that will continue to increase in breadth and number with the results of ongoing ground-based and space-based surveys as well as future planned space missions, in particular by the NASA TESS mission, to be launched in early 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Efficient scheduling of the large number of individual, time-critical transit events – needed to complete observations of the complete sample – would be essential to the success of the mission.

More generally, the main conditions that were used to constrain the launch window are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par59">No eclipses allowed during the mission lifetime (including the transfer and the 2 year mission extension), for thermal and power generation stability.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par60">Propellant-free injection into L2 to minimise propellant mass.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par61">An orbit amplitude around L2 ≤ 1.5 million km to minimise the S/C to Earth distance for the communications subsystem, leading to a Sun-S/C-Earth angle ≤45°.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par62">Due to the cryogenic nature of the ARIEL PLM placed on top of the SVM and the mid-day launch windows (i.e. facing the Sun), additional constraints are placed on the launch window to minimise the duration during which the PLM is exposed to direct Sun illumination.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par63">Concerning this last pointhowever, the MSR concluded that the impacts of this Sun illumination (modifications of materials and coatings on the PLM are needed to survive this phase, with an impact on the cryogenic performance, plus the need to test and qualify the PLM against this environmental condition) are severe and should be mitigated by investigating alternative scenarios where this constraint is no longer present.

The orbit transfer to L2 occurs within this Commissioning Phase. After completion of the LEOP activities the first Transfer Correction Manoeuvre (TCM) would be executed. Two further TCMs are foreseen with nominal arrival at operational orbit within 30 days of launch. Initial commissioning activities would be carried out during the transfer phase with completion of commissioning envisaged for 90 days after launch. The Commissioning Phase would be followed by another 90 days of instrument performance verification and science demonstration phase before the nominal science operations can start. Standard tasks to be undertaken during these phases would include commissioning of all the S/C subsystems and verification of the payload performance and calibration.</p><p id="Par68">The nominal science observing strategy for ARIEL is such that the average observation of a single science target will be in the order of 7.7 h with a separation of 70 degrees from the previous and next science target. The maximum observation time is in the order of 10 h. The required overall observation efficiency is ≥85%. Outages in this observation time are driven mainly by station keeping manoeuvres (approximately every 30 days), slews between targets and an allocation for safe modes.</p><p id="Par69">The ARIEL mission will be operated out of a single ESA Mission Operations Centre (MOC) located at ESOC in Darmstadt. X-Band will be used for telecommand uplink, real-time housekeeping downlink and the high rate stored housekeeping telemetry and science data telemetry downlink. Use of the ESA ESTRACK 35 m antenna network is planned to support these activities.</p><p id="Par70">For routine operations the ARIEL mission is foreseen to be operated in a highly autonomous way. The ARIEL mission on board capability is foreseen to handle simplified commanding for execution of slews between observations based on requested target position; reaction wheel momentum management will be controlled on board and all operations executed on board from preloaded mission timelines. This approach reduces the need for ground-based definition of the slew profiles and momentum management. The mission timelines are uplinked on a periodic basis (e.g. weekly) and the shortened pass durations (~14 h per week split in 3 passes) are primarily used for downlink of the science data and collection of tracking data needed for orbit determination. The orbit control is anticipated to be of a predictive nature allowing the mission to apply rule based planning for engineering windows for platform operations, this allows for the remaining science planning to be done on a long-term basis by the SOC. Thanks to a steerable Medium Gain Antenna (MGA), the ground station passes can be scheduled independently of the science observations, and these passes do not affect the observation efficiency as science observations and ground contact can be performed in parallel.</p><p id="Par71">The ARIEL mission will be designed for a nominal 4 year lifetime, resulting in a 3.5 year nominal science operations phase (after deduction of the commissioning and science performance verifications phases). Mission consumables are sized for an additional 2 year extended science operations phase. The ARIEL mission would be terminated with a de-orbiting and mission disposal phase where ARIEL would be removed from the L2 orbit and put in a heliocentric orbit with a very low probability for a return to Earth. This final decommissioning/disposal phase is foreseen to last up to 90 days.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Ground segment and science operations</title><p id="Par72">The ARIEL Ground Segment (GS) provides the means and resources with which to manage and control the mission via telecommands, to receive and process the telemetry from the satellite, and to produce, disseminate and archive the generated products.

The target list would be converted into a sequence of observations with high scheduling efficiency to maximize the scientific return.

The extraction of the final exoplanet spectra from the stacked target observations throughout the mission is under the responsibility of the IOSDC using state-of-the-art tools. These core science products would be delivered to the SOC for ingestion into the ARIEL archive hosted at ESAC. Re-processing of the data is foreseen when new calibration data would become available or new insights into processing steps require modifications to the pipeline modules. Cadence is currently foreseen to be approximately once per year.</p><p id="Par76">The ARIEL archive will be developed by ESA and would be the repository for all data associated with all phases of the mission, fulfilling the role of mission database and science data archive. Before launch it would be used for instrument-level testing and on-ground calibration. During operations it would be used to store raw telemetry, processed science data products, calibration products as well as relevant support data. The higher-level data products together with the relevant pipelines and calibration data would be made available to the scientific community through the archive based on the agreed data release policy (see section <xref rid="Sec28" ref-type="sec">7</xref>), with user support provided by SOC in close collaboration with the IOSDC. This will allow the scientific users to re-process the science data using their own preferred tools for exoplanet science if they so wish. Post-operations and following the archiving phase, final versions of all calibration files, data products and support data as well as processing software/pipelines including user documentation would reside in the archive as part of the long-term science data preservation plan of the science data archives at ESAC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Spacecraft design</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Design drivers</title><p id="Par77">The most stringent requirements applicable to the ARIEL mission are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par78">Wavelength range.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par79">Near photon noise limited system.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par80">Photometric stability of up to ~10<sup>−4</sup> or better (depending on the target).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par81">These requirements have the following system level impacts:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par82">The noise threshold over the wavelength range means low read out noise and low dark current Mercury-Cadmium-Telluride (HgCdTe) detectors operated at a temperature as low as ~40 K (for AIRS channel #1) are required.

The AOCS requirements are split into 2 main pointing modes: a coarse pointing mode and a fine pointing mode.</p><p id="Par101">The coarse pointing mode is achieved by only using the AOCS units accommodated in the SVM, with the star tracker as the main sensor and the reaction wheels as the sole actuactors (i.e. without the FGS in the control loop). This mode is used to slew between target stars. The resulting coarse Absolute Performance Error (APE) of 8″ across the LoS of the FGS channels is included in the sizing of the FGS Field of View (FoV). As such, this mode ensures the FGS can acquire the target star within its FoV, to then successfully transition to the fine pointing mode.</p><p id="Par102">The fine pointing mode is the precise pointing mode that will be used during observations of all science targets. It is achieved with the FGS in the control loop to provide fine pointing knowledge around the 2 axes across the LoS of the instruments, hybridised with the star trackers for a coarse determination of the attitude around the 3rd roll axis (pointing errors around the roll axis of the telescope/instruments are less constrained since ARIEL is observing a single target at a time in the centre of the FoV). The main fine pointing requirements achieved by the system across the instruments LoS are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par103">Fine APE ≤1”</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par104">Relative Performance Error (RPE) ≤ 200 mas up to 90 s</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par105">Performance Drift Error (PDE) ≤ 100 mas up to 10 h for integrations of 90 s</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par106">These requirements are applicable when observing bright targets. This is because the brighter the target is, the larger the photometric variation induced by a pointing variation is. As a corollary, for fainter targets, these pointing requirements are more relaxed (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). This benefits the AOCS subsystem, since the FGS centroiding error increases slightly with a lower input flux. The bright target pointing requirements given above are to be achieved with a specification on the FGS measurement error ≤ 20 mas at 10 Hz.</p><p id="Par107">Similarly to the coarse APE and the sizing of the FGS FoV, the fine APE is taken into account in the sizing of the entrance slits of both AIRS channels.</p><p id="Par108">The RPE contains all the high frequency jitter terms. Most of this jitter is un-resolved, because the detector read out rates are slower than most sources of high frequency jitter (FGS error at 10 Hz, reaction wheel and cryo-cooler micro-vibrations in the 10s to 100 s Hz range). This jitter induces a small blur of the large system PSF (driven by the telescope diffraction limit at approximately 3 μm), but does not result in photometric variations in the frequency range of the science observations.</p><p id="Par109">The PDE is the most important pointing requirement, as it translates directly into photometric variations that add to the instrument noise budget. As the PSF drifts on the focal plane detectors, the number of photons incident on the individual pixels will vary. This photometric variation is taken into account in the instrument noise and photometric stability budget. Since the PDE applies to very low frequencies (minutes to hours), it is more easily met than the RPE. The main phenomena that translate into attitude drifts in this frequency range are thermo-elastic errors due to changes in attitude of the S/C between targets (and therefore changes in attitude with respect to the Sun leading to different thermal loads on the S/C) and the Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP). In the case of ARIEL the SRP is more than one order of magnitude lower than that of typical astrophysics missions with telescopes that are accommodated vertically (e.g. Herschel or Euclid). This is because the horizontal accommodation of the PLM on the SVM allows for a well-balanced S/C which minimises the torque that originates from the misalignment between the centre of gravity of the S/C and the centre of pressure of the SRP. Any drifts occurring from thermo-elastic effects and the SRP are in any case seen by the FGS as it is operating at a much higher frequency, and are therefore corrected by the AOCS subsystem.</p><p id="Par110">While these fine pointing requirements impose the need for the FGS as a fine sensor in addition to the star trackers, they can still be met with reaction wheels as the sole actuators (i.e. no need for a fine pointing actuation system). To achieve this, the reaction wheels need to be operated in a narrow angular speed range, away from any peak vibration mode and away from any possible amplification frequency of the S/C structure (first modes, in the tens of Hz). This derives into the need to very frequently off-load the reaction wheel momentum to ensure they remain within this narrow operating range, as the angular speed will continuously be evolving as the wheels are constantly gaining momentum to counteract the SRP. This off-loading is performed with the propulsion subsystem and can be done as frequently as between every target observation, in parallel to the slew to the next science target. In addition, the reaction wheels could also be accommodated on dampers to minimise all high frequency micro-vibrations (in the hundreds of Hz) as an additional mitigation measure, as such high frequency terms cannot be accurately predicted at a Phase A level.</p><p id="Par111">Similarly, the micro-vibrations from the cryo-cooler must be controlled to ensure they do not excite any structural mode of the S/C and are sufficiently damped. With the capability to fine tune and adjust the exact operating frequency of the cooler compressors to within a few Hertz, this enables the cryo-cooler to comply with the pointing budgets allocations.</p><p id="Par112">Based on this, all the fine pointing requirements have been demonstrated to be met. The only exception is the RPE which becomes marginal when also taking into the reaction wheel spikes (more accurately referred to as friction torque variations) when observing bright targets (faint targets are fine with the more relaxed RPE requirement). Such spikes have been measured on past missions and this is considered as a complex phenomenon that is due to multi-body interactions of the different balls and the distribution of lubricant within the bearing. Several mitigation measures are possible to overcome this problem, but the current baseline simply involves accepting that the science frames taken during suck spikes are lost, as this phenomenon would be sufficiently infrequent to still allow the mission to be compliant with the overall observation efficiency requirement (see section <xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">4.2</xref>).</p><p id="Par113">The propulsion system is a simple mono-propellant system (hydrazine) that is based around standard qualified off-the-shelf components (typically 1 to 20 N thrusters depending on the industrial Contractor). All thrusters are redundant, and provide control of the S/C around the 3 rotational degrees of freedom for reaction wheels off-loading and safe modes, as well as thrust for orbital correction manoeuvres.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>SVM electrical architecture</title><p id="Par114">The power subsystem uses standard qualified off-the-shelf components. Solar cells are accommodated on the bottom floor of the SVM which provides sufficient area to cover the needs of the mission without requiring deployable Solar arrays. The required packaging ratio of the cells leave sufficient areas for all the other units accommodated under the SVM (e.g. antennas and mechanism, Sun sensors etc.). Since the orbit is eclipse-free, batteries are only necessary during the launch phase.</p><p id="Par115">The communication subsystem uses X-band only, with at least 2 Low Gain Antennas (LGA) distributed around the S/C to provide a full 4π steradian sky view to allow for S/C recovery in case of a safe mode or loss of attitude. These antennas provide only a low bit rate and can therefore only be used for such recovery cases and for uplink telecommands. For science data downlink, a high bit rate is achieved with a MGA located on the bottom of the SVM. It is accommodated on a 2 DoF mechanism to ensure that ground contact can be achieved whatever the attitude of the S/C. This enables parallel data downlink and science observations to optimise the observation efficiency budget. More importantly, it relieves any constraint on the observation plan (as the transit/eclipse observations are time critical) while allowing for fixed pre-planned ground contact times and durations in order to simplify the MOC schedule and keep the operations cost low. Any of the 3 ESA 35 m antennas (Cebreros, Malargue and New Norcia) is suitable, selection will be made closer to the launch date when the antennas’ usage are better known. 14 h of ground contact are planned every week, split in 3 passes of ~ 4 h to 6 h.

This implies that all final qualification tests are conducted on a S/C PFM. Such an approach carries an acceptable amount of risk and avoids having to produce and pay for two full S/C models in parallel (one for testing / qualification and one for launch). To consider environmental tests only at final S/C FM level would further decrease the cost but would increase the risks to a level that is no longer acceptable (i.e. large cost impact if a test fails so late in the development phase and results in the need for re-design and re-qualification).</p><p id="Par125">The PFM model is typically supported by additional models earlier in the development plan. The following models are baselined:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par126">an Avionics Model (AVM) to verify the electrical and electronics interfaces</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par127">a Structural Thermal Model (STM) to de-risk the structural and thermal design with a focus on environmental testing</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par128">a Performance Verification Model (PVM) of the PLM only under the responsibility of the payload Consortium.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par129">Some major payload design aspects will also be de-risked earlier (starting in Phase A and continuing in Phase B1) in the program using development models where possible within the programmatic constraints.</p><p id="Par130">The AVM will integrate Engineering Models (EMs) of the payload warm electronics elements (e.g. M2 mechanism electronics, Instrument and FGS Control Units, cryo-cooler drive electronics) that will be delivered to the S/C prime and assembled with the SVM AVM model. This model typically enables to check all the functional and electrical (power, data and communications) interfaces between all units, to verify the functionality of the avionics including the on-board software and the AOCS closed control loop (which will require a simulator of the FGS output).</p><p id="Par131">The STM allows to qualify the structure and demonstrate the thermal performance of the design. The SVM and PLM can each have a separate STM model that will be developed and tested in parallel. Mating these models into a single S/C STM is potentially not required due to the clear mechanical and thermal interface and different temperature conditions experienced by both modules. Based on heritage and fidelity of the structural and thermal analysis tools, the SVM STM could potentially be considered unnecessary, leaving the full qualification of the SVM structural and thermal design only to the PFM with an acceptable risk.</p><p id="Par132">In addition to the AVM and STM, an additional PVM is baselined by the Consortium early in the development process, so as not to leave the full performance testing of the payload (including optics and detectors) in cryogenic conditions too late in the development process. This model will be stand-alone, i.e. will not require any other S/C or SVM units and models to mate and interface with, and as such does not require to interface with the industrial contracts and be delivered to the S/C prime. It may include flight spares for the telescope mirrors and will use engineering models of the detector (functionally representative in terms of performance, but not flight grade) and will enable performance validation of the payload in cryogenic conditions (although some simplifications might be possible, e.g. depending on the need or not for straylight verification, the mirrors’ roughness could be relaxed if not affecting the PSF quality, enabling a faster development/polishing time at a reduced cost), and more importantly validation of all payload performance software models based on correlation between test data and analysis results. If enhanced with some SVM elements, it could also be used to validate the micro-vibrations impact on the instrument LoS.</p><p id="Par133">The final model is the PFM. It will be built from the SVM and PLM PFM models that will then be assembled together. The FM units of all payload units (telescope, instrument, cryo-cooler etc.) will be included, aligned and functionally tested in operating conditions at PLM PFM level only. Therefore, no cryogenic or optical test is needed at full S/C PFM level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Technology development activities</title><p id="Par134">A number of Technology Development Activities are running for ARIEL, some managed by ESA and others by the payload Consortium. They all relate to payload developments, as no need for any new technology has been identified on the SVM. Some of these are developments that are required in the baseline design, while others are only back-ups or nice-to-have for enhanced performance (these latter ones are not included in the list below). The objective of these activities is to ensure that all elements of the ARIEL design have reached a TRL ≥ 6 by mission adoption at the end of the Phase B1 study, which is expected no earlier than Q4/2018. These are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par135">Development of an Aluminium path finder telescope mirror.

The choice of targets shall meet the science requirements that govern the target sample, and will be made before launch. Inputs will be solicited from the wider community (e.g. through whitepapers, meetings, and other mechanisms) that will be kept informed about the status of the target list, as will the ESA Advisory Structure whose feedback will be solicited. By the time of launch it will have evolved into a description of the final nominal pre-launch ARIEL target list, however, it can – and should – evolve during the mission if there are compelling scientific reasons, such as e.g. including previously unknown particularly interesting targets and actual mission in-flight performance.</p><p id="Par140">ARIEL is an ESA mission with Consortium lead, it is recognized that ARIEL data and science will be of interest to a large community of ‘external’ exoplanetary scientists, and there is a strong wish to embrace them. The intention is to provide high quality data products in a timely manner and to have a continuous dialogue with the wider community, ultimately maximising the science that can be achieved by the mission.</p><p id="Par141">The last step before commencing the nominal science operations of the mission will be the on-orbit performance verification and science demonstration phase, lasting no more than 3 months. The data from this phase will be released as soon (1-month TBC) as practical after observing, and a public workshop will be organized in connection to the data (levels 1 and 2) release.</p><p id="Par142">In the nominal science operations phase the ARIEL observing strategy will be to observe the targets in three tiers as described in chapter 2. The data will be pipeline processed to different levels of data products labelled ‘raw telemetry’ (level 0), ‘raw spectral frame cubes’ (level 1), ‘target (star + planet) spectra’ (level 2), and ‘individual planet spectra’ (level 3, respectively.</p><p id="Par143">Datasets up to and including level 2 products for Tier 1 targets will be released quarterly, the objective is to achieve this 1 month after the end of each calendar quarter, e.g. 1 May for Q1 etc. Early in the mission this delay may need to be longer, if this is the case this interval will be reduced to 1 month as soon as possible as the mission progresses and a more complete understanding of the instrument characteristics, calibration needs and data processing/correction or systematics is gained.</p><p id="Par144">Datasets up to and including level 2 products for Tier 2 and Tier 3 targets will be released similarly, after each semester where the required signal-to-noise (SNR) and spectral resolution for a particular target requiring multiple observations has been achieved. Early in the mission this delay may need to be longer, until the calibration needs and the knowledge needed for data processing and correction of systematics are fully understood.</p><p id="Par145">Release of associated ancillary data, pipeline input files, and similar will be performed in connection with the above-mentioned releases.</p><p id="Par146">In addition, level 3 products will be produced and publicly released. These are not pipeline products but involve manual processing, and require a good understanding of ARIEL data, their instrumental signatures, and any possible peculiarities that will only be obtained once in orbit. It is in the interest of the ARIEL consortium to have level 3 data processed, published and released soon and frequently. It is foreseen to provide level 3 products at least on an annual basis, and sooner/more frequently when the knowledge to produce them is firmly in hand.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusions of the Ariel mission selection review</title><p id="Par147">The main conclusions of the MSR were (full details in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]):</p><p id="Par148">Technical aspects:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par149">The mission design was considered to be feasible and adequate to meet the mission requirements.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par150">At SVM level, no critical item was identified.
