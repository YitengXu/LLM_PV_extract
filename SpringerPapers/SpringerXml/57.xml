</title><p id="Par1">The average global temperature has increased by approximately 0.7 °C since the last century. If the current trend continues, the temperature may further increase by 1.4 – 4.5 °C until 2100. It is estimated that air-conditioning and refrigeration systems contribute about 15% of world electrical energy demand. The rapid depletion of non-renewable resources such as fossil fuels and the associated emissions lead to the development of alternative solutions which employ renewable energy resources for refrigeration. The conventional vapour compression (VC) and vapour absorption (or adsorption) (VA) refrigeration systems usually rely on fossil fuels for their operation which ultimately leads to large amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. Thermoelectric (TE) refrigeration systems working on the principle of Peltier effect are an alternative for the conventional systems. The thermoelectric refrigerators will not produce any noise and vibration due to the absence of any moving parts. They are refrigerant-free as electrons act as heat carriers. The greatest advantage of a TE system is that it can directly be powered by solar photovoltaic (PVs) since they give a DC output. The main drawback of thermoelectric refrigeration system is their low coefficient of performance (COP). The COP of a thermoelectric cooler (TEC) operating with a temperature difference of 20 °C is about 0.5. The improvement of heat transfer at the hot side of the cooler is a key aspect for a better COP. A good thermoelectric material should possess high Seebeck coefficient, low-thermal conductivity, and high electrical conductivity. Since these three are interrelated, these parameters must be optimized. It is important to reduce the electric contact and thermal resistances and get an optimized configuration of thermoelectric cooler. The recent developments in material science has enabled the usage of better thermoelectric materials with a positive Thomson coefficient to produce a better cooling performance. The total efficiency of a TEC powered by solar cell is the product of PV system efficiency and the COP of the cooler. Therefore, the enhancement of PV system efficiency and the selection of materials with better thermoelectric performance are important in the design of solar-powered thermoelectric cooler. The performance of solar cell-powered TEC depends on solar insolation which varies with weather, climate, and geographic location. Due to the variation in insolation and unavailability of solar power in the night, a battery must be used to store the energy. This paper presents a comprehensive review about the thermoelectric coolers and the dependance of performance of TECs on various operating and design parameters. The results reported for the performance improvement of solar PV-powered thermoelectric coolers were critically analysed.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Thermoelectric</kwd><kwd>Solar</kwd><kwd>Coolers</kwd><kwd>Photovoltaic</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>14</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/44189_2023_Article_22.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering Thermodynamics, Heat and Mass Transfer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Thermodynamics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The average global surface temperature has escalated by 1.09 °C in 2011 – 2020 above that in 1850 – 1900 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Anthropogenic climate change has caused extensive adverse impacts, associated losses and damages to nature and people, and includes more frequent and intense extreme events, beyond natural climate variability. If global warming surpasses 1.5 °C in the next decades or later, it is predicted that many human and ecological systems will encounter additional severe threats, some of which may even be irreversible. Realizing these threats, the international community decided to take steps to stop or at least slow down global warming and climate change, the result of which led to efforts such as Kyoto Protocol (1997). It is a legally enforceable disposition under which industrialized countries had to lower their aggregate greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% in comparison with the year 1990 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The most important of these was reduction of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions which is an inexorable derivate of many industrial activities.</p><p id="Par3">The global human population is increasing at an exponential rate and is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 and 10.9 billion by 2100 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The population growth has increased the demand on building sector, and it is estimated that approximately 50% of natural materials are utilized to build structures and related amenities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In a building, heating ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) are found to consume most of the energy for cooling and heating purposes. The rising demand for refrigeration and air-conditioning has resulted in a rise in electricity production and associated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. According to the International Institute of Refrigeration in Paris, various refrigeration and air-conditioning applications consume 15% of global electricity, and the energy consumed for air-conditioning in various households and commercial buildings accounts for nearly 40% of the total. Most of the energy comes from non-renewable energy sources, mainly fossil fuels. The accelerated consumption and utilization of fossil fuels cause severe environmental and energy issues such as global warming, ozone layer depletion, atmospheric pollution, and global energy crisis. One of the hardest hit industries by the Kyoto Protocol was the refrigeration industry, as most of the refrigerants being used at that time were having huge global warming potential (GWP). All these problems are forcing us to look for alternative cleaner solutions for refrigeration and air-conditioning.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Conventional refrigeration and air-conditioning systems</title><p id="Par4">The most used refrigeration and air-conditioning systems today are vapour compression (VC) and vapour absorption (VA) systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Vapour compression systems have high coefficient of performance (COP) in the range of 2–3 for commercial systems. They are comparatively cheaper and have large cooling capacities. All these desirable characteristics make them the most attractive refrigeration and air-conditioning system today. They use a compressor for its operation, which makes the system noisy in certain applications. Vapour compression systems use refrigerants that are derivatives of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) or hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) which has high GWP and ozone depletion potential (ODP). Due to this reason, the VC systems may be slowly phased out in the future. Even though modern VC systems use environment-friendly refrigerants having very low GWP and zero ODP, their COP is found to be less than that of the previously used refrigerants.</p><p id="Par5">VA system works on heat-operated cycle and is mostly used in industries where waste heat is available. They have an absorber/adsorber and generator in place of a compressor and hence are least noisy in operation. Their COP varies with applications and are generally found to be less than that of VC systems and close to 1. VA systems are bulkier in construction and are more costly compared to VC systems for the same cooling capacity.</p><p id="Par6">There are some other non-conventional refrigeration and air-conditioning systems like thermoelectric (TE) systems, magnetic cooling systems, thermo-acoustic refrigeration systems, electrochemical refrigeration systems, and ejector refrigeration systems which are all very promising technologies which are still in the development phase and not used widely for commercial uses.</p><p id="Par7">It is estimated that air-conditioning and refrigeration systems contribute about 15% of world electrical energy demand.

In 1821, Thomas Johann Seebeck, a German physicist, found that when two or more dissimilar conductors are joined together and the junctions are kept at different temperatures, an electromotive force (emf) and consequently an electric current are produced in the conductors. This phenomenon is called the “Seebeck effect.” The reverse of Seebeck effect where electrical energy can be converted to thermal energy for cooling and heating is called Peltier effect and was discovered in 1834 by the French Physicist Jean Charles Athanase Peltier.</p><p id="Par10">Altenkirch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] was the first to present the theory of thermoelectric power production and refrigeration. In 1911, Altenkirch derived the thermoelectric efficiency, which is now referred to as the thermoelectric figure of merit (Z) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thermoelectric industry started developing rapidly in the 1950s with the emergence of new materials, especially semiconductors, which proved to be far superior compared to dissimilar metals used at that time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

When the cooling power of the TEACs is increased by increasing the input current, a larger quantity of heat is generated at the hot side of the TEM. A solution to this problem was to use liquid cooling systems to efficiently dissipate heat to higher surface areas. A closed-loop system circulating the liquid coolant is proposed which operates under modest pressure difference. The coolant used in this study is distilled water with 100–200 ppm sodium chromate as corrosion inhibitor. An antifreeze, ethylene glycol (5% vol) is added to prevent problems associated with freezing of the coolant such as pipe bursts.

It was observed that perforating the heat sink increased the COP of the air cooler, especially for lower values of input power. The perforations escalate the turbulence level of air flow and promotes additional mixing of fluid. Moreover, perforations decrease the material of the heat sink which changes the temperature gradient along the fins and changes its thermal behavior. It could be noted that perforating the heat sink improved the COP of the cooler between 25 and 50% depending on the air flow rate and input power. Using a spring wire as turbulator has even greater effect and improves the COP to around 130%. In fact, using the spring wire turbulator, maximum mixing of the fluid takes place, beyond which further mixing does not improve the COP. In other words, spring wire completely discharges the accumulated cooling capacity in the heat sink. Spring wire creates the required friction between heat sink and air so that complete possible heat transfer takes place between them. The average hydraulic diameter of the air passage is lowered by the spring wire perforator, which in turn increases the Reynold’s number which again contributes to higher heat transfer. Spring wire makes the cold surface warmer, which indicates that maximum heat has been absorbed from the air. The influence of water flow rate, air flow rate, incoming air, and water temperature was also studied.</p><p id="Par81">Shen et al.

This occurs due to the delay of thermal diffusion of Joule heat. On one hand, Peltier effect occurs locally and is restricted to the junctions of TE elements, and on the other hand, Joule heat occurs volumetrically. Peltier effect helps to develop the instantaneous temperature reduction.</p><p id="Par88">There are many time constants like the time to reach minimum temperature (TRM), the time that TEM remains at the minimum temperature (holding time), and the time needed for the TEM to arrive at the steady-state temperature after the transient current applied is removed.

Usually in the urban areas, a microclimate different from nearby areas is developed which increases the overall temperature, forming heat islands which in turn increases the use of air-conditioning in urban buildings. Cooling of pavements using TECs has been found effective in mitigating the heat islands formed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par95">The conventional refrigeration systems like vapour compression and vapour absorption systems depends on fossil fuels for their operation and use gases with high global warming potential (GWP) as refrigerants. Therefore, scientists across the world are trying to develop alternative cooling solutions including the thermoelectric refrigerators. The combustion of fossil fuels liberates greenhouse gases and contributes to global warming. Moreover, the vapour compression system cannot be operated at a place where electricity is not available. Since solar energy is freely available in sufficient quantity, a solar-powered thermoelectric cooler working on Peltier effect is a better alternative for the conventional system. Thermoelectric cooler is a noise-free and vibration less system because of the absence of moving parts. They do not use a refrigerant, and electrons act as heat carriers. A better temperature control is possible in a thermoelectric cooler. Their unique advantages like refrigerant-free operation and ability to operate in both cooling and heating mode combined with their portability, noise-free operation, and reliability make TECs an attractive choice. They are finding increasing applications in portable refrigerators, air-conditioners in zero energy buildings, automobile industry, etc. Solar-powered thermoelectric refrigerator can be operated as standalone portable reliable refrigerator for the transport and storage of vaccine and medicine and for the storage of perishables.</p><p id="Par96">Solar PV-powered TEC is the best option for niche cooling applications like storage and transport of vaccines, medicines, and other perishables in remote and rural areas where grid connectivity is not available. Some innovative applications like solar-driven cool pavement where solar PVs are used to drive TECs that cool pavements in urban areas are also being reported.</p><p id="Par97">The reported energy efficiency of the solar-powered thermoelectric refrigerators is lower than its compressor counterparts. There are two main approaches to achieve performance enhancement of TECs: improving the intrinsic efficiency of the materials used as thermoelectric material and improving the thermal design of TECs. The performance improvement can be achieved through improving module contact resistance, thermal interfaces, and heat sinks. At present, the figure of merit of thermoelectric material ZT is about 0.7. It should be further increased by the selection of better thermoelectric material.</p><p id="Par98">In this paper, a comprehensive review of studies aiming at performance improvement of solar-powered thermoelectric cooler is presented. The performance of the solar-powered TEC depends strongly on the intensity of solar insolation and the temperature difference between the hot and cold sides of the thermoelectric module. Better COP was reported for a TEC by providing minichannel water-cooled heat sinks on the hot side and heat dissipators on the cold side. The cooling performance of a segmented thermoelectric element was found to be superior than that of traditional TECs.</p><p id="Par99">The performance of the solar-powered thermoelectric refrigerator system is highly dependent on the thermoelectric material used in it. A good thermoelectric material should possess high Seebeck coefficient, low-thermal conductivity, and high electrical conductivity. The optimization of the thermoelectric material performance is achieved by reducing the material thermal conductivity especially the lattice thermal conductivity. Even though promising results are reported in the literature, further improvement of COP should be achieved by the development and selection of better thermoelectric materials and a superior thermal design of TECs.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions
