Nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary field that combines science and technology with aims to develop new and improved materials with significant functions, physical and chemical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Material at this scale has unique properties compared to the same matters at higher dimensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For this reason, various innovative applications through nanotechnology can be explored in many disciplines.</p><p id="Par94">Not only as a technology enabler, nanotechnology can also be a driver towards achieving national economic growth. The forest products industry in Malaysia contributes around RM22.5 billion value of export in 2019 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Wood products exported from Malaysia include sawn timbers, veneers, plywoods and mouldings. The wood-based industry in Malaysia has the opportunity to fully exploit the nanotechnology to its own advantages. It is imperative that the effort to apply nanotechnology in the wood-based industry particularly in Malaysia is supported and given attention in order to diversify and add value to the existing timber products which eventually will boost the economic growth in this arena.</p><p id="Par95">The fact that forest plays an essential role for civilisation for so many years cannot be ruled out as it has become the source of lignocellulosic materials for various product exploitations and development. As a matter of fact, wood products have long been available in the society in the form of timbers, furniture, papers and many other functional materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The application of nanotechnology in forestry sector particularly in forest products or wood-based products warrants an attention from all related players and stakeholders. Nanotechnology utilisation could result in stronger, multifunctional yet lighter wood-based products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Traditional forest products such as pulp and paper, wood composites, wood coatings and wood preservatives can be expanded or transformed into new or valued added products to find broader and/or more advanced applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par96">In this review paper, the application of nanotechnology in wood-based products industry can be divided into two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] pathways:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par97">Derivation of nanomaterial(s) from the forest</p><p id="Par98">Increasing concerns with respect to the environment have triggered an immense need to introduce sustainable and biodegradable nanosized material. This new material called nanocellulose can be produced from forest resources in a safe and sustainable manner. The abundance of lignocellulosic material from the forest has created a surge of interest to convert cellulose to nanocellulose. Nanocellulose is principally cellulose at molecular level that has several key features such as high strength and stiffness, high strength-to-weight ratio, electromagnetic response and a large surface area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The outstanding characteristics of this material offer huge application potentials beyond forest products industry itself. In wood-based product area, it can be applied as a reinforcing agent in pulp and paper and wood composite or as a coating material in wood coating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Due to its versatility, nanocellulose could be used as one of the components (as substrate, stabiliser, electrode) for non-forest products sector such as electronics, sensors, batteries, food, pharmaceutical and cosmetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par99">Use of nanomaterial(s) for wood-based products</p><p id="Par100">Nanomaterials could be used to enhance existing wood-based products in terms of its functionality. For example, the use of nanomaterial in wood coating such as nanozinc oxide or nanotitanium oxide can enhance the functionality of the wood in terms of its durability, fire resistance and UV absorption as well as decrease of water absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. On the other hand, the application of nanoencapsulation in wood preservative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] could improve the impregnation of wood with pesticides by ensuring that chemicals can penetrate deeper into the wood, thus reducing the issue of excessive leaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This improves the durability of treated woods against biodegradation agents.</p></list-item></list>
A number of review articles on the application of nanotechnology in forestry and forest products have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. An article by McCrank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] gives an overall overview of nanotechnology application in forest sector, whereas Moon et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] discuss more on nanoindentation. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are limited publications on this topic particularly covering selected sectors of wood-based industry. This review paper will provide a highlight on the recent progress of nanotechnology applications on the selected wood-based sectors, namely pulp and paper, wood composite, wood coating and wood durability. Moreover, some potential applications of nanocellulose being a new generation of cellulose in wood-based products industry are also highlighted in areas such as energy and sensor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Applications</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Pulp and Paper</title><p id="Par101">The annual production of paper and paperboard worldwide is more than 400 million tonnes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It shows that the current digital era has not stopped the continual use of paper products in the community. Nevertheless, the rising demand is mostly for various packaging products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This rise may be spurred by the shift of consumer preference over online shopping and the boost of e-commerce that gives such convenience to shop at the comfort of one’s home and has the product delivered safely to the intended recipients.</p><p id="Par102">Paper is made from lignocellulosic materials that have undergone a series of primary processing, treatment, papermaking, drying and coating. The papermaking stage is where all the mixing of pulp and additives is added and adjusted to suit different end products. Nanotechnology is applied in pulp and paper in the form of nanomaterials or nanoadditives. For example, forest resources or rather lignocellulosic materials can be exploited to extract the nanosized building block or known as nanocellulose that serves as a reinforcement unit to provide unique mechanical strength, functionality and flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This new generation of cellulose is produced via cell wall delamination to obtain nanofibril or by extraction of crystalline cellulose at the nanoscale. Nanocellulose is added into papermaking mainly to increase the paper strength. Other nanomaterials used during paper production process include nanosilica, nanozeolite and etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The incorporation of nanomaterials or nanoadditives in paper industry can help to improve the performance of the paper products.</p><p id="Par103">Main additives used or can potentially be used in the pulp and paper industry are discussed in the following sections.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Nanocellulose as Wet or Dry Strength Agent</title><p id="Par104">Nanocellulose has been extensively studied as a strength additive in pulp and paper field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Nanocellulose is getting tremendous interests due to its abundance, availability and also because of its interesting characteristics such as biodegradable, low toxicity, excellent mechanical and optical properties, high surface area and renewability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Nanocellulose is actually cellulose at a nanoscale dimension which can be isolated and prepared from any lignocellulosic materials that includes wood pulp, non-wood plants, wood and agricultural residues, bacterial cellulose and tunicates. Cellulose is a linear compound with β-1,4 linked glucose units that comprises crystalline and amorphous regions. The removal of amorphous domains from cellulose chain using mineral acid leads to the isolation of nanocrystalline cellulose, whereas cell wall delamination via high shear mechanical action results in the reduction of cellulose width thus forming nanofibrillated cellulose. These two categories of nanocellulose are the most studied nanomaterial in pulp and paper field for product enhancement. For the last decade, numerous works have been focused on the preparation of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) and nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) from various plant resources.

Nanofibrillated cellulose is prepared by subjecting fibres to selective high shear mechanical treatments. There are many methods and combination of methods to produce nanofibrillated cellulose. Homogenisation and microfluidisation are the common techniques used for nanofibrillated cellulose preparation which involves subjecting the fibres into a small nozzle under high pressure for repeated passes usually between 10 and 15 passes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This type of treatment if used alone requires high energy consumption, thus pre-treatment with chemicals such as TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl)-mediated oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], carboxymethylation or enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] is usually required to save energy. Using this method, the nanofibrillated cellulose is produced as a result of high shear rates induced by high velocity and force from the fluid stream. Another popular method to produce nanofibrillated cellulose is via the grinding method. The grinding machine consists of static and rotating stone disks. The shearing force generated by the stones breaks down the cell wall fibres to individualised nanofibrils. To avoid a wide distribution in width using this method due to aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], the authors recommended that the feedstocks need to be kept in water after pulping and bleaching processes. This is to hinder the formation of hydrogen bond network when it is at a dry state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The ultrasonication method has also been studied to prepare nanofibres. Sonication involves the generation of cavitational high shear force from ultrasonic waves which can break down the fibre cell structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The sonication technique is said to produce well-dispersed and stable nanofibres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Besides that, cryo-crushing can also be applied to convert native fibres to nanofibres. The fibres need to be frozen using liquid nitrogen followed by high shear forces. The high shear force induced pressure on the ice crystals that force cell walls to rupture and release the microfibril [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par107">Nanocrystalline cellulose extracted from native cellulose is commonly prepared using acid hydrolysis. Other methods involving the use of specific chemical such as TEMPO-mediated oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and ionic liquids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] have also been studied for nanocellulose preparation. An application of cellulase enzyme has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par108">During acid hydrolysis, the degree of polymerisation of cellulose decreases rapidly, but it stabilises at some point known as the level off degree of polymerisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The reason for this behaviour could be due to amorphous regions being rapidly hydrolysed by the acid. As hydrolysis starts, acid preferably attacks the amorphous region due to its high volume and hydrolyses the easily accessible glycosidic bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Once it hydrolyses the easily accessible bond, further hydrolysis occurs at a much slower rate at the reducing end of the glucose chain and on crystalline region surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].

The enhancement results in fibre bonding ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Boufi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] proposed the mechanism may be due to the increase in bonded area as a result of nanocellulose acting as a connector between fibres that leads to fibre-to-fibre bonding. Besides that, it could be also due to different networks created in the fibre that results in the increase in bonding capability. Given the micrometer length of nanocellulose they can act as a bridge to connect the neighbouring fibres that leads to stronger network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

It was found that an increase of 5% tensile strength was observed when 3% NFC was added into the pulp furnish composed of beaten pulp together with cationic starch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It is interesting to note that the effect was more remarkable if the pulp is less beaten. For instance, more than 100% increase in tensile strength when 6% NFC was added to thermomechanical pulp. On the other hand, NFC had a lesser impact when added onto well beaten chemical pulp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Thus, enhancement in tensile is expected to occur when NFC is added into filled paper, mechanical pulp and recycled pulp. Hii et al.

The only major shortcoming of using NFC in papermaking is that it makes the drainage slower. Drainage plays a very much important role in papermaking as it directly relates to the efficiency of paper production. The slower the drainage time, the slower the paper will be produced. It is therefore very important to use retention agent at specific dosage to improve the adsorption of the nanofibres on the surface of the fibre, thus leading to improved dewatering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].</p><p id="Par112">NFC has properties in between of dry strength additive such as starch and fines created from the action of beating as both of them lead to increase the bonded area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

Petroleum-based polymers are generally divided into thermoplastic and thermosetting types.

However, wood is subjected to intense oxidative degradation processes such as photo-oxidation, chemical oxidation, thermal decomposition and photolysis reactions from the environment, including ultraviolet (UV) light, moisture, chemical pollutant and heat/cold variations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. Even non-wood materials like bamboo itself is a natural organic material which is rich in protein, carbohydrate and other nutrients and is prone to mildew, being eaten by moths and rotting. Hence, the final products of wood and non-wood products conventionally comprise additives which can be used as coatings for protection and aesthetic appearance improvement, preservatives for protection against fire and biological factors (fungi and insects).</p><p id="Par131">Coating is a process of applying a layer to the substrate surface. Examples of common coatings applied to wood surfaces are varnishes, lacquers, and paints whose purpose can be both protective and decorative. The main components of the coatings determine their fundamental properties such as binders, pigments, solvents, fillers, and additives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]. Each element contributes specific properties to the wood surface. The binder contributes to the adhesion of the pigment to the wood and creates a protective layer, while the pigment provides colour and form non-translucent surface layer. The solvents give necessary viscosity for coating application, and the addition of the fillers alters the colour strength and the gloss of the coating. As for the additives, they inhibit mould and decay, assist the drying process, improve the adhesion properties and control the finishing. However, there are weaknesses of coatings such as limited flexibility, strength loss, disproportionate adhesion between coating layer and substrate, inferior abrasion resistance and less durability.</p><p id="Par132">Nanocoating has the capability to resolve these issues. Nanocoating is a process by which a thin layer of thickness about &lt; 100 nm is deposited on the substrate for improving some properties or for imparting new functionality. The nanocoating can be used not only on nanomaterials but also on a bulkier material with an extremely thin layer coating without affecting the topography of the substrate surface. The application of nanocoating in wood and wood products is mainly focused on the improvement of durability, mechanical properties, fire resistance and UV absorption as well as decrease in water absorption. One approach to enhance the functionality and the end user value of nanocoating is the addition of nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>]. These nanoparticles have very large surface-to-volume ratios due to their morphology, which allows them to interact intensively with their surroundings, and their nanosize ensures transparency is still sustained.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Nanoadditive for Durability Improvement</title><p id="Par133">Nanocoatings are able to improve the durability of wood and non-wood products by utilising nanoparticles and nanodelivery systems that make the changes at the molecular level of the products. One of the aims of coatings is to prevent the growth of various microorganisms like fungi and bacteria. Nanosized particles of metal oxides, such as zinc oxide (ZnO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>], titanium oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>] and cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>] were reported to demonstrate strong antimicrobial properties. Studies have been conducted in the direct deposition of nanoparticles onto wood surfaces or direct functionalisation of wood surfaces with nanoparticles. ZnO nanoparticles were successfully fabricated on the surface of bamboo timber by a simple low-temperature wet chemical method based on sol–gel-prepared ZnO seed layers. The findings indicated that the treated bamboo timber had better resistance against <italic>Aspergillus niger V.

Graphene also demonstrates superior ability to inhibit bacterial growth. Hence, the combination of utilising reduced graphene oxide and nano-ZnO to coat bamboo-based outdoor materials via a two-step dip-dry and hydrothermal process, resulting in the improvement of the mould resistance and antibacterial activity properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>]. Similarly, the nanostructured ZnO using a hydrothermal process has also provided an effective protection of wood surfaces from biodeterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>].</p><p id="Par134">Waterborne polyurethane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>] coatings (WPU) incorporated with nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were used to improve antibacterial property of wood board [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>]. The AgNPs were known for their antimicrobial material but aggregated easily during the preparation process. Therefore, NCC was introduced to assist with the blending and dispersibility of AgNPs with WPU or other coatings. In addition, NCC was also a good reinforcing agent to improve the mechanical properties of nanocomposites. Mini emulsion polymerisation was also used to synthesise an acrylic latex coating containing AgNPs, which will limit the growth of black-stain fungi on the wood surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>]. The study of the antibacterial effect of silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles in acrylic coatings applied during the treatment of commercial wooden composites such as particleboard and medium density fibreboard was conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>].

This is due to the hydrophilic nature of the cell wall constituent polymer and its capillary-porous structure. The interaction between wood and water leads to biodegradation of wood, dimensional instability and accelerated weathering. Although there are conventional chemical modifications being used to improve the hydrophobicity of wood, the accessibility of water into wood is still not completely retarded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>]. Furthermore, the chemicals used in the treatment process are possibly hazardous. Hence, nanotechnology is used as an alternative approach for wood modification and functionalisation. The incorporation of nanoparticles into polymeric coatings is used to improve water absorption of wood surfaces. Two approaches are utilised to integrate the nanoparticles into the coatings, namely solution blending and in situ addition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>]. The first approach (solution blending) is when a solvent combines with the polymer before being dispersed onto the wood surfaces. This physical method can be applied through dipping, brushing and spraying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>]. Wu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>] reported that a superhydrophobic coating was constructed on the surface of poplar wood with a contact angle of up to 158.4° through the waterborne UV lacquer product (WUV) which was modified by ZnO nanoparticles and stearic acid. Compared with WUV, the water resistance of zinc stearate/waterborne UV lacquer super-hydrophobic coating (ZnSt<sub>2</sub>/WUV) was stronger, which was conducive to prepare superhydrophobic coatings in an easy and environmentally friendly. Interestingly, a water-based varnish added with TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles was used to evaluate the finishing of nine tropical wood species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>]. It was found that the incorporation of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles decreased the values of water absorption and after a year of weathering exposure, the varnish with no added TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles degraded completely, while the modified varnish film endured. Other examples of superhydrophobic wood coatings which were successfully prepared are lignin-coated nanocrystalline cellulose (L-NCC) particles/polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) composite paint system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>], UV-light curable methacrylic-siloxane-cellulose composite coatings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>], Fe<sup>3+</sup>-doped SiO<sub>2</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> composite film [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>] and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/silica hybrid coating system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>].</p><p id="Par136">The second approach is the in situ addition or a chemical process which involves compound addition directly to monomers and subsequent polymerisation. The nanoparticles are synthesised in situ by chemical reactions on the wood surface such as hydrothermal methods or solgel deposition. Gao et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>] applied a simple and effective method in preparing superhydrophobic conductive wood surface with super oil repellency using AgNPs modified by fluoroalkyl silane. The multifunctional coating could be commercialised for various applications, especially for self-cleaning and biomedical electronic devices. In another study, bamboo was treated using ZnO sol, and the ZnO nanosheet networks were grown hydrothermally onto the bamboo surface and subsequently modified with fluoroalkyl silane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>]. The successfully treated bamboo exhibited superior properties such as robust superhydrophobicity, stable repellency towards simulated acid rain, UV-resistant and fire-resistant. Similar superior properties were obtained when bamboo timber prepared by the hydrothermal deposition of anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles and further modified with octadecyltrichlorosilane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>]. Superhydrophobic wood surfaces can also be prepared using approaches such as layer-by-layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>] assembly of polyelectrolyte/TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles multi-layers and hydrophobic modified with perfluoroalkyltriethoxysilane (POTS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>], spray coating of a waterborne perfluoroalkyl methacrylic copolymer (PMC)/TiO2 nanocomposites onto the PDMS pre-coated substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>] and a one-step hydrothermal process using tetrabutyltitanate (Ti(OC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>)<sub>4</sub>, TBOT) and vinyltriethoxysilane (CH<sub>2</sub>CHSi(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, VTES) as a co-precursor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>].

The inorganic particles when apply in micron size have disadvantages such as they reduce the flexibility of the material and decrease the transparency of the coating system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]. The utilisation of the inorganic particles in nanosize increases the surface area and the ratio of the interfacial area, which subsequently influences the properties of the raw material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>]. Recent studies have investigated on using nanocellulose as a renewable reinforcement to develop a bio-based nanocomposite coating system with improved performance. Nanocellulose was surface modified due to the issue of incompatibility with the polymer matrix. The addition of TEMPO-oxidised cellulose nanofibres improved the mechanical properties of the WPU coating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>].

The UV radiation is capable of photochemically degrading the polymer structure components of wood (lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>]. The photodegradation process usually results in reduced water resistance of wood and wood-based materials which lead to further biodegradation under outdoor exposure conditions. The intense damage to materials due to the UV component in solar radiation can be prevented by using light-stabilisation technologies, surface coatings or by replacing these materials with materials that are more resistant against UV radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>]. Nanoparticles can be utilised to improve the UV resistance for solvent, waterborne and UV coatings in order to protect the wood surfaces. Nanoparticles that contain functional coatings to achieve UV-blocking properties offer a high level of protection against UV without affecting the transparency of the surface. The small size of the nanoparticles gives a significant increase in effectiveness of blocking UV light compared to natural material due to their large surface area-to-volume ratio.</p><p id="Par140">The use of UV radiation absorptive coatings serves to prevent lignin degradation from UV light.

To overcome the inherent deficiencies and use of wood and non-wood in a safe manner, the flame retardant properties need serious consideration. Nanoparticles have recently been used to produce the nanocomposites for the improvement in fire retardant properties. The utilisation of nanoparticles, either alone or in combination with conventional fire retardants, serves to reduce the ignitability of wood. The nanosize and high surface area of nanomaterials make them more effective at low concentrations than other conventional compounds which are an enormous advantage industrially and economically. The surface modification is necessary for nanoparticles to achieve better compatible and homogeneous dispersion. The TiO<sub>2</sub> coated wood was found to be capable in reducing the flammability of the wood and the spreading of the flame, as compared to the uncoated sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">178</xref>].

These properties make nanocellulose more preferred as biomaterials since it can enhance the selectivity and sensitivity of sensors for the detection of analytes. On the other hand, the adhesion properties of nanocellulose prevents the leaching problems of immobilised reagents. Thus a remarkable improvement can be obtained for the long-time stability of the sensor. Besides, the hydroxyl –OH groups on nanocellulose can be modified for the incorporation of binding sites for the selective adsorption of different analyte species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR278">278</xref>].

The safety or toxicity issue needs to be addressed by conducting a complete study from various angles. Nanotoxicity or the study of nanomaterials’ toxicity can be classified into several areas namely oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and ecotoxicity. In humans, toxicity can occur through pulmonary, oral and dermal routes. Nanomaterials can affect humans mainly during extraction or production, handling, usage and disposal. Inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) such as ZnO and nickel oxide (NiO) are believed to be more toxic compared to organic nano materials such as nanocellulose. Digested organic NPs are less likely to induce toxicity since the by-products of digestion by stomach acid are simple sugars, although in the case of nanocellulose, the lack of enzyme in human gut capable of degrading cellulose results in the cellulose moving through the gut fairly quickly. A 90-day subchronic toxicity study on Sprague Dawley rats conducted by Ong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR300">300</xref>] indicated that no systemic toxicity attributable to 4% dietary consumption of fibrillated cellulose was observed. In the same study, a higher concentration of 30% of nanofibrillated cellulose for 72 weeks also indicated no adverse effects. When present in the air, nanoparticles can also have harmful effects to human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR301">301</xref>]. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are possibly one of the most studied NPs for toxicity effects. In the study, Poulsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR302">302</xref>] found that both thick and long as well as thin and short MWCNT induced genotoxic potential and long lasting inflammation and can lead to cardiovascular disease. In contrast, a study on inhalation NCC toxicity in albino rats was conducted and showed no undesirable effects were observed at a maximum concentration of 0.26 mg/L for a period of four (4) hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR303">303</xref>]. At cellular level, cytotoxicity on NCC on different cell types has been studied with most studies concluded that NCC to be non-toxic to a variety of mammalian cells at concentrations below 0.25 mg/L, but can exhibit cytotoxic effects at concentrations of 0.5 mg/L and above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR304">304</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR309">309</xref>]. Primary nanogenotoxicity refers to the possibility of nanoparticles or their by-products to damage DNA directly or indirectly. Secondary genotoxicity is caused by immune system interaction to disturbances cause by nanoparticles. A study by Akerlund et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR310">310</xref>] indicated that inorganic NPs of Ni and NiO-induced cytokines inflammations which led to secondary genotoxicity in human lung epithelial cells. However, they require further investigation to understand the factors causing this secondary genotoxicity and whether such results are caused by other nanoparticles as well.</p><p id="Par193">NanoTiO<sub>2</sub> in wood coatings has been reported to have low toxicity to terrestrial organisms, and no bioaccumulation was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR311">311</xref>]. Another study conducted on cerium oxide (CeO<sub>2</sub>) nanoparticle or ceria showed that no acute toxicity was observed for Daphnia magna and Thamnocephalus platyurus and D. rerio embryos at test concentrations of 1000, 5000, and 200 mg/L, respectively. However, the same study indicated that a significant chronic toxicity on P. subcapitata was observed with 10% effect concentrations (EC10s) between 2.6 and 5.4 mg/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR312">312</xref>]. Pulido-Reyes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR313">313</xref>] explained that the redox cycling between Ce<sup>3+</sup> and Ce<sup>4+</sup> is a unique chemistry of nanoceria which depends on the prevailing environmental conditions. They concluded that in most cerium oxide NP studies, the amount of surface Ce<sup>3+</sup> correlates with toxicity and this can be overcome by blocking the Ce<sup>3+</sup> sites with anions such as phosphates (PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3−</sup>) which will reduce reactive oxygen species levels and overcoming oxidative stress. During and after disposal, there is a likelihood that NPs can interact with the environment, whether in soil or aquatic environment. The oxidative stress or carbon-based nanoparticle-induced toxicity is primarily of concern as this condition will affect the oxygen balance in the environment. Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR314">314</xref>] showed that NCCs’ activated oxidative stress in aquatic organisms (Scenedesmus obliquus algae, planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna and freshwater fish larva Danio rerio) at concentrations above 0.1 mg/L. The NCC form, morphology and concentration are believed to be the contributing factors, thus suggesting evaluation of nanocellulose ecotoxicological impacts when used at large scales. One method of reducing the undesired effect to the environment is by providing a mechanism to capture, retain or recycle the NPs during processing. Magnetic NPs (e.g. magnetite) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR315">315</xref>] or surface modification can be used for this purpose. Almost all toxicity studies on nanoparticles recommend more research to be conducted on finding suitable analytical techniques and protocols in detecting organic NPs within biological matrices as well as mechanistic and environmental investigations to understand potential NPs risks on the ecosystem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR301">301</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR302">302</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR310">310</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR316">316</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec34" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par194">The potential of nanotechnology in wood-based products sector is enormous. Nanotechnology offers the opportunity to change the landscape of wood-based products industry locally and globally. Forest itself via forest plantation can provide sustainable sources towards the creation of new generation of cellulose called nanocellulose that could offer myriads of application in various industrial fields. Besides, nanocellulose is less expensive than carbon-based material (e.g. carbon nanotube, graphene), environmentally friendly and may improve the recyclability and performance of countless products. For instance, nanocellulose can be used to improve the performance of paper and reduce the use of pulp in papermaking, thus resulting in cost saving. Nanocellulose can also be made into nanopaper or thin film for use in paper packaging or other sector such as electronics which offers alternative to non-renewable plastic. Nanocellulose used in wood composite can lead to the development of advanced composites which can be tailored to specific uses. Together with their strength properties and affordability makes them a viable solution to reduce the need for solid wood. Industrial sectors other than wood-based products could also benefit from the use of nanocellulose such as in energy device and sensors. Various nanocellulose-based products for energy storage and energy harvester applications as well as sensor have been developed at laboratory scale. In view of this interesting development, Malaysia has embarked on the production of nanocellulose from various tropical lignocellulosic materials. Unfortunately, the application of nanocellulose at commercial scale in Malaysia is still non-existent. Thus, it requires collective, concert and intensive efforts from various players that include stakeholders, industry and researchers to promote the use of nanocellulose and ensure that nanocellulose could enter the next level of application and commercialisation stage. The use of nanosized material other than nanocellulose has already benefited and also given advantage to wood-based products area which includes pulp and paper, wood composite, wood coating and wood preservative.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the financial support from 11th Malaysia Plan.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors’ contributions</title><p>LJ, RR, TK, RJ and SA contributed equally to this work. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was financially supported by the development study under the 11th Malaysia Plan (2016–2020).</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>All data and materials are available without restriction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par195">The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wegner</surname><given-names>TH</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>EP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">A fundamental review of the relationships between nanotechnology and lignocellulosic biomass</article-title><source>Nanosci Technol Renew Biomater</source><year>2009</year><volume>1</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>41</lpage></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wegner</surname><given-names>TH</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>PE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Advancing cellulose-based nanotechnology</article-title><source>Cellulose</source><year>2006</year><volume>13</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>115</fpage><lpage>118</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="other" assigning-authority="ChemPort ( Chemical Abstract Service )">1:CAS:528:DC%2BD28XjslCrt7s%3D</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s10570-006-9056-1</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bajpai</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><source>Pulp and paper industry: nanotechnology in forest industry</source><year>2016</year><publisher-loc>London</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Elsevier</publisher-name></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Malaysia Timber Industry Board (MTIB).
