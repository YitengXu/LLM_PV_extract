Among them, wearable organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) play an important role in visualizing the data signal processed in wearable electronics to humans. In this study, textile-based OLEDs were fabricated and their practical utility was demonstrated. The textile-based OLEDs exhibited a stable operating lifetime under ambient conditions, enough mechanical durability to endure the deformation by the movement of humans, and washability for maintaining its optoelectronic properties even in water condition such as rain, sweat, or washing. In this study, the main technology used to realize this textile-based OLED was multi-functional near-room-temperature encapsulation. The outstanding impermeability of TiO<sub>2</sub> film deposited at near-room-temperature was demonstrated. The internal residual stress in the encapsulation layer was controlled, and the device was capped by highly cross-linked hydrophobic polymer film, providing a highly impermeable, mechanically flexible, and waterproof encapsulation.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>15</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41528_2021_Article_112.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Optical and Electronic Materials</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Polymer Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Electronics and Microelectronics, Instrumentation</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry and Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), the value of connecting humans and smart electronic devices is increasing. Wearable display devices are interface devices that lead the hyper-connectivity between humans and wearable electronics by visualizing the information processed in wearable electronics to humans. Textile-based display devices can utilize the textile itself as a platform for the display. This ability makes them suitable for daily application in the healthcare, bio-medical, safety, interior, military, and fashion fields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Among many display devices, organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) have achieved significant attention as wearable display devices because of their high flexibility, light weight, low power consumption, and low heat generation. These properties also make them compatible with textile substrates.</p><p id="Par3">In wearable technology, the flexibility of the device is extremely important because the device should not interfere with the active movement of the human body. For this reason, as wearable technology advances, the substrate has increasingly become ultra-thin and ultra-light. However, these properties also seriously reduce the heat resistance of the substrate. In addition, OLEDs also have low thermal stability. To address these problems, the process temperature of the encapsulation film, which is an essential part of water-sensitive OLEDs, should be lowered to near-room-temperature. However, many encapsulation processes are still being conducted at high temperature, around 100 °C.</p><p id="Par4">Chen et al. performed encapsulation at room temperature using CeO<sub>2</sub> and poly(divinylbenzene) (PDVB)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, the water vapor transmission ratio (WVTR) of that barrier was reported to be 1.81 g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> at 30 °C and 100% relative humidity (RH) accelerated environments. For the extremely water-sensitive OLEDs, the encapsulation barrier should achieve a WVTR on the order of 10<sup>−6</sup> g<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>. In addition, the flexibility and waterproof properties of the encapsulation layer were not considered. Wang et al. reported a 2-dyad encapsulation barrier using Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and alucone that was deposited at 50 °C to enhance the reliability of perovskite solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The WVTR of the multi-barrier encapsulation was 1.6 × 10<sup>−5</sup> g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> at 30 °C and 80% RH accelerated environments. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices was maintained at 96% of initial efficiency for over 2000 h at 30 °C and 80% RH accelerated environments. In order to demonstrate the flexibility of the encapsulation layer, the encapsulation layer was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after bending 500 times with a 5 mm radius. However, because the purge time of the precursors was over 80 s, it resulted in extremely low throughput. Also, plasma treatment was utilized. Moreover, a bending radius of 5 mm is comparatively large, and 500 bending cycles is insufficient to demonstrate that the barrier has high flexibility. For foldable displays, the required bending radius is 1 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. The waterproof property of the encapsulation layer was not considered.</p><p id="Par5">The encapsulation film is the most important limitation on the flexibility of the entire textile-based OLED structure, and therefore developing highly flexible textile-based OLEDs typically involves improving the flexibility of the encapsulation layer. Many studies have been performed to achieve this, however, few encapsulation layers have been reported that are capable of enduring a bending strain of more than 1% or a bending radius of less than 5 mm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). In addition, only a few studies have reported on the waterproof property of the encapsulation layer and the reported waterproof properties are still less than 200 min (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). To realize an environmentally robust textile-based OLED that is durable against wet conditions such as rain, sweat, or washing, an improved waterproof property is required.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, to realize a reliable, foldable, and washable textile-based OLED, a multi-functional encapsulation that simultaneously exhibits an WVTR on the order of 10<sup>−6</sup> g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>, high transparency, high curvature flexibility, waterproof property, and a near-room-temperature process was developed. Although the process temperature was only 40 °C, the WVTR of the bilayer encapsulation was estimated to be 9.94 × 10<sup>−6</sup> g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> at 30 °C and 90% RH and its thickness was only 115 nm. In addition, it showed the highest bending performance and waterproof property among reported encapsulation barriers (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">By utilizing this multi-functional encapsulation layer, a reliable, foldable, and washable textile-based OLED was realized and its practical utility was demonstrated. The textile-based OLED showed an enhanced operating lifetime of 160 h under ambient conditions. Also, it endured repetitive high curvature bending, maintaining its optoelectronic properties and operating lifetime after tensile bending with a 1.5 mm radius for 1000 repetitions. In addition, the encapsulated OLEDs showed unchanged optoelectronic characteristics even after immersion in water for 1440 min, which suggest its potential for waterproof wearable OLEDs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par8">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> illustrates the proposed textile-based OLED and a multi-functional near-room-temperature encapsulation layer. The red phosphorescent OLED (phOLED) was fabricated on a conventional polyester fabric substrate and passivated with a bilayer encapsulation. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, the bilayer encapsulation was a double-layer structure, where a 1,3,5-trivinyl-1,3,5-trimethyl cyclotrisiloxane (pV3D3) polymer film was deposited on an Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> nanolaminate layer (AT nanolaminate layer). The AT nanolaminate is a thin film comprised of alternately deposited Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and TiO<sub>2</sub>. By utilizing this multi-functional encapsulation on both the top and bottom sides of the OLED, a real wearable OLED was realized on conventional dress-shirts and T-shirts. The chemical structures of each of the organic layers used in the textile-based OLED with encapsulation layer are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>, the wearable OLED emitted red light even when folded under water, as would occur during hand-washing, demonstrating its practical applicability, mechanical durability, and environmental robustness.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Wearable OLED with a multi-functional encapsulation layer.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Illustration of the proposed textile-based OLED and encapsulation layer. <bold>b</bold> TEM image of the encapsulation layer.

In thermal ALD, as the deposition temperature decreases, the ligand exchange does not occur completely, because the main source of the ligand exchange is thermal energy. For this reason, the higher the deposition temperature, the better the film quality, specifically, it’s density or purity, which thereby improves the barrier property<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> indicates that the barrier property of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was actually enhanced as the deposition temperature increased<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Accordingly, many studies have performed the encapsulation process at a high temperature, around 100 °C. However, such a high-temperature process may cause thermal damage to organic electronic devices with low thermal stability. For example, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref> shows the operating lifetimes of textile-based OLEDs stored for 3 h at 40, 70, and 100 °C. The data confirm that the higher the storage temperature, the shorter the operating lifetime of the textile-based OLEDs due to detrimental thermal damage. The lifetime of the device stored at 40 °C was more than twice that of the device stored at 100 °C.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>WVTR of the ALD TiO<sub>2</sub> depending on the deposition temperature.</title><p><bold>a</bold> WVTR of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> encapsulation layer depending on the deposition temperature. <bold>b</bold> Operating lifetime of the textile-based OLEDs depending on the storage temperature. <bold>c</bold> WVTR of the barriers depending on the deposition temperature and the number of dyads. <bold>d</bold> WVTR of the TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film depending on the deposition temperature. <bold>e</bold> ALD process window of TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film. <bold>f</bold> Residual stress in the TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film depending on the deposition temperature (with error bars that indicate standard deviation).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41528_2021_112_Fig2_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">To resolve this problem, TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film was deposited at near-room-temperature, and exhibited extremely outstanding impermeability. This demonstration enabled the development of a near-room-temperature encapsulation with low WVTR on the order of 10<sup>−6</sup> g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>, the WVTR of TiO<sub>2</sub> film deposited at 40 °C was estimated to be 3.17 × 10<sup>−5</sup> g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> at 30 °C and 90% RH acceleration environments, even with a thickness of 30 nm. In fact, the TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film exhibited a higher barrier property than Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which is currently the most commonly used encapsulation material due to its high impermeability. Specifically, the barrier property of a single TiO<sub>2</sub> barrier deposited at a near-room-temperature was higher than that of a 2.5-dyad Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> multi-barrier deposited at 120 °C.</p><p id="Par11">The ALD TiO<sub>2</sub> film also showed a unique WVTR tendency depending on deposition temperature. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, the WVTR of the TiO<sub>2</sub> film was lowest when deposited at near-room-temperature and rapidly increased as the deposition temperature increased from around 55 °C. This tendency is unlike other ALD films, where the WVTR decreases as deposition temperature increases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. In order to specifically clarify why the TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film deposited at near-room-temperature had much higher impermeability than the TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film deposited at a higher temperature, many film properties including composition, surface roughness, film density, infrared absorption spectrum, and crystallinity were measured (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The measurement results obtained for the TiO<sub>2</sub> deposited at near-room-temperature were all the same as the results of the TiO<sub>2</sub> deposited at a higher temperature. In the measurement results shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, no distinct difference in film properties was observed between the high-temperature and low-temperature deposition samples.</p><p id="Par12">This unique phenomenon of TiO<sub>2</sub> is in good agreement with the ALD process window graph (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2a</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>, the ALD process window was located at near-room-temperature, 40–55 °C, where the WVTR was the lowest.

In addition, the residual stress in the film increased as the deposition temperature increased due to the more thermally activated desorption phenomenon. The TiO<sub>2</sub> film deposited at high temperature exhibited residual stresses of 200–300 MPa while the TiO<sub>2</sub> film deposited at 40 °C exhibited residual stresses of only about 20 MPa. Considering that the residual stresses in other ALD thin films have been reported to be several hundred MPa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, the residual stress of the TiO<sub>2</sub> deposited at 40 °C is significantly low.</p><p id="Par17">One of the major issues in the deposition process is the difference in the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). However, assuming that Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> film is deposited on a Si wafer at 100 °C, the stress from the CTE difference is calculated to be only 20 MPa. The critical tensile stress of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> film is about 1.08 GPa when the elastic modulus of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is considered to be 180 GPa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.

Because of this phenomenon, the residual stress in the TiO<sub>2</sub> was lowest at a deposition temperature of 40–55 °C and increased when the process temperature was higher than 55 °C. The increased residual stress increased the WVTR of the TiO<sub>2</sub> because residual stress increases the crack driving force, <italic>G</italic><sub>ss</sub>, which promotes crack growth in the film. Therefore, the TiO<sub>2</sub> film exhibited the lowest WVTR at near-room-temperature deposition and the increased WVTR at higher process-temperature.</p><p id="Par19">After chemically determining the encapsulation material based on the reaction mechanics of the precursors, the encapsulation structure was physically optimized. First, the overall barrier structure was designed as a nanolaminate structure to compensate for the low transmittance of the TiO<sub>2</sub> layer, and to decouple the cracks. Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was selected as the second laminate material because it is transparent and has good compatibility with the ALD process. As mentioned above, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> deposited at near-room-temperature, 40 °C, had poor barrier property due to its low film quality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). However, the crack decoupling effect of the nanolaminate structure was sufficient to overcome the poor barrier property of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The WVTR of the AT nanolaminate layer was improved compared to a TiO<sub>2</sub> single layer (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">The transmittance of the AT nanolaminate layer was improved by 6.35% compared to the single TiO<sub>2</sub> layer, because of the transparent Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The transmittance of a single TiO<sub>2</sub> layer was only 78.35% and the transmittance of an AT nanolaminate layer was 84.70%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3b</xref>). The transmittance of the encapsulation barrier is important because it can cause luminance loss when applied to OLEDs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">Next, the sub-layer thickness of the AT nanolaminate layer was optimized to maximize the crack decoupling effect. The crack decoupling effect is a phenomenon that increases the penetration path length of moisture and oxygen gas by decoupling the cracks in the thin film. The crack decoupling effect is maximized when the total barrier thickness is fixed and sub-layers are most repeatedly alternated within the nanolaminate barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>; that is, it is when the sub-layers are alternatively deposited in the thinnest possible layer. If the sub-layer is too thin, it becomes a mixed alloy phase, not a nanolaminate phase. Therefore, the nanolaminate structure should be carefully designed. To identify the minimum thickness of sub-layers that can be distinguished as individual separate layers, thickness control was performed at the nanometer scale by the ALD deposition and the structure was confirmed through high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis. The AT nanolaminate barriers were deposited by increasing the sub-layer thickness from 1.25 to 5 nm with the total barrier thickness fixed at 30 nm. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> shows that when the thickness of the sub-layer was 3 nm, it started to appear as a separate layer, and when the thickness was less than 2.1 nm, it became an alloy phase. These results indicated that the crack decoupling effect will be maximized when the sub-layer is deposited at 3 nm thickness. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> demonstrates that when the thickness of the sub-layer was 3 nm, the WVTR of the AT nanolaminate barrier was at its lowest, estimated to be 2.58 × 10<sup>−5</sup> g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Optimization of the encapsulation barrier structure.</title><p><bold>a</bold> TEM images and WVTRs of the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> nanolaminate layer (AT nanolaminate layer) with sub-layer thicknesses of 1.25, 2.1, 3, and 5 nm, respectively.

It can be intuitively predicted that the WVTR decreases as the barrier thickness increases based on Fick’s law, which is the diffusion equation of gas molecules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, the WVTR increases again when the thickness of the barrier exceeds a certain thickness, due to the accumulation of residual stress in the film, which is not considered in Fick’s law. As the thickness of the film increases, residual stress accumulates in the film, reducing the stability of the film. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> shows that the WVTR increased again when the thickness of the AT nanolaminate layer was more than 50 nm. It was also confirmed that as the total thickness of the film increased, the membrane force in the film increased proportionally. Consequently, the total barrier thickness was determined to be 30 nm, which was the optimum thickness in the WVTR saturation range between the region where Fick’s law is dominant and the membrane force dominant region.</p><p id="Par23">Finally, the structure and composition of the optimized AT nanolaminate layer was visualized through TEM and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Improvement in flexibility and waterproof property</title><p id="Par24">A highly cross-linked pV3D3 polymer film was deposited via initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) on the AT nanolaminate layer to improve the transmittance, mechanical flexibility, and waterproof property of the barrier for real wearable OLEDs.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">d</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5d</xref>, the <italic>J</italic>–<italic>V</italic>–<italic>L</italic> curves and operating lifetime of the textile-based OLED were maintained after this repetitive bending deformation. Moreover, Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">f</xref> shows that there was no physical cracking or delamination in the emission area, which fully continued to emit red light even when the devices were folded and wrinkled by hand. This confirms that the textile-based OLED can sufficiently endure external repetitive deformation such as bending, folding, or wrinkling, which are typical of the active movements of a human body.</p><p id="Par36">In addition, to demonstrate waterproof property of the encapsulated OLEDs, the optoelectronic characteristics of OLEDs were estimated depending on water immersion time. The results showed that the bilayer-encapsulated OLEDs exhibited no deterioration of optoelectronic characteristics even after water immersion for 1440 min, confirming the encapsulation layer resulted in highly environmentally robust OLEDs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5e</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">f</xref>). To ensure the reliability of the experiment, a total of 6 OLED samples were estimated and the results were averaged. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>, the textile-based OLED emitted red light even in water.</p><p id="Par37">Finally, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref> shows a wearable red OLED that was realized on a typical dress-shirt and T-shirt. These samples demonstrate the potential practical application by emitting red light with a luminance of 1000 nit, which is required for outdoor display, and displaying information such as a logo, the weather, time, or date. To operate the wearable OLED, a flexible battery that supplied 6 V to the OLED device was used. Therefore, the real wearable OLEDs were fabricated and showed the potential to realize the smart e-textiles.</p><p id="Par38">A reliable, foldable, and washable textile-based OLED was fabricated and their practical usability was demonstrated. The main technology used to realize this textile-based OLED was a multi-functional near-room-temperature encapsulation layer. It was demonstrated that an ALD TiO<sub>2</sub> thin film deposited at near-room-temperature has outstanding impermeability and by this demonstration, a near-room-temperature encapsulation with WVTR on the order of 10<sup>−6</sup> g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> was developed. To ensure mechanical flexibility and waterproof property, an internal stress analysis was performed, and a highly cross-linked iCVD polymer capping layer was introduced. After applying this barrier to the textile-based OLED, it exhibited an operating life-time of 160 h with an initial luminance of 1000 nit. The OLED maintained its optoelectronic characteristics and operating lifetime even after tensile bending 1000 times with a 1.5 mm radius, which is enough flexibility to endure the deformation by movement of human body. In addition, the bilayer-encapsulated OLEDs retained their initial optoelectronic characteristics even after immersion in water for 1440 min. These experimental results confirmed that the textile-based OLED can continue to operate despite water exposure such as washing or rain.</p><p id="Par39">It is expected that these functional wearable OLEDs will play an important role in visualizing information on smart clothes for the IoTs in the future. In addition, TiO<sub>2</sub> material will be the main encapsulation material as an alternative to Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, because of its high impermeability despite near-room-temperature deposition temperature. With the TiO<sub>2</sub> material, the proposed encapsulation barrier provides possibility to improve the reliability of all types of flexible substrates and devices that are extremely sensitive to temperature or moisture.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Encapsulation fabrication</title><p id="Par40">The encapsulation barrier was fabricated as a bilayer structure that consisted of an inorganic layer and an organic layer.
