Besides carbon-based nanomaterials, conjugated polymers are emerging promising photothermal materials but their facile syntheses remain challenging. In this work, by modification of a CBT-Cys click condensation reaction and rational design of the starting materials, we facilely synthesize conjugated polymers poly-2-phenyl-benzobisthiazole (PPBBT) and its dihexyl derivative with good photothermal properties. Under the irradiation of either sunlight-mimicking Xe light or near-infrared laser, we verify that PPBBT has comparable photothermal heating-up speed to that of star material single-wall carbon nanotube. Moreover, PPBBT is used to fabricate water-soluble NP<sub>PPBBT</sub> nanoparticles which maintain excellent photothermal properties in vitro and photothermal therapy effect on the tumours exposed to laser irradiation.

Currently the major sources of energy are fossil fuels. Combustible fossil fuels combust in heat engines to generate mechanical energy but in the meantime bring severe pollution problems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Therefore, in terms of energy exploitation and environment protection, developing photothermal materials, which are able to harness sunlight and convert it to thermal energy seems extraodinarily attractive<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Among the various types of photothermal materials, carbon-based materials are good absorbers due to their π-band’s optical transitions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In particular, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit extraordinarily high efficiency of photothermal conversion and excellent thermal conductivity (2000–76,000 W m<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>), which is comparable to that of the best natural thermal conductor diamond<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Besides carbon-based nanomaterials, conjugated polymers, whose large non-localized π-bond backbones are composed of aromatic or aromatic heterocyclic rings, represent another type of emerging photothermal materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Capable of transducing light into local heat, some conjugated polymers with prominent photothermal conversion efficiency (<italic>η</italic>) have been applied as an efficient medical tool in photothermal therapy (PTT) for cancer treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Accumulating evidences have indicated that nano-agent (e.g. CNT)-assisted PTT might bring anti-tumour immunological effects by generating tumour-associate agents from ablated tumour cell residues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, rendering PTT a powerful tool for cancer therapy. Nevertheless, facile fabrications of these photothermal materials remain challenging. At present, there are many techniques to fabricate CNT in sizable quantities including arc discharge, laser ablation, high-pressure carbon monoxide disproportionation, and chemical vapor deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, most of these manufacturing processes take place in vacuum or with processing gases. Compared to the harsh conditions for CNT fabrication, the syntheses of conjugated polymers are usually more flexible, solution-processable, or lower-cost<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Moreover, some conjugated polymers were reported to interact with the immune system and might be used as potenial vaccine adjuvants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, current monomer species for the syntheses of conjugated polymers are quite limited and therefore available conjugated polymers with excellent photothermal properties are quite few<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This calls for new molecular structures and efficient reactions to fabricate conjugated polymers for the applications of energy exploitation.</p><p id="Par4">In 2010, after carefully investigating the luciferin regeneration pathway in firefly, Rao et al. developed a click condensation reaction between the cyano group of 2-cyano-benzothiazole (CBT) and the 1,2-aminothiol group of cysteine (Cys), which could be controlled by pH, reduction, or protease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. This CBT-Cys click condensation reaction has a very high second order reaction rate of 9.19 M<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and is biocompatible to biological systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. To date, this click condensation reaction has been successfully utilized to design smart imaging probes (optical, nuclear, or magnetic resonance probes)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, synthesize cyclic superstructures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, overcome multidrug resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, and prepare oligomeric hydrogels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, there has been no report of using this click condensation reaction for even the fabrication of conjugated polymeric materials, let alone applications of such type of materials (e.g. photothermal therapy).</p><p id="Par5">Inspired by the abovementioned pioneering studies, in this work, we modify abovementioned CBT-Cys click condensation reaction and rationally design the starting materials for the facile fabrication of conjugated polymers. We hypothesize that, as exampled in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, if two 1,2-aminothiol groups of above click condensation reaction are on one aromatic ring but not cysteines, and two cyano groups are directly linked to one benzene ring but not benzothiazoles, these two starting materials could still be subjected to above click condensation reaction to yield π-conjugated polymers with excellent photothermal properties. Therefore, 1,4-dicyanobenzene and 2,5-dimercapto-1,4-phenylenediamine are designed as the starting materials to synthesize poly-2-phenyl-benzobisthiazole (PPBBT, R = H in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The resulting PPBBT exhibit an ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectrum in good overlap with solar spectrum, suggesting its potential application in solar energy ultilzation. Using single-wall CNT (SWCNT) as the control, we verify that as-obtained PPBBT has comparable photothermal heating-up speed to that of SWCNT. Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, via aromatic substitution, PPBBT could be easily modified with additional functional groups, demostrating the feasibility of our approach in large-scale screening of conjugated polymers with desired properties. Finally, we find that the hydrophobic PPBBT could be easily coated with Poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(hexyl ethylene phosphate) (mPEG-<italic>b</italic>-PHEP) through routine nanoprecipitation method to obtain highly stable, physiologically dispersed, and photostable nanoparticles NP<sub>PPBBT</sub>. Notably, as-prepared NP<sub>PPBBT</sub> nanoparticles show low dark-cytotoxicity but high photo-cytotoxicity at 50 μg mL<sup>−1</sup>. In vivo experiments show that the NP<sub>PPBBT</sub> nanoparticles are effectively accumulated in the tumour site due to their enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and have excellent PTT efficiency against tumour.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Syntheses and optical properties of PPBBT (or Dihexyl-PPBBT). <bold>a</bold> Synthetic routes for PPBBT and its dihexyl derivative Dihexyl-PPBBT. <bold>b</bold> Photographs of PPBBT, Dihexyl-PPBBT, and SWCNT powders. <bold>c</bold> UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of PPBBT, Dihexyl-PPBBT, and SWCNT</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2019_9226_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Facile syntheses and optical properties of PPBBT</title><p id="Par6">By modifying abovementioned CBT-Cys click condensation reaction and employing the reported Cu<sup>2+</sup>-catalyzed reaction condition between 2-aminobenzenethiol and benzonitriles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, we facilely synthesized PPBBT and its derivative Dihexyl-PPBBT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). Five minutes after equivalent 1,4-dicyanobenzene and 2,5-dimercapto-1,4-phenylenediamine at 67.6 mM were mixed in ethanol in the presence of 10 mol% of Cu(Ac)<sub>2</sub> at 70 °C, black precipitates of PPBBT in large quantity (yield: 59.9%) were observed, suggesting the reaction rate of this condensation reaction is very high. The crude product was then centrifuged, washed with water and ethanol to remove the catalyst and remaining starting materials, and lyophilized to yield pure black powder product (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) and characterized with <sup>1</sup>H NMR spectrum (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The successful formation of the poly-benzothiazole structure was characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra in Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>. As shown in the Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>, the newly appeared N 1 <italic>s</italic> peak at 398.7 eV of PPBBT could be assigned to the <italic>sp</italic><sup>2</sup>-hybridized nitrogen in the newly formed C–N–C structures on the benzobisthiazole structure. Additionally, element composition analysis of the XPS spectrum suggested that the atom number ratio between N and S (N/S, 1.02) was near to 1:1 (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), indicating a very high polymerization degree of the PPBBT product (note, the N/S ratio of the two starting materials was 2:1 while that of the repeating unit in the polymer product is 1:1). Additionally, the gel permeation chromatography (GPC) trace of PPBBT showed that the number-average molecular weight of the polymer was about 23,176 with a polydispersity (PDI) of 1.34 (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). To test the feasibility of introducing additional functional groups onto PPBBT, we synthesized 2,5-dihexyl-1,4-dicyanobenzene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> (Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>) and used it to react with 2,5-dimercapto-1,4-phenylenediamine under the same reaction condition for the preparation of dihexyl-substituted PPBBT (Dihexyl-PPBBT, Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). As expected, the black powder Dihexyl-PPBBT was also facilely obtained with a yield of 69.0% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). Successful formation of the poly-benzobisthiazole structure in Dihexyl-PPBBT was also characterized by its XPS spectra with a N/S value of 0.89 (Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>, and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). These results demonstrated the feasibility and versatility of our approach in the facile syntheses of conjugated polymer materials.</p><p id="Par7">To determine the optical properties of above-obtained conjugated polymers, UV-Vis-NIR spectra of PPBBT and Dihexyl-PPBBT were acquired, which consistently showed a broad absorption band from 250 to 1200 nm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Interestingly, their UV-Vis-NIR spectra are in good overlap with that of the solar spectrum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> (Supplementary Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>), suggesting these two conjugated polymers could efficiently absorb and utilize solar energy. The energy band gap is a key parameter that controls the light absorption efficiency of the photothermal materials in solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Based on their corresponding UV-Vis-NIR spectra and using the equation E = <italic>hν</italic> = 1240/<italic>λ</italic>, the energy band gaps of our PPBBT and Dihexyl-PPBBT were roughly calculated to be 0.69 eV and 0.62 eV, respectively, which were near to that 0.54 eV of SWCNT. The low energy band gaps of PPBBT and Dihexyl-PPBBT suggest their potential application in organic photovoltaics. After their light absorption properties were characterized, the electronic structures of PPBBT and Dihexyl-PPBBT were also characterized using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Supplementary Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>). UPS valence-band spectra together with secondary electron cutoffs revealed that the ionization potential for PPBBT and Dihexyl-PPBBT were −5.47 eV and −5.95 eV, respectively, suggesting their good oxidative stability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Photothermal properties of PPBBT</title><p id="Par8">Above characterizations indicated good photothermal properties of our conjugated polymers PPBBT and Dihexyl-PPBBT. To demonstrate their photothermal properties, we used a Xenon (Xe) lamp, whose full light spectrum closes to that of the Sun, to shine PPBBT using SWCNT as the control. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, when exposed to 0.8 W cm<sup>−2</sup> Xe light, PPBBT exhibted a comparable heating-up speed to that of SWCNT. The maximum photothermal temperature 71.0 °C of PPBBT was close to that 70.8 °C of SWCNT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), implying PPBBT a good material for solar energy ultilization. To calculate the photothermal conversion efficiency, we also measured the rate of temperature decrease after removing the light source at 40 s (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>).

The maximum photothermal temperature that PPBBT could reach under this condition was 107 °C, lower than that 160 °C of SWCNT. The photothermal conversion efficiency of PPBBT at 808 nm was roughly calculated to be 62.3% of that of SWCNT. We proposed that the better NIR performance of SWCNT is due to its higher absorption coefficient at NIR region than PPBBT.
