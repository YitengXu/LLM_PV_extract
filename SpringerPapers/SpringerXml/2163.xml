Herein, dye-synthesized solar cell technology is combined with lithium-ion materials to investigate light-assisted battery charging. In particular we report the direct photo-oxidation of lithium iron phosphate nanocrystals in the presence of a dye as a hybrid photo-cathode in a two-electrode system, with lithium metal as anode and lithium hexafluorophosphate in carbonate-based electrolyte; a configuration corresponding to lithium ion battery charging. Dye-sensitization generates electron–hole pairs with the holes aiding the delithiation of lithium iron phosphate at the cathode and electrons utilized in the formation of a solid electrolyte interface at the anode via oxygen reduction. Lithium iron phosphate acts effectively as a reversible redox agent for the regeneration of the dye.

The first photo-rechargeable battery was proposed in 1976 by Hodes <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> using a three-electrode system composed of cadmium selenide/sulfur/silver sulfide (CdSe/S/Ag<sub>2</sub>S), followed in 1977 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>) by the ternary system <italic>n</italic>-cadmium selenide telluride/caesium sulfide/tin sulfide (CdSe<sub>0.65</sub>Te<sub>0.35</sub>/Cs<sub>2</sub>S<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>/SnS). In 1990, Kanbara <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> investigated a photo-reaction on a semiconductor silicon/silicon oxide (P-I aSi/SiO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>) electrode using silver iodide tungstanate (Ag<sub>6</sub>I<sub>4</sub>WO<sub>4</sub>) and observed a photo-sensitizing effect on the surface of SiO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>. More recently, a solar rechargeable battery consisting of a hybrid titania (TiO<sub>2</sub>)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene, PEDOT) photo-anode and a perchlorate (ClO<sub>4</sub><sup>−</sup>)-doped polypyrrole counter electrode was proposed by Liu <italic>et al</italic>. in 2012 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). In 2014, Yu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> reported charging of a lithium–oxygen (Li–O<sub>2</sub>) battery with the assistance of a redox-coupled dye photo-electrode. In the meantime, in 2015 Li <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> integrated a TiO<sub>2</sub>-based electrode in a three-electrode system comprising a lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO<sub>4</sub>; LFP)/lithium metal cell using triodide/iodide (I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>/I<sup>−</sup>) as a redox agent in a separate electrolyte compartment. All these devices are basically three-electrode systems that have two linked sections, namely: one dedicated to solar energy conversion and the other dedicated to energy storage as discussed recently by Li <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Along the same lines, Xu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> connected a perovskite methylammonium lead iodide (CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>)-based solar cell in series with a Li-based cell (LFP cathode and a Li<sub>4</sub>Ti<sub>5</sub>O<sub>12</sub> anode) and observed good cycling stability. Also in 2015, Thimmappa <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> proposed a chemically rechargeable photo-battery device utilizing potassium iron hexacyanoferrate prussian blue analogue (KFe[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] and titanium nitride (TiN) in which: the photo-electrons generated on the TiN electrode assist in battery discharging while sodium disulphate Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> participate in charging as is consumed and continuously regenerated. In another development, Li <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> proposed a very innovative device, integrating a CdSe@Pt photocatalyst into Li–S batteries via which direct solar energy storage takes place in the form of H<sub>2</sub> production. In 2015, Yu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> designed a photo-rechargeable Li-iodide flow battery, using a TiO<sub>2</sub>-dye photoelectrode via linkage of an I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>/I<sup>−</sup> based catholyte for the conversion and storage of solar energy. Compared to the previous concepts, the devices described by Li and Wu are single systems. In Li’s device, the electrons are consumed by the reduction of hydrogen (2H<sup>+</sup>+2e<sup>−</sup>→H<sub>2</sub>) while in Wu’s device, a constant flow of a reversible I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>/I<sup>−</sup> redox agent is required. For the two-electrode system, Liu <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> suggested in 2015 the use of a graphitic carbon nitride (C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>) photocatalyst to reduce the charging voltage in a Li–O<sub>2</sub> battery.</p><p id="Par4">In this paper, we report a two-electrode system involving direct photo-oxidation of LFP nanocrystals by light irradiation in the presence of the N719 dye as hybrid photo-cathode, Li metal as anode, and LiPF<sub>6</sub> organic carbonate solvent (EC/DEC/VC) as electrolyte that corresponds to Li-ion battery charging. We utilize LFP as the cathode material because of its stability and safety as well as its favourable redox potential. The latter, 3.4 V versus Li<sup>+</sup>/Li (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>), is very close to that of the classic I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>/I<sup>−</sup> redox couple (∼3.1 V versus Li<sup>+</sup>/Li) used in the dye-sensitized solar cell invented by O’Regan and Grätzel in 1991 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>). Dye-sensitization generates electron–hole pairs with the holes aiding the chemical conversion of LFP (triphylite) nanoplatelets to FePO<sub>4</sub> (heterosite) at the cathode and the electrons utilized via oxygen reduction in the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) at the anode made-up of lithium-carbonate-based species. The photo-assisted delithiation of LFP is reversible upon galvanostatic discharge. Our findings open possibilities in designing photo-rechargeable Li-ion batteries based on a two-electrode device configuration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Observation of LFP delithiation</title><p id="Par5">The original photocathode investigated consists of a film of colloidal LFP nanoplateletes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> deposited on conducting glass/F:SnO<sub>2</sub>(FTO), annealed and sensitized with the N719 dye as represented in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>.

In this case, the full charge occurred faster (1.5 days versus 20 days) compared to the charge under neon light. Therefore, light is essential for the oxidation reaction. Also, the XRD measurements showed clearly the conversion of triphylite LFP into heterosite FePO<sub>4</sub> after illumination by the solar simulator. The cell was subsequently subjected to OCV charging and discharging cycling (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).

The cell was held at OCV and charged a second time which required 100 h at OCV to reach 3.43 V and another 100 h to reach 3.62 V (increasing the voltage from 3.43 to 3.62 V needed 40 h more compared to the first OCV). After light-assisted charging, the cell was discharged a second time at C/24 where a comparable capacity of 99.3 mAh g<sup>−1</sup> was obtained.

More importantly, no new products are detected by <sup>1</sup>H NMR.

Our NMR results therefore did not suggest any major changes taking place in electrolyte composition. However, as we discuss later in the mechanism section where we propose EC/DEC to react at the LFP/electrolyte interface that apparently went undetected by the NMR analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Figs 24–27</xref>) due to the low concentrations involved.</p><p id="Par12">The stability of the film was improved by changing the composition of the film and its preparation (see ‘Methods’ section). The changes made were the use of PET/Sn:In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (PET/ITO) instead of glass/FTO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) as substrate, the use of carbon nanotubes to improve conductivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>), and the use of PVDF binder to improve film integrity. We performed XRD on the new film and obtained the same results as for glass/FTO: the conversion of triphylite into heterosite after OCV is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>. During galvanostatic charge–discharge performed in the dark (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>), we observed a relatively low battery capacity/stability (below 40 mAh g<sup>−1</sup>). Nevertheless, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> shows a relatively fast photo-assisted OCV (&lt;24 h) and a discharge current for 48 h at C/24 corresponding to a capacity at least two times the theoretical one. The same capacity was observed after 15 discharges (and 15 OCVs photo-assisted charges) As mentioned earlier the photocathode tends to undergo partial charge during galvanostatic discharge because of its exposure to light that induces LFP to delithiate, hence creating vacancies for extra charge storage beyond the theoretical capacity. In <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, the 15th OCV is lower than the first OCV and probably due to a loss of dye in the electrolyte-although this could not be confirmed, but the photo-oxidation of LFP is still much faster with respect to the glass/FTO electrode (respectively 24 h after 15 cycles for ITO versus 160 h after the 2nd cycle for FTO). Considering these results we can reasonably assume that the combined use of PET/ITO, carbon nanotubes and PVDF as binder improved the performance of the device. Another critical factor in the observed photo-oxidation of LFP is the nanosize effect. This was determined by comparing the photo-response of differently prepared LFP samples. Thus no photo-oxidation was observed when we replaced the colloidal nanocrystals with hydrothermally synthesized crystals (∼1–3 μm sized crystals); but after ball-milling (crystals of ∼80 nm) photo-oxidation did take place as evidenced by the increase of OCV to 3.65 V after 24 h (for more details see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Fig. 12</xref>). BET analysis showed the pristine hydrothermal LFP sample has a specific surface area of 5 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>, while the ball milled sample has 24 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>. By comparison, the etched colloidal LFP sample (nanoplatelets 7–10 nm thick) with a surface area of ∼70 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> underwent the fastest photo-oxidation. Therefore, the surface area of LFP nanocrystals is a key property that facilitates photo-oxidation. Our hybrid photocathode featuring colloidal LFP nanoplatelets and N719 dye can undergo a photo-oxidation for 15 cycles in a cell with Li metal as anode. Besides the cyclability, it is interesting to note that we observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>), when the light was switched off, the voltage experienced a drop of 150 mV but when the light was switched on again, the voltage profile was restored. The voltage drop observed after 15 cycles (from 3.4 V to ∼3 V) is attributed to a number of factors as evidenced by supplementary characterization work, such as the formation of resistive LiF deposit on the surface of the film (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Fig. 13</xref>) and dye segregation at the surface of the cathode or its partial dissolution in the electrolyte (N719 was still detected in its active form by Raman analysis, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Open circuit voltage and discharge curves of LiFePO<sub>4</sub> film on ITO.</title><p>Open circuit voltage (OCV) curves and galvanostatic discharge profile of ITO@LFP+CNTs+PVDF.

The band offset relative to the vacuum level is <italic>E</italic><sub>off</sub>=<italic>V</italic><sub>vac</sub>–<italic>E</italic><sub>VBM</sub>. The [010] surface of LFP exposed to vacuum was used in the calculation because this surface has the lowest surface energy, and consequently the highest equilibrium surface area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

The values reported here were obtained with the 35 Å vacuum layer, which converged the band positions very well. The thickness of LFP was five times greater than the dimension of the [010] direction of the lattice parameter in the calculation. Our test also shows that further increase in the LFP thickness does not significantly change the final result. The band offset of the maximum in the LFP valence band is −5.2 eV, as shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. A calculation of the band offset of FePO<sub>4</sub> by the same procedure yielded −8.3 eV. These aligned energy bands convinced us that the desired processes are as illustrated in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>. That is to say, the incident photon excites electrons in the dye molecule, pumping them to the excited LUMO, leaving a hole in the HOMO. When the LFP particles are positively charged by the holes, the electrochemical potential for Li<sup>+</sup> increases. The equilibrium between the Li<sup>+</sup> in the electrolyte and LFP particles shifts towards more Li<sup>+</sup> in the electrolyte as the cathode is charged. However, when most of the LFP is transformed to FePO<sub>4</sub>, as illustrated in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, the absorption of photons does not lead to hole transfer to FePO<sub>4</sub>, therefore the reaction stops. The undesired processes, such as charge carrier recombination, electrons hopping to FePO<sub>4</sub> do exist and adversely affect energy conversion efficiency as already alluded earlier. Proper selection of cell components and interfacial electrode engineering should be pursued for improving the efficiency of the device. As for the electrons, it appears that they do not hop into FTO or ITO to any significant extent if consider that during OCV illumination no current was flowing between the two electrodes, lithium reduction is energetically unfavourable (see next paragraph) and the FTO/ITO collectors remained totally transparent, without showing any lithium intercalation product (that is, the TCO did not become brownish).

Similarly, the dye could not have been reduced considering that its tiny amount (1:1,000) was able to oxidize the whole LFP for at least 15 times as confirmed by Raman analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>) that revealed the presence of N719 (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>) in photo-oxidized sample with FePO<sub>4</sub> (refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>).

Having ruled out the reduction of Li<sup>+</sup> ions at the anode or the reduction of any component of the TCO/LFP/dye photocathode we propose that the photo-generated electrons react with some component(s) of the electrolyte used (LiPF<sub>6</sub> in EC/DEC+VC). To verify this scenario, we tested different electrolytes: 1 M LiPF<sub>6</sub> in EC/DEC+2% VC, 1 M LiPF<sub>6</sub> in THF (in THF polymerization reactions are slower than in DME/DOL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>), 1 M LiPF<sub>6</sub> in TEGDME<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, 1 M LiTFSI in EC/DEC +2% VC and 1 M LiTFSI in DME/DOL. We observed photo-oxidation of LFP to take place (after 24 h illumination) only when LiPF<sub>6</sub> in EC–DEC+2% VC is used as electrolyte (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Fig. 17</xref>). This series of tests confirms that the photo-oxidation is facilitated by certain electrolyte components as are, for example, EC and DEC that are known to be prone to reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. We observed further that the reaction in LiPF<sub>6</sub> in EC/DEC+2% VC involved oxygen as only in the presence of oxygen gas (dry room environment) and not in the presence of argon, did photo-oxidation take place (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Fig. 18</xref>). We propose the following reaction sequence to account for these observations: the photo-generated electrons reduce oxygen and the new reduced oxygen species (for example, peroxide and/or superoxide<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>) being unstable react with the carbonate-based electrolyte to form SEI as also has been observed in Li–O<sub>2</sub> battery studies by Zhu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup> and Read<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.

However NMR could not detect any reduced electrolyte species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Figs 24–27</xref>). The low reactivity of LiTFSI in EC/DEC+2% VC should be due to differences in viscosity and lithium ion solvation properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> that hinder lithium release by LFP photo-oxidation.</p><p id="Par18">We also found that when the LFP film was immersed in the LiPF<sub>6</sub> in EC/DEC+2%VC electrolyte under light illumination without any lithium metal present, then no photo-oxidation was observed in 48 h. But photo-oxidation did take place after 7 days (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Fig. 19</xref>). These results suggest that the presence of lithium metal as CE accelerates the LFP photo-oxidation reaction via catalytic reduction reaction of the coupled oxygen/electrolyte. To verify the role of the lithium metal CE and the presumed reduction of the electrolyte (EC/DEC solvent components) via the reduced oxygen species formed by the photo-generated electrons, we performed a new OCV test under illumination using the two-electrode (LFP versus Li) cell configuration the results of which are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Fig. 20</xref>. As it can be seen the OCV of LFP increased with illumination time again and LFP converted to FePO<sub>4</sub>. Therefore, the presence of lithium, even without passage of electrons via the external circuit, is confirmed to facilitate this photo-oxidation reaction. We procedeed afterwards to examine the reaction products formed on the lithium metal (CE) surface after completion of the photo-oxidation test. The analysis revealed the formation of crystals (cubic and polyhedral; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Fig. 21a,b</xref>) that contain lithium, carbon and oxygen as confirmed by energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Fig. 21c</xref>).

We have further performed EDS analysis on the Li metal anode after 48 h of discharge and we observed no more micron-sized cubic crystals that constituted the major part of the SEI but only rings composed of Li, C and O (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2335">Supplementary Figs 29–31</xref>). In other words, we observed just remnants of the SEI after discharge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Global mechanism of LFP photo-oxidation</title><p id="Par19">Considering that no external current between the electrodes is possible during OCV illumination, that lithium is not deposited on the anode but rather consumed during the discharge, the composition of the electrolyte has an influence on the photo-oxidation reaction, that the presence of lithium metal facilitates the photo-oxidation of LFP, and that the SEI crystals formed on the lithium anode surface at least partially dissolves during discharge, we propose the following mechanism (as depicted in <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). The photo-assisted charging of LFP in the LFP(dye)/electrolyte/Li cell involves in addition to the oxidation of LFP via the injection of holes from the photo-excited dye, a two-step reaction sequence in which firstly the photo-generated electrons promote reduction of oxygen followed by the reaction with carbonate-based electrolyte (probably the ethylene carbonate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>) and secondly lithium metal surface appear to provide favourable nucleation sites enabling the deposition of the new Li-carbonate-based electrolyte derivative components as Li compound crystal-containing SEI thanks to accumulated Li<sup>+</sup> ions at the surface. The SEI film crystals mostly dissolve during discharging. The SEI does not appear to hinder the transfer of Li<sup>+</sup> ions from the anode to the cathode during discharge. Therefore, the lithium metal facilitates the photo-oxidation reaction that mimics the charge process of a Li-ion battery under light irradiation, although no traceable Li reduction takes place at the anode.

Thus while FePO<sub>4</sub> can be converted to LFP by the externally applied current during discharge, the formed LFP reconverts into FePO<sub>4</sub> again by the photo-excited N719 dye that injects holes to LFP and electrons to oxygen, with the latter leading to formation of peroxide or superoxide species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> that subsequently react with carbonates.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Discharge curves of films in different gas atmosphere at fixed C/24 discharge rate.</title><p>Discharge curves of CNTs+N719 dye film under Argon gas (black line), CNTs+ N719 dye film in dry room (blue line), film of CNTs in dry room (red line) and LiFePO<sub>4</sub>+CNTs+dye film in dry room (green line).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2017_Article_BFncomms14643_Fig8_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par22">In summary, we described the direct (open circuit) photo-oxidation of LFP nanocrystals by light irradiation in the presence of a N719-Ruthenium-dye as hybrid photo-cathode in a two-electrode system with Li metal anode and LiPF<sub>6</sub>-EC/DEC/VC electrolyte that corresponds to standard Li-ion battery charging. Dye-sensitization generates electron–hole pairs with the holes aiding the chemical conversion of high surface area LFP (triphylite) nanoplatelets to FePO<sub>4</sub> (heterosite) at the cathode and electrons utilized in the formation of SEI at the anode via oxygen reduction. LFP (∼3.4 V versus Li<sup>+</sup>/Li), in analogy with the I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>/I<sup>−</sup> couple (∼3.1 V versus Li<sup>+</sup>/Li) in DSSCs, acts effectively as a reversible redox agent for the regeneration of the dye N719. Photo-oxidation of LFP is pronounced with colloidal nanoplatelets but less so with hydrothermally synthesized crystals reflecting the strong nanosize/surface area effect. The SEI consists of organic lithium carbonate deposits-their formation of which is driven by the reduction of oxygen gas into per-/super-oxide species followed by the reaction of the latter with carbonate electrolyte components and accumulated of Li ions at the surface of the Li metal anode. Upon discharge most of the SEI dissolves and is reconstituted partially with repeated photo-charging and galvanostatic discharging cycling. The generated discharge current corresponds to a capacity at least two times the theoretical value of LFP. The same capacity was observed after 15 discharges (and 15 OCV photo-assisted charges). The excess capacity is attributed to the fact that the photocathode continues undergoing partial charge during galvanostatic discharge because of its exposure to light that induces LFP to delithiate, hence creating vacancies for extra charge storage.</p><p id="Par23">The combined photo-conversion and storage efficiency of the prototype two-electrode cell with LFP/CNTs/N719 as photo-cathode and Li metal as CE was calculated to be in the range 0.06–0.08%. Though these values are low we should keep in mind that these are early performance data corresponding to electrodes made of LFP nanoparticles deposited on (transparent conductive oxide) TCO along carbon and a binder. To put this into perspective hybrid devices made of tandems of solar cells and energy storage cells yield till very recently efficiencies &lt;1% (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>). Moreover, the present system featuring a hybrid photo-cathode (LFP/dye) is unlike the previous in-series concept<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> or three-electrode systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. At this early stage, we attribute such low current efficiency to large charge recombination losses at the LFP/dye/electrolyte interface. Our findings open new possibilities in designing photo-rechargeable Li-ion batteries based on a two-electrode device configuration. Among the critical issues that need to be tackled before such an exciting nanotechnology device becomes a reality include interfacial engineering of the LFP/dye photo-cathode to reduce charge recombination losses and use of a reversible redox mediator that can accept the photo-generated electrons thus suppressing undesirable electrolyte reduction reactions. Also it is important to select an anode that can provide an operating voltage of ∼0.7–1 V as suggested by redox flow battery systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup> and iodine based systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par24">Lithium iodide (beads, ≥99%), lithium hydroxide, iron(II) chloride anhydrous (≥98%), iron sulphate heptahydrate (≥99.0%), lithium hydroxide monohydrate (≥98.0%), phosphoric acid (85% w/w in water, ≥99.9% trace metals basis), ammonium phosphate dibasic (≥98%), ammonium hydroxide (solution 28.0–30.0% NH<sub>3</sub> basis), ascorbic acid (≥99.0%), oleylamine (&gt;70%), 1-octadecene (&gt;90%), ethanol and dichloromethane, Di-tetrabutylammonium <italic>cis</italic>-bis(isothiocyanato)bis(2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylato)ruthenium(II) dye (N719 dye, 95%), tetrahydrofuran (THF, anhydrous, ≥99,9%), tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (TEGDME, ≥99.0%), <italic>N</italic>-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP, &gt;97%), vinylene carbonate (VC) (≥97%) and bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium (LiTFSI) salt were purchased from Sigma Aldrich while carbon nanotubes were purchased from CNano Ltd.
