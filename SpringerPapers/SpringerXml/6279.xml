Here we demonstrate polymer-based photovoltaic devices on plastic foil substrates less than 2 μm thick, with equal power conversion efficiency to their glass-based counterparts. They can reversibly withstand extreme mechanical deformation and have unprecedented solar cell-specific weight. Instead of a single bend, we form a random network of folds within the device area. The processing methods are standard, so the same weight and flexibility should be achievable in light emitting diodes, capacitors and transistors to fully realize ultrathin organic electronics.

Organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells are highly promising in this sector. The thin-film devices comprise two electrodes, a light-harvesting active layer and blocking or transport layers. The total thickness of a functional OPV cell is only a few hundred nanometres. Primary benefits of OPV cells are often listed as low cost, low weight, flexibility and compatibility with reel-to-reel processing for high volume production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Efficiency and lifetime have reached commercially acceptable levels and flexible modules with roughly 1.5% power conversion efficiency, and over 1 year lifetimes are already on the market<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings have attained laboratory-scale cell efficiencies of 10%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Weight and flexibility are two of the primary benefits of OPV; yet these mechanical properties are entirely dominated by the device substrate, which leaves much room for advancement of this technology.</p><p id="Par4">Among the thinnest reported substrates for OPV devices are 125-μm plastic foils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. The resulting solar cells are highly flexible with a radius of curvature of 5 mm. It is further interesting to consider not only flexibility but also stretchability. Stretchable inorganic PV devices were made from an array of GaAs microcells arranged in a sub-module configuration with high areal coverage on a patterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) supporting layer. They have demonstrated 20% strain and wrapping around cylinders with 1.5 mm radius<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Stretchable organic solar cells have been fabricated directly on pre-stretched PDMS (thickness 200–500 μm), which can then attain 27% tensile strain reversibly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. A liquid metal back contact was used to improve mechanical stability. For both the stretchable and flexible OPV devices, the actual solar cell still constitutes &lt;0.25% of the total device thickness.</p><p id="Par5">In this work, we answer the questions 'how light?' and 'how flexible?' OPV can be by demonstrating the extremes achievable today. We present ultrathin, light, flexible and compliant OPV devices constructed on only 1.4-μm-thick polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates, where the total thickness of the device is less than a typical thread of spider silk. The substrate is commercially available Mylar 1.4 CW02, a commodity scale PET film commonly used as a foil capacitor dielectric. We obtain solar cells with 4.2% power conversion efficiency, an unprecedented specific weight value of 10 W g<sup>−1</sup>, high flexibility and can reversibly attain tensile strains of more than 300% on an elastomeric support.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ultrathin solar cells</title><p id="Par6">An ultrathin OPV cell is shown schematically in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>.

The PET adheres to the PDMS-coated glass via weak van der Waals bonding, which allows standard laboratory processes such as spin coating, thermal annealing and vacuum evaporation. The primary functions of the glass support are to maintain planarity during processing and to ease the handling of the device, and the PET can be easily removed by peeling it away.

After removal from the supporting glass, it is difficult to maintain planarity in the device, and therefore to know the incident area for calculation of current density (<italic>J</italic>) and power conversion efficiency (<italic>η</italic>). All measurements while the device is still attached to the glass support are scaled per unit area, using a conservative area estimate as the PEDOT:PSS transparent electrode is difficult to pattern exactly.

In order to do so, we transfer the device from the glass support to a pre-stretched elastomer (3 M VHB 4905). The device on PET sticks to the elastomer very well, and the glass support can be removed. Two rigid plastic spacers are placed on the elastomer, leaving a gap of 1 cm for the compression and stretching of the device. This assures that the strain will be nearly one dimensional and concentrated in the region of the active device, which occupies roughly half of the 1 cm gap. The rigid spacers are brought closer together in steps of 1 mm, corresponding to 10% compression. For each step, the <italic>I</italic>-<italic>V</italic> characteristics are measured under the solar simulator, and the results are shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>. It is clear that the device remains a functional solar cell down to 80% compression. Upon re-stretching the device, it returns to its pre-compression operation state. According to accepted definitions for stretchable conducting films, this re-stretching process corresponds to 400% tensile strain in a fully functional solar cell, where 300% is considered ultrahigh for a single conducting film<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A more detailed description of the calculation of compression and tensile strain is given in the Methods section, and an illustration of the compression/stretching apparatus is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM696">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>. The <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>, <italic>I</italic><sub>SC</sub>, FF and output power are plotted as a function of compression (and corresponding tensile strain) in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>, all normalized to their pre-compression value. As the incident area should track linearly with the compression, we would expect the <italic>I</italic><sub>SC</sub> and power to scale exactly with the compression, following the black line in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>.

In the compressed state, there is more light absorbing polymer per unit incident area. Light not absorbed on the first pass through the active layer could also be reflected back into the device on the other side of a crease, allowing for improved overall absorption. This is evident in the relative total reflectance of the sample shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM696">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>, where less light is reflected in various stages of compression. Additionally, the compression does not decrease the device area uniformly. As the device area is defined by the metal back electrode, it is likely that the overall substrate compresses more on the edge. Thus, when the total compression is 50%, the device area is not reduced by exactly the same value. This effect can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM696">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>, upon the very first compression of the sample. It becomes much less prominent on the subsequent cycles. Compression values greater than 60% likely approach the limit of the test fixture, and the physical deformation may no longer be quasi-linear. There is evidence for both an increase in light harvesting and an error in area estimation upon compression.</p><p id="Par16">The complex formation of folds and wrinkles, as seen in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM696">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>, also allows biaxial compression. In order to attach the solar cell to the elastomer, now pre-stretched in two directions, the rigid plastic pieces that constricted the compression to one dimension were left off. This makes the actual compression of the device much less certain. Device performance under reversible biaxial compression is shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>, where the device withstands roughly 20% biaxial compression and re-stretching.

The fabrication processes used are entirely planar, avoiding transfer printing processes, and are thus reel-to-reel compatible. Any microstructuring, surface conformation or other physical manipulation can be performed subsequently, without integrating specific geometries into cell construction. Adhesion to a pre-streched elastomer is done in a single step after device fabrication. The complete solar cells show large, reversible quasi-linear compression ratios over 70%, corresponding to a tensile strain of more than 300% from the wrinkled state.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Cyclic stretching</title><p id="Par18">Though compression and stretching of the device induces very little change in the device performance, there may be small changes that accumulate over many cycles.

At each cycle the <italic>I-V</italic> characteristics were measured under the solar simulator, both in the compressed and extended state.

We suspect that the <italic>I</italic><sub>SC</sub> decreases gradually because the device never fully returns to its original incident area. The elastomer is visco-elastic and therefore permanently deforms over time. This is evident after cycling, as there are still visible ripples in the device. The reduction in FF may be due to increased resistivity of the metal or PEDOT:PSS electrodes. Both layers may form cracks under repeated cycling, which reduces the conductivity and increases the series resistance of the device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, cyclic tests of resistivity of Ag and PEDOT:PSS layers on the same PET substrate are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM696">Supplementary Fig. S4</xref>. The resistance increases by &lt;10% in a Ag film and there is no detectable increase seen in PEDOT:PSS after 100 cycles. There is also an additional resistance induced by the deterioration of the rigid metal wire contact. It is difficult to quantify the contributions from the external contact and the actual device degradation. But in all of our tests, the external wire broke loose before the device degraded catastrophically.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par20">The power conversion efficiency of a solar cell corresponds directly to the power per unit area, and is the primary metric for describing solar cell performance.

We place the 3 M VHB 4905 elastomer between the two clamps and stretch it by moving the clamps further apart. We then place rigid delimiters to define a compression and stretching zone, where the distance between the two rigid delimiters is exactly 1 cm. We define this to be <italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub>. Then we place the solar cell onto the elastomer. The active area of the cell is roughly 2×5 mm<sup>2</sup>, and we align the long dimension in the direction of the compression. Thus, the cell occupies roughly half of the 1 cm gap in the compression direction. We then compress the cell by moving the rigid delimiters closer together, allowing the elastomer to relax, which compresses the device area. The compression zone is 5×1 cm<sup>2</sup>, so the deformation is quasi-linear and quasi-reversible, though there is always a small, unintentional bi-axial and/or permanent deformation due to the visco-elasticity of the elastomer. The area changes with the linear change in distance between the rigid delimiters. We define the compression to be (<italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub>−<italic>L</italic>)/<italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub>. Shrinking the gap from 10 to 2 mm corresponds to an 80% compression. The definition of tensile strain uses the fully relaxed (smallest) state as the starting point. So after relaxing to 2 mm, re-stretching to 10 mm would give a tensile strain of (10–2 mm)/2 mm, or 400% tensile strain. Both 80% compression and 400% tensile strain refer to a five times change in device area, and use either the fully stretched or fully compressed state to normalize.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Additional information</title><p id="Par29"><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Kaltenbrunner, M. <italic>et al</italic>.
