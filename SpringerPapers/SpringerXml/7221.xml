Above all, application of AI is increasing in the field of membrane-based treatment where it shows great potential until now. Membrane separations are generally recognized as energy-efficient processes. In particular, membrane desalination, forward osmosis, energy generation, and biomass treatment have shown substantial potential in modern industries, such as wastewater treatment, pharmaceuticals, petrochemicals, and natural products. All these industries consume more than 20% of total energy consumption in the world. Moreover, the laboratory research outcomes illuminate the way to better membrane design and development, including advanced process control and optimization. The membrane processes with existing technologies for a sustainable environment could be integrated with the AI model. This review summarizes several membrane-based water treatment designs and plant performances where artificial intelligence is being used to minimize waste generation and lead to cleaner production.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Artificial intelligence</kwd><kwd>Membrane separation</kwd><kwd>Water treatment</kwd><kwd>ANN</kwd><kwd>Waste

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The advent of the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other intelligent approaches such as machine learning (ML) in membrane applications led to many improvements in environmental engineering problems, especially regarding the membrane fouling in the whole processes. As reported in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, it has been discovered that modern methods such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Fuzzy Logic (FL), genetic programming, and model trees are the modeling techniques employed with success (Bagheri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2019</xref>) in several parts of the world.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A classification table of AI and ML techniques useful in the water systems</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41748_2021_220_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par3">Continuative research in the fields of AI is continuously leading to the emersion of new engineering innovations and possibilities, with features like high-efficiency standards and a “greener” approach, which are two of the leading contemporary requests to any kind of newborn technologies. With the same importance, looking back to established technologies and appliances, this AI-based approach is a promising, yet concrete, methodology to renew and optimize existing membrane-based plants, like desalination or water treatment units, for more efficient resources and energy management. On the other hand, although Bayes Model Averaging (BMA) has no direct link with any membrane-based processes, it provides a Bayesian probabilistic model to understand the propagation of the uncertainty from various sources of the input data. Unlike the PCA which performs a base change on the data, most of the time using only the main components and sometimes ignoring the rest.</p><p id="Par4">In this article, a membrane fouling control with the aid of a specific AI tool regarding a water treatment industrial plant application is explained and discussed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows an increasing trend of number of publications regarding it in the recent years); then, a new prespective of a suistainable and cleaner production of energy is also discussed.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Publications regarding AI applications to wastewater treatment (Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41748_2021_220_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>AI in Membrane Applications</title><p id="Par5">Fouling or concentration polarization is preventing the membrane to perform at its best efficiency. It can happen in all membrane-based processes. The main applications of AI in the membrane world essentially regard fouling prevention. For predicting different fouling parameters—such as permeate flux and Transmembrane Pressure (TMP)—different techniques of AI and ML have been used to improve the accuracy compared to mechanistic models and solve all types of calibration problems. In particular, the intelligent models ANNs were the first to predict and more precisely control the membrane fouling, followed by FL which may use to model membrane fouling and develop automated systems to control and manage it automated way. Simultaneously, GP has been used for the prediction and simulation (Zhao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020</xref>) (Arefi-Oskoui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2017</xref>) (Badrnezhad and Mirza <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>) (Salahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>) (Soleimani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2013</xref>) (Yusuf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2017</xref>) (Lecun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015</xref>) (Chew et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>) (Gao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>) (Huyskens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2011</xref>) (Ruder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2016</xref>) (Kamali et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>) (Netzband and Rohbrecht-Buck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1992</xref>) (Zandi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2019</xref>) (Pan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>) (Sarkar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2021</xref>) (Pan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2009</xref>) of a wastewater process design. Alternatively, Model Trees (MTs) are hierarchical structures with nodes and branches and can be applied too in different fouling prevention mechanisms. The internal nodes contain tests on the input variables; MT identifies a set of subdomains characterized by regression functions. Unlike other models, it could partly explain the hidden relationships between different parametric data of complex water treatment systems.</p><p id="Par6">A typical approach to optimize the fouling is represented by the Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with intelligent data pre-processing capabilities to mitigate fouling and reduce the cost of the cleaning mechanism. Badrnezhad and Mirza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>) used GA techniques for optimizing different operating parameters such as TMP, pH, feed temperature, and filtration time to control fouling in ultrafiltration of oily wastewater, on the other hand, Salahi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2010</xref>) used GA to find the minimum and maximum values of flux. Soleimani et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2013</xref>) proposed a GA-based multi-objective optimization for the filtration of oil from industrial wastewater for an efficient predictive system. In a very interesting work, Yusuf et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2017</xref>) introduced a model-based controller for Submerged Membrane Bio-Reactor (SMBR) filtration process, where the PSO algorithm was used as a real optimizer in updating the model-based controller cost function. Drews et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2007</xref>) developed an optimization framework that can automatically recognize the current dominant filtration mechanisms.</p><p id="Par7">Moreover, some more hybrid intelligent models exploit intelligent modeling methods and different optimization techniques. For example, Chew et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2017</xref>) (Coppola et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2021</xref>) developed a hybrid model composed of a physical model and a Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLPANN) for predicting the fouling parameters into an ultrafiltration water treatment.</p><p id="Par8">The clustering approach is an ML technique used in the membrane filtration processes to analyze the effects of the temperature impacts on the properties of sludge, the structure of the cake layer, and the fouling in an anaerobic SMBR (Alwatban et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2019</xref>) (Osman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2019</xref>). Moreover, clustering techniques were used to grouping data in different membrane fouling problems. In addition, the image recognition technology was used to control the membrane fouling, particularly in the control of the optimal filtration conditions (Huyskens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2011</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Water Treatment Plant Monitoring</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Neural Networks</title><p id="Par9">Over the last years, significant progresses have been made in several Deep Learning (DL) frameworks such as Deep Dense Neural Network (DDNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). A DNN model consists of an input layer, multiple hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer is composed of a set of artificial neurons (sometimes called nodes), which are connected with the neurons of the succeeding layer. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows a network with two hidden layers where both the first and the second hidden layer have four neurons.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>A neural network with 2 hidden layers</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41748_2021_220_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">More generally, Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of Machine Learning (ML) which has revolutionized many tasks ranging from computer vision, speak recognition, text processing, molecular and drug analysis. Basically, DL is a representation learning method composed of several representation layers, obtained by composing simple but non-linear modules (Lecun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2015</xref>). Using neural networks as the main architecture, DL is able to learn complex functions from new data instead of using handcrafted or more speculative functions, based on domain experts. Even though neural networks are not a recent paradigm, they became more successful in the past decade due to the availability of big training data and of inexpensive, parallel hardware (e.g., GPU).</p><p id="Par11">Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> illustrates the mathematical model of an artificial neuron. Each of these neurons aggregates the connections coming from the neurons in the previous layers and applies an activation function whose selection depends on the kind of modeling data and scale of values (e.g., sigmoid function for binary classification problems).

A Deep Neural Network (DNN) exploits innovative techniques (Momentum, Nesterov Accelerated Gradient AdaGrad, RMSProp, Adam) (Ruder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2016</xref>) to overcome the problems that characterize the gradient descent and backpropagation algorithms (explosion/vanishing gradient, overfitting, very long training times). DNN layers are independent of one another, that is, a specific layer can have an arbitrary number of neurons (generally, this is defined as a hyperparameter of the network). A DNN with multiple hidden layers can have the earlier layers learn about simple low-level features and have the later deeper layers detect more complex features.</p><p id="Par13">Convolutional Neural Networks, introduced in 1998, is inspired by the behavior of the human visual cortex. Just like ordinary Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are made up of neurons with learnable weights and biases. However, they deal with the problem that the number of training parameters of a dense neural network can grow very fast as the network becomes bigger. For example, if you have a grayscale image of size 100 × 100 every neuron in a first hidden layer of a regular neural network would have 100 × 100 = 10,000 parameters. For facing this problem CNN’s introduces convolutional layers that use the convolution operation (from signal theory) by applying a filter (or also called kernel) in different positions of the input to extract local features stored in the features map. Each of the neurons of a convolutional layer does not receive all inputs (e.g., all the pixels of the image) as in dense networks, but only those belonging to the area determined by the filter.</p><p id="Par14">Another typical layer of CNNs is the pooling layer that can be considered as a subsampling layer for reducing the size of the input layer. Generally, after stacking convolutional and pooling layers, one or more fully connected layers are added.</p><p id="Par15">Neural networks that allow just “forward” connections, or in which information flows sequentially from layer to layer towards the output, are called feedforward neural networks.</p><p id="Par16">Other types of neural networks with feedback connections are called recurrent neural networks (RNNs). They are specialized in analyzing temporal sequences of data. The output that a recurrent network returns depends on both the current input and the previously processed inputs, which allows the creation of internal memory for the network.</p><p id="Par17">If the sequences to be processed are of considerable length, the state cannot remember the oldest inputs. This phenomenon could represent a problem, for example, in the analysis of a sentence where the first words can have significant importance in determining its meaning. Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) are special kinds of RNN designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem.</p><p id="Par18">In general, the challenges of wastewater treatment are many, e.g.: the correct balances of microbes into the activated sludge plant treatments, the optimization of the treatment, the daily or weekly or seasonally variation of the influent hydraulic and organic loads, to remain within the discharge limits, the reduction of the environmental damage and the pollution incidents. In this context, the smart network monitoring of the plant results in a real and actual challenge to improve all aspects of the plant. A topic like AI application for Membrane Bio-Reactor (MBR)-based technologies is increasing drastically and more and more research are going on around us (Kamali et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2020</xref>). The first report about it was by Netzband and Rohbrecht-Buck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1992</xref>)<italic>,</italic> and it talked about an expert system for effluent discharged treatment from degraded material disposal.

Thus, the new technologies for the water supply and its ever-increasing efficiency play a fundamental role in this world emergency analyzed through a computational method how the graphene nanometer-scale pores can filter the NaCl into the water, modeling a series of graphene nanopores with different functionalization and diameters (Cohen-Tanugi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>). The pore sizes varied within the range of 1.5–55 Å<sup>2</sup>. The study was made on pores passivated with hydroxyl groups—commonly hydrophilic to examine the effect of the pores’ chemistry on desalination dynamics. This research established that desalination performance is more sensitive to pore chemistry and size. Hydrogenated pores' hydrophobic character reduces the water flow by imposing additional order to the system. However, the limited-hydrogen bond allows a higher salt rejection compared to the pores hydroxylated.</p><p id="Par24">Alwatban et al.

The net spacers were used to mitigate the polarization, and a laminar model was used to characterize the weather, the velocity, and the concentration range in the empty channels. The simulation results underline that the pore size and the porosity are increased, while the intensity of temperature, the permeation flux, and the concentration of polarization increase as the thickness decreases. The spacers’ presence increases the membrane flux’s performance more significantly than 50% and attenuates polarization by 30%. On the other hand, Osman et al.

The phenomena equations were written in three domains, that are membrane, cold and hot channels.

Unlike the weekly or monthly traditional monitoring of the hygienic quality on the raw water sample used for drinking water production, this monitoring system was for daily monitoring, and it was fully automated. It consisted of pumps and valves for accurate management of the liquid, an incubator/reaction cell connected to a detector, and control/interfacing units. This monitoring system supported the hypothesis that warmer winters with shorter periods with ice cover on the lakes can be a consequence of climate changes and can reduce the sanitary barrier efficiency in deep lakes used as sources of drinking water. The daily fully automated monitoring could be partly offset by lower costs for manual sampling and water analysis.</p><p id="Par35">Thus, a fully automated monitoring of a wastewater plant joined with AI tools could improve both quality of the water and the operating costs.

Therefore, to obtain clean water is necessary different energy requirements. Of consequence, these systems are a combination of several unitary processes, which have been designed to manage each of these qualities. Thus, there are some cases where the chemical and physical phenomena are insufficient to implement the proper operation and control, increasing the expectation in the AI use. For example, Hitachi developed its technology—called H technology—which provides functions that result and visually represents the correlations from a large amount of numerical data, and actually, it may be used for many different applications and fields (e.g., cancer screening, food waste, shipping, fight cyber bullying into the Japanese schools, financial) (Moriwaki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2016</xref>) (Ltd. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>).

The main answer to this problem seems to reside in the usage of the most sustainable kinds of energy, therefore, combining both the use of renewable sources and a fine optimization of the efficiency of these sources. Blue energy is one of these sustainable and well promising sources of energy, they are mainly membrane-based technologies that can be finely optimized by the use of AI techniques.</p><p id="Par49">Blue energy is a term mainly related to osmotic power, which is a kind of energy that can be gathered by exploiting the salinity gradient among two different streams of water, for example freshwater and seawater. By these means, it is possible to imagine large amounts of energy harvested from the intersection of rivers and oceans. The two main membrane technologies appliable to recover osmotic energy are pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO) and Reverse Electrodialysis (RED).</p><p id="Par50">The Reverse Osmosis technique exploits hydraulic pressure to control the gradient of osmotic pressure, generated through a semipermeable membrane, thus resulting in a water flow going from a concentrated stream to the permeate side of the membrane. In addition, Pressure-Retarded Osmosis generates hydraulic pressure in the saline concentrated stream. This pressure is low compared to the osmotic pressure gradient, and as a result, a flux of water is generated through the membrane, but this time the water is flowing towards the side of a draw solution.</p><p id="Par51">Therefore, blue energy can be defined as a particular source of energy produced by the environment. This kind of life can be harvested from solar, radiofrequency radiation, piezoelectric, thermal, body motion and water flows sources. The latter resides in water masses’ movement of any head, including ocean tides, rivers and even raindrops.</p><p id="Par52">The conventional energy harvesting from flowing water sources comprises bulky devices where mechanical energy from water is transformed into electrical power (Prudell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2010</xref>). As an example of the previously cited Pressure-Retarded Osmosis, a study by Prof. Sidney Loeb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1975</xref>) is shown as pressure-retarded osmosis could be used to harvest energy from two aqueous solutions with different saline concentrations, segregated by a semipermeable membrane.</p><p id="Par53">The application of these principles has been illustrated through three main applications methods, in fact, nanogenerators can be divided into sliding droplet, flowing water, and phase change-based devices, all of them are the so-called TENGs (triboelectric energy generators), where the surface charge relocation between two materials in close contact generates a polarization as long as the two are disconnected. At this stage, a repetition of contact-and-release actions produces a current.</p><p id="Par54">Much research has been brought on the topic, and many materials have been investigated, including nanostructures. ZnO is one of the most typical materials used, having outstanding piezoelectric and semiconducting properties (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par55">Many types of devices have been studied, including Droplet-based electricity generators (DEGs) (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2020</xref>), Reverse Electrodialysis devices (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>), flowing water devices (Ravelo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>) (Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2018</xref>), electrical double layer devices (Moon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2013</xref>), zinc oxide nanosheets, where PTFE balls are placed as the superhydrophobic bottom of the system. Nanopore devises designs have been studied, including boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) and molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) nanopores (Siria et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2013</xref>) (Feng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par56">The interest in harvesting ambient energy from sources such as solar, Radio Frequency or Wi-Fi, or even thermal gradients or motion energy by piezoelectric energy harvesting devices have reached good promising steps, but any of these devices have to face the issue of relying on a source that is not stable and constant, this primarily due to their strong dependence to environment influences (Parks et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2013</xref>). From here, it is necessary to develop systems highly tolerant to power fluctuations, especially for those devices that need to respond to certain computational needs. In addition to that, ambient energy sources often translate to poor conversion efficiencies. As an example, ambient RF power sources are drastically dependent on variables as frequency, source distance, the presence of obstacles, interactions with other electromagnetic sources to mention a few of them (Visser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2008</xref>).

The energy harvesting and management sector are responsible for the power available for the sensor, processor, and transmitter units. The so-called I/O interface can comprise digital devices attached to sensing units, display units or others, or even analog units combined with antennas or electrodes. The whole design of the device is meant to reduce the power needed and, in the meantime, to address the requirements of the system.</p><p id="Par58">Recent works have focused on optimizing energy harvesting systems with AI architectures that can suit different energy sources and applications. Fluctuations in energy harvesting directly translate to devices that frequently switch on and off, so that every computational progress that is not saved in time gets lost. Using non-volatile processors (NVP), every computational progress can be stored in non-volatile memory (NVM). This process, known as checkpointing, assures the device’s recovery at the same state before the switch off due to lack of power. This process has a consistent drawback; this writing process is time and energy consuming, so it needs to be optimized at its best. This problem can be addressed either with hardware than software extents.</p><p id="Par59">Software-side optimization can be reached by both reducing the checkpoint data load and the checkpointing rate of recurrence. The latter can be addressed by the avoidance of unnecessary checkpoints or by the augmentation of the stored energy before the switch on so that the subsequent execution can last longer.</p><p id="Par60">Actions on the hardware side can include reducing the capacitor’s target voltage, where the energy is stored so that the switch on of the device can occur earlier. Consequently, a lower amount of energy results to be harvested, so this can lead to more frequent checkpointing.</p><p id="Par61">As the two optimization methods seem to act in reciprocal contrast, a good trade-off between them must be reached. Pan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2019</xref>) proposed an algorithm to reduce the checkpoints data size, in junction with another algorithm to avoid unnecessary checkpoint recurrence. The two were combined to a wake-up procedure to mitigate between the software and hardware side optimizations.</p><p id="Par62">The above-mentioned work proposes three power-saving methods to augment efficiency in energy management in a self-powered Internet of Things (IoT) device. This providing a power supply that is ultra-low-harvesting. A non-volatile processor (NVP)-aware task scheduling (NTS) is proposed to reduce the data size of the checkpointing process. Subsequently, a tentative checkpointing withdrawal (TCW) is provided to eliminate checkpointing which could result as unwanted. As the last step, a dual wake-up procedure (DWP) is added to equalize software and hardware overheads as an additive maximization of energy efficiency. In the work of Khorsand et al.
