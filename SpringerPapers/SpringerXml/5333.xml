Solving it requires reproducible, user-independent laboratory work and intelligent preselection of experiments. However, experimental materials science is a field where manual routines are still predominant, although other domains like pharmacy or chemistry have long used robotics and automation. As the number of publications on Materials Acceleration Platforms (MAPs) increases steadily, we review selected systems and fit them into the stages of a general material development process to examine the evolution of MAPs. Subsequently, we present our approach to laboratory automation in materials science. We introduce AMANDA (Autonomous Materials and Device Application Platform<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.amanda-platform.com" ext-link-type="uri"> - www.amanda-platform.com</ext-link>), a generic platform for distributed materials research comprising a self-developed software backbone and several MAPs. One of them, LineOne (L1), is specifically designed to produce and characterize solution-processed thin-film devices like organic solar cells (OSC). It is designed to perform precise closed-loop screenings of up to 272 device variations per day yet allows further upscaling. Each individual solar cell is fully characterized, and all process steps are comprehensively documented. We want to demonstrate the capabilities of AMANDA L1 with OSCs based on PM6:Y6 with 13.7% efficiency when processed in air. Further, we discuss challenges and opportunities of highly automated research platforms and elaborate on the future integration of additional techniques, methods and algorithms in order to advance to fully autonomous self-optimizing systems—a paradigm shift in functional materials development leading to the laboratory of the future.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi"

repetition of the same production process. Since the eighteenth century, increasingly automated machines have been developed to speed up production and improve quality. Today, the ever-growing automation of industrial processes has led to completely automated production plants. Computational methods and data collection further integrate the knowledge about the manufacturing processes into production planning systems in order to make informed decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. As such, these “smart” industrial processes are referred to as “Industry 4.0” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">The automation of simple scientific tasks started much later in the late nineteenth century with simple tasks like washing filtrates or conducting solvent extraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the laboratory environment, it was not until the 1980s with the pioneering work of Sasaki that more complex setups were implemented, where several devices were coupled together and samples were automatically handled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Until today, these advances are mainly found in the field of clinical and pharmacological research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">The potential for automation as a disruptive technology to greatly accelerate materials science has been recognized for years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Several programs like the Materials Genome Initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] (MGI) and the Clean Energy Materials Innovation Challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] target faster material development and commercialization by introducing automation into the field of materials science. Latter defined the combination of highly automated robotic setups with inline characterization and artificial intelligence (AI) as a Materials Acceleration Platform (MAP). First approaches of automation have been shown already a decade ago, mainly utilizing high-throughput techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. AI-guided selection of experimental parameters, so-called closed-loop optimization, emerged only recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Coupling modular robotic techniques with comprehensive data collection and artificial intelligence enables new experimental approaches like the inverse design of materials synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Automation can also be the gateway to higher reproducibility, an attribute often missing in scientific research. According to a survey by Baker among 1500 physics and chemistry scientists, more than 40% have failed to reproduce their own experiments. This rate is even as high as 60% when trying to reproduce the experiments from other laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The use of automated devices such as robots or pipetting units reduces the error into defined margins, because of enhanced repeatability and their constant accuracy. The specified operational ranges can be taken into consideration during process design but also evaluation. Automated research platforms can therefore contribute to increase the reproducibility of, and thus the confidence in published data.</p><p id="Par7">While classical automation in mass production is based on the strict repetition of the same process, it is characteristic for laboratory research in materials science to vary parameters and the process itself in order to understand and optimize a material system. For the automation of a laboratory, it is therefore critical to keep the workflows as flexible as possible. However, automated, robot-supported processes always lead to restrictions. While a typical robot for handling samples has between 3 and 10 joints, the human body has several hundred joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This means that the automated system will have significantly fewer degrees of freedom than a researcher operating with the same processing and characterization equipment. In addition, humans are not confined to a particular area—they can walk to different parts of the laboratory, while the typical robot is fixed in location. First approaches are being shown, like the <italic>mobile robot chemist,</italic> to compensate for this weakness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Nevertheless, a researcher can also make ad-hoc decisions to change a workflow or introduce a new procedure at any time, while in an automated system the development and testing of new features often delays utilization.</p><p id="Par8">Despite these challenges, flexible automated setups with customizable processes have the potential to encourage the transition from traditional laboratory work into the laboratory of the future. Highly customizable experimental design preserves a researcher’s ability of individually adapting the experiments and is key for scientific discoveries. Our vision for a laboratory of the future expands laboratory work with automation for enhanced experimental precision, implements digital technologies for data collection and storage, performs simulations and uses artificial intelligence to guide the researcher.</p><p id="Par9">In this publication, we examine the evolution of Materials Acceleration Platforms and introduce a system that goes significantly beyond the state-of-the-art. Our <italic>Autonomous Materials and Device Application Platform: AMANDA</italic><xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> is designed as a framework for the laboratory of the future, including a generic software backbone with the capability of controlling multiple Materials Accelerations Platforms. The software allows for a high degree of automation to accelerate research while keeping the laboratory processes flexible. Data is collected at all stages of the process; during preparation, execution and characterization for a comprehensive and complete documentation. All data sets are interlinked and retrievable to allow systematic analyses across experiments. Self-driven feedback loops additionally enable autonomous experimentation against optimization targets. Additionally, the system implements an experiment-as-a-service (EaaS) approach. Researchers define their experiments through a web-interface. The processing is then conducted automatically on <italic>AMANDA</italic>’s Materials Acceleration Platforms and the results can again be retrieved online.</p><p id="Par11"><italic>AMANDA</italic> is used in this publication to drive an automated experimental line which is designed to accelerate the materials and process development for solution-processed organic solar cells—<italic>LineOne (L1).</italic> Organic photovoltaics (OPV) is a promising field of materials science and a viable path toward cleaner energy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Research is driven by new materials and the production routes are defined by the complex bulk-heterojunction morphology, leading to a large variety of process parameters influencing the solar cell performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Lately the PM6<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref>:Y6<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> material system attracted a lot of attention in the OPV research community for boosting the efficiency of organic solar cells up to 18% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Adding further materials, like additional electron donors or acceptors into the PM6:Y6 active layer mixture can improve both efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and long-term stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] of produced solar cell devices. However, the complexity in the fabrication process as well as the grown number of process parameters in multi-component systems makes it increasingly difficult to investigate such systems manually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. For a systematic screening of the vast amount of promising OPV materials and combinations, utilizing automation is a viable solution and becomes more and more necessary to reduce the time of material qualification, as the availability of new materials is increasing steadily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">We demonstrate the capabilities of <italic>L1</italic> at the hand of the state-of-the-art OPV material system PM6:Y6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In this work, <italic>L1</italic> processed complete PM6:Y6-based bulk-heterojunction solar cells in air. A power conversion efficiency of 13.7% was reached, which compares to other reports on the processing of that material system in ambient atmosphere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Furthermore, a reproducibility study was performed over the course of 3 months on that material system. In 19 different experiments with the same materials and process parameters, we show that <italic>L1</italic> performs steadily at a very low deviation with an interquartile range of 0.74% in power conversion efficiency (<italic>PCE</italic>). We take advantage of this reproducibility to investigate the influence of solid content and solution amount for the spin coating process on the solar cell performance. Additionally, we discuss the difficulties but also the advantages of operating fully integrated MAPs. Finally, we elaborate the future development roadmap for the <italic>AMANDA</italic> Platform as well as the opportunities we see by the implementation of such systems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>The evolution of Materials Acceleration Platforms</title><p id="Par15">The development of humankind is strongly linked to the evolution of materials. As knowledge and technical skills improved, people gained access to more complex material compositions and manufacturing processes. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a qualitatively relates the complexity of material composition and processes for fabricating functional materials throughout the historical eras. Material compositions used in the distant past, such as Bronze, consisted of only two elements. In strong contrast to this binary compound, the chemical parameter space available in the organic chemistry of small molecules alone is estimated at around 10<sup>63</sup> possible molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. A similar increase in complexity is seen in the processing of materials. To make bronze, tin and copper ore were molten at around 1000 °C for a few hours about 5000 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Nowadays, the process to get electronic grade, high purity silicon is much more complex. The commonly used Czochralski process for the production of silicon single crystals, needs temperatures of around 1400 °C, high purity raw material containing, e.g., less than 0.2 parts per billion of boron and phosphorus, intensive Argon purging of the reactor and slow, yet very consistent pulling speeds of a single-crystal seed of few millimeter per minute [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The dimensionality of the parameter space increases dramatically with growing complexity of the compounds and processes. A vast multi-dimensional space requires a structured examination, however finding its optimum becomes an increasingly daunting task. In order to master this challenge, materials science today relies on the intuition and experience of scientists to reduce the necessary number of samples. In order to transfer this complex optimization problem to automated systems, it is crucial to understand the process of material development and divide it into its individual parts.

The individual experimental parameters are chosen by the researcher (oftentimes students) and varied in order to reach some sort of optimum. The selection of parameters relies on a mixture of knowledge, experimentation results and intuition in order to improve performance step by step (compare Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c: manual research). Precision relies on the thoroughness, diligence, dexterity and aptitude of the scientist performing the work, all factors that may change on a daily basis. This leads to a strong user-dependency of experimental results and can therefore impair the reproducibility of scientific results. Furthermore, only successful experiments and results are usually published while unsuccessful experiments are often not even documented. Much of the knowledge that might still be important for a systematic understanding is often lost as it has neither been stored nor shared among peers.</p><p id="Par22">The purpose of automation in R&amp;D (different to automation in production) is not so much about being faster, but it is rather about guaranteeing highest data quality, best possible reproducibility, control over all parameters and the complete collection of all data in a database. Automated laboratory systems can relieve scientists from repetitive laboratory work and give them more time to design and evaluate their experiments carefully. For processes which involve manual routines, like, e.g., pipetting, they offer a high reproducibility. Automated systems also make it easy to systematically collect large amounts of additional data, like timings, temperature, humidity or other conditions which a researcher often would not collect in her laboratory book for later evaluation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c: automated research). Yet, even with the benefits of automation, the systematic and complete screening of all parameter dimensions is not feasible in high-dimensional spaces due to the large number of experiments required. Employing closed-loop inline AI optimization to guide the search for an optimum reduces the amount of experiments. The enabler to properly use AI is a systematic data collection in a machine-readable format. Utilizing computational predictions allows MAPs to autonomously select which points to probe while scientists can focus on the experimental hypothesis and the inference from the collected data (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c: closed-loop research). This approach makes much better use of the intellectual resources of the scientists. At the same time, the reproducibility of automated processing provides the required data quality for a precise reconstruction of the complex hypersurfaces—minimizing the required samples to find an optimum. The drastic reduction in the number of experiments, as well as the scalability of the approach, are the driving force for an accelerated discovery of innovative functional materials.</p><p id="Par23">The advantages of automated setups have led to the increased use of such systems in recent years. The life sciences were among the first fields to adopt equipment with features of MAPs. The field of pharmacy and drug research was revolutionized through the introduction of automation by Mitsuhide Sasaki from 1981 to 1992 at the Kochi Medical School [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The field of synthetic chemistry was also among the “early adopters” of automation, with first reports on automated synthesis dating all the way back to 1966 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. An early overview for automated setups in the field of chemistry was already compiled by Lindsey in 1992 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Highly automated setups comparable to MAPs were first introduced in the fields of systems biology with landmark systems like ADAM and EVE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], which already combined high degrees of automation, data extraction and hypothesis-driven closed-loop repetition for dedicated tasks like yeast or drug screening.</p><p id="Par24">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d captures the evolution of automated setups in materials science over the last decade, categorizing their degree of automation and their capabilities at different stages of the functional materials development process. The figure focuses somewhat on platforms for photovoltaic materials, yet we included selected other notable robotic systems for reference and comparison. Their capabilities from chemical synthesis up to stability testing are shown on the y-axis. The left labels categorize the generalized materials development process into stages from synthesis to qualification via stress tests, which are implemented by the MAPs. Specific designations for OPV research are shown on the right side, covering the range from polymer synthesis to stability testing.</p><p id="Par25">The first step in the development of new functional materials is the <italic>chemical synthesis</italic> (e.g., an organic semiconducting polymer). In order to process these synthesized materials, the substances must be brought into a <italic>precursor</italic> state (e.g., a formulated ink made from an organic polymer). If solution-based processes are used, this typically involves steps like mixing, filtering, dispersing or dissolving. The precursors are then processed into some <italic>component</italic> (e.g., a layer on a substrate in OPV). Depending on the field of application this component can have many manifestations. To get the desired <italic>functionality</italic> additional steps or materials usually are applied, e.g., deposition of an electrode grid, interlayers or protective coatings. If the functionality needed for a specific application like the power conversion for a solar cell is achieved, the temporal variation of that property can be tracked. This is usually done by a stress test, such as a light or heat-induced stability quantification in photovoltaics.</p><p id="Par26">By applying these categories of the materials development process, we examine the development of MAPs.

WANDA is a pipetting robot with a specially developed low thermal mass reactor for fully automated solution-based synthesis of colloidal nanocrystals. WANDA was utilized to perform high-throughput mapping of materials ratios and other process conditions with the purpose to optimize photoluminescence yield and peak width, upconversion luminescence and polydispersity of different nanocrystals.

The 4-dimensional parameter space of the nanotube growth is spanned by reaction temperature, ethene and hydrogen partial pressure and water content. While the synthesis and analysis of the nanotubes are automated, the prediction of further parameter combinations by a linear regression model was first conducted manually off-line. In 2016, the authors reported an update to their system which has since been able to perform inline closed-loop prediction.</p><p id="Par29">In the past 5 years, the systems have become more and more sophisticated.

They utilize a system for building-block-based synthesis with standardized chemical reactions to synthesize 14 different classes of small molecules. They also discovered a commonly applicable catch-and-release purification based on a common key intermediate. The synthesis is broken down to deprotection, coupling and purification and works with a lot of commercially available building blocks.

The synthesis module is abstracted to four general steps, namely reaction, work-up, isolation and purification. The abstraction is formalized to a chemical programming language, out of which the so-called <italic>Chempiler</italic> can generate low-level instructions for the hardware modules. For synthesis of a new molecule, a retrosynthetic module generates a synthesis route, which is then carried out by the synthesis module.

As a consequence, the developed framework supports a large variety of equipment, with a toolset for quick integration of new devices into the system. Through this flexible approach the <italic>AMANDA</italic> control software is able to model a very large number of processes. Instead of hard programmed sequences, the ability to operate on so-called sequence plans is provided. These are highly customizable process recipes for the research facility which can be either arbitrarily arranged or automatically generated. They enable working with and tracking of variables as well as the usage of standard control flow operations (e.g., loops, cases, jumps) in the process. This allows the conduction of any desired researcher-defined experiment sequence within the capabilities of the given hardware.</p><p id="Par46">The sequence plans are handled in the control module of the system. This module provides means of parallelization through a token-based system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] in order to make the best possible use of the equipment available and increase the average machine utilization time. Apart from parallelization <italic>AMANDA</italic> also has the capability of handling multiple hardware research facilities with the same software and database. This is important, especially when it comes to scalability. The hardware structure can be duplicated easily if there is an increased demand for research capacity. Likewise, it might be necessary to break the workflow, e.g., to perform a particular characterization that is not possible in the line but on another setup. This feature of distributed control goes beyond just using a common control program for the facilities or a common user interface.</p><p id="Par47">To make the distributed control possible, <italic>AMANDA</italic> intrinsically assigns every item that is processed a unique sample ID. For example, with the facility <italic>L1</italic> we are able to conduct complete experiments, starting at stock solutions, continuing with substrate handling and layer formation, evaporation of back electrodes and characterization of the working cells. It is possible to remove samples from this sequence, perform process steps or analytics on these samples and return them into the sequence at a later point in time. Through the unique IDs, samples can be tracked and handled throughout the complete laboratory “landscape.”</p><p id="Par48">In order to implement that level of data penetration, a considerable effort was put into properly defining the database.

This especially relates to the referencing, the cross-linking and traceability of data entries. In addition, the developed software by design tracks the actions with all the materials, substrates and supplies from registration upon delivery, over processing until final discarding.

Examples are a thermal treatment of a sample at a certain temperature for a certain duration or a spin coating task with its processing parameters. The whole experiment can then be described as an arbitrary list of tasks, which constitute a so-called sequence plan.</p><p id="Par68">Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows an example on how one full production and characterization of an OPV sample is mapped into individual tasks. The sequence plan, represented by the tasks, is stored in the database and waits as a “print job” to be triggered by an operator. <italic>AMANDA</italic> then informs the operator in the laboratory to load fresh substrates and stock solutions into <italic>L1</italic>. The production process starts with a reference measurement of the blank substrate consisting of a photograph and an absorbance measurement. In parallel to that characterization, the solution for the first layer is prepared. The desired amounts of the stock solutions are each aspirated into one of the pipetting channels and dispensed into a common, small container. The containment is shaken in order to achieve a good blend before the mixture is used in the process. Subsequently, the first layer is formed by spin coating and in predefined areas removed again with a cotton swab. This cleansing is required to enable an electrical contact to the bottom transparent electrode layer for the later conducted electrical characterization. For this purpose, a cotton swab is picked up by a pipetting channel and wiped over the substrate short before the layer is thermally annealed. This procedure (characterization and solution mixing, spin coating, wiping, annealing) is repeated until all solution-based layers are formed. Another optical characterization is conducted before the final top electrode layer is applied by thermal evaporation. Finally, a current–voltage measurement of the completed sample is taken in dark and under AM1.5 illumination by utilizing a solar simulator. A stability measurement can optionally be performed on the solar cells. For this purpose, the samples are transferred to the module for accelerated aging and exposed to LED light of up to 15 suns. This testing can be interrupted by IV measurements in given intervals based on illumination exposure, temperature over time or fixed timings to gain insight into the changing performance behavior.

The absolute difference of the OD before and after spin coating was calculated at the PM6 absorption peak wavelength of 620 nm. The OD values and the solar cell performance values are plotted against each other in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c for each of the six cells on the sample.

For thicker active layers, the <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> rises until it reaches its maximum at an OD of around 0.65.

For this procedure, only the stock solutions were prepared by hand as the liquid handling robot created the appropriate mixture. With this generic approach, we are able to continuously probe the complete compositional space automatically, even for very complex, high-dimensional problems.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Spin coating parameter study—volume</title><p id="Par75">To explore the possibility of minimizing material consumption we varied the amount of solution deposited on the sample to form the active layer during a dynamic spin coating process. In our manual routines, we tend to use a solution volume (<italic>V</italic><sub>spin</sub>) of 50 µl for our 25 × 25 mm substrates. For this experiment, we used 50 µl as a starting point and reduced it down to 5 µl. A set of pictures taken of the active layer films while systematically decreasing the <italic>V</italic><sub>spin</sub> is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a. For volumes at or below 15 µl, one can see clearly that the substrate surface is not fully covered anymore with the wet film, which leads to torn films toward the outside of the substrates. This behavior is expected and can be easily explained by the insufficient amount of applied material.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Photographs of PM6:Y6 layers spin-coated automatically on AMANDA L1 while varying V<sub>spin</sub> from 5 µl to 50 µl. <bold>b</bold> Solar cell performance of the samples shown in (a), plotted over V<sub>spin</sub></p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10853_2021_6281_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par76">The layer quality however seems to decrease again for higher volumes of 30 µl and above as the films tend to be increasingly inhomogeneous and show features that resemble drying stains. These artifacts in all likelihood result from too much solution in those particular spots. This excess solution is not pushed off the substrate fast enough by centrifugal forces and dries inhomogeneously on the sample surface. To avoid this behavior, the removal rate of the excess solution has to be higher than the rate of the solution’s solvent evaporation.</p><p id="Par77">Adjusting the parameters, e.g., solvent, solvent additives, liquid volume, spin coating velocity, etc. can help to reach an optimal, homogeneous film as well as having an effect on the composition and morphology. In this experiment, we used chloroform which has a very high evaporation rate due to its low boiling point. Since the morphology formation of PM6:Y6 layers is strongly dependent on the choice of the processing solvent, a change to high boiling solvents is detrimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The control of the layer thickness is therefore made possible by changing the spin coating velocity, the solid content and the amount of used solvent. Nevertheless, those parameters can also influence the drying kinetics and thus lead to a different microstructure of the resulting film. It is therefore important that those parameters can be adjusted individually when trying to find optimal process conditions.</p><p id="Par78">Altogether in our experiments, the layers with the best visual appearance are formed with a <italic>V</italic><sub>spin</sub> of 20 µl and 25 µl.

For 5 µl, the performance drops dramatically, as the active layer film coverage over all the solar cells of a sample is not given. For 30 µl and 40 µl, the performance varies especially in fill factor and short-circuit current, which can be attributed to poor layer homogeneity. Overall, the best results were achieved with volumes of 20 and 25 µl. This is half of the amount used in our manual processes and shows <italic>L1</italic> can decrease the necessary material quantities per substrate by 50%.

In order to start a process with solutions and conclude with fully evaluated solar cells, the whole process chain has to be broken down into many subtasks that need to be automated and coordinated. Every action usually performed by an operator needs to be mapped onto an automated system with rather limited degrees of freedom.</p><p id="Par85">While not obvious at first hand, the biggest challenges for integrating an OPV process into <italic>L1</italic> were rather the small things that usually go unnoticed. Good examples for this are trivial actions like opening up a screw capped vial, wiping away a stripe of a 200 nm thick layer of polymer or even just putting a shadow mask onto some substrates and turning that stack around. Those tasks are straightforward for humans with 27 joints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] in one hand alone. But for a single 6-axis robot with a binary-state open/close gripper, it is not simple at all. As we implemented the OPV fabrication process on <italic>L1</italic>, we broke down the whole process into 50 single tasks which can be executed natively by one of the integrated devices (see Table S2). However, for several tasks we adapted and validated alternative approaches, or had to devise attachments and workarounds. For the opening of vials, we exchanged screw caps for rubber corks, which can be picked up by one of the pipetting channels with a special adapter (Figure S2b). In a similar fashion, we also designed adapters that are fitted with cotton swabs for the pipetting channels in order to remove stripes of the coated polymer layers (Figure S2a).</p><p id="Par86">A further challenge we faced was the integration and automation of equipment originally designed for regular laboratory use. Common laboratory machines are typically designed for manual operation and are often not suited for the use in automated systems. Apart from transport of samples between and the placement into the equipment, the hardware interfaces and software communication protocols needed special attention. <italic>AMANDA</italic> controls about 150 single devices of 37 different types in <italic>L1</italic>. To interface with that variety of hardware, the remote connections needed to be converted to a common standard. In <italic>AMANDA</italic>’s case, the ethernet network was selected as communication standard, both for scalability as well as the centralized server-based control from a Linux environment.</p><p id="Par87">Since all the integrated devices were selected by their functionality for the process and not on the availability of their documentation, a significant effort has gone into the proper implementation of communication protocols. As a result, a vast library of basic implementations for nearly any connection type is part of the framework that allows very quick integration of new devices at this point. However, a small number of vendors have proven to be rather unwilling to share the specifications of their devices which required the reverse engineering of their protocols and devices. We strongly advocate the use of a common standard in laboratory equipment, one approach has been shown for example with the SiLA standard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p id="Par88">Despite these challenges, the advantages of an automated and integrated system make the effort worthwhile. The complete automation improves the process reproducibility as well as the quality and especially the completeness of the acquired data for each sample. In addition, a generic toolkit like <italic>AMANDA</italic>, which has now proven its capabilities on OPV, can very easily be adapted to tackle questions in other fields of materials science like, e.g., quantum dots, perovskite solar cells, thermoelectrics, catalysts, batteries or fuel cells. The comprehensive, structured collection of data with unique identifiers in machine-readable formats generated by MAPs like <italic>L1</italic> or other <italic>AMANDA</italic> facilities is the foundation for deploying artificial intelligence to solve materials science questions. This enables the efficient (multi-objective-) optimum search in vast high-dimensional spaces of materials composition and process conditions. This approach is likely to significantly accelerate the discovery and commercialization of new functional materials in the future.</p><p id="Par89">A further important aspect for the acceleration of materials science is parallelization in conjunction with connectivity. The <italic>AMANDA</italic> software backbone allows the simultaneous control of multiple hardware research facilities and, respectively, various hardware devices which can be operated either in parallel or be combined into a larger sequence. This makes it possible to create virtually connected cloud laboratories and cross-platform integration of data, providing scalability for addressing complex and important materials science problems, which has never been available before. The flexible, web-based process design and the experiment-as-a-service approach of <italic>AMANDA</italic> provides full process control and data access for scientists, independently of their actual location opening a path to truly distributed research. A specialized facility like <italic>L1</italic> in the <italic>AMANDA</italic> environment could allow researchers, which otherwise would never have access to such research equipment, to test their ideas on a service level, extending an approach that has been commonly used for computational investigations on supercomputers into materials science facilities. As such it provides scalability with regard to the utilization of intellectual potential.</p><p id="Par90">A further property the automation approach shares with computing is scalability of processing resources. Training a skilled operator on complex tasks takes years. However, when an automated facility exists it is possible to simply reproduce the facility in order to double the throughput while still providing exactly the same quality of operation. Apart from that optimization of existing facilities also has a large potential. In our implementation of <italic>L1</italic>, there are still significant capacity increases possible through the implementation of further parallelization in <italic>L1</italic>. While current “process runs” on <italic>L1</italic> typically encompass 6 batches of 6 samples each in a typical workday, which sums up to 36 samples. Since every sample is divided in 6 parts and each part contains an independent solar cell device, this estimates to 216 solar cells. However, this does not reflect the potential throughput of the facility. With a more sophisticated scheduling algorithm for parallel processed batches, <italic>L1</italic> would be able to process 9 batches on a regular workday of 8 h. The batch size can also be increased to 8 samples, that would make it possible to process 72 samples (≙ 432 solar cells) in a single shift on a normal working day (compare Figure S3). In continuous operation, up to 34 batches could be processed in 24 h, which corresponds to 272 samples (≙ 1632 solar cells). All this could already be achieved with minimal hardware changes. In a sequential automated process, it is always the task with the longest cycle time that limits the throughput. In the case of <italic>L1</italic>, the evaporator is the limiting factor at the moment. With a cycle time of 42 min per batch, a maximum of 34 evaporations per day can be achieved. To overcome this bottleneck, multiple batches would need to be evaporated at the same time, giving <italic>L1</italic> the ability to roughly double its throughput to ca. 500 samples with ca. 3000 devices per day. To go beyond this, the setup would need to be reproduced, which is much simpler and faster than the initial development, since from day one it would benefit from all the “knowledge” acquired with the previous setups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par91">Automation and artificial intelligence-enhanced discovery and qualification of new materials play an increasingly important role in materials science. In this publication, we reviewed the development of Materials Acceleration Platforms over the past decade. Using a generalized classification, we compared selected MAPs and examined the degree of automation of the individual stages of material development. We concluded that interconnected, multi-stage MAPs, reinforced with artificial intelligence are the way to the automated laboratory of the future. As one step toward this goal, we presented the <italic>AMANDA</italic> Platform, a framework for autonomous laboratory research, and the hardware facility <italic>L1</italic>, a full-scale Materials Acceleration Platform for generalized and flexible materials research. <italic>AMANDA</italic> together with the hardware implementation <italic>L1</italic> has reached a maturity, where fully automated processing of organic solar cell devices is conducted on a daily basis. The software backbone of <italic>AMANDA</italic> follows the experiment-as-a-service approach that abstracts design of experiment from automated execution and allows researchers to focus on data and evaluation. We discussed the large potential of flexible automation for science and demonstrated how to transfer a complex laboratory process onto a robotic platform. The functionality of <italic>L1</italic> was demonstrated on the hand of automatically manufacturing solar cells with the PM6:Y6 material system, achieving efficiencies for ambient atmosphere processing of up to 13.7% under AM1.5 illumination. The precision of the platform was used to investigate the influence on performance of different parameters that are difficult to access with manual laboratory work. Specifically, the effect of semiconductor concentration in the solution used for spin coating, as well as the effect of the solution volume deposited for spin coating, were investigated. Optimal process parameters could easily be extracted from the results. Furthermore, the reproducibility of this system is demonstrated with repeated production runs of the PM6:Y6 material system, showing an interquartile range of 0.74% in <italic>PCE</italic> for 108 individual cells on 19 substrates which were processed as reference samples in 19 individual processing runs performed over the course of 3 months.</p><p id="Par92"><italic>AMANDA</italic> together with the Materials Acceleration Platform <italic>L1</italic> is a work in progress, yet already now demonstrates the capabilities of such systems. Despite the fact that they are able to perform all the functions to manufacture laboratory-scale solution-based solar cells automatically, new features are still being added, and the production capacity is continuously increased. Recently, a stability screening module was integrated in <italic>L1</italic> which is capable of accelerated aging of up to 64 samples in parallel at 15 suns max. Its integration allows the determination of efficiency potential, processing parameters and stability for a new material in one process. In general, we expect that <italic>AMANDA</italic> will be capable of generating enough devices and data for AI algorithms to understand the underlying model of properties and processing conditions of a new material system within one to two processing days. However, to further speed up this process, we believe that the data for the AI computations must be extended beyond the current experimental loop and include the knowledge from other (previous) experiments as well. By finding similarities in the chemical composition of the material systems, we are looking to bias the prediction model to quicker converge toward optimums.</p><p id="Par93">A further step for <italic>AMANDA</italic> and <italic>L1</italic> will be the completion of the discussed materials development process by including the synthesis stage.

The organic solar cells fabricated for this work were deposited on indium tin oxide covered glass substrates with a sheet resistance of 7–9 Ω/sq. Before usage, the substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min in purified water, acetone and 2-propanol, respectively. For all solar cells, an inverted architecture was used with the first layer comprised of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NP), spin-coated automatically on <italic>L1</italic> with 3000 rpm, in the quasi-static on-the-fly spin coating mode. The solution was purchased from Avantama and was treated prior to usage with an ultrasonic horn for 60 s before filtering with a 0.2 µm PTFE syringe filter. The ZnO-NP layer was post-treated at 200 °C for 5 min. After optical characterization of that first layer, the active layer was deposited. Therefore, a chloroform stock solution was prepared with 99.5 vol% chloroform and 0.5 vol% of 1-chloronaphthalene. PM6 and Y6 purchased from Derthon were diluted in parts of the chloroform stock solution, respectively, forming two additional stock solutions with a solid content of 20 mg/ml each. These three solutions were mixed by the pipetting robot before usage. The ratio of PM6 and Y6 was 1:1.2 for all shown devices, the total solid content was varied between 10 and 20 mg/ml (16 mg/ml for the reference samples). The active layer was spin-coated in dynamic spin coating mode on <italic>L1</italic> at a rotation velocity of 3500 rpm. The used solution amount was varied between 5 µl and 50 µl. The pipette to substrate distance during ink dispensation was fixed to 50 mm. A dispense speed of 500 µl/s was used. The active layer was thermally annealed at 100 °C for 10 min and optically characterized after annealing. Then, the samples were transported to the evaporator. A shadow mask was applied to the substrates leading to an active area of the solar cells of 10.4 mm<sup>2</sup>. The substrates were loaded into the evaporation chamber and molybdenum oxide and silver were evaporated subsequently with a waiting time of 2 min in between the two evaporation processes. The molybdenum oxide was evaporated with a rate of 0.1 Å/s for the first 2 nm, then with 0.2 Å/s until a final film thickness of 10 nm was reached. For silver, an initial rate of 0.5 Å/s was used for the first 10 nm, after that the rate was increased to 3 Å/s until a total film thickness of 100 nm was reached. The solar cell performance was measured automatically in <italic>L1</italic> under an AM1.5 spectrum provided by a Newport LSH-7320 class ABA LED solar simulator and additionally measured by a Wavelabs Sinus-70 class AAA LED solar simulator manually.</p></sec></app><app id="App2" specific-use="web-only"><sec id="Sec18" specific-use="web-only"><title>Appendix 1: Electronic supplementary material</title><p id="Par98">Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1" xlink:title="Appendix 1: Electronic supplementary material"><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10853_2021_6281_MOESM1_ESM.docx" position="anchor"><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Supplementary file1 (DOCX 2542 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></app></app-group><fn-group><fn id="Fn2"><label>2</label><p id="Par10"><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.amanda-platform.com" ext-link-type="uri">www.amanda-platform.com</ext-link></p></fn><fn id="Fn3"><label>3</label><p id="Par12">(poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b0]dithiophene))- co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7- bis(2-ethylhexyl)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c0]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] — chemical structure is given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a</p></fn><fn id="Fn4"><label>4</label><p id="Par13">2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2,"3′’:4’,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile)—chemical structure is given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a</p></fn></fn-group><notes notes-type="Misc"><title>Publisher's Note</title><p>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p></notes></back></article></records><facets><facet name="subject"><facet-value count="1">Characterization and Evaluation of Materials</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Classical Mechanics</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Crystallography and Scattering Methods</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Materials Science</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Materials Science, general</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Polymer Sciences</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Solid Mechanics</facet-value></facet><facet name="keyword"/><facet name="pub"><facet-value count="1">Journal of Materials Science</facet-value></facet><facet name="year"><facet-value count="1">2021</facet-value></facet><facet name="country"><facet-value count="1">Germany</facet-value></facet><facet name="type"><facet-value count="1">Journal</facet-value></facet></facets></response>
