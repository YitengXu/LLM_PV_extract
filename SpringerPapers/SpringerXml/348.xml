The growth kinetics are found to depend strongly on the physicochemical properties of the solvent and zeta potential of the colloidal solution. Furthermore, the resulting nanostructures as a photoanode material, displayed a prominent structure dependent property in determining the efficiency of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The fabricated solar cell with ZnO nanostructures based photoanode exhibited improved conversion efficiency. Moreover, the nanoflower based DSSCs showed a higher conversion efficiency of 4.1% compared to the other structures. The excellent performance of ZnO nanoflower is attributed to its better light-harvesting ability and increased resistance to charge-recombination. Therefore ZnO nanostructures can be a promising alternative for TiO<sub>2</sub> in DSSCs. These findings provide new insight into the simple, low cost and consistent synthetic strategies for ZnO nanostructures and its outstanding performance as a photoanode material in DSSCs.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>6160</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2021_Article_85701.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">A reliable, cost-effective and everlasting renewable energy source like solar energy is the solution for the next generation energy crisis. The current solar energy market is dominated by the silicon-based p–n junction photovoltaic devices because of their maturity, performance and reliability. Since the low-cost investments and fabrication are the key desired features, researchers everywhere are trying to come up with newer and more economical ways of generating energy through solar power<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted much attention in recent years because of their good photovoltaic performance, specifically under diffuse light conditions. Low fabrication cost, semitransparency, flexibility and easiness of assembly are the characteristic features of Dye Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs). These specialities distinguish DSSCs from the commercial silicon based photovoltaic devices. So the active research on each component of DSSC to improve its efficiency and lifetime becomes significant<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Conventional DSSC constitutes four main components photoanode, dye sensitizer, redox electrolyte, and a counter electrode. Here, the wide band gap oxide semiconductor (TiO<sub>2</sub>, ZnO, SnO<sub>2</sub>) based photoanode represents a key component for enhancing the efficiency of DSSCs. There are many reports on the optimization of the nanostructure and selection of photoanode material for the fabrication of DSSCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. The specific role of photoanode is to transmit the photoelectrons generated by the light absorption of dye sensitizers like Ruthenium based N719 and N<sub>3</sub> dyes to the external circuit. The redox couple electrolyte restores the original state of the dye by the passage of photoexcited holes. The Pt coated FTO is a widely used promising counter electrode for collecting the photoexcited electrons from the external circuit and for enhancing the catalysis of the electrolyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.
</p><p id="Par3">The present work is particularly focused on the fabrication of DSSCs which employ ZnO nanostructures based photoanode exploiting its low cost, easy synthesis, large scale production, as well as good thermal and chemical stability. Furthermore, the higher carrier mobility and diffusion coefficients of ZnO nanostructures ensure a better photovoltaic performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. It has been reported that the controlled morphology of photoanode can change the photoconversion efficiency of DSSC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In nanoscience concept of materials, the engineering aspects like dimensional control and design of oriented nanostructures by varying the synthetic strategies are very important<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. All the physical and chemical properties of these nanostructures are altered by the size, shape and surface structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Thus the architecture of nanostructure plays an influential role in the functionality of the material. According to the experimental conclusions, reaction conditions, choice of reactants and medium of reaction can be engineered to diversify the nanostructures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Also, a variety of synthetic approaches including sol–gel synthesis, hydrothermal, co-precipitation, microwave-assisted and laser ablation are proposed for the controlled and synthetic preparation of nanostructures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Still, there are many other dependent factors which are unclear in connection with the precise and controlled growth mechanism of nanostructures.</p><p id="Par4">Among the transition metal oxide, zinc oxide (ZnO) has an appealing great interest due to its potential applications in various optoelectronic fields. Moreover, it exhibits properties like nontoxicity, thermal and chemical stability, wide band gap energy as well as large exciton binding energy (60 meV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. ZnO possess a wide variety of nanostructures including zero, one, two and three-dimensional structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Many synthetic approaches have been tested by researchers for the preparation of oriented structures. Most of the synthetic approaches have limitations like tedious experimental procedures, high-temperature requirement, and time-consuming processes. Since the controllability and reproducibility of the results are not delivered by most of the experimental techniques, researchers are keen to develop simple and reliable experimental procedures for the synthesis of ZnO nanostructures. Herein, a simple, low growth temperature, ultrasonication assisted solution method is set forward as a better method for the fabrication of self organized ZnO nanostructures. In the solution method, solvents are considered as an enchanting part and the interface-solvent interactions control the aggregation kinetics in the growth. Physicochemical properties of the solvents such as viscosity, dipole moment, polarity, dielectric constant, solubility and coordination ability are expected to influence the structural properties of nanomaterials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Lui et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> studied the solvent effect on the spontaneous growth behavior of uncapped Te nanoparticles and suggested a growth mechanism based on the solvent properties. Several studies have been reported based on the solvent assisted morphological tuning of ZnO nanostructures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Chen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> investigated the influence of polar protic solvents on the morphological tuning of ZnO nanostructures and prepared nanodots, nanodisks, mesocrystals, spheres and sheets using same precursors. They proved that solvent property and structure played an important role in the morphological engineering. In 2018, Liang<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> successfully tailored the growth of ZnO meso/nanocrystals through a facile precursor hydrolysis process using water/organic solvent (ethanol and DMF) system as reaction media. In the synthesis process, the volume ratio between organic solvents and water plays an important role in developing diverse shapes enclosed by tunable facets. Recently, Arie Wibowo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> reviewed the progress of ZnO nanostructures in emerging solar cell applications including dye sensitized solar cells, quantum dot sensitized solar cells, organic and inorganic solar cells and hybrid solar cells. The excellent stability, nontoxicity, proper morphological controllability, low production cost, good reproducibility, and high electron mobility of ZnO will boost their potential application in the emerging photovoltaic market. In one of our previous works<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, ZnO nanoparticles morphology was successfully controlled using different alcohols as reaction media by an ultrasonication assisted simple solution method without the use of any surfactants. In that report, the physicochemical properties and alkyl group length of the solvents enabled a nanodot to nanorod morphological tuning. Also, we demonstrated the potential use of synthesized structure in the fabrication of DSSCs. Motivated by this work, well defined ZnO nanostructures were synthesized using four solvents such as ethylene glycol, 1-butanol, acetic acid, and water. An investigation on the subsequent aging process of the nanostructures revealed an interesting solvent effect on the growth kinetics. The physicochemical properties of the solvents are given in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Solvents control the aggregation rate and particle–particle interaction in the reaction kinetics. Solvent properties like dipole strength, coordination capacity, dielectric constant, etc. play important roles in controlling the aggregation rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Here we present a simple synthetic strategy for the preparation of ZnO nanostructures that can be used as the photoanode material in the fabrication of DSSC. The nanostructure dependant enhancement in the internal power conversion efficiency is discussed based on the visible light harvesting capacity and the electron–hole recombination rate.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Fundamental physicochemical properties of used solvents.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Solvents</p></th><th align="left"><p>Formula</p></th><th align="left"><p>Relative polarity</p></th><th align="left"><p>Dielectric constant</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Ethylene glycol</p></td><td align="left"><p>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub></p></td><td align="left"><p>0.790</p></td><td align="left"><p>38</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>1-Butanol</p></td><td align="left"><p>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.586</p></td><td align="left"><p>17.5</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Acetic acid</p></td><td align="left"><p>CH<sub>3</sub>COOH</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.648</p></td><td align="left"><p>6.1</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Water</p></td><td align="left"><p>H<sub>2</sub>O</p></td><td align="left"><p>1</p></td><td align="left"><p>80</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Result and discussion</title><p id="Par5">In order to investigate the formation of ZnO nanostructures, HRTEM and FESEM analysis were carried out.

The morphological properties were identical in the entire series and only a size tuning has been observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref>). In the initial stage, well-dispersed spherical nanoparticles with an average size of 17.2 ± 3.5 nm were formed without heating.

Further, a reduction in ZnO nanodot size was observed with aging time. Particle sizes for the resulting ZnO nanodots were 10.80 ± 5.1 nm, 5.1 ± 0.96 nm and 5.68 ± 0.61 nm corresponding to aging periods of 8 h, 16 h and 24 h, respectively. Unlike the Oswald ripening, we could observe a reduction in the homogenous size distribution of the nanodots with increase in growth time. In the present situation, particle size decreases with an increase in aging, indicating the growth inhibition behavior of the solvent. To verify the solvent inhibitory effect,the morphological aspects of ZnO were examined by varying pH, surfactants, heating time, and temperature of the reaction, which are the major parameters that affect the final product morphology, particle size, number of growth units and nucleation of materials. The evolution of the particle diameter as a function of change in these parameters are shown in the Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S6</xref>. It can be noticed that the particle shapes are not affected drastically by the variation of parameters and only the size change was observed. In an aqueous solution, homogenous growth is pronounced than heterogeneous growth, indicating the dominant growth controlling nature of the solvent. HRTEM of the nanodots in C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> prepared by varying the parameters is shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S7</xref>. The figure indicate that all the particles exhibit a preferential growth along [100] direction of ZnO. The ZnO crystal growth in the plane (100) is less compared to other planes and for ZnO wurtzite structure, (100) nonpolar surface has the lowest surface energy and better stablility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Upon variation of all these growth parameters, the ZnO nanodots were found to prefer the growth in a significantly stable (100) surface. Solvent acts as the capping agent to stabilize the growth surface. The shape of the nanoparticles was not changed by the heating and aging process. So the result indicates that C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> prevents the surface aggregation of ZnO in the growth process and it is a good solvent for synthesizing homogenous ZnO nanodots.</p><p id="Par7">Further, we examined the growth behavior of ZnO with C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O as a solvent. When the ZnO sol was heated, the aggregation of nanoparticles allowed the random growth of crystallites under oriented attachment, causing the formation of nanorods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S8</xref> indicates that heat treatment is not enough to form a well-defined structure. The heat treated sol kept for a period of 24 h resulted in crystalline ZnO nanorods indicating that the aging process strongly affects the crystallinity. A similar growth mechanism was also found to occur for the other two solvents, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH and H<sub>2</sub>O as shown in Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S10</xref>. In both the cases, ZnO aggregates were formed in the initial stage. The heating and subsequent aging process changed the morphology of aggregates giving rise to an ordered structural formation. It was also noticed that in both cases, 24 h aging time is good enough to produce the crystalline structures shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. ZnO nanoplates were formed in CH<sub>3</sub>COOH and nanoflowers were formed when H<sub>2</sub>O was used as the solvent.

In good agreement with the TEM analysis, it reveals the morphological transition from zero dimensional to three dimensional ZnO nanostructures due to the property of the solvents. To investigate the growth orientation and crystalline structures of ZnO, HRTEM and SAED were carried out for each sample. Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S11</xref> represents the HRTEM image of synthesized ZnO nanostructures. The ZnO nanodots have a lattice spacing of ~ 0.30 nm corresponding to the distance between the (100) planes of ZnO crystal lattice. Other ZnO nanostructures such as nanorod, nanoplate and nanoflower, disclose a d spacing of the lattice ~ 0.25 nm which corresponds to the (101) plane. So all the structures except nanodots exhibit preferential growth in [101] direction because of its fastest growth compared to [100] direction. Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) pattern shown in the Supplementary data Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S12</xref>, indicates that all the prepared ZnO nanostructures have hexagonal wurtzite nanocrystallite structure with the space group P6<sub>3</sub>mc<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.

Interestingly, the tuning of the ZnO nanostructure morphology was achieved by using four distinct reaction media. Evidently in the selected solvents, a well-defined nanostructure of ZnO evolved under 24 h of aging. Since the solvent properties significantly affect the growth kinetics and aggregation, a detailed description of the interaction is needed to understand the distinct growth mechanism. The crystal growth in solution mainly includes two stages (1) nucleation process (2) growth process<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. In the nucleation stage, OH<sup>−</sup> ions react with Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in solvents to form Zn(OH)<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> growth unit. ZnO nuclei of a few nanometer sizes are formed by the decomposition of the growth unit. The secondary growth process is more complicated than the primary nucleation process in which primary ZnO nanoparticles will be assembled to form various morphologies. Solvent polarity, dielectric constant, supersaturation of ZnO primary particles in the solvent and solvation degree of NaOH are the major factors that affect the growth mechanism. Other than these parameters, the electrostatic force plays a critical role in the growth of ZnO nuclei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic diagram of (<bold>a</bold>) synthesis procedure (<bold>b</bold>) growth mechanism of ZnO nanostructures in the distinct solvents.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2021_85701_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">The repulsive electrostatic interaction energy is,<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equa_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="Equa_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The coloumbic force being repulsive, hinders the aggregation of nanoparticles leading to a decrease in the growth rate. This interaction energy is directly proportional to the charge value of ZnO nanoparticles and inversely proportional to the dielectric constant of the solvent molecules. In the present experiment, no surfactants were added to the solvents. The charge value of ZnO nanoparticles is derived from the ionization of the solvent molecules, which is closely related to its polarity. So, the distinct ZnO growth behaviour depends directly on the polarity and inversely on the dielectric constant of solvent molecules. The literature suggests that a faster growth rate of the nanostructure is observed in weakly polar solvents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par12">By comparison, it was found that the growth is enhanced according to the dielectric constant in the case of H<sub>2</sub>O and C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O. Both the solvents possess a high dielectric constant (ε) value. Compared to other solvents selected, polarity value is lesser in C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O and one-dimensional nanorod structure was formed. In the case of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a growth inhibition nature was observed. Compared to C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O and CH<sub>3</sub>COOH, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> possess higher polarity leading the inhibitive nature and the formation of nanodot. Among the four selected solvents, H<sub>2</sub>O possess the highest polarity resulting in increased repulsive interaction between solvent and ZnO nanoparticles. At the same time, the dielectric constant of water is sufficient to reduce the repulsive interaction. Thus in water, there is enhanced ZnO growth in the direction [101], forming a nanoflower structure. The acetic acid with smaller dielectric constant and polarity exhibit a faster growth. In order to explain this contradictory process, we measured the zeta potential of the colloidal solution.</p><p id="Par13">According to the literature,the zeta potential is also a key factor that controls the growth mechanism. It also has the nature of a repulsive force that can hinder the growth rate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The measured value of zeta potential for the ZnO nanostructures are found to be − 26 mV, − 7.2 mV, − 4.5 mV and − 2.5 mV for C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH and H<sub>2</sub>O, respectively as shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S14</xref>. The general mechanism is an electric double layer around the colloidal ZnO nanoparticles inhibiting the aggregation/agglomeration rate. As a result, the highest absolute value of zeta potential causes a strong hindering effect in the growth. According to the measured zeta potential values, the particle movement is strongly hindered in C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and enhanced in H<sub>2</sub>O. This inference is in agreement with the observations from the morphological characterization techniques such as TEM and FESEM. For CH<sub>3</sub>COOH, the zeta potential value is found to be lesser compared to that of C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O. Hence in this case, the growth kinetics favours the formation of 2 dimmensional plate like structures. So, polarity, dielectric constant and zeta potential of the colloidal solution are the three parameters that can completely explain the interactions and growth kinetics of the ZnO nanostructures.

There are numerous reports investigating the role of different defect states on visible emission. According to these studies, the deep level defects of zinc vacancies, oxygen vacancies are responsible for blue emission, oxygen vacancies for green emission, oxygen interstitials for yellow emission and zinc interstitials for red emission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.

The measured J<sub>SC</sub> for the four solar cells making use of nanostructures; dot, rod, plate and flower were found to be 6.68, 8.60, 9.80 and 12.32 mA cm<sup>−2</sup>, respectively. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of cells was also found to follow a similar trend as that of J<sub>SC</sub> values. An enhancement in PCE was observed with increment in J<sub>SC</sub> value in the order nanoflower &gt; nanoplate &gt; nanorod &gt; nanodot. Among all, the cell incorporating the nanoflower was found to exhibit the highest current density as well as efficiency. The efficiency of the cell with ZnO nanoflower based photoanode was found to be 4.1%. It induces strong visible photon capturing by enhancing the incident light scattering and weakening the transmittance. The ordered large-sized nanostructures inevitably cause an enhancement in light scattering and a decrease in the charge-transfer resistance. Thus they exhibit a superior photovoltaic performance as compared with that of small grain sized nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S17</xref> shows the reflectance spectra of ZnO nanostructure films wherein the nanoflower film show higher reflectance than the other structures. Generally, higher reflectance indicates a better light scattering ability, which implies a longer light path inside the photoanode thereby offering a better opportunity for the dye molecules to absorb more photons. The random distribution of growth direction of nanoflowers can also significantly improve the light trapping effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Moreover, the surface area plays a vital role in the dye adsorption and light scattering. Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> shows the direct correlation between nanostructure surface area and dye adsorption. The increased surface area enhances the dye adsorption on the photoanode surface and faster dye penetration during the sensitization process, giving rise to an increased efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. An estimation of the adsorbed amount of dye was carried out using the method reported previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup> and the corresponding UV absorbance spectra are shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S18</xref>. The above-discussed factors such as higher scattering ability, larger surface area, and enhanced dye adsorption improve the efficiency of a cell fabricated using ZnO nanoflower. ZnO nanoplate based DSSC displayed second highest efficiency (3.3%) followed by the device based on ZnO nanorod (2.5%) and nanodot dye sensitizied solar cell (2.1%).<fig id="Fig9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of DSSC and (<bold>b</bold>) J–V curves of fabricated DSSCs usingZnO nanostructures as photoanode.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2021_85701_Fig9_HTML.png" id="MO9"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The photovoltaic parameters of DSSCs fabricated using synthesized ZnO nanostructuresas photoanode.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>ZnO nanostructures</p></th><th align="left"><p>V<sub>OC</sub> (V)</p></th><th align="left"><p>J<sub>SC</sub> (mA cm<sup>−2</sup>)</p></th><th align="left"><p>FF</p></th><th align="left"><p>ɳ (%)</p></th><th align="left"><p>Dye adsorption (nmol cm<sup>−2</sup>)</p></th><th align="left"><p>BET surface area (m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>)</p></th><th align="left"><p><inline-formula id="IEq19"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq19_Math"><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq19_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}
