Unique properties of 2D materials have been widely utilized for diverse applications such as catalysis, supercapacitors, energy storage devices, and high-performance sensors. Besides graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and layered oxide materials are also parts of 2D materials family. 2D materials have shown promising properties in the application of electronic devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Semiconductor behavior of 2D materials (e.g., MoS<sub>2</sub>) makes them promising materials for field-effect transistors (FETs). The FET fabricated from 2D materials will not only exhibit improved performance, in terms of fast processing rate and low power consumption, but also allow further reduction in device dimensions which is the need for the fabrication of next-generation electronic devices. In recent years, many efforts have been made to review the research on the synthesis, characterization of single- and few-layered 2D materials including their electronic, magnetic, optical and mechanical properties as well as applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, some reviews focused on the utilization of 2D materials in a variety of applications such as flexible and transparent electronic, optoelectronic devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], energy conversion and storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], hydrogen generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and gas sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It is well known that most 2D layered materials exist in a bulk state. These materials have layered structure and weak interlayer van der Waals force holding these layers together. Layered structure makes it possible to achieve monolayer or a few layers of 2D materials by mechanical exfoliation. On the other hand, in-plane atoms are connected with strong covalent bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Hence, monolayer 2D materials possess two-dimensional features in the lateral x–y direction and quantum confinement in the third dimension, which makes these materials unique from their bulk counterparts. One of the features is high carrier mobility, which is essential for high-speed transistors. For a high-performance transistor, good ohmic contact, higher carrier mobility, and appropriate band gap (~1 eV) are the basic requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Graphene, the most extensively studied 2D material, has exhibited very high carrier mobility (~2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) at the temperature of 5 K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, it is not suitable for logic applications due to its zero band gap, resulting in very small on/off ratio (&lt;10) at ambient temperature. In order to improve its on/off ratio, the opening of band gap has been proposed. However, engineering the band gap up to ~400 meV will lead to a decrease in the mobility to less than 200 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>. Similarly, p-type device, based on the graphene nanoribbons, demonstrates a band gap opening due to the various edge (armchair or zigzag) structures resulting in very high on/off ratio of ~10<sup>6</sup> and extremely low charge carrier mobility of ~100–200 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, as compared to other members of graphene family. However, these devices have shown the subthreshold slope (SS) of ~210 mV per decade, which is not desirable and ideal. It needs to be ~60 mV per decade at room temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In contrast to graphene, TMDCs, such as MoS<sub>2</sub> (1.8 eV), WS<sub>2</sub> (2.1 eV), MoTe<sub>2</sub> (1.1 eV), and WSe<sub>2</sub> (1.7 eV), have desirable band gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. MoS<sub>2</sub> is one of the most promising materials for logic devices such as metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) due to its tunable band gap, high on/off ratio and relatively cheap price. The band gap of monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> has been reported to be 1.8 eV earlier. However, recent work demonstrates it has a direct band gap of 2.5 eV, while its bulk counterpart has an indirect band gap of 1.2 eV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Being a relatively large band gap material, experimentally, MoS<sub>2</sub> only shows low carrier mobility of ~1 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> without high-<italic>k</italic> dielectric gate material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], whereas the mobility can reach ~150 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> at 300 K with HfO<sub>2</sub> as the top-gate layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In addition, theoretical calculation based on density functional theory has indicated that the mobility of MoS<sub>2</sub> can reach 400 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] at room temperature. More recently, another type of 2D material, black phosphorus, has been predicted to have a hole mobility of 10,000–26,000 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and experimentally, a mobility of 1000 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> has been achieved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], showing very promising potential for electronic devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">In this review, we mainly focus on the recent development of the charge carrier mobility in 2D TMDC materials and the challenges for achieving high mobility as well as high current on/off ratio simultaneously, which are essential for 2D TMDC-based electronic devices. We also give an introduction of 2D materials (including TMDCs) and their synthesis using different approaches. Finally, this review describes the possible methodology and future prospective to enhance the charge carrier mobility for electronic devices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>2D Materials</title><p id="Par4">Recent advancements in science and technology have unveiled the new prospects and put the mankind on the foundation of the newly developed field named as nanotechnology. This technology has enabled us to conduct research and work in the domain up to nanometer scale, resulting in the technologies which were never possible earlier. These technologies include cancer therapy based on nanoparticles, nanocomposites and innovative medicine, high-performance nanoelectronics, and highly sensitive sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Evolution of nanotechnology has also introduced the distinguished class of low-dimensional systems such as zero-dimensional (0D, i.e., nanoparticles), one-dimensional (1D, i.e., nanowires), two-dimensional (2D, i.e., graphene), and three-dimensional (3D, i.e., bulk materials). The low-dimensional system plays an important role in classifying the nanomaterials, as the dimension of the material will not only define the atomic structure but also the properties of the nanomaterials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">In 2004, Geim and Novoselov [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] obtained a layered structure by mechanical exfoliation using scotch tape, which is later called graphene. The discovery of graphene has opened a new area of research—2D materials. These materials have shown many excellent properties widely used for energy, sensors, catalysis, electronic devices, spintronic devices as well as biomedical applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The discovery of graphene has triggered the research interest toward other two-dimensional materials, such as silicene, black phosphorus, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), and layered oxide materials. One of the most important features of these 2D materials is the high mobility of the carriers due to their quantum confinement in the third dimension, which is promising for the applications of electronic devices, such as transistors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">As described previously, graphene has exhibited very high carrier mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, it is unsuitable for the applications in transistors since materials used to make transistors have to be able to switch current on and off to create logic circuits. Different from graphene, MoS<sub>2</sub>, one of the TMDCs, has a direct band gap in monolayer structure, which makes it possible to tune the carriers transport in an electronic device, thus realizing the device functions. Among the 2D materials, currently, TMDCs have attracted more and more interest due to their natural abundance and unique/diverse properties. The generalized chemical formula for TMDCs is MX<sub>2</sub>, where M represents the transition metal (typically Ti, Zr, Hf, Mo, W, Nb, Re, V, and Ni) of group 4–10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and X is a chalcogen (S, Te, and Se) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Presently, more than 40 different TMDCs combinations have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and they have shown distinctive properties. In TMDCs, M (transition metal) layer sandwiched between two (02) X (chalcogen) atomic layers. Different atomic arrangements can generate the octahedral (tetragonal, T) and trigonal prismatic (hexagonal, H) structure of the 2D TMDCs. In H-phase TMDC, hexagonal symmetry can be observed from a top view and X-M-X arrangement is considered to be the monolayer, in which each M atom is covalently bonded to the six X atoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], whereas T-phase has a trigonal arrangement of the chalcogen (X) atoms on the top and shows the hexagonal structure of chalcogen atoms from a top view [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Among both, the 2H phase of 2D TMDCs is stable in air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].The stability of mono or few layer TMDC is of the vital importance due to its layer dependent properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The conductivity of 1T MoS<sub>2</sub> phase is 10<sup>7</sup> times better than 2H MoS<sub>2</sub> phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Due to the tunable band gap, quantum confinement and surface effects, monolayer 2D TMDCs (MoS<sub>2</sub>, WS<sub>2</sub>) exhibit strong photoluminescence (PL) and large exciton binding energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Besides the TMDCs, two-dimensional oxides have also been extensively investigated. Two-dimensional oxides include micas and layered oxides, such as MoO<sub>3</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and WO<sub>3</sub> (micas) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], TiO<sub>2</sub>, MnO<sub>2</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, TaO<sub>3</sub>, and RuO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].

Synthesis of MoS<sub>2</sub> 2D nanostructured sheets by CVD on an oxidized silicon substrate is one of the recent developments. Generally, there are two ways for the fabrication of monolayer 2D materials. MoS<sub>2</sub> as an example, first, in a so-called two-step bottom-up technique, a thin layer of metallic Mo is evaporated by an e-beam evaporation system. The Mo layer then reacts with sulfur vapors, generated by heating the elemental sulfur above its melting temperature. This reaction occurs at 750 °C leading to the formation of monolayered MoS<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. This method can yield MoS<sub>2</sub> with a thickness more than three layers. Second, a so-called one-step bottom-up technique is used for the synthesis of the atomically thick MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets. In this approach, pure S and MoO<sub>3</sub> powders are put in a CVD system. The mixture is heated to 650 °C. Then, the atomic layer of MoS<sub>2</sub> will be grown on the Si substrate, which is covered with the rGO (reduced graphene oxide) for MoS<sub>2</sub> layers growth. The rGO acts as a catalyst and the seed to enhance the growth of MoS<sub>2</sub> layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d. By this approach, MoS<sub>2</sub> monolayer with a thickness of 0.72 nm has been obtained. Furthermore, large-area MoS<sub>2</sub> nanostructured sheets can be obtained by dip coating of (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>MoS<sub>4</sub> (ammonium thiomolybdate) dissolved in DMF (dimethylformamide) on silicon or silicon dioxide substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>].

It is well known that graphene is a gapless semiconductor. High symmetry of honeycomb lattice protects the zero gap of single-layer crystal. However, the band gap of bilayer graphene can reach up to 250 meV by the application of a transverse electric field and the band gap is tunable by an electric field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>].

Charge carrier sign of 2D nanostructure materials can be modified by the application of electrical field allowing its utilization in high-mobility p–n junction transistors and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology. Defect-free high-quality crystal up to micron scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>] is the main reason for achieving high charge carrier mobility due to scattering free movement of electrons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. Therefore, 2D materials are very popular in the design of nanoelectronic devices such as field-effect transistors (FET) due to their high charge carrier mobility, high on/off current ratios, and low power consumption. FET composed of pristine graphene exhibits very high electron mobility (200,000 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] but lacks in on/off ratio.

Indirect-to-direct transition of band gap from bulk to the single-layered 2D material is due to the upshift of the indirect band gap induced by strong quantum confinement effect in a single layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

In addition, mechanical strains and electrical field both have significant influences on the band structure of 2D nanostructured materials, which makes them suitable candidates for sensor applications.

However, this miniaturization and fast processing are possible at the cost of high-power consumption. This high-power requirement is due to the short-channel effect which arises in the MOSFET having a dimension less than 50 nm and makes the gate control weaken over the channel current. This results in disability of the gate to completely switch “off” the current through the channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>]. This flow of unwanted leakage current, at the “switch off” state of MOSFET device, gives rise to the high-power consumption and overheating problems. Further miniaturization of MOSFETs has been restricted due to the aforesaid challenges.

The possible reasons for the thickness dependence are coulomb scattering and the Schottky barrier between channel and electrode contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213">213</xref>]. Moreover, in recent work, Hall mobility of ~1000 and ~34,000 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> is reported for single- and six (6)-layered encapsulated MoS<sub>2</sub> devices, respectively, at a temperature below 5 K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">214</xref>]. Just like the channel thickness, measuring or operating temperature has a significant effect on carrier mobility. High temperature (&gt;100 K) enhances the lattice phonon scattering which tends to have an adverse effect on carrier mobility of 2D TMDCs.

In this range, an increase in charge density may have two outcomes. First, high charge density is favorable for increasing carrier mobility by suppressing the interfacial impurity potential. Second, high carrier density tends to increase the carrier energy which may result in reducing carrier mobility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR212">212</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Interfacial Schottky barrier, between the channel semiconductor and metal electrodes, reduces the charge carrier mobility by inducing resistance in carrier transfer. This unwanted effect can be minimized by employing four-terminal measurement method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">220</xref>]. Formation of the Schottky barrier is due to the difference in energy levels between the semiconductor and electrode materials. Schottky barrier height is directly proportional to the energy-level difference of two coupled materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">221</xref>]. Barrier height can be reduced by making contact between <italic>n-</italic>type semiconductor and low work function metals or <italic>p-</italic>type semiconductor and high work function metal. Moreover, the Schottky barrier is tunable by varying the FET gate bias. Initially, this variation was considered to be the switching mechanism of FETs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR222">222</xref>]. Later, the dependence of barrier height on channel thickness was reported. In thicker flakes, the barrier height is much smaller than that of monolayered 2D TMDCs materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR223">223</xref>]. It is due to the influence of band gap of semiconductor channel on the Schottky barrier.

Hence, charge carrier mobility can be improved by optimizing the metal/semiconductor contact. Furthermore, minimum electrode length needs to be identified in order to obtain better charge transferring efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">220</xref>]. Channel length (in appropriately annealed samples), however, does not affect the MoS<sub>2</sub> device performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">220</xref>].

In FETs made of 2D TMDC materials, charged impurities (coulomb) are present at the interface between dielectric and 2D channel. These charged impurities have a scattering potential which induces the scattering in 2D FETs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR226">226</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228">228</xref>]. The source of charged impurities includes chemical residues, adsorbates introduced during device fabrication, and contaminated surface, which results in reduced charge carrier mobility of the 2D TMDC-based FETs.

As the thickness decreases, interaction distance between charge carriers and charged impurities shrinks due to the electrostatic equilibrium.

However, these calculations did not cater for the effects of dielectric mismatch and free-carrier screening. Phonon scattering becomes dominant due to the presence of high-<italic>k</italic> dielectric material and leads to a drastic decrease in electron mobility at room temperature (300 K) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR230">230</xref>]. This phenomenon tends to increase as the thickness of the semiconductor layer is decreased from bulk to monolayer. In TMDC materials like MoS<sub>2</sub>, polar nature of the chemical bonds gives rise to the dipole moments between anions and cations. Perturbation of dipole moment by polar phonons creates an electric field which is coupled with charge carrier, resulting in low charge carrier mobility. This phenomenon is called Frohlich interaction or polar optical phonon scattering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR229">229</xref>].

Vacancy scattering is independent of carrier density and weakly depends on the temperature and channel thickness as these parameters do not have any direct relation with the defect densities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">235</xref>]. Besides vacancy defects, the presence of tilt grain boundaries may also degrade the charge carrier transport efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR236">236</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Electron or charge carrier density (<italic>n</italic>) is also one of the factors affecting the charge carrier mobility. Although electron mobility tends to increase with the increase in electron density, the effect is prominent after the effective screening of phonon scattering. As the dielectric value of <italic>k</italic> increases, electron mobility drastically decreases due to phonon scattering. Electrons presented in atomically thick 2D mono or few layer nanosheets excite the phonons in the nearby dielectric material (which supports polar vibrational modes) at room temperature. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR230">230</xref>] demonstrates the effects of dielectric environment on charge carrier mobility at two different temperatures of 100 and 300 K. In both cases, electron density and charged impurity density are considered equal to 1013 cm<sup>−2</sup>. The solid line represents the combined effects of coulomb and phonon scattering on mobility, whereas the broken line shows the electron mobility while neglecting the effects of phonon scattering, which indicates a trend to achieve large mobility at high-k dielectric environment (<italic>ε</italic><sub>e</sub>).

This path leads to two methodologies pertaining to the improvement of charge carrier mobility by the utilization of existing materials via special design, such as heterostructure technique or experimental study of some new materials, which is possible to have high carrier mobility.</p><p id="Par47">For the first methodology, efforts need to be made to produce the high-quality and defect-free 2D nanostructure which contains a minimum level of charged impurity density. Mechanical exfoliation can produce high-quality TMDCs. However, the difficulty for large-scale synthesis with uniformity and reproducibility of samples are the main limitations of this process. CVD is a method which has the potential of producing the large-scale high-quality 2D TMDCs or graphene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">237</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR238">238</xref>]. In order to obtain the impurity-free high-quality 2D materials, the ultraclean substrate (flushing of the substrate with acetone and isopropanol and subsequently vacuum annealing at high temperature) and highly pure precursors need to be used. In addition, the synthesis parameters such as pressure, temperature, and growth time are needed to be optimized, which are all important to achieve large-scale, high-quality single-crystal 2D materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR237">237</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239">239</xref>]. Proper procedures to avoid contamination during 2D material synthesis are also of importance. For example, the purging of Ar gas with a very high purity is required to eliminate any chance of impurity in the samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">240</xref>]. Thickness and number of layers of 2D material can be controlled by controlling the deposition parameters, such as heating temperature, deposition time, and chamber pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR238">238</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR241">241</xref>]. Furthermore, very recent developments have shown that adding a small amount of O<sub>2</sub> in the Ar carrier gas can also suppress the nucleation and promote the synthesis of MoS<sub>2</sub> with a large area and high quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239">239</xref>]. In addition, device fabrication and encapsulation inside Ar-filled glove box will also help avoid device degradation, possibly due to the presence of chemical species (e.g., O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O) in ambient condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR242">242</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">From the above discussions, charge carrier mobility in 2D materials is primarily dependent on the concentration of the charged impurities and then on the phonon scattering due to the dielectric environment at high temperatures. CVD method has the potential to generate high-quality large-scale single-crystal 2D nanosheets. MoS<sub>2</sub>, graphene, WS<sub>2</sub>, and MoTe<sub>2</sub> high-quality monolayers have been extensively reported using CVD techniques. Recently, it has been observed that assembling different 2D materials into heterostructure may lead to the tuning of electronic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR243">243</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">244</xref>]. A band gap of 0.1 eV of MoS<sub>2</sub> was achieved after a heterostructure composed of MoS<sub>2</sub>, and graphene was formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR243">243</xref>]. Furthermore, heterostructure-based FET composed of MoS<sub>2</sub> (channel), h-BN (top-gate dielectric), and graphene (source, drain and top-gate electrodes) has displayed charge carrier mobility of ~33 cm<sup>2</sup> V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and on/off current ratio of &gt;10<sup>6</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">214</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR245">245</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a). Besides MoS<sub>2</sub>, TMDCs p–n junction (heterostructure) also demonstrates promising results. Heterostructure of TMDCs, n-MoSe<sub>2</sub>/p-WSe<sub>2</sub>, has exhibited the clear rectification with an ideality factor of ~2 at 290 K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR246">246</xref>]. Similarly, p–n junction of p-WSe<sub>2</sub>/n-MoS<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b) has also shown the promising gate tunable rectifying electrical characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR247">247</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR250">250</xref>]. The average conductance slope of 75 mV per decade at room temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR250">250</xref>] and ideality factor of 1.2 were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR251">251</xref>]. However, in recent work, the p–n heterojunction formed by <italic>p-</italic>type single-walled carbon nanotubes and <italic>n-</italic>type monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub> has also revealed the charge transport behavior with a forward/reverse current ratio of larger than 10<sup>4</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR252">252</xref>]. In addition, heterostructure made from InAs (<italic>n</italic> type)/WSe<sub>2</sub> (<italic>p</italic> type) has displayed the even better rectification with a forward/reverse current ratio larger than 10<sup>6</sup> and an ideality factor of ~1.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR253">253</xref>].<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Heterostructure-based <bold>a</bold> FET composed of MoS<sub>2</sub> (channel), h-BN (top-gate dielectric), and graphene (source, drain, and top-gate electrodes).
