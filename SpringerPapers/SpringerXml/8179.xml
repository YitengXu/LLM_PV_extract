However, optimizing the electrochemical performance of graphene-based electrode materials remains challenging because the electrochemically active surface area is smaller than that predicted from the ultrahigh surface area of ideal graphene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

Owing to their multidimensional structure and three-dimensional conductive networks, hierarchical nanostructured carbons possess large, electrochemically active, surface areas with efficient porous channels and high electrical conductivity, which facilitate fast ion diffusion/electron transfer and can enhance the electrochemical performance of a nanostructured electrode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p><p>To date, the strategies for synthesizing these hierarchical nanostructured carbons have generally concentrated upon either assembling graphene with other pre-synthesized carbon materials or a bottom-up approach involving the growth of carbon materials on the surface of graphene. In the assembly approach, pre-synthesized carbon materials are hierarchically embedded in or wrapped with graphene by controlling the chemical interaction between the carbon materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. On the other hand, in the bottom-up approach, carbon materials such as CNTs or mesoporous carbon are grown on the surface of graphene by using chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or soft/hard templates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, these strategies require additional processes for combining graphene with other carbon materials and in some cases, contact resistance may occur at the interface between the different types of carbon material.</p><p>Herein, we report a strategy for the synthesis of a hierarchical graphene-based carbon material, henceforth referred to as spine-like nanostructured carbon, from one-dimensional graphitic carbon nanofibers (CNFs) by controlling the local graphene/graphitic structure <italic>via</italic> a combination of an expanding process and a co-solvent exfoliation method. The resultant spine-like nanostructured carbon has a unique hierarchical structure of partially exfoliated sp<sup>2</sup> graphitic blocks interconnected by ligament-like thin graphene nanoplatelets. Using the aforementioned co-solvent method induces only mild exfoliation conditions that prevent these interconnections from breaking. By virtue of the exposed graphene layers and interconnected sp<sup>2</sup> carbon structure, this hierarchical nanostructured carbon not only possesses a high surface area but also exhibits high electrical conductivity.

The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image of <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> shows the as-prepared P-CNF with a fiber diameter of ~200ânm. In the high-magnification TEM image (inset in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref>), graphene layers are stacked perpendicular to the fiber axis with a distance of ~0.34ânm and their edges are exposed in the radially outward direction of the fiber. Owing to this stacking direction of the graphene layers, the as-prepared P-CNF could be partially exfoliated along the fiber axis. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b</xref> shows the spine-like nanostructured carbon synthesized from as-prepared P-CNF by the expanding process and the co-solvent exfoliation method. The TEM image reveals that spine-like nanostructured carbon is partially exfoliated but maintains a one-dimensional shape on a microscopic scale. Individual spine-like nanostructured carbons can be distinguished owing to their different orientations on the TEM grid. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1c and 1d</xref> present high-magnification TEM images of differently oriented Carbons 1 and 2, respectively. The graphitic blocks of a similar size (~100ânm) in Carbon 1 are individually exfoliated but interconnected by thin graphene nanoplatelets. On the other hand, in Carbon 2, the basal planes of the graphene nanoplatelets are exposed between graphitic blocks (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref> for graphene nanoplatelets at high magnification). Partial exfoliation of the graphitic blocks is also seen by comparing scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of as-prepared P-CNF (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2e</xref>) and spine-like nanostructured carbon (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2f</xref>). To our best knowledge, this spine-like nanostructured carbon, composed of a periodically alternating structure of exfoliated graphitic blocks and graphene nanoplatelets, is the first such carbon nanostructure reported.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TEM images of (a) as-prepared P-CNF (inset shows a high-magnification view of the edge structure) and (b) spine-like nanostructured carbon synthesized according to <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>.

First, graphitic blocks of similar size (~100ânm) are periodically exfoliated along the major axis. Second, the exfoliated graphitic blocks are interconnected by thin graphene nanoplatelets. The formation of this hierarchical structure could be governed by the expanding and exfoliating conditions.</p><p>The structural periodicity (the graphitic blocks with a similar size) in the nanostructured carbon could be induced by adjusting oxidation condition during expanding process. The average number of stacked graphene nanoplatelets for graphene-based carbon materials such as reduced graphene oxide (RGO, multi-layer graphene) has been reported to be highly affected by the degree of oxidation in the starting material (graphite oxide, GO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Yoon <italic>et al</italic>. also demonstrated that the size of the exfoliated graphitic blocks could be controlled by the degree of CNF oxidation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. In their study, as the degree of CNF oxidation increased, the same exfoliation procedure resulted in thinner exfoliated graphitic blocks. Consistent with this view, CNFs could be periodically expanded with graphitic structures of a similar size by adjusting the oxidation treatment (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figure S2</xref> for the optimized expanding condition).</p><p>The conditions during exfoliation may determine the connectivity (interconnected or disconnected) of the graphene nanoplatelets between the graphitic blocks. As noted above, we introduced a co-solvent method to avoid complete exfoliation of the graphene layers and disconnection of the graphitic blocks in the resulting nanostructured carbon. Generally, neutral or basic water and a number of organic solvents (dimethylformamide, N-methyl pyrrolidone and tetrahydrofuran) are used to effectively exfoliate GO (or to de-bundle CNTs) and generate stable dispersions by a sonication or homogenization treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In contrast, these functionalized carbons are hardly exfoliated in methanol, ethanol and acetone during sonication owing to their relatively low solubility in these media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Here, a mixed solvent of water (soluble) and ethanol (insoluble) lowered the dispersion stability of expanded CNF and yielded partially exfoliated graphene layers that interconnected the graphitic blocks. Although exfoliated graphitic carbon materials have been reported in several studies, the investigations have generally focused on uniform exfoliation of the graphitic structure with little attention to controlling the local graphene/graphitic structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. In particular, no attempts have been made yet to control the local nanostructure during exfoliation using a mixture of soluble and insoluble solvents for a functionalized carbon dispersion.</p><p><xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows the exfoliation sequence of the graphitic blocks in CNFs during synthesis. Compared with the as-prepared P-CNF (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref>), the expanded P-CNF prepared by oxidation treatment (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3b</xref>) shows a graphitic structure that is partially widened along the direction of the fiber axis. This effect may be attributed to the weak van der Waals force between the graphene layers due to the oxygen-containing functional groups formed during oxidation treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref> shows partially exfoliated graphitic blocks in the spine-like nanostructured carbon prepared from expanded P-CNF by using the co-solvent exfoliation method; the exfoliated graphitic blocks are interconnected by graphene nanoplatelets (shown in the schematic on the bottom left). To investigate the degree of exfoliation and connectivity of the graphene nanoplatelets between the graphitic blocks in the nanostructured carbon, relatively harsh exfoliation conditions were introduced by using water as the soluble solvent for expanded P-CNF. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3d</xref> shows that the graphitic blocks in the CNF are fully exfoliated by sonication in water; disconnected graphene layers are seen between the separated graphitic blocks. This result suggests that the co-solvent exfoliation method is useful for synthesizing spine-like nanostructured carbon. A graphitic block fully separated by harsh exfoliation treatment is shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3e</xref>.

This result indicates the presence of exposed graphene layers between the graphitic blocks, layers that could highly increase the specific surface area of spine-like nanostructured carbon. The geometrically calculated surface areas are consistent with the possibility that the exposed graphene layers can increase the specific surface area in the resulting nanostructured carbon (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Figure S6</xref>).

First, graphitic blocks of similar size (~100ânm) are periodically exfoliated along the major axis. Second, the exfoliated graphitic blocks are interconnected by thin graphene nanoplatelets in the manner of ligaments. Owing to these structural characteristics, the spine-like nanostructured carbon has a significantly higher specific surface area of 428âm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>â1</sup> than that of as-prepared P-CNF (64âm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>â1</sup>) and mostly maintains its initial surface area after undergoing processes similar to real electrode fabrication. Additionally, the nanostructure maintains high electrical conductivity (388âS m<sup>â1</sup>) owing to the graphene nanoplatelet interconnections between graphitic blocks. The resultant spine-like nanostructured carbon exhibits significantly improved electrochemical performance in terms of specific capacitance (272âF g<sup>â1</sup> at 10âmV s<sup>â1</sup> in a three-electrode cell test and 238.8âF g<sup>â1</sup> at 2.5âA/g in a two-electrode cell test) and rate capability (230âF g<sup>â1</sup> at 200âmV s<sup>â1</sup>, above 85% of the initial value at 10âmV s<sup>â1</sup>).</p><p>The improved electrochemical performance of the spine-like nanostructured carbon can be explained as follows. In this nanostructured carbon, the partially exfoliated graphene nanoplatelets that are exposed to the electrode/electrolyte interface improve the double-layer capacitance of the electrode by increasing the electrochemically active surface area. Additionally, the partially residual, oxygen-containing functional groups on the exfoliated graphene layers undergo pseudocapacitive redox reactions and enhance the capacitance of the nanostructured carbon electrode. Furthermore, the graphitic blocks interconnected by graphene nanoplatelets in the carbon structure maintain the high electrical conductivity of spine-like nanostructured carbon, which likely supports the good rate capability of the electrode. Consequently, owing to the unique hierarchical structure of partially exfoliated sp2 graphitic blocks interconnected by graphene nanoplatelets, the spine-like nanostructured carbon electrode exhibits improved electrochemical performance in terms of capacitance and rate capability.
