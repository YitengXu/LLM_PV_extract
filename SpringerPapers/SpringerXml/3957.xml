Herein, a nanocomposite NiO NPs@AuNPs@Van (NAV) for selective MRSA removal was constructed by electrostatic self-assembly of highly photothermal magnetic NiO NPs and vancomycin (Van)-modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). In the presence of MRSA and under NIR irradiation, Van-mediated AuNPs can self-aggregate on MRSA surface, generating photothermal effect in situ and killing 99.6% MRSA in conjunction with magnetic NiO NPs. Additionally, the photothermal efficiency can be improved by magnetic enrichment due to the excellent magnetism of NAV, thereby enhancing the bactericidal effect at a lower experimental dose. In vitro antibacterial experiments and full-thickness skin wound healing test demonstrated that this combination therapy could effectively accelerate wound healing in MRSA-infected mice, increase collagen coverage, reduce IL-6 and TNF-α content, and upregulate VEGF expression. Biological safety experiments confirmed that NAV has good biocompatibility in vivo and in vitro. Overall, this work reveals a new type of nanocomposite with enhanced photothermal antibacterial activity as a potential nano-antibacterial agent for treating bacteria-infected wounds.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Self-aggregating AuNPs</kwd><kwd>Photothermal therapy</kwd><kwd>NiO NPs</kwd><kwd>Magnetic enrichment</kwd><kwd>Infected wound healing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">31902304</award-id><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">31972167</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>the Open Project Program of State Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Tianjin University of Science &amp; Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">SKLFNS-KF-202114</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>the Key Laboratory of Agro-Products Processing，Key Laboratory of Agro-products Quality and Safety Control in Storage and Transport Process, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">S2021KFKT-20</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>the Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, 300457, P.

Antibiotics are drugs currently used clinically to fight bacterial infections. However, traditional antibiotics are becoming less effective due to the emergence of drug-resistant (DR) or multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacterial strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) is the most typical drug-resistant pathogen, which can be transmitted between humans and animals, posing a serious threat to human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. MRSA can attack many organs and tissues and cause various diseases such as endocarditis, chronic osteomyelitis, pneumonia and bacteremia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. MRSA can resist the effects of many common antibiotics through a variety of drug resistance mechanisms, such as thickening of cell wall, increase of cell membrane efflux pumps, mutation of cytoplasmic drug target, drug modifications and change of bacterial colonization status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In view of the more complex problem of the treatment of DR or MDR bacterial strains, the development of new approaches based on new treatment regimens with lower induction of drug resistance is becoming more and more urgent.</p><p id="Par31">Thanks to the rapid development of nanotechnology, various nanomaterial-based antibacterial materials and strategies have been proposed, including chemotherapy, photocatalytic therapy, antibacterial peptides, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy (PTT) and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Among them, near infrared (NIR) laser-triggered PTT is considered as an effective alternative to traditional antibacterial strategies because of its advantages of simplicity, deep tissue permeability, minimal invasiveness, low light damage, easy positioning, and non-drug resistance, particularly in treating infected wounds. Photothermal wound dressings usually contain NIR absorbers and kill microorganisms by denaturing bacterial proteins/enzymes, inhibiting their basic intracellular reactions, and inducing irreversible bacterial ablation through the conversion of light energy into heat to increase local temperature (&gt; 50 °C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">Recent studies have shown that there are four types of common photothermal materials: noble metal nanomaterials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], carbon-based nanomaterials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], organic compound materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and metallic/non-metallic compound nanomaterials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Carbon based nanomaterials mainly refer to graphene oxide and carbon nanotubes, which are characterized by good thermal stability and high drug loading capacity, making them a good carrier for photothermal therapy and chemotherapy. However, the preparation of such materials is relatively difficult, and the light absorption coefficient is low in the near-infrared region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Organic compound nanomaterials include small molecular dyes (such as indocyanine green, prussian blue and thiadiazole derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]) and supramolecular complexes (such as porphyrin rings, conjugated polymers, polyaniline, polypyrrole and polythiophene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]). The significant advantage of this type of material is its high biocompatibility, but it is less stable under light and easy to photodegrade. Metal and non-metal compound nanomaterials are metal sulfides, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and copper sulfide (CuS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Metal sulfides have been used to inhibit bacteria, but the preparation process of most materials is complex and difficult for large-scale production.</p><p id="Par33">Noble metal photothermal nanomaterials, such as gold, silver, platinum, etc., can absorb light energy of specific wavelengths and generate oscillating free electrons on the surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Among them, Au nanoparticles have become a promising photothermal agent due to their good light stability, low toxicity, and easy surface modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Moreover, the shape of Au nanoparticles can be adjusted for strong NIR absorption, which can finally be transferred to the surrounding environment in the form of heat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. For instance, Han et al. reported a functional Au nanostar as a photothermal agent for clearing bacterial infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Youn et al. successfully developed the rabies virus glycoprotein (RVG) peptide-PEG-capped silica-gold nanorods (RVG-PEG-AuNRs@SiO<sub>2</sub>), which can respond to NIR laser irradiation to induce hyperthermia and effectively inhibit brain tumors in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. You et al. proposed a specific photothermal ablation therapy based on TNYL peptide conjugated hollow gold nanospheres (TNYL-HAuNS), which can significantly inhibit the growth of endometriosis and induce ectopic endometrial atrophy and degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Richter et al. reported a scaffold composed of electrospun Jellyfish-based nanofibers and decorated with Au–Ag bimetallic nanoparticles, which was demonstrated to be able to disrupt and eliminate the regeneration of mature biofilm colonies successfully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Nevertheless, single-mode PTT usually has the disadvantage of prolonged exposure to high-power-density NIR lasers, which may lead to inflammation and thermal damage of nearby healthy tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Additionally, the non-specific dispersion of plasma-absorbing nanomaterials on the bacterial surface cannot ensure the complete transfer of the hyperthermia converted from the absorbed light energy to the bacteria under NIR laser irradiation. Therefore, it is imperative to design a treatment model for accurate attack on bacteria-infected tissues without damaging adjacent normal tissues.</p><p id="Par34">Inspired by this idea and based on aforementioned reports, we proposed an accumulation strategy using MRSA as a template for selective removal of bacterial infections while protecting adjacent normal tissues. The targeted accumulation of nanomaterials on MRSA was achieved by modifying spherical Au nanoparticles with Van (AuNPs@Van), which was bonded to D-Ala-D-Ala part of the Gram-positive bacterial cell wall and anchored on the bacterial surface. AuNPs@Van was expected to accumulate on the MRSA surface and reach a concentration to activate the plasma coupling effect between particles (Scheme <xref rid="Sch1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). Subsequently, the AuNPs and magnetic NiO NPs were electrostatically self-assembled to form NAV nanocomposites. Nickel oxide nanoparticles possess good chemical stability and magnetism, and they were reported to have the ability to capture and bind bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, no study has been performed on their photothermal conversion ability and magnetic enrichment performance in biomedicine. A large number of studies have pointed out that PTT-assisted multi-modal collaborative treatment is the most effective strategy to solve single-mode defects due to the combination of different advantages in a single-mode method, which can shorten the NIR time and improve the antibacterial efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].<fig id="Sch1"><label>Scheme 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>A</bold> Schematic diagram for NAV preparation; NAV can preferentially accumulate on MRSA surface under Van mediation. <bold>B</bold> In situ photothermal and magnetic enrichment of bacteria-infected tissues stimulated by NIR irradiation and its application in eliminating bacteria in vivo</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12951_2022_1535_Sch1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par35">In this study, NiO NPs were discovered to have excellent photothermal properties. The introduction of NiO NPs into the nanocomposite system we prepared could greatly shorten the irradiation time and improve the efficiency of photothermal sterilization. Meanwhile, under the action of an external magnetic field, the photothermal efficiency was further improved through magnetic enrichment, and a remarkable sterilization effect could be achieved at a lower experimental dose, thereby improving biological safety. Overall, the hyperthermia of NAV was triggered in situ in the infected tissue under Van mediation and NIR irradiation, thereby achieving selective and effective bacterial removal (Scheme <xref rid="Sch1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials and reagents</title><p id="Par36">The materials used in this study included diethylene glycol (DEG, ≥ 99.0%) from Sigma-Aldrich Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China); nickel (II) chloride (NiCl<sub>2</sub>, ≥ 99.0%) from Macklin Reagent Co.

Subsequently, the obtained NaOH/DEG was quickly injected into the above round bottom flask, and the color of the system was seen to change from green to black. After 2 h of reaction, the mixture was naturally cooled to room temperature to obtain NiO NPs. After two washes with ethanol and three washes with deionized water, the NiO NPs were stored in absolute ethanol for further use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Synthesis of AuNPs@Van nanoparticles</title><p id="Par38">The synthesis of AuNPs@Van NPs followed two steps.

After cooling to room temperature, the AuNPs were stored at 4 °C for later use.</p><p id="Par39">In the second step, 10 mg of Van was dissolved in 1.0 mL of deionized water, followed by adding EDC (50 μL, 50 mg/mL) and NHS (50 μL, 25 mg/mL) for 1 h of stirring reaction to activate Van.

In Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S4B and 4C, the magnetic adsorption inhibition rates on MRSA were shown to be 43.2% and 41.4% for NiO NPs and NAV, respectively.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>A, the morphology of MRSA was intact, with a smooth surface and a regular shape in the PBS group (either PBS-NIR<sub>(–)</sub> or PBS-NIR<sub>(+)</sub>). Meanwhile, incubation of MRSA with NAV (NAV-NIR<sub>(−)</sub>) was shown to rupture the cell membranes of some bacteria, leading to membrane content leakage, but some bacteria still had good cell structure, suggesting the limited bactericidality of NAV. In contrast, the NAV-NIR<sub>(+)</sub> treatment showed severe damage in the cell wall and membrane, leading to more obvious content leakage, implying stronger photothermal effect of NAV on MRSA cells under NIR irradiation. The destruction of cell membranes is usually considered a significant mark of disinfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Additionally, we investigated the effects of AuNPs@Van, NiO NPs and NAV on the morphology of MRSA through TEM (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S5). MRSA maintained a complete shape and a regular smooth surface in the control group (PBS-NIR<sub>(−)</sub> and PBS-NIR<sub>(+)</sub>), and incubation with AuNPs@Van or NiO NPs without NIR irradiation only made the cell membrane surface slightly twisted and wrinkled, demonstrating that AuNPs@Van or NiO NPs alone had little effect on the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane. In contrast, the AuNPs@Van-NIR<sub>(+)</sub> and NiO NPs-NIR<sub>(+)</sub> groups exhibited obvious cell deformation and content leakage, indicating that the photothermal effect strengthened the damage to bacteria. Compared with AuNPs@Van or NiO NPs treatment, exposure to NAV without NIR (NAV-NIR<sub>(–)</sub>) made the bacterial surface coarser and wrinkled, while exposure to NAV plus NIR (NAV-NIR<sub>(+)</sub>) caused the bacteria to completely lose their cell integrity, implying stronger antibacterial ability of the synergistic strategy.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>A</bold> Typical SEM images of MRSA treated with PBS (PBS-NIR<sub>(−)</sub> and PBS-NIR<sub>(+)</sub>) and NAV (NAV-NIR<sub>(−)</sub> and NAV-NIR<sub>(+)</sub>). <bold>B</bold> Intracellular ROS level of MRSA induced by NAV in the presence and absence of NIR laser irradiation. <bold>C</bold> Protein leakage of NAV-treated MRSA with or without NIR laser irradiation. <bold>D</bold> DNA leakage of NAV-treated MRSA with or without NIR laser irradiation. <bold>E</bold> The ATPase activity of MRSA after exposure to NAV with or without NIR laser irradiation.

Besides, the ATPase activity showed a 1.9-fold reduction in the NAV-NIR<sub>(+)</sub> group relative to the PBS-NIR<sub>(+)</sub> group (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>E). These results suggested that NIR-assisted NAV treatment could disrupt bacterial membranes, leading to the release of bacterial contents and ultimately the death of bacteria.</p><p id="Par66">Moreover, the intracellular ROS level was also investigated, and disrupting the bacterial wall and cell membrane was not the only cause for bacterial death. As depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>B, the intracellular ROS increased significantly after incubation with 125 μg/mL NAV, and the green fluorescence signal further increased after treatment of NAV plus 808 nm NIR laser, implying that NAV-NIR<sub>(+)</sub> treatment could stimulate in situ ROS production in MRSA. This observation was consistent with the aforementioned agar plate and MIC results. Based on the above results and discussion, the antibacterial mechanism of NAV against MRSA is visually demonstrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>F. Endogenously generated ROS plays an important role in signal transduction. Specifically, when the generated ROS exceeds the cell clearance capacity, a chain reaction will be triggered: ROS will oxidize the intracellular proteins through the bacterial cell wall and destroy the bacterial homeostasis, and the hyperthermia generated by NAV under 808 nm laser irradiation will reduce the protein activity and ATPase activity, making joint contributions to bacterial death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>In vivo antibacterial activity of NAV and skin wound healing</title><p id="Par67">Inspired by the excellent antibacterial efficacy of NAV in vitro experiments, we further investigated the application prospects of NAV in animal wound disinfection and tissue healing. Before treatment, whether NAV is safe was tested by injecting NAV (200 μL, 125 μg/mL) into mice and assessing its acute toxicity. The results of serum biochemistry tests showed no statistically significant difference in the values of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S6A), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S6B), albumin (ALB) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S6C) and Creatinine (Cr) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S6D) in the control and NAV treatment groups, indicating no apparent toxicity of NAV at a given dose. Additionally, H&amp;E staining showed no statistically significant differences in the internal organs of the mice (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Fig. S6E). The above results indicated that NAV (200 μL, 125 μg/mL) can be safely used in animal experiments under our experimental conditions.</p><p id="Par68">Then the BALB/c mice infected with MRSA were used as a full-thickness skin defect repair model (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A). The infected mice were randomly divided into 4 groups: (I (PBS-NIR<sub>(-)</sub>), (II (PBS-NIR<sub>(+)</sub>), (III (NAV-NIR<sub>(−)</sub>), and (IV (NAV-NIR<sub>(+)</sub>). In Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>F, the temperature of the mouse wound area was seen to increase to 55.3 °C in the NAV-NIR<sub>(+)</sub> group after 1 min of irradiation, intuitively proving that NAV can be used as a photothermal antibacterial agent. Meanwhile, no significant temperature changes were detected in the PBS-NIR<sub>(+)</sub> group. This result was consistent with the in vitro photothermal experiment. A possible explanation for the temperature changes is that the surface plasmon resonance effect activated the aggregation of AuNPs mediated by Van and NiO NPs synergistically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. In this study, the photographs of the mice infected parts were taken on day 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 of treatment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B). On day 0, redness and swelling could be seen in the infected area of all groups. With the passage of treatment time, the scars of all groups gradually darkened in color and gradually reduced in size, demonstrating that the epidermal bacterial infection was suppressed and the wounds were gradually healed. The NAV-NIR<sub>(−)</sub> and NAV-NIR<sub>(+)</sub> groups showed significantly better scar rates than the other two groups. After 9 days of treatment, the wound in the NAV-NIR<sub>(−)</sub> group had scabs and became significantly smaller, but the infected site was still swollen, indicating that NAV has a certain antibacterial ability, but it is not enough to cure MRSA skin infections. In contrast, the scabs in the NAV-NIR<sub>(+)</sub> group were healed and fell off, with the wounds being basically healed, further proving that the antibacterial ability of NAV was enhanced under NIR irradiation. The antibacterial performance of each treatment group was further quantified by monitoring the number of colonies formed at the infected site during the treatment. In Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C, no obvious difference could be presented in the number of colonies between PBS-NIR<sub>(−)</sub> and PBS-NIR<sub>(+)</sub> groups, indicating that NIR does not affect the bacterial growth.

Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are usually used as important indicators in mouse skin defect models to evaluate the effect of a dressing on wound healing. IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is closely related to the degree of inflammation in the early stage of wound healing (day 3 and 7). VEGF, an important angiogenic factor, can reflect the angiogenesis in the late stage of wound healing (day 7 and 9).

The antibacterial mechanisms of NAV can be summarized as follows: (1) in the presence of MRSA and under near-infrared light irradiation, Van-mediated spherical AuNPs self-aggregated on the surface of MRSA will activate plasmon resonance between particles to generate heat; (2) NiO NPs, an outstanding NIR-assisted photothermal agent, can enhance the photothermal effect synergistically with aggregated AuNPs; (3) the excellent magnetic properties of NAV can further enhance the photothermal effect through magnetic enrichment, facilitating targeted killing of MRSA at a lower dose. Therefore, the hyperthermia caused the damage and deformation of cell membrane and the leakage of contents, leading to the ultimate death of bacteria. In vitro and in vivo test results indicated that the NAV had prominent bactericidal properties and excellent biosafety and could promote wound healing. Considering these advantages, NAV may provide a novel perspective for treating both medical device-associated and wound infections.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Ting Du: Investigation, Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Data curation, Writing–original draft, Project administration, Funding acqusition.
