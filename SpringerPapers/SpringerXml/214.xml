sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Green hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) generated via renewables-driven electrolysis is increasingly emerging as a key driver for deep-rooted decarbonization, especially in energy-intensive and hard-to-abate sectors where direct electrification is challenging e.g., the chemical industry (e.g. methanol, ammonia production etc.) and generation of synthetic fuels for use in aviation or shipping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, for green hydrogen to become a scalable and viable energy carrier or chemical feedstock (for both export and domestic utilization) there is the need to achieve economic parity with the more established fossil-fuel-based hydrogen production pathways (i.e. Steam Methane Reforming-SMR and Coal Gasification), and the energy sector more generally. Key opportunities for cost reductions include decreasing renewable electricity pricing and electrolyzer costs, optimizing financing costs (linked to technology and market risks), finding the right market fit (i.e. end use and location for best resources to assist hydrogen generation) as well as optimizing overall system configurations including capacity utilization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Currently renewable energy generation costs, particularly of wind and solar, continue to fall with technical progress and achievement of economies of scale, leading them to already becoming the lowest cost sources of new electricity provision in many locations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Similarly, electrolyzers despite still being in their earlier stages of commerical deployment, are also undergoing a rapid cost reduction with technology development and manufacturing scale-up, with further reductions expected as the green hydrogen sector grows<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Combined both these factors are expected to drastically reduce the cost of generating green H<sub>2</sub>, and some predictions have it reaching the same costs as fossil fuel-sourced H<sub>2</sub> by as early as 2030, especially in regions with abundant high-quality renewables and favourable financing environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In the meantime, generally, while the cost of technology remain high, any viable investment into renewables-driven green hydrogen production will require supportive policies, premium pricing and, also, the most efficient utilization of low-cost renewables and what are still capital-intensive electrolyzers.</p><p id="Par4">One key challenge for an efficient and direct integration of electrolyzer and low-cost renewable power generation through solar PV and wind, is their highly variable and somewhat unpredictable nature which restricts the electrolyzer operation to follow the local wind and/or solar power generation patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Enforcing an economic penalty associated with leaving these capital-intensive electrolyzers sitting idle or operating at limited power for large portions of the year when renewable energy resources are scarce, resulting in lower capacity factors, limited capital efficiency and higher Levelized Costs of Hydrogen (LC<sub>H2</sub>). In addition to the economic advantage, high-capacity factor operation of the electrolyzers is also important for the utilization of H<sub>2</sub>, especially for conversion into ammonia or methanol etc. as these conversion processes are currently designed for fairly steady state operation and thus require a stable supply of H<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Integrating them with highly variable electrolyzer operation would then require the inclusion of high volumes of intermediate H<sub>2</sub> storage, which is generally costly to build and suffers from safety concerns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Therefore, the optimization of electrolyzer capacity factors is a key research and industry challenge for improving green hydrogen economics.</p><p id="Par5">Yet, the advantages of high electrolyzer capacity factor operation must, however, be weighed against the costs of the renewable generation it draws up. This aspect becomes more prominent and critical when considering actual project design as several configurations of electrolyzer and powerplants can be realized each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Several studies have explored the use of local and wind profiles to simulate H<sub>2</sub> generation and optimise the capacity factor of the powerplants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, which suggest oversizing the solar/wind powerplants to the capacity of the electrolyzer, inclusion of hybrid designs with combined solar and wind powerplants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, intermediate storage through Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> or Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) to achieve higher capacity factor operations. However, these studies reveal a trade-off between the high upfront capital investment required to develop these configurations and the ultimate benefit of the increased capacity factor. Therefore, currently, developing stand-alone projects is the most prominent industrial strategy as it allows the electrolyzer to be integrated to dedicated solar/wind farms in regions of excellent wind and/or solar resources (specially sized for optimized capacity factors), water availability, low-cost natural hydrogen storage (e.g. salt caverns) and high land availability, as well as other relevant infrastructure including ports for export, natural gas pipelines for hydrogen injection or local hydrogen demand, e.g., for ammonia generation or decarbonization of local industries (e.g. clean electricity generation, for mobility (fuel cell vehicles) and green steel making etc.).</p><p id="Par6">Alternatively, complex project designs involve isolated systems with fully dispatchable generation, where low cost but variable renewable power is supplemented with multiple energy sources or generally high cost yet more reliable power sources (particularly from fossil fuels) to achieve higher capacity factors while trading-off electricity costs to avoid high LC<sub>H2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. One such strategy involves contracting electrolyzers with one or more renewable projects through Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), while such contracts vary markedly by jurisdiction and involve complexities around regional pricing differences, they typically provide a measure of electricity price assurance if electrolyzer operation is matched to the aggregated contracted renewable generation. Therefore, electrolyzers can operate through time-matched consumption with available renewable generation contacted through PPAs and thus represent the ‘best case’ assured green electricity supply at low cost. Our previous work has studied this in detail and shows that an efficiently volumed electricity supply through a renewable PPA can lead to very high-capacity factors at lower LC<sub>H2</sub>s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Moreover, there is no obligation that the contracted PPA capacity matches the electrolyzer capacity, thus if their supply exceeds the electrolyzer rating at times and the excess electricity can be sold on to the grid for additional income<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, or potentially stored e.g., via onsite battery storage to further enhance their capacity factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, or to operate downstream systems (compressors, etc.). Alternatively, such PPAs can be negotiated to use excess otherwise curtailed renewable generation through the grid, effectively offering zero cost energy supply, but this could still lead to low capacity factors as curtailed energy volumes are also variable and time restricted<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Therefore a fossil fuel-complemented grid connection could be preferred as it would permit electrolyzer operation to leverage a stable energy supply above the varying level of contracted renewables. While this would increase electrolyzer operational capacity factor, additional costs of grid connection along with potential issues of network constraints and risk of variable spot pricing as well as environmental concerns of relying on fossil-fuel generation (associated emissions with green H<sub>2</sub>) would have to be considered.</p><p id="Par7">Collectively, these prior studies provide valuable strategies to improve capital utilization and reduce the costs of renewable-driven electrolysis. However, the applicability of these strategies is highly context specific due to varying local renewable energy potential, available resources (especially water), and infrastructure (end users and transmission/transport networks). Moreover, in practice as suggested above, there is a wide set of options available to project proponents for integrating renewable supply with an electrolyzer through possible mixes of renewable generation (i.e., battery storage (BESS) inclusion, grid connection or a hybrid combination of solar and wind) and oversizing these with respect to electrolyzer capacity. Thus, there is a clear need for an overarching framework, which provides a systematic approach to evaluate underlying factors that affect the suitability of a given location for developing green electrolyzer projects, and the range of configuration options available. To the best of our knowledge a number of tools including the H2A analysis tools developed by the US Department of Energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, the AusH2/Hydrogen Economic Fairways Tool (HEFT) developed by the Australian Government<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, the Global H<sub>2</sub> Cost Tool developed by the University of Cologne<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and others<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, are available that intend to assist developers in assessing potential H<sub>2</sub> generation projects. Each with its own functions and competencies, but a critical overview reveals that these have widely differing scopes, open-source capabilities, and underlying assumptions (refer to Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">1</xref>), which leads to inconsistencies for their application.</p><p id="Par8">To address these limitations, we propose a framework that builds upon the existing strategies and tools, implemented via integrated open-source tools that has been designed for a comprehensive spatial and temporal technoeconomic analysis of renewable-powered electrolysis opportunities. The framework has the following competencies: (i) zoning filters that provide guidance for selecting potential project sites, (ii) a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) for a comparative and competitive analysis of each sites to shortlist the sites based on their suitability to host H<sub>2</sub> generation hub, (iii) an open source cost tool that assesses project economic viability by (iv) modelling local H<sub>2</sub> generation potential (over various time resolutions) based on the solar and wind traces in any given location over a year or more, (v) allowing the user to explore a wide variety of renewables—electrolyzer configurations (standalone or grid connected, either solar or wind powered or hybrid combinations with different levels of oversizing and with optional inclusion of BESS storage), while (vi) providing complete control to the user to define/explore various costs (including capital cost of equipment and installation/land, influence of economies of scale, etc. and operating parameters including electrolyzer load ranges, efficiency variations vs load, degradation, etc.), as well as (vii) a python code based algorithm that evaluates benchmark value capacity mixes and cost parameters needed to achieve low LC<sub>H2</sub> or high capacity factor operation. In this manner, our framework is designed to provide a user an integrated ‘first pass’ for a convenient and comprehensive assessment of different renewable-powered H<sub>2</sub> generation opportunities.</p><p id="Par9">Herein, we apply the framework to Australia, which is one of the world’s fastest-growing renewable energy markets and a key early player in green H<sub>2</sub> progress. A potential that is already globally acknowledged<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and certainly recognized by the Australian Government, which has set a stretch target to bring the cost of generating hydrogen below A$2 kg<sup>−1</sup> (US$1.4 kg<sup>−1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and is actively advancing policy, building trade relations and providing, and attracting investment into green H<sub>2</sub> projects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. These projects are intended to serve the emerging hydrogen markets in the Asia Pacific region and beyond, especially Germany, Japan and Korea which are exploring opportunities to import Australian-generated H<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Given this, achieving economic viability for green hydrogen projects in Australia could play a key role in the development of a global H<sub>2</sub> supply chain. Therefore, Australia provides an ideal case study to demonstrate our framework, as we compare 41 potential hydrogen production sites across Australia, evaluate their costs and benchmark them against the Australian target of A$2 kg<sup>−1</sup> (US$1.4 kg<sup>−1</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Model framework</title><p id="Par10">The open-source framework proposed herein to evaluate green H<sub>2</sub> production costs is represented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

In the next sections we apply the framework to Australia as a case study, where the zoning filters are used to determine 41 potential locations for green H<sub>2</sub> hubs, and the MCA is then applied to provide an outlook of each locations’s suitability to host a H<sub>2</sub> project/hub. Afterwards, the excel tool is applied to assess the local solar/wind profiles to determine hydrogen generation potential and assess the costs of a wide range of potential renewable electrolyzer configurations by adopting the current state-of-the-art costs and performance parameters from literature, engagements with technology providers and future predictions. A sensitivity analysis is then conducted to establish key drivers of costs and determine potential for future costs reduction.

As an initial part of our framework, we consider each of the above as a category of zoning filters that act as a guideline to shortlist potential locations, and these are detailed below:</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Water availability</title><p id="Par17">A sustainable and scalable water supply is an essential input to electrolyzer systems. Prior work has shown that water costs make only a relatively modest contribution to hydrogen production costs, even if high levels of treatment is required (e.g., desalination)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Instead, the availability of a suitable and proximate water source becomes a locational constraint given the environmental considerations (for example, threats to fresh water reservoirs) and the competition with other high priority water uses such as agriculture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. For our analysis we consider groundwater, desalination and recycled water availability in Australia and cost them on basis of average wholesale pricing (Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>, Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">3</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Renewable energy availability</title><p id="Par18">Similarly, access to renewable electricity is another key underlying aspect of green hydrogen generation, therefore potential locations will be constrained by their associated renewable resource potential, available land to install the electrolyzer and any associated plant as well as dedicated solar/wind farms, and infrastructure to support energy projects (transmission lines, BESS etc.). In this regard, regions identified by policy makers as Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) offer key opportunities as they are already designated areas with high renewable energy generation potential, available land that is suitable for project development and suitable energy infrastructure including transmission already in place or planned for development. Several REZs are already identified in Australia, and we consider these for our analysis as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.

Domestically, we assume H<sub>2</sub> can be used as a feedstock or clean fuel in existing industries, e.g., ammonia production facilities, oil refineries and steel plants, or as a clean fuel for large emitters, e.g., cement facilities, and alumina smelters. Additionally, hydrogen can also be injected and hence blended into existing natural gas pipelines (already being actively demonstrated in Australia)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. We also assume electrolyzers integrated with solar/wind farms and fuel cells can be used in combined power and heat systems to replace diesel or natural gas fired generators that are actively used in off-grid sites across Australia. More broadly, it seems likely that the bulk of Australia’s hydrogen production may be exported, and sites close to the coast or existing ports with energy export infrastructure (refer to Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">4</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">3</xref>) could well end up being used as hydrogen export hubs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Additional infrastructure</title><p id="Par20">To leverage these various utilization opportunities, additional support infrastructure including intermediate hydrogen storage, transport facilities and electricity transmission networks would be required to integrate the hydrogen generation facility and downstream end use sector.

For large scale storage, salt caverns offer a much more viable solution due to low cost construction, strong containment, low risk of H<sub>2</sub> leakage and fast injection and withdrawal rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Similarly, depleted oil and gas reservoirs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> or geographical formation suitable for CO<sub>2</sub> storage might also be used for H<sub>2</sub> storage (refer to Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">5</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">13</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. While exisitng road and railways can be leveraged to transport, the equipment, workforce, and produced hydrogen via tube trailers. As an alternative in the absence of such opportunities, dispatching the electricity from the solar/wind farm from potent locations to the electrolyzer installed at the utilization site might be more viable, for which any existing grid infrastructure could be leveraged albeit at additional cost of connecting to the grid and transmission charges.</p><p id="Par21">We conducted an extensive analysis of all these opportunities across Australia (refer to Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">6</xref> and Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">2</xref>), and through these zoning filters identified 41 particularly prospective hydrogen production locations across Australia as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Multi criteria analysis tool</title><p id="Par22">The next stage of the framework develops a multi criteria analysis (MCA) tool to conduct a competitive analysis of the selected sites.

To read the graph, pick a location (represented with different symbols in the keys for each state) and individual category (renewable energy availability, location viability, end use opportunities and storage opportunities), the score for that category is then measurable how far from the centre the symbol is on the axis. E.g., if we chose Geraldton in WA and measure its score for end use opportunity, we see that the symbol lies close to the 4th dotted line from the centre that represents 80%, so for end use opportunities Geraldton scores 80% out of a max score of 100%. Moreover, the wider the distribution (or the more spread out the solid lines—spider web for any given location), the better it ranks in terms of all categories. The score assigned are assigned to each location based on the matrix in Methods section (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), the complete MCA database and ranking for the individual locations is presented in Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">2</xref> and the summary of the MCA results for each state is detailed in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">4</xref>.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43247_2022_640_Fig3_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par30">The MCA reveals that some of the more favourable sites for developing hydrogen hubs are available in Queensland (QLD), South Australia (SA), Western Australia (WA), and New South Wales (NSW). Overall, the MCA based ranking results also reveal an interesting trade-off between sites with renewable energy potential, resources (better water, storage opportunities etc) and end use opportunity, highlighting that a high score across all the cateogries is not guranteed with some locations having high renewable energy potential but limited complementary resources of water, transmission networks, road/rail connetions and potential end users. E.g., as observed most of the high profile solar/wind sites (like Broken Hill, Clean Energy Hub North Qld etc.) are often far off from high value end use opportunities like existing ports or local demand centres or face locational issues especially water availability. However, as suggested earlier these sites can be leveraged for grid connected opportunities where the electricity generated at the REZs can be transmitted (at the cost of additional grid usage charges elaborated earlier) through the grid to electrolyzers established in suitable locations and close to demand sites. This can also be achieved using the rail and road network, where the hydrogen can be generated at a suitable site and then transported to the utilization site, creating room for additional economic optimization to either develop an electric network or a supply chain. Moreover, the MCA framework also allows us to compare the renewable energy potential and seasonal variability, which highlights that while several sites might have high renewable energy potential but are also susceptible to high seasonal variability which would result in variable H<sub>2</sub> production and affect downstream utilization (e.g,. requiring oversizing, grid supplementation or BESS to firm the supply which will be an economic concern as discussed in later sections). Similarly, solar and wind profiles at several locations can play a complementary role e.g., if the solar profile is high volatile and the wind is highly stable these profiles can be combined to make a hybrid powerplant which would have a more stable H<sub>2</sub> supply (as elaborated later).</p><p id="Par31">In addition, as elaborated earlier, its important to note that the MCA is highly subjective to scope of analysis, as the rankings can vary significantly depending on how the assumptions are set up. Currently, we have set up the MCA with the highest weighting given to renewable energy potential and end use, and with scoring inclined towards factors like higher scores for good renewable potential and low seasonal variation, export as the highest scoring end use and desalination as the most sustainable source of water etc. as these reflect the most likely settings for project development as elaborated in the Methods section. In comparison, the user might prefer the use of hydrogen locally and other locational viability factors e.g., co-location with recycled water facilities etc. as the highest weights, this could significantly of change the outlook of the MCA. To enable this the MCA tool (refer to Supplementary Software <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">1</xref>), is made available as an open-source resource to allow the user to update or add their own weights, categories, and score matrix as per requirement. Therefore, such an MCA framework provides a simple yet powerful tool for initial shortlisting of sites that fulfill a specific project scope.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Application of the HySupply Costing Tool</title><p id="Par32">The third stage of the framework is the development and application of the HySupply Cost Tool. The details of the tool are elaborated in the “Methods” section, Supplementary Information, and the sections below. In summary, the tool (refer to Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">14</xref>) is designed to rely on local solar and wind traces to conduct an hourly simulation of powerplant power output (based on combinations of solar/wind farm and BESS) which can be designed in a wide range of scenarios (refer to Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">15</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">5</xref>), the power output is then co-related with the efficiency of the electrolyzer (refer to Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">16</xref>) to provide the hourly hydrogen generation profile. In this manner, using the tool the capacity factor profiles can then be mapped for all the consider locations to determine and understand the trends of overall hydrogen generation potential at each site as described in the sections below. In addition, the tool can conduct a robust technoeconomic analysis based on user defined capacities, cost, and performance parameters (which include advanced features to design and evaluate 24 different electrolyzer—powerplant configurations listed in  Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">5</xref>, through a comprehensive capital cost—direct and indirect cost model, economies of scale, electrolyzer efficiency variation with load, degradation etc. which are generally not present in other tools as highlighted in Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">1</xref>). Herein we use the tool to determine the LC<sub>H2</sub>, by adopting literature-based cost and performance parameters as elaborated in “Methods” (refer to Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">7</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Geospatial modelling of solar and wind traces</title><p id="Par33">Of all the considered locational aspects, the renewable energy potential is the most critical factor for green hydrogen generation. Our analysis (refer to Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">17</xref>) shows that the highest solar profiles are available in Northern Territory (NT), SA, QLD, and WA (and lowest in Victoria—VIC and Tasmania—TAS), with the average solar capacity factors (average of all the considered sites in each state) in order of; (i) WA—33.4%, (ii) NT—32.2%, (iii) QLD—30.5%, (iv) SA—29.2%, (v) NSW—29.1%, (vi) VIC—25.9%, and (vii) TAS—23.8%. Overall, the highest average solar capacity factor is exhibited in Tennant Creek, NT (capacity factor of 35.5%), while in other states: WA—Geraldton (33.9%), NSW—North West REZ (32.7%), VIC—Murray River REZ (29.8%), SA—Roxby Downs REZ (32.9%), QLD—Barcaldine REZ (33.7%) and the TAS—North East Tasmania REZ (25.2%) have the highest capacity factor. Similarly, the average wind capacity factors are in the order; (i) TAS—48.5%, (ii) QLD—44.9%, (iii) NT—38.2%, (iv) SA—38.1%, (v) WA—36.5%, (vi) VIC—36.0% and (vii) NSW—35.4%. The highest wind capacity factor is exhibited by Far North Qld REZ (capacity factor of 58.7%), with similar high-capacity factors are also shown by Tasmania Midlands REZ (55.3%) while the in other states NSW—Tumut REZ (42.2%), VIC—Ovens Murray REZ (41.4%), SA—Leigh Creek REZ (42.3%), NT—Tennant Creek REZ (48.5%) and WA—Geraldton REZ (43.5%) have the highest capacity factor. Overall, and as expected, wind offers higher capacity factors than solar across all regions. Several REZs in QLD and WA offer interesting case studies as they offer both high solar and wind potential.</p><p id="Par34">However, as elaborated earlier, capacity factor provides limited information on the variability of the solar and wind profiles over time. This is an important consideration for project proponents given how short-term variability will impact on the amount of hydrogen storage required, while seasonal variation will impact on production profiles for delivery to consumers. To the best of our knowledge no other publicly available tool (refer to Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">1</xref>) analyze variability in capacity factors of local solar and wind traces and their subsequent effect on electrolyzer generation over different time resolutions. Our tool, by comparison, has the functionality to map the locational solar and wind profiles over various resolutions. Here we only focus on monthly distribution curves for simplicity and the fact that they best visualize seasonal variability. To undergo this evaluation, we compare the monthly average capacity factor curves for solar and wind of the best performing location (i.e., highest overall annual capacity factor) vs the worst location (i.e., lowest annual capacity factor) for each site as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. Comparing the capacity factor curves highlight that for NT, the maximum daily capacity factors across the months remain between 80 and 100% for both solar and wind, and in the northern region (NT1), the solar traces generally peak in the Australian winter (April–Sept), at the same time in the south (NT3) the solar profiles decline and tend to peak in the tail end of the winter (Sep–Dec). In comparison, the wind profiles also peak between May and Sep in the northern regions (NT1 – NT2) but for the southern regions the profile peak for a larger period April–Sep). In contrast, WA show similar solar profiles near the coast (W1 and W3) with peaking in Australian Summer (Jan and Feb), after which there is a decline and stabilization around the average (March–Jul) before peaking again towards the later part of the year (Aug–Dec). Inland (W2), there is a similar profile, but this location experiences a much higher decline in the mid-year as experienced in the other locations. In NSW, the solar profiles tend to remain high throughout the year peaking in the summer months (especially around Dec/Jan and April) and decrease during the winter months of (June to Aug). While the wind traces across the state show a similar trend with peaking in the winter months (May to August) especially in the southern locations (Tumut and Cooma Monaro REZs). Similar trends can be identified for the rest of the locations.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Variability in the solar and wind traces across the best and worst performing locations amongst the selected REZs in each State.</title><p>Each set representing the State of <bold>a</bold> New South Wales, <bold>b</bold> Victoria, <bold>c</bold> Queensland, <bold>d</bold> South Australia, <bold>e</bold> Western Australia, <bold>f</bold> Tasmania and <bold>g</bold> Northern Territory consists of four figures that show the site (from amongst the selected sites) with the highest annual capacity factor (on the left), compared to the one with the lowest annual capacity factors (on the right) is shown for solar energy (the top two figures of each set) and for wind energy (the bottom two figures of each set).

They can be used for a preliminary design for storage capacity, where the annual capacity factor can be used as a standard for yearly hydrogen output (ton/yr) and the trend of daily, weekly, or monthly capacity factors (especially their standard deviations) can be used as potential patterns to define downstream hydrogen supply contracts (e.g., contracts can be scheduled to supply larger volumes of H<sub>2</sub> during months with favorable solar/wind production or to establish storage volumes and durations required to meet baseline supply requirements around the year by storing excess demand during favorable months to offset the lower production in months with variable or low solar/wind prodiction). Moreover, the traces can also reveal sites where solar, and wind play a complementary role both in terms of capacity factors and variability over different time periods to develop a hybrid powersupply that can ensure better capacity factors compared to having either a solar or wind farm operating the electrolyzer. While here we focus on the solar and wind traces over annual and monthly resolutions for solar and wind farms, the tool also can map similar traces for electrolyzer capacity factor which can be compared to evaluate load variations, efficiency vs load trade-offs as well as impacts of hybrid or oversized powerplants on the electrolyzer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Base case results</title><p id="Par36">In addition, as a base case, we assess the levelized costs for standalone wind and solar farm powered 10 MW electrolyzers across each site, the results are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. We evaluate that the LC<sub>H2</sub> for Solar powered AE systems will range between US$5.5 kg<sup>−1</sup> and US$8.6 kg<sup>−1</sup>, while that of PEM system will range between US$7.1 kg<sup>−1</sup> and US$10.8 kg<sup>−1</sup> at present input cost estimates (refer to Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">17</xref>). Similarly, for Wind powered AE and PEM systems the costs range between US$3.7 kg<sup>−1</sup> and US$7.8 kg<sup>−1</sup> and between US$4.7 and US$9.2 kg<sup>−1</sup> (refer to Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">17</xref>). The lowest average LC<sub>H2</sub> (US$4.7 kg<sup>−1</sup> and US$4.9 kg<sup>−1</sup>) are recorded in Tasmania and Queensland, for wind driven systems due to the inherent high-capacity factors. Moreover, the AE systems have a lower capacity factor due to a lower operational range compared to PEM, which allows PEM systems to take advantage of lower capacity power outputs from the powerplant and operate for longer times, however AE has a LC<sub>H2</sub> advantage due to lower capital cost and lower specific energy consumption (kWh kg<sup>−1</sup>). Note these values are based on current cost expectations (refer to Methods), and as highlighted in our prior work and that of others, there remains significant room for improvement in costs remain due to capital cost reduction and efficiency improvements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, as well as taking advantage of scaling project capacity to take advantage of economies of scale and further capacity factor optimization (oversizing, inclusion of BESS and hybrid powerplants).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Summary of the base case results.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3"><p>State</p></th><th colspan="4"><p>Solar driven system</p></th><th colspan="4"><p>Wind driven system</p></th></tr><tr><th colspan="2"><p>Capacity factor (%)</p></th><th colspan="2"><p>LC<sub>H2</sub> (US$ kg<sup>−1</sup>)</p></th><th colspan="2"><p>Capacity factor (%)</p></th><th colspan="2"><p>LC<sub>H2</sub> (US$ kg<sup>−1</sup>)</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>AE</p></th><th><p>PEM</p></th><th><p>AE</p></th><th><p>PEM</p></th><th><p>AE</p></th><th><p>PEM</p></th><th><p>AE</p></th><th><p>PEM</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>NSW</p></td><td><p>27.64%</p></td><td><p>28.00%</p></td><td><p>6.48</p></td><td><p>8.16</p></td><td><p>33.80%</p></td><td><p>35.55%</p></td><td><p>6.16</p></td><td><p>7.53</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>VIC</p></td><td><p>24.45%</p></td><td><p>24.90%</p></td><td><p>7.34</p></td><td><p>9.21</p></td><td><p>33.72%</p></td><td><p>35.33%</p></td><td><p>6.17</p></td><td><p>7.63</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>QLD</p></td><td><p>29.08%</p></td><td><p>29.32%</p></td><td><p>6.14</p></td><td><p>7.79</p></td><td><p>43.05%</p></td><td><p>44.31%</p></td><td><p>4.97</p></td><td><p>6.13</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>SA</p></td><td><p>27.75%</p></td><td><p>28.05%</p></td><td><p>6.48</p></td><td><p>8.19</p></td><td><p>35.75%</p></td><td><p>37.45%</p></td><td><p>6.13</p></td><td><p>6.23</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>WA</p></td><td><p>28.56%</p></td><td><p>32.05%</p></td><td><p>5.61</p></td><td><p>5.79</p></td><td><p>34.49%</p></td><td><p>35.88%</p></td><td><p>5.69</p></td><td><p>6.80</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>NT</p></td><td><p>27.50%</p></td><td><p>29.76%</p></td><td><p>5.87</p></td><td><p>6.06</p></td><td><p>36.19%</p></td><td><p>37.58%</p></td><td><p>5.32</p></td><td><p>6.10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TAS</p></td><td><p>22.31%</p></td><td><p>22.85%</p></td><td><p>7.97</p></td><td><p>9.98</p></td><td><p>46.49%</p></td><td><p>47.80%</p></td><td><p>4.58</p></td><td><p>5.65</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>The values represented are the average of the capacity factors and levelized cost of each considered REZs in the mentioned state/territory.

The analysis undertaken in this study (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a, b</xref>) reaffirms this and highlights that cost reductions for the electrolyzer is more important in lowering LC<sub>H2</sub> than a reduction in solar and wind powerplant capital costs. Estimates for future electrolyzer costs suggest that these might well be reduced by 50–70%, while those of solar have been forecast to decrease by 50–60%, yet perhaps only around 5–10% reduction in wind power costs (refer to SI section Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">8</xref>). Our prior analysis has shown that these cost reductions would be a key driver in reducing costs to match the Australian Government’s stretch A$2 kg<sup>−1</sup> target (US$1.4 kg<sup>−1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In addition to the upfront capital cost reduction, scaling up projects to higher capacity (&gt;10 MW) will play a further complementary role in reducing the LC<sub>H2</sub>, especially if projects of multi MW scales (&gt;500 MW) to take advantage of economies of scale would lead upto 70% reduction in LC<sub>H2</sub> under current expectations, and even more if a lower scale index (n) (the unit cost reduction associated with larger projects) can be achieved (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c-d</xref>). Moreover, while installing electrolyzers at site, additional costs are added to the equipment cost due to installation and land expenses (for both electrolyzer and powerplant plus that of BESS and grid connection if present), while land costs are likely to increase due to the nature of the market, installation costs are likely to decrease as the supply chain for electrolyzers are established. In addition, while we do not consider this in our modelling, remoteness of the site from major industrial energy hubs could also affect project economics, as prior analysis for renewable projects in Australia show that cost of installation increases if projects are not developed in close proximity to industrial hubs due to lack of local industry capabilities and workforce<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>System efficiency improvements</title><p id="Par39">Alternatively, increasing the efficiency of the systems is another a key avenue for LC<sub>H2</sub> reduction. Improvement in electrolyzer energy consumptions/efficiencies (kWh kg<sub>H2</sub><sup>−1</sup>) are expected with ongoing R&amp;D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, and our sensitivity analysis (refer to Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">18a</xref>) shows this would reduce the LC<sub>H2</sub> due to capacity factor improvement as more hydrogen is generated for the same energy applied. However, a counter element is the degradation of the electrolyzer and solar/wind farms that leads to lower energy output and subsequent lower hydrogen generation, with our prior analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> shows that these aspects are usually neglected in cost modelling and our sensitivity results show these can add upto 2% increase in LC<sub>H2</sub> (refer to Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">18b–c</xref>). Similarly, another commonly underexplored aspect is the efficiency variation with load, literature analysis shows that both AE and PEM operate at higher efficiency at lower loads (refer to Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">16</xref>). This could be considerably important as shown by duration curves, as the electrolyzer with dedicated powerplant would operate at lower loads for longer durations as compared to higher loads (refer to Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">11</xref>). Our sensitivity analysis reveals that accounting for this can lead upto ~30% reduction in LC<sub>H2</sub> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). Specifically, for the PEM electrolyzers, they also can be overloaded (run upto 120–150% of their nominal loads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>), accounting for this shows that the LC<sub>H2</sub> can further decrease by 5–10% (refer to Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">18d</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Configuration designs</title><p id="Par40">The configuration of the electrolyzer and powerplant integration would also influence the LC<sub>H2</sub> due to different share of each component in the total project costs and the subsequent capacity factors delivered. We have already revealed that an optimum oversize ratio (1.25–1.5) exists for delivering the LC<sub>H2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and our sensitivity results also support this finding as oversizing by 1.5 leads to cost reduction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>). However, a critical part of the oversizing the powerplant is that excess energy has to be curtailed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, adding a BESS is a potential solution as suggested earlier. The sensitivity analysis reveals an interesting aspect that while inclusion of batteries and oversizing increases to enhanced capacity factors it also causes increase in LC<sub>H2</sub> due to additional CAPEX; a premium (higher LC<sub>H2</sub>) will be incurred for ensuring high-capacity factor operation. However, given the different levels of oversizing and BESS storage (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5f</xref>), an optimum energy mix can exist that allows both high-capacity factor and acceptable LC<sub>H2.</sub> Moreover, given there is a capital cost difference between BESS of different power and storage duration, an optimum mix also exists while choosing the batteries rated output—MWh (refer to Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">18e</xref>). Similar trade-off also exists in developing a hybrid powerplant, e.g., in Geraldton (site used as an example for our sensitivity analysis), a hybrid combination can be developed to take advantage of a higher capacity and less volatile wind traces to boost the lower capacity factor and more volatile wind. Our sensitivity result (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>) also supports showing that a hybrid powerplant with a larger share of wind has a lower LC<sub>H2</sub> than that with a larger share of solar, therefore a trade-off also exists between different hybrid ratios due to different capital cost of solar and wind farms (solar farms are less costly than wind farms) and the capacity factors (wind traces mostly higher than solar and less volatile across Australia as compared to solar traces). This is where the best-case scenario algorithm comes as it can run through the range of capacity mixes (solar/wind, oversize ratios, share in hybrid combination and BESS capacity) to find the most optimum mix for LC<sub>H2</sub> and capacity factor targets as elaborated in the next section.</p><p id="Par41">Alternately, the powerplant–electrolyzer can be connected via the grid, so the energy used to power the electrolyzer is purchased as a PPA with additional transmission charges. The AEMO ISP 2020, suggests the LCOE of solar and wind farms and the transmission costs for the NEM connected REZs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, these range between; US$22 MWh<sup>−1</sup> (A$30 MWh<sup>−1</sup>) to US$29 MWh<sup>−1</sup> (A$40 MWh<sup>−1</sup>) for Solar LCOE and similarly for Wind LCOE, the costs range US$23 MWh<sup>−1</sup> (A$32 MWh<sup>−1</sup>) to US$50 MWh<sup>−1</sup> (A$70 MWh<sup>−1</sup>) for Solar LCOE both with additional transmission cost of US$3.5 MWh<sup>−1</sup> (A$5 MWh<sup>−1</sup>)to US$21 MWh<sup>−1</sup>(A$30 MWh<sup>−1</sup>). However, these network charges could be as high as US$200 MWh<sup>−1</sup> (A$286 MWh<sup>−1</sup>) based on tariffs suggested by Australian power suppliers (refer to Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">6</xref>). These costs can then increase the LC<sub>H2</sub> by upto between 3 and 4 folds with 70% of the LC<sub>H2</sub> just contributed by the cost of buying electricity from the grid. However, connecting the powerplant–electrolyzer has an advantage that the any excess energy (not used by electrolyzer or charge the BESS) can be retailed to the grid, especially if the project proponents can risk selling at the spot prices, the excess can be retailed for upto US$3500 MWh<sup>−1</sup> (A$5000 MWh<sup>−1</sup>) based on the highest end spot price in the NEM over 2020<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>), this could potentially offset the transmission costs while yielding addtional revenue generation ultimately reducing the LC<sub>H2</sub>.</p><p id="Par42">Additional cost reduction can also be generated by retailing the O<sub>2</sub> but this has a very little value due to current low cost of O<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, however considering the purity of the O<sub>2</sub> if a suitable offtake market is available in close proximity a higher retail cost could be achieved.</p><p id="Par43">In this manner, the application of the proposed MCA and cost tool allow an integrated one stop solution for the user to systematically visualize, understand, quantify, and explore different trade-offs between key design aspects and cost parameters and their eventual influence on the overall economics.

Initially, the algorithm was run to establish the least LC<sub>H2</sub> for a maximum of 1 GW electrolyzer capacity with no minimum capacity factor constraint and using the cost/performance parameters (refer to Methods), to provide an overview of the costs that can be achieved. The results for both AE and PEM systems are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a, b</xref>. As expected, the results (LC<sub>H2</sub> and capacity mixes) have a strong locational dependence due to differing solar and wind profiles. It is observed that for the current CAPEX and OPEX expectations, we can achieve LC<sub>H2</sub> of between US$2.2 kg<sup>−1</sup> and US$4.3 kg<sup>−1</sup> across all sites, with a minimum of US$2.2 kg<sup>−1</sup> (AE) and US$2.7 kg<sup>−1</sup> (PEM) achieved in REZ-Q1 (Far North Queensland). Comparing both types of electrolyzer highlights that for PEM systems the optimal powerplant configuration differed only slightly from the AE electrolyzer despite having a larger CAPEX than AE, which is countered by their higher load range (assumed minimum load rating of 5% compared to 15% for AE) leading to better capital efficiencies. Therefore, the LC<sub>H2</sub> for PEM systems was on average US$0.5 kg<sup>−1</sup> higher across all REZs. To achieve these costs, for most of the considered sites, a hybrid powerplant was found to be the best option albeit with different solar and wind shares (α and β ratios—subjective to the local traces). For five of the considered REZs (Q1, T1, T2, T3, and NT3) a wind-only powerplant was found to be best. This tended to be locations with a very strong and consistent wind resource, hence where it was more beneficial to oversize the wind powerplant rather than add solar generation. In addition, the optimum average powerplant oversize ratio was determined to be two times the capacity of the electrolyzer and without the constraint on capacity factor, the BESS is never required since it adds insufficient value to counter the additional high costs it adds to the project.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Best Case Scenario Results.</title><p>The powerplant and BESS capacities required and their subsequent LC<sub>H2</sub> to achieve the least cost (unconstrained capacity factor) for both <bold>a</bold> AE and <bold>b</bold> PEM systems, capacity factor target of 80% for both <bold>c</bold> AE and <bold>d</bold> PEM systems and capacity factor target of 90% for both <bold>e</bold> AE and <bold>f</bold> PEM systems are shown for 1 GW electrolyzer capacity.

The comparison reveals similar outcomes, for example, REZ-Q1 was found to have the highest wind potential overall and the lowest solar potential in QLD. In the base case it had the lowest LC<sub>H2</sub> of all sites for wind-only and was on par with the average for solar-only for both AE and PEM. For an AE system, the LC<sub>H2</sub> for the base case was US$3.73 kg<sup>−1</sup> compared to US$2.24 kg<sup>−1</sup> for the best-case. For REZ-NT3, optimizing the configuration decreased the levelized cost by 40% compared to the lowest cost in the base case (AE, wind only). In general, the configuration with a hybrid solar and wind powerplant performed better than either on their own, and larger systems had lower levelized costs due to the economies of scale (which is also supported by the sensitivity analysis—Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Note, because the scale models which we have incorporated are unconstrained, building a higher capacity will lead to greater cost reductions. To demonstrate this, we used the tool to estimate the LC<sub>H2</sub> at a higher scale (&gt;10 GW), the results show that the optimal powerplant remains constant as a ratio of the electrolyzer size. In practice, such scales, certainly at an early stage of industry development would be constrained by the available capital, resources, land, and manufacturing capacity, and put very large amounts of capital at risk. At present, we still have limited data on how costs of mega-scale electrolyzer projects (&gt;100 MW) might scale as such projects are yet to be implemented.</p><p id="Par46">In addition, the minimum electrolyzer CF constraint was included to allow us to model scenarios with greater utilization of the electrolyzer. Such a requirement might be imposed, for example, by downstream conversion processes. Since for these standalone systems the electrolyzer operating level is driven by the renewable energy available in each timestep, higher capacity factors are achieved by increasing the oversize ratio or adding a BESS into the system to shift excess generation to low-production times. Thus, addition of BESS generally increases the LC<sub>H2</sub> compared to the unconstrained case. Setting the minimum electrolyzer capacity factor over the year to 80% increased the average cost across all the sites to $3.73 kg<sup>−1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c, d</xref>). All sites relied on a hybrid solar and wind powerplant to achieve this capacity factor since this greatly increases the time that the electrolyzer can operate due to their complementary nature. Despite the lower capital and operating costs of the solar plant, all the sites had a higher share of wind capacity than solar capacity (on average <italic>α</italic> = 35% and <italic>β</italic> = 65%) in the combined hybrid powerplant capacity, likely because the wind farms have a higher capacity factor. Although only one of the considered sites (REZ-N7) needed a BESS to meet this target, the powerplant oversize ratio is also much higher than the unconstrained scenario at around 3.23.</p><p id="Par47">To achieve an electrolyzer capacity factor of 90% over the year, BESS were required in the configuration for 11 out of the 20 REZs shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e, f</xref>. The average LC<sub>H2</sub> increased to US$4.45 kg<sup>−1</sup> and the average powerplant oversize was 4.5, hence involving periods of very high spill. Note that for the BESS, there is an interplay between the BESS power capacity (MW) and the duration of storage that needs to be considered when finding the minimum cost as shown in the sensitivity analysis. Such analysis falls outside the scope of this work but can be explored at a later stage using our tool. Interestingly, for some sites the costs does not vary much by constraining the capacity factors, this could be explained by several factors like (i) as found in our earlier work there is an optimum oversize ratio which despite increase of solar/wind capacity and their cost leads to lower LC<sub>H2</sub>, (ii) achieving an 80% capacity factor leads to higher capital efficiencies of the electrolyzer and the increase in costs are countered by higher hydrogen production or (iii) by chance at the site the capacity mix for achieving the least LC<sub>H2</sub> is same or close to that to achieve the capacity factor constraints. For reference, the electrolyzer capacity factor in the unconstrained case was between 50% and 76% for AE and 58% and 81% for PEM. This is much higher than the base case because of the power plant oversizing. While we do not map these, like the LC<sub>H2</sub> case there are ranges of powerplant configurations which would result in similar capacity factors being achieved.</p><p id="Par48">The best-case algorithm also allows us to visualize the solution space as two of the inputs are changed. As in the contour graphs in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g, h</xref>, which maps the LC<sub>H2</sub> as a function of solar and wind capacity for a constant electrolyzer size, we can see that though the minimal value is reached only once, there are ranges of powerplant configurations which will result in similar levelized costs. We also ran the results for future capital cost reduction (refer to Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">19</xref>) and see that under current economies of scale assumptions at 1 GW scale at 50% reduction in reference capital cost of electrolyzer and the powerplant (solar/wind) will lead to some sites achieving the US$1.4 kg<sup>−1</sup> (the Australian target of A$2 kg<sup>−1</sup>) and at 50–100 GW this is achievable for more sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par49">We have developed a comprehensive framework for preliminary design and prefeasibility analysis of exclusively solar and wind powered electrolysis. The framework consists of zoning filters, a multi criteria analysis, a comprehensive cost analysis tool and a best-case scenario algorithm. While such tools/frameworks have been developed before, our system provides an integrated framework tools and functionalities that can then be used individually and ideally altogether to optimize across the stages of renewable electrolysis project design which is missing in prior work. We apply this framework to the emerging Australian Hydrogen market as a case study, by identifying and comparing 41 different sites across the country for potential hydrogen hubs. This extends to evaluating each site’s solar and wind potential, locational viability (water resource, proximity to end use application etc.) and levelised cost of generating hydrogen. The cost tool is then used to understand the influence of local renewable energy potential (local solar and wind resource), different design parameters (oversizing, hybrid combination, BESS storage, grid connection etc.), cost (economies of scale) and performance parameters (degradation rates, efficiency variation with load etc.). Subsequently the best-case scenario algorithm is applied to individual sites to determine installed capacities of electrolyzer, solar/wind powerplant and BESS capacity to achieve least cost or target capacity factors. Our MCA results show that some of the more favourable sites for developing hydrogen projects are in New South Wales, South Australia, Western Australia, and Queensland (subjective to the MCA assumptions). Furthermore, under current cost expectations at 10 MW (scale of existing projects in Australia) the cost of H<sub>2</sub> ranges between US$6 kg<sup>−1</sup> and US$10 kg<sup>−1</sup> (A$8 kg<sup>−1</sup> and A$14 kg<sup>−1</sup>). However, scaling up of project capacities to take advantage of economies of scale, optimizing the capacity mixes of the powerplant (oversized Solar/Wind Farm and BESS hybrids) and leveraging the trends for capital cost reduction, can lead to achievement of the Australain target of US$1.4 kg<sup>−1</sup> (A$2 kg<sup>−1</sup>) at some favourable sites in the near term (within 10 years) and rest of the sites over the long term. Note while these selected sites are just used as a case study and an indicative representation of each state’s hydrogen generation potential as a platform for developing Australia’s hydrogen future, the framework can be used to evaluate and identify additional sites not only in Australia as well as in other jurisdictions.

Similarly, in the Northern Territory, locations including Baines, McArthur, and Tennant Creek have high renewable energy generation potential. Tennant Creek’s potential for renewable hydrogen production has already been acknowledged, with a trial off-grid hydrogen project to be implemented in 2021<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Tennant Creek also neighbours the town of Elliot, where the Sun Cable project to export solar energy to Singapore via HVDC cable is being developed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. Other considerations for these site selections for NT and WA were their proximity to highways, railways, existing gas pipelines and ports. A similar preliminary analysis by Geoscience Australia also finds these regions to be amongst the high to moderately suitable locations for hydrogen generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. We provide a comparative analysis of all these REZ and additional selected locations to assess Australia’s renewable hydrogen generation potential.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Water availability</title><p id="Par52">For this analysis, we consider locations close to the coast where water can be sourced through desalination plants, while inland locations will need access to either fresh water, underground aquifers, desalination plants or recycled water (refer to Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">3</xref>). For costing these choices, we consider wholesale prices of fresh water, recycled water, and desalinated water as A$2.5 kL<sup>−1</sup>, A$1.6 kL<sup>−1</sup> and A$2.5 kL<sup>−1</sup> respectively, based on typical wholesale water supply prices in Australia (refer to Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Downstream utilization opportunities</title><p id="Par53">For export opportunities, we consider findings in a study by ARUP that identified ports that are suitable for hosting export facilities for hydrogen and its derivatives (refer to Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">3</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. For local demand, we identify demand centres which include ammonia production facilities, cement plants, steel making plants etc. where hydrogen can be used for decarbonisation. Moreover, we identify other distributed applications like use of hydrogen for mobility application at mines, injection in natural gas pipelines, storage of renewable energy for electricity generation or for replacement of diesel/natural gas-based energy generators in off grid locations. The details of these opportunities for each REZ are highlighted in Supplementary Data <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">2</xref>. Note we do not assess the technical and economic feasibility of these opportunities, however, use them as a metric to compare the potential of different REZs to host hydrogen hubs using the MCA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Additional support infrastructure</title><p id="Par54">To identify potential underground H<sub>2</sub> storage opportunities we consider salt caverns and depleting oil/natural gas fields that have been identified as part of a technical analysis conducted by CSIRO for identifying suitable sites for large scale underground hydrogen storage (refer to Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">13</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Similarly for transport network, electricity grid and natural gas network, we consider existing road and railway lines, power transmission lines and natural gas pipelines. Note similar to utilization, we do not assess the technical and economic feasibility of leveraging these resources, however, use them as a metric to compare the potential of different REZs to host hydrogen hubs using the MCA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Renewable energy availability</title><sec id="Sec29"><title>Solar and wind profiles</title><p id="Par55">As elaborated earlier, our cost tool relies on time-sequential, hourly observations of the solar and wind data at each location to assess its power generation potential. The tool comes preloaded with solar/wind traces (hourly data over a year) for 41 locations across Australia and allows users to add their own custom solar/wind profiles as well. We obtain these solar and wind traces from publicly available databases: the AEMO ISP 2020 Database and the Open-Source tool “Renewables Ninja” (refer to Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">3</xref>). Note there are differences in base line assumptions in both models, the Renewables Ninja model considers a 10% power loss due to conversion loss for solar (DC to AC conversion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>) while the AEMO ISP assume the solar plant are practically inherently oversized to counter this energy loss (DC to AC ratio is assumed to be between 1.1 and 1.3 to counter the energy loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>). Similarly, the AEMO ISP assumes a 10% loss in energy output for wind which can be attributed to the interaction of wind turbines resulting in loss of area and interference in wind patterns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, while the Renewables Ninja does not consider this. For consistency we consider a correction factor of 1.11 and 0.9 for solar and wind traces respectively, for the raw data extracted from renewable ninja to counter the above discrepancies in between the two databases.</p><p id="Par56">The data from both resources was extracted and resampled to an hourly format and is already preloaded in the tool. The tool then correlates the hourly generation data with the specific energy consumption of the electrolyzer to model the hydrogen generated, also on an hourly basis. This hourly data can then be represented as a sorted annual distribution of the power output from the solar PV or the wind powerplant, or as power consumed by the electrolyzer, using a similar protocol detailed in our prior analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Moreover, these duration curves were arranged as (i) an annual duration curve (refer to Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">5</xref>) which shows the total energy output by the powerplant, i.e., the area under the duration curve and the total time that the power output is maintained at any particular proportion of the capacity of the powerplant, and (ii) as the monthly distribution curve (refer to Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">11</xref>) which show the maximum/minimum capacity factor, the standard deviation in capacity factors (the normal standard deviation and +/− standard deviation) and average capacity factors. It is assumed that these solar/wind profiles are independent of the size of the powerplant, and thus apply to any scale.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Renewable potential assessment</title><sec><p id="Par57">To evaluate and compare the renewable energy potential, we use the capacity factor and seasonal variability as key metrics, as elaborated below:</p></sec><sec id="FPar1"><title>Capacity factor</title><p id="Par58">The capacity factor of the powerplant achieved over the year at each site is evaluated as shown in Eq. <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>:<disp-formula id="Equ2"><label>2</label><alternatives><mml:math id="Equ2_Math"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">,</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Actual</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.16em"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Energy</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.16em"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Output</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Theoretical</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.16em"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Maximum</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.16em"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Energy</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="0.16em"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Output</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">E</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">O</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ2_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The script is presented in the Supplementary Information (refer to Supplementary Note <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">10</xref>) and the tool takes as inputs the electrolyzer nominal capacity, the powerplant capacity as a ratio of the electrolyzer capacity (oversize ratio), the ratio of solar to wind contributing to the powerplant (in case of hybrid system), the energy storage system rated power and duration of storage, and the solar/wind profile of the chosen location. The algorithm can also be fed a minimum allowable capacity factor for the annual electrolyzer operation as a proxy for annual hydrogen production. Upper and lower bounds are set on each of the quantitative parameters along with a step size which determines how many possible configurations are tested. The LC<sub>H2</sub> calculation is then run for each configuration and the tool returns the set of input parameters (electrolyzer nominal capacity, powerplant capacity, oversize ratio, hybrid ratio, BESS rated power and BESS storage duration) which give the least cost.
