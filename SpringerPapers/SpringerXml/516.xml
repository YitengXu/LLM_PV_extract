These networks have high optical transmittance, low electrical sheet resistance and at the same time function as a photonic light-trapping structure enhancing optical absorption in the absorber layer of thin-film solar cells. We study the influence of nanowire width and pitch on the network transmittance and sheet resistance and demonstrate improved performance compared to ITO. Next, we use P3HT-PCBM organic solar cells as a model system to show the realization of nanowire network based functional devices. Using angle-resolved external quantum efficiency measurements, we demonstrate engineered light trapping by coupling to guided modes in the thin absorber layer of the solar cell. Concurrent to the direct observation of controlled light trapping we observe a reduction in photocurrent as a result of increased reflection and parasitic absorption losses; such losses can be minimized by re-optimization of the NW network geometry. Together, these results demonstrate how engineered 2D NW networks can serve as multifunctional structures that unify the functions of a transparent conductor and a light trapping structure. These results are generic and can be applied to any type of optoelectronic device.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>10933</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>19</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep11414.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep11414" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep11414</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>High-quality transparent conducting electrodes (TCEs) form an essential component of a broad range of optoelectronics devices including LEDs, displays and solar cells. For solar cells, the inclusion of a transparent conductor is particularly important when the charge carrier diffusion length is short, such as in for example Si heterojunction, perovskite or organic cells. The most commonly used TCE is indium-tin-oxide (ITO). However, high material costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, the scarcity of indium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, brittleness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, optical absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> and incompatibility of the sputtering process with organic layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> strongly motivate the development of a replacement for ITO.</p><p>The high conductivity of metals has stimulated interest in metal nanowire (NW) networks and meshes as alternatives to ITO. A wide variety of geometries have been proposed, including random nanowire meshes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, percolated films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, 1D (nano) imprinted gratings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, nanogratings interconnected with mesoscale wires<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, self-assembled microstructures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, as well as NW-graphene hybrid structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. These nanoscale and multiscale geometries can be designed to provide improved optoelectronic performance relative to ITO, achieving concurrent improvements in both optical transparency and electrical conductivity. Furthermore different metals can be used, which provides tuneability of the workfunction of the contact and allows for inverted fabrication schemes.</p><p>Plasmonic light trapping effects can further improve the absorption in thin absorber layers. For organic photovoltaic devices, plasmonic light trapping has recently become the subject of intense interest due to the short carrier diffusion lengths in these material systems. To facilitate efficient carrier extraction the active layer thickness must be thin, however this limits the optical path length inside the absorbing material. Optical efficiency enhancements have already been demonstrated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> by employing both localized plasmon resonances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) on the (rear) electrode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. ITO can be replaced with a conductive plasmonic array made of 1D silver gratings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and silver nanohole arrays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Random NW networks provide limited light trapping capabilities through random scattering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, all these geometries are either strongly polarization dependent (limited or no light trapping for other polarization) or allow no control over the network geometry.</p><p>Recently, we have shown using e-beam lithography (EBL) that 2D networks of silver NWs can match the optical performance of ITO as a transparent conductor, while offering significantly improved sheet resistances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Unlike random networks, controlled network geometries allow engineered spectral transmission by optimizing the effects of excitation of localized and propagating surface plasmon modes, scattering and coupling to guided modes in an underlying semiconductor substrate.</p><p>In this work, we employ soft-imprint lithography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> to transfer this small-area concept into large-area applications of NW networks. The facile fabrication of large-area NW networks allows us to systematically vary NW width and pitch and study the influence on spectral transmittance and sheet resistance and to demonstrate centimeter-scale NW network based functional devices. Furthermore, we employ the engineered 2D NW networks to systematically study plasmonic light trapping in an organic solar cell in a fully controlled manner. We demonstrate the unique combination of both mode-matched light trapping and charge collection in a single multifunctional layer using P3HT-PCBM polymer solar cells. The results from this well characterized model system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> are generic and applicable to all thin film devices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results And Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Nanoimprinted nanowire networks as transparent conducting electrodes</title><p>Substrate conformal imprint lithography (SCIL) is a high-resolution nanoimprint technique that employs a bilayer PDMS stamp to reproducibly transfer high-resolution nanopatterns onto substrates in a fast, facile and inexpensive manner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Here, we use this technique to fabricate Ag NW networks over centimeter-scale areas on a glass substrate with nanometer control over nanowire position, dimension and spacing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). Briefly, a PMMA sacrificial layer and a silica sol-gel layer are deposited on a glass substrate by spin coating. A 6” diameter SCIL stamp containing the nanowire pattern is applied and, after 30 minutes of drying in ambient conditions, removed to leave behind the patterned silica sol-gel layer. Subsequent reactive ion etching of the PMMA, thermal evaporation of Ag through the sol-gel/PMMA apertures and a liftoff process complete the fabrication of networks of Ag NWs. While this process can be applied to wafer-scale processing, here the stamped pattern consists of 40 square networks (2 × 2 mm<sup>2</sup> each), with each square containing a 30 nm high network with different NW width and pitch (widths: 55–130 nm, pitches: 300–1000 nm in steps of 100 nm). Electrical contact pads on either side of each network (125 μm × 2 mm) were fabricated using UV-lithography, followed by thermal evaporation (5 nm Cr, 50 nm Au) and subsequent lift-off (see sketch in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S2a</xref>).</p><p>The NW networks resulting from this top-down SCIL process are uniform over large areas (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), with the wires exhibiting both smooth interfaces and high-quality interconnections (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>). Unlike chemically synthesized random NW network meshes, these large-area NW networks are fabricated out of a single metallic sheet with correspondingly low inter-wire junction resistance, as we will show. We use 40 different combinations of pitch and NW width, each with a different metal filling fraction, to explore the trade-off between high optical transmittance and low sheet resistance on each array geometry.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Nanoimprinted silver nanowire networks as transparent electrodes.</p><p>(<bold>a</bold>) SEM image of large-area 500 nm pitch Ag NW network on glass.

Optical transmission spectra were taken of the Ag NW coated glass, with the NWs at the front (incident) side. An integrating sphere was used to allow the collection of light diffracted out of the sample under large angles (inset <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). To isolate the influence of the NW networks, the measured transmission spectra were normalized to the transmittance of a bare glass sample.</p><p>All nanowire network spectra exhibit broadband normalized transmittance as a result of guided modes through the apertures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, with two main perturbations (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). The sharp dip in the red spectral range is a result of diffractive coupling of light to propagating surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) along the nanowires<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. A broad dip in the blue spectral range originating from absorption due to the excitation of the transverse local surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of the individual wires; and plasmonic light scattering into waveguide modes in the glass substrate.</p><p>This diffractive coupling of light into the glass substrate, appearing as a reduction in the transmission spectra (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>), is a desired feature in light trapping geometries. In a functional device, the guided light couples to the absorber layer and will enhance the absorption, as demonstrated below. To investigate it further we plot the maximum in-plane wavevector <inline-formula id="IEq1"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2015_Article_BFsrep11414_IEq1_HTML.gif"/></inline-formula> that can be obtained in a glass substrate through scattering off a grating with pitch <italic>p</italic> (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, where <italic>n</italic><sub><italic>sio2</italic></sub> = 1.52). Guided modes lie between the light lines in air and in the glass substrate (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, shaded region). Combined, these conditions define the wavelength range for which mode coupling occurs (red line in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). For optical frequencies where λ<sub><italic>min</italic></sub> &lt; λ<sub>0</sub> &lt; λ<sub><italic>max</italic></sub> (dashed vertical gray lines in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) light couples to guided modes in the glass substrate; the density of these optical modes decreases with increasing wavelength, resulting in reduced coupling and a concomitant increase in transmittance through the slide, as is observed.</p><p>Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> were performed to calculate the fraction of light trapped by mode coupling into the glass substrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary S3</xref>). To this end, we simulated the transmittance of the top interface with Ag NW network (neglecting the 1 nm Ge seed layer, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary S6</xref>) and calculated the angular distribution of the light transmitted into the substrate. For the experimental Ag network dimensions (<italic>w</italic> = 65 nm, <italic>p</italic> = 500 nm), the results are shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>. The spectral distribution of total transmittance into the substrate (blue) is separated into the 0<sup>th</sup> order transmittance (green) and the [ ±1,0] and [0, ±1] (red) and [ ±1, ±1] (purple) diffraction orders in the substrate. Since the simulations only consider the top interface, direct comparison with the measured spectrum (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) in absolute terms is incorrect. However, comparing the 0<sup>th</sup> order transmittance (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>, green line) with the measured spectrum (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, green line) shows good qualitative agreement. The dip in transmission as a result of plasmon absorption (λ<sub>0</sub> ~ 450 nm), the gradual increase in transmittance due to substrate modes (500 ≤ λ<sub>0</sub> ≤ 760 nm), as well as the kink in transmission at λ<sub>0</sub> = 760 nm are clearly reproduced.</p><p>From the angular analysis we find that 5% of the photons in the AM1.5 solar spectrum will couple to guided modes, indicated by the shaded region. In the experiment, this fraction is not collected giving rise to the kink in the measured transmittance at λ<sub><italic>max</italic></sub> = 760 nm (see <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c,e</xref>). <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref> shows that the total transmitted spectrum (0<sup>th</sup> order plus grating coupling into the substrate) is ~ 90% over the entire spectral range from 500–900 nm (88% averaged over photon flux). This is very similar to the average transmittance through the ITO layers for this spectral range (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) despite the large area fraction covered by metal (20–31%, as determined from SEM images). Note that the simulated reflection and parasitic losses in the metal are limited to only 9.7% and 2.3% respectively (averaged over photon flux).</p><p>The sheet resistance (<italic>R</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>) of the NW networks was characterized using four-point-probe measurements. Two probes were placed on each contact pad and the resulting current-voltage (IV) response measured (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). For the ITO, the standard geometry of four equally spaced probes was used to measure <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub>. All NW networks and ITO samples showed Ohmic behavior, allowing <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>s</italic></sub> to be extracted from a linear fit.</p><p>For all nanowire networks the sheet resistance was measured and found to be significantly lower than the resistance of the ITO reference samples (thicknesses 110, 150 and 200 nm). The data is plotted in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref> for different pitches (shown as different colors) with the corresponding measured average transmittance (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>AM</italic>1.5</sub>), weighted for photon density in the AM1.5 solar spectrum (using the experimental spectral range; 400 &lt; λ &lt; 965 nm). For comparison, the measured data for ITO is shown in gray. The NW networks had a measured <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>AM</italic>1.5</sub> from 40–87% compared to 93–95% for commercially available ITO. Note that this neglects the  ~ 5% coupled by the NW networks into waveguided modes of the glass substrate. However, the NW networks show sheet resistances in the range of 8.7–27.5 Ω/sq, which is much lower than ITO studied here (34.3–63.6 Ω/sq). This shows that, despite the nanoscale dimensions of the wires, the presence of the highly conductive Ag metal permits a large improvement in sheet resistance.</p><p>Comparing the measured data with the theoretical sheet resistance for a square grid we find that the effective resistivity of the material is (7.0 ± 0.5) × 10<sup>−8</sup> Ωm, which is 4.3 ± 0.3 times larger than the bulk resistivity of silver. We attribute this to variations in wire width, surface roughness and electron scattering from grain boundaries. This is a significant improvement compared to the 5.7 times increase in resistivity observed for NW networks fabricated by e-beam lithography<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, which we attribute to reduced surface roughness on the individual NWs.</p><p>To determine the upper limit in performance that can be achieved with the NW networks, as well as to correct for the fraction of light coupled to guided substrate modes, we simulated the transmittance for <italic>p</italic> = 500 nm, <italic>h</italic> = 30 nm and <italic>w</italic> = 30–130 nm (similar to <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>), converted the spectra to normalized transmittance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary S3</xref>) and calculated the sheet resistance.

Second, the performance of the NW networks including the light coupled to guided modes (dashed line) is calculated by using the realistic resistivity (4.3 times bulk resistivity) instead of bulk resistivity. Third, by excluding the light coupled to guided modes the experimental conditions used in this work are calculated (solid line). Indeed, the theory line (solid) shows good agreement with the measured results (see inset of <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>), showing that the simulations accurately describe the experiments.

The geometry of the front contact is clearly visible through the glass substrate (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, front), where the color of individual squares is the result of scattering from the NW networks. Electrical contacts are made by positioning a probe on one of the 4 corner pads (black squares). The rear contacts (LiF, Al and Ag) are evaporated through a circular physical mask (1.9 mm diameter) such that isolated cells are defined with an area of 0.0284 cm<sup>2</sup> each (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>, back). The layered structure of these cells can be seen in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>, which shows a focused-ion beam (FIB) cross section of a representative device. The figure clearly shows the layers including the NWs. Importantly, the 30 nm thin PEDOT:PSS layer conformally coats the NWs, which we found was essential to prevent voltage reduction from current leakage. In total, 3 samples, containing 113 complete cells were fabricated, with an overall yield of 89%. Device failures were a result of current leakage induced by metal residues from incomplete lift-off processes.</p><p>To characterize the performance of the Ag nanowire contacted solar cells we performed current density - voltage (<italic>JV</italic>) measurements under white light illumination (100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, 1 sun). Typical results are shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d</xref> for NW network-based cells with wire widths of ~ 65–85 nm and pitches ranging from 300–1000 nm (colored lines), along with reference results for an ITO-based cell (gray dashed line). Performance parameters for these cells - open-circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>), short-circuit current density (<italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub>, obtained from EQE measurements below), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) - are shown as an inset.</p><p>These <italic>JV</italic> measurements prove that the NW networks function as efficient transparent conductors. The application of the NW networks as a transparent conductor induces no current leakage, as <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> is ~ 550 mV for all NW network cells, equal to that of the ITO reference cell. Also, the fill factor, which represents the electrical quality of the device, is ~ 0.66 for all NW network devices, similar to that of the ITO reference device. So, despite the corrugation of the cell surface resulting from conformal coating of the NW network, the networks do not induce additional carrier recombination. Replacing the ITO with NW networks causes a reduction in the short-circuit current density (<italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub>) from 9.4 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> to 7.4–7.7 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for the NWs relative to ITO. This difference in <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> can be attributed to several effects. First, the NW networks used here have slightly lower transmittance than the ITO reference samples (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>). Despite the lower sheet resistance, this results into reduced current generation. Second, the active layer thickness is not optimized for the NW network cells. Third, in the solar cell geometry the NW networks are coated by PEDOT:PSS instead of air. As a result, the refractive index contrast at the position of the NWs is reduced from 1 (air) → 1.52 (glass) to 1.52 (glass) → 1.7 (PEDOT:PSS). This reduces the forward scattering of the NWs and thereby increases the reflection of the cell, as confirmed by reflection measurements on the completed devices (see Fig. S4). Fourth, the higher refractive index red-shifts the LSPR to longer wavelengths where the solar flux is higher, thereby increasing the absorption in the NWs. From FDTD simulations we estimate the combined absorption losses (400 ≤ λ ≤ 650 nm) in the PEDOT:PSS and nanowire network to be 17.4% and 10.7% with and without the 1 nm Ge layer present, respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplemental S6</xref> for influence of Ge). The difference in transmittance can be readily minimized by optimizing the nanoimprint process for thinner wires, as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>. The effects of the increased refractive index however, are inherent to the device structure.</p><p>To characterize the spectral dependence of cell performance, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by illuminating the cells with a 1 mm diameter spot of monochromatic light (300 – 900 nm, 10 nm steps) and measuring both the illumination power and resulting photocurrent. The band edge for absorption in the P3HT donor molecule is observed at λ ~ 650 nm (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref>), in agreement with literature values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. In the blue spectral range the NW network cells show a reduced EQE relative to the ITO cell, due reflection (see Fig. S4b) and absorption in the metal. Furthermore, a clear transition in the shape of the EQE curves can be observed with increasing pitch. For the 300 nm device, the EQE is strongly asymmetric, showing low EQE in the blue and high EQE in the red spectral range. This is a clear sign of strong scattering by the LSPR of the NW network around λ ~ 450 nm. Fano-interference with the non-scattered light causes destructive interference for λ <italic>&lt;</italic> λ<sub><italic>LSPR</italic></sub> and constructive interference for λ &gt; λ<sub><italic>LSPR</italic></sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> For larger NW pitches, the wire density decreases, such that the scattering amplitude of the LSPR also decreases. This reduces the spectral asymmetry and results in a more spectrally flat response.</p><p>Finally, small but significant peaks can be observed in the EQE of the NW devices for λ &gt; 650 nm, exceeding the EQE of the ITO reference device. To show this more clearly, a logarithmic plot is shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2e</xref> (inset) for a 500 nm (green) and 400 nm (blue) pitch device. An EQE enhancement is observed for 700 &lt; λ &lt; 900 nm and 650 &lt; λ &lt; 800 nm for these two devices, respectively. We attribute this EQE enhancement to light trapping as a result of the NW networks scattering light into the guided modes of the polymer cells. This EQE enhancement occurs in the weakly absorbing spectral range of the polymer, corresponding to PCBM (acceptor molecule) absorption up to λ ~ 750 nm and CT absorption up to λ ~ 1100 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Light trapping through NW network scattering</title><p>To confirm that the EQE enhancement observed at long wavelengths is a result of mode coupling we first calculate the guided modes supported by the solar cell layer structure.

However, an offset is observed for all lines, which can be attributed to three factors. First, the calculations assume perfectly flat layers, while the fabricated devices show variations in thickness (Fig. S3b). Using FIB cross sections we measured the range of polymer layer thicknesses and observed thickness variations on the order of 65 nm. Dispersion curves calculated for both the minimum and maximum layer thicknesses are shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d,e</xref>. Second, the calculations neglect the presence of the NWs. Third, the calculations assume a dispersive but isotropic refractive index for P3HT-PCBM; the actual dielectric is known to be anisotropic as a result of vertical segregation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p>The EQE response of the cells can be further understood by comparing crosscut spectra (taken from <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d,e</xref>) with measured reflection spectra. The total reflection of the completed devices was measured using an integrating sphere setup (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary S5</xref>). The angle of incidence is set to 6 ± 1 degrees to prevent the specular reflection from escaping the sphere.

First, crosscuts along wavelength axis show a clear peak in EQE where equation <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">(2)</xref> is satisfied, corresponding to an ~1.7 and ~1.5 enhancement for devices with <italic>p</italic> = 400 and 500 nm pitches, respectively (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3g,i</xref>). <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3i</xref> clearly shows coupling to both the TE<sub>0</sub> and TM<sub>0</sub> modes at different angles of incidence. Second, crosscuts along angle axis (θ = 6 degrees) show small but clear shoulders on the rapidly decaying background signal above the absorption edge (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3f,h</xref>, left axes). Third, the spectral position of the enhanced EQE shows good agreement with reflection minima, demonstrating a concomitant increase in absorption.

Concurrent to the observation of direct evidence for engineered light trapping, the NW networks geometries used in this work resulted into an overall decrease in photocurrent and thereby power conversion efficiency. The net increase in photocurrent as a result of light scattering and trapping is counteracted by a larger increase in reflection and absorption losses. These losses can be minimized by further reducing the NW width. As shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>, reducing the NW width from the 65 nm used in this work to 30 – 40 nm will significantly increase the transmission.

A supercontinuum laser (Fianium SC400–4) was attenuated using a glass wedge and a ND 2.0 filter, after which it is focused by a f = 200 mm lens onto the samples. The samples are mounted in front of an integrating sphere (LabSphere). The transmitted light is collected from the sphere using a multi-mode collection fiber and fed into a spectrometer (Acton SpectraPro 300i) equipped with a Si CCD (Roper Scientific 7344–0001, cooled to −45 °C). The measured spectral range was 400 – 964 nm. Each reported spectrum is an accumulation of 250 spectra, each with 100 ms accumulation time. The spectra were normalized to the transmission through the bare glass, right next to the NWs/ITO on the same sample. The total reflection measurements on the completed devices were performed with the same settings. Here, a silver mirror is used as a reference.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Sheet resistance measurements</title><p>The sheet resistance is determined from four-point probe measurements. For the NW networks, two probes were positioned on each contact pad. For the ITO the standard procedure using four equally spaced probes (spacing 1 mm) was used. IV-curves were measured with micro-positioning probes connected to a source meter (Agilent B2902A) by applying current (−10 to 10 mA, in 101 steps) through the samples using the outer probes and measuring the induced voltage with the inner probes. The sheet resistance is found from a linear fit through the data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Solar cell fabrication</title><p>ITO-coated glass substrates (200 nm thick ITO, Naranjo substrates) were cleaned by sonicating in acetone and soap-water followed by rinsing with normal water and sonicating in 2-propanol for few minutes. Silver nanowire substrates were cleaned only by mild rinsing in isopropanol to remove dust particles and were blow-dried using nitrogen.</p><p>A commercial formulation of high conductivity poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), PH1000 was mixed with 5 wt% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to enhance its conductivity and 0.2 wt% fluorosurfactant Zonyl FS-300 to facilitate wetting. The mixture was sonicated for 30 mins. This PEDOT:PSS formulation was then spin coated on top of ITO-coated substrates and Ag-nanowire-coated substrate at 6000 rpm to obtain a 30 nm thick film.</p><p>P3HT (&gt;98% head to tail, <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> = 54,000–75,000 g mol−1, Plextronics, purchased from Aldrich) and PCBM (&gt;99%, Solenne BV) in 1:1 weight ratio were dissolved in ortho-dichlorobenzene (<italic>o</italic>-DCB, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) at a concentration of 40 mg/mL. The polymer solution was stirred overnight at 70 °C and was then filtered using a 1 μm-pore filter. The polymer was spin coated inside a nitrogen filled glovebox at 700 rpm to obtain a 220–230 nm thick film. Substrates were subsequently annealed inside a glovebox at 110 °C for 30 mins.</p><p>To complete the devices, 1 nm LiF, 100 nm Al and 500 nm Ag were evaporated using a circular shaped shadow mask (diameter = 1.9 mm). The thickness of all layers was measured using Veeco Dektak 150 Surface Profiler.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Solar cell characterization</title><p>Current vs. voltage curves (I−V) were measured under simulated solar light (100 mW cm<sup>−2</sup>) from a tungsten–halogen lamp filtered by a Schott GG385 UV filter and a Hoya LB120 daylight filter using a Keithley 2400 source meter. The voltage range was −2 to 2 V. The short-circuit current density (<italic>J</italic><sub><italic>SC</italic></sub>) was determined from the EQE data by multiplying with the AM1.5G solar spectrum and integration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>.</p><p>EQE measurements were performed in a homebuilt set-up, with the devices kept in a nitrogen filled box and illuminated through an aperture of 1 mm diameter. Mechanically modulated (Chopper, Stanford Research, SR 540) monochromatic (Monochromator, Oriel, Cornerstone 130) light from a 50 W tungsten halogen lamp (Osram 64610) was used as probe light. A calibrated Si photodiode was used for the reference spectrum. The response was recorded as the voltage using a current preamplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR570) connected to lock-in amplifier (Stanford Research Systems, SR830).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Angle-resolved EQE measurements</title><p>A supercontinuum laser (Fianium, SC400-4) and a home-built prism-based monochromator were used to obtain fiber-coupled (multimode) monochromatic illumination (1.5 – 5.5 nm bandwidth, 57 – 65 μW). After the outcoupler, a 50 – 50 beam splitter was used to direct half of the power to a calibrated power meter (Thorlabs PM300) and half through a f = 200 mm lens onto the sample. The sample is mounted in the same nitrogen-filled box onto an automated rotation stage (HUBER 420–10724) and the generated photocurrent is measured by a source meter (Keithley 2612). In the experiment, the wavelength was scanned from 650 – 850 nm in steps of 5 nm. For each wavelength, the angle of incidence was scanned from 0 – 45 degrees in steps of 0.5 degrees. The measured photocurrent values are the average over 10 measurement points.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: van de Groep, J. <italic>et al</italic>.
