In the near term, this implies a better understanding of context-specific challenges in integrating sustainability with climate policies during the designing, planning, implementation and financing stages. Through a review of selected studies across regions, this paper draws out conclusions focussing on mitigation–sustainable development goal (SDG) trade-offs, with implications on costs and equity for different development contexts. Studies show that trade-offs depend on how the option is implemented and at what scale; mitigation options such as afforestation, biomass production and digitalisation are examples of this. Some options could also result in significant adverse environmental impacts as in the case of battery waste and raw material resources for electric vehicle (EV) or air pollution associated with compact urban development. We find the most important factors influencing equity include unequal access (e.g. urban green spaces and public transportation), high costs (e.g. EV) and financial constraints. Major knowledge gaps include (i) limited empirical evidence of SDG-related trade-offs associated with scaling up mitigation options, (ii) limited understanding of the extent to which benefits are experienced by different groups, (iii) an understanding of the extent to which local context was considered when assessing mitigation–SDG interaction, including the engagement of stakeholders and (iv) synergies and trade-offs associated with cross-sectoral policies. The paper recommends ex-post analysis of detailed and place-based cases that document how synergies and trade-offs emerged and how these were addressed.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>SDGs</kwd><kwd>Synergies</kwd><kwd>Trade-offs</kwd><kwd>Climate change mitigation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Technical University of Denmark</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>17</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/11625_2023_Article_1322.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Management</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Climate Change Management and Policy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Economics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Landscape Ecology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Sustainable Development</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Public Health</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Earth and Environmental Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">To limit global warming in line with the Paris agreement requires rapid and very wide global participation in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, and this can only be achieved if climate policies are embedded in a broader sustainable development policy framework (UNFCCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2015</xref>; IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2022a</xref>). In practice, it means that GHG emission reduction policies have to align- or at least not counteract sustainable development-related policy goals. A myriad of topics emerges from this challenge including the need for integrated assessment of several policy objectives for mitigation options and issues related to the planning, implementation and financing of integrated sustainability and climate policies.</p><p id="Par3">Mitigation is critical to sustainable development, and mitigation actions can deliver a range of sustainable development outcomes. At the same time, mitigation policies could entail trade-offs with some development objectives as the ones included in the UN2030 agenda for sustainable development including 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) (United Nations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2015</xref>). Chapter 17 and Figure SPM.8 of IPCCs WGIII report included a qualitative mapping of potential synergies and trade-offs between the SDGs and mitigation options based on inputs from the sectoral chapters (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2022a</xref>; Denton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2022</xref>). Chapter 3 of the same report (Riahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2022</xref>) included a similar assessment based on global and national integrated assessment models. A key message from these assessments is that there are many synergies between mitigation options and SDGs, few trade-offs, and in a number of cases, <italic>both synergies and trade-offs</italic>. In this paper, we use ‘mixed evidence’ to refer to the interactions that show (i) both synergies and trade-offs and (ii) trade-offs<italic>.</italic></p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Sectoral mitigation options and their interlinkages with SDGs</title><p id="Par4">The sectoral assessment of synergies and trade-offs between mitigation options and meeting the SDGs in Denton et al.

The same is the case for hydropower due to land use conflicts and impact on fisheries. Potential trade-offs in relation to SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) can occur due to high water consumption for some options. Rivalry about water resources could emerge from bioenergy crops and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), as well as from cooling water demand from various power supply options.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Synergies and trade-offs between mitigation options and the SDGs.

The assessment of the AFOLU mitigation options emphasises that the synergies and trade-offs are very context- and scale-dependent, depending on how measures are carried out, for example, in relation to the enhanced production of renewables needed to replace fossil fuel-based products. Trade-offs are particularly a risk with large-scale applications of afforestation projects, bioenergy crops and other land-consuming activities, and especially, if not adapted to local circumstances, there are adverse implications for food security, livelihoods and biodiversity.</p><p id="Par7">In urban areas, several mitigation options have synergies with the SDGs and in a few cases can result in mixed evidence (44 out of 171 interactions), depending on the specific urban context (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Actions taken in the building sector can have mixed evidence such as the economic impacts in the energy sector associated with reduced energy demand and lower energy prices, and with energy-efficiency investments, and the fostering of innovation and improvements in labour productivity.</p><p id="Par8">The mitigation options in the transportation sector are assessed as having synergies with SDG 1 (no poverty) and SDG 3 (good health and wellbeing) mainly due to improved air quality, with exceptions in relation to pollution from biofuels and the risks of traffic accidents. Synergies are also assessed in relation to SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure). 10 out of 58 interactions between mitigation options and SDGs show mixed evidence. There may be potential trade-offs with SDG 2 (zero hunger) in the transportation sector if the production of biofuels takes land away from food production (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">In the industrial sector, energy efficiency, material recycling and electrification create increased employment and business opportunities related to SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), but material-efficiency improvements could reduce tax revenues. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) applied in industry can increase emissions of some air pollutants such as particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and ammonia, and production costs could increase due to higher energy consumption (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). 7 out of 31 interactions in this sector show mixed evidence<italic>.</italic></p><p id="Par10">The impacts on SDGs of mitigation scenarios were assessed by Chapter 3 of IPCC WGIII (Riahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2022</xref>) based on integrated assessment models implemented at global and regional scales. Though several synergies were found, it was also highlighted that limiting global warming to 1.5 °C could imply trade-offs in terms of increasing food prices, population at risk of hunger and population relying on solid fuels. The assessment also highlighted that mineral resources could be under pressure and that a habitat loss could potentially emerge if mitigation policies were carried out narrowly and not integrated with sustainable development policies. For instance, bioenergy demand should be reconciled with food, water, biodiversity and competition for land and should be supported by a range of policies and technologies related to agricultural intensification, dietary changes, open markets, biotechnology and other options to avoid trade-offs. The importance of policies to support the capture of SDG synergies with mitigation policies is also emphasised by Cohen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2021</xref>) based on a mapping of SDG relationships with mitigation options in countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which concluded that it could be very beneficial to further link SDGs and mitigation policies.</p><p id="Par11">Nerini et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>) reviewed synergies between climate action and 134 targets across all SDGs and concluded that there are approximately four times more synergies than trade-offs (only 34 targets across 12 SDGs) between climate action and the delivery of the SDGs. Those trade-offs nevertheless have the potential to block climate action—or conversely other development gains making the case for strong governance structures and policy coordination. Similar observation can be made using the open access data behind the Figure SPM.8 of IPCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2022a</xref>). It can be observed that 275 out of 397 interactions identified in the underlying studies reviewed are related to synergies, and 119 out of 397 interactions show mixed evidence (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Existing literature discusses synergies at a great length but misses out on the other two interactions both synergies and trade-offs, and only trade-offs—which means missing out on 30% of the interactions. The sectoral studies and the review of the integrated assessment models for global, regional or national scenarios by IPCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2022a</xref>), Cohen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2021</xref>) and Nerini et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>) reach similar conclusions despite different scaling focus and methodological approaches.</p><p id="Par12">Existing literature focuses on approaches or methodologies to understand mitigation–SDG linkages, and assessment of interactions with national and sectoral policies (Nerini et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>; Di Lucia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2022</xref>; Cohen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2021</xref>). There is, however, limited literature that does an in-depth analysis of identifying and understanding trade-offs as a basis for understanding how those can be resolved or minimised through integrated policies, which also partly explain the small share of trade-offs in interactions identified in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. There are methodological challenges to understanding trade-offs, especially how these manifest in different contexts, what actions were taken to address these and whether these were successful. A key missing aspect in the existing literature on trade-offs is how the mitigation interventions impact equity and how this is related to implementation policies. Costs and finance are also central in relation to implementation policies in order to capture synergies and avoid trade-offs between mitigation options and SDGs, but these are only sparsely addressed in the literature on mitigation–SDG linkages. This paper, therefore, delves deeper into understanding the interactions between equity, finance, costs and implementation challenges, in relation to mitigation options, which could have synergies as well as trade-offs.</p><p id="Par13">The paper reviews studies that focus on potential trade-offs between mitigation and SDGs, and how these can be overcome in policy design and implementation. Among the several trade-offs evident in the literature, equity impacts of climate actions are important in relation to policy implementation. For example, earlier studies have shown that climate action can enable and reinforce building prosperous, equal and peaceful societies, and equity is an important component in building strong, functioning and capable institutions, and is closely related to sustainable development aspects such as poverty reduction, welfare and jobs (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>). However, climate action can also exacerbate equity issues if improperly implemented (Roy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2022</xref>). Bowen et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2017</xref>) highlight that win–win in terms of only synergies are difficult to achieve and trade-offs related to equity, justice and fairness are important to address as part of an integrated approach to implementation. Howe et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2014</xref>) in a review of over 1000 case studies on ecosystem services and trade-offs show significant gaps in the literature, including a limited geographic distribution of case studies and highlight the importance of considering the reasons for the trade-offs.</p><p id="Par14">In this backdrop, this paper contributes to the literature in two key aspects: (1) examines carefully selected mitigation interventions and their trade-offs with SDGs while specifically understanding their impacts on equity; and (2) highlights key issues related to policy implementation matters with a specific focus on how studies have assessed equity, costs and stakeholder perspectives in relation to implementation and policy coordination issues for a number of sectoral mitigation options. By doing so, the paper moves the knowledge closer to how options in practice can be implemented.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><p id="Par15">Our starting point is the IPCC AR6 categorisation of sectoral mitigation options and SDG interlinkages assessed in IPCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2022a</xref>). We focus on selected mitigation options for a more detailed examination based on the following three main vetting criteria: (i) options where mixed evidence (only trade-offs or both synergies and trade-offs) were identified in IPCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2022a</xref>); (ii) case studies where the potential implementation of specific mitigation options was addressed and where aspects of trade-offs related to equity, costs and finance were included; and (iii) studies from diverse contexts and countries at different development stages.</p><p id="Par16">A focussed literature search is conducted based on the sectors and mitigation options included in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> that match the aforementioned vetting criteria, using a combination of search terms including the name of options, “SDG” and “equity”. Equity is here defined as the principle of being fair and impartial, and a basis for understanding how the impacts and responses to climate change, including costs and benefits, are distributed in and by society in more or less equal ways in accordance with the IPCC Glossary (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2022b</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">The resultant studies were then filtered to identify mitigation options and related studies which included a detailed in-depth discussion of the mitigation option and its synergies and trade-offs with SDGs. Studies which demonstrate mixed evidence were included. After reading the articles, we shortlisted key studies for a particular option which would include an in-depth discussion of implementation challenges and equity issues. Detailed summaries were recorded from each study for synergies and trade-offs, costs and equity. Finally, we looked for and reported implementation—the conditions necessary for implementation but more importantly if there was evidence of or recommendations on enabling conditions that could affect the implementation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sectoral assessment</title><p id="Par18">Based on the review, we identified the following mitigation options for more in-depth review in the paper: afforestation and biomass production in the AFOLU sector; electric vehicles (EVs) and public transport in the transportation sector; urban green areas and planning in the urban systems sector; electrification with renewable energy in the industry sector; and digitalisation as a cross-sectoral option. For each sector with extended assessment, we both include our own assessment and the results from other assessments of these sectors.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>AFOLU</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Afforestation</title><p id="Par19">Several synergies with SDGs have been identified (IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2022a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">b</xref>) relating to afforestation in the literature: for example, income to forest community/villagers (SDG 1), improved regional soil quality (SDG 2), health benefits due to cleaner air (SDG 3), improved quality and availability of water (SDG 6), potential cooling effects in surrounding cities (SDG 11), may provide shelter from predators and food for life below water (SDG 14) and beneficial for biodiversity (SDG 15) (Denton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2022</xref>; Nabuurs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2022</xref>). However, very-large-scale afforestation has trade-offs with SDGs due to increased competition with agricultural land, leading to increased food prices affecting food security (SDG 2) (Denton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2022</xref>; Kreidenweis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par20">The synergies and trade-offs vary with the species of trees used, the scale of implementation and the region of implementation (Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2021</xref>; Peprah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2017</xref>). Our literature review helped in identifying some real-life examples of how implementing afforestation projects created opportunities and challenges. Kim et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2021</xref>) reported four afforestation projects, one in South Korea and three others funded by South Korea in other countries: China, Mongolia and Kazakhstan. These projects provided several region-specific ancillary benefits, thereby increasing regional socioeconomic resilience such as recruiting local low-income individuals, and eco-refugees, opening education centres and providing forestry-related education and training. The major challenge identified is inadequate data collection that would help in quantitative analysis. In 2014, financial incentives (such as establishment expenditure, maintenance premium and afforestation premium) were introduced in Poland to encourage afforestation in low-yield agricultural farmland which is under 10 ha (Źróbek-Różańska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2014</xref>). However, farmers do not always prefer investing in afforestation as this is a long-term investment that could potentially be impacted by various uncertainties (e.g. fire) or changes in forest policy. They tend to make investment decisions by weighing an investment in afforestation vs in other assets (like the real estate market) because of profitability.</p><p id="Par21">A study in Ghana (Peprah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2017</xref>) found that the success of afforestation (in terms of redeeming land degradation) depends on the species of plant used in swamplands.

Dasgupta and Srikanth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2021</xref>) reported that in India, the intergovernmental fiscal transfers for forests by indirectly incentivising the subnational entities for maintaining land under forests have not resulted in desired outcomes as the social, cultural and economic values for communities were not incorporated. Therefore, the paper recommended the involvement of forest communities in such projects and creating a knowledge pool from existing projects which can be used to implement such international policies around the world.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Biomass production</title><p id="Par22">In the context of climate and energy policies, researchers and policymakers (e.g. in India and Chile) are advocating a circular economy.

However, if done at a larger scale, and without considering local circumstances, it can lead to competition with land resources and can have an adverse impact on food security (increasing food prices), biodiversity and livelihoods (Humpenöder et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>; IPCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2022a</xref>).

Other concerns shared by the farm owners include no guaranteed collection system, no organised biomass transport system to buyers and lack of knowledge/information about innovative ways of using biomass for energy.

This can also increase investment cost of crop establishment and biomass transportation cost. Scenario analysis, using global land use models, suggests that complementary measures are needed to reduce trade-offs (such as deforestation, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from land use change, nitrogen losses, unsustainable water withdrawals and food prices) arising from large-scale biomass production. Such complementary measures include forest and water protection schemes, agricultural intensification and improved fertilisation efficiency (Humpenöder et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par25">A recent study (Kevser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2022</xref>) explored the long-term relationship among biomass energy investment, financial development and economic growth in 15 African and Asian countries (Cameroon, Democratic Congo, Tanzania, Nigeria, Haiti, Nepal, Togo, Mozambique, Ivory Coast, Niger, Kenya, Cambodia, Myanmar, Zimbabwe and Republic of Congo) and found that investment in biomass energy can increase economic growth and financial development. In line with these findings, the paper recommended creating new energy policies to support biomass investment. In India, around 60% of the land is under agriculture (World Bank Data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2022</xref>). Therefore, massive agricultural residues are produced. However, the primary residues are used as fertiliser and animal feed, but the secondary residues can be used as biomass feedstock for power generation. Kumar et al.

Several studies that have assessed the health impacts of mitigation policies concluded that large benefits could be generated by reduced air pollution (SDG 3), particularly in urban areas from using cleaner energy technologies and fuels (Riahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2022</xref>), creation of jobs associated with EV supply chain and associated infrastructure building (SDG 8), reducing oil import dependence in some contexts and decarbonisation in the long term from low-emission electricity production (SDG 7) (Dhar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>; Jaramillo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2022</xref>). Electric vehicle deployment has advanced in several countries and is increasing in others. Our literature review shows that in countries/regions where upscaling (“diffusion” stage of transition) is already taking place, the challenges are very different from the countries/regions where EV is still in the “emergence” stage.</p><p id="Par28">In US cities where the “diffusion” of EVs is taking place, the main challenges faced are high upfront costs, range anxiety and inadequate charging stations. Romero-Lankao et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2022</xref>) highlight that EV diffusion generates a rural–urban divide in the US as the wealthier population is likely to have both plug-in and non-plug-in hybrid EVs, and more access to charging stations in cities, while for the rural/ex-urban population, the detrimental factors are the high upfront cost of plug-in EVs, less access to charging infrastructure and range anxiety as people have to travel longer distances. Hardman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2021</xref>) highlight that EV charging infrastructure is not equitably dispersed and more low-cost charging stations are needed in lower income residential areas. In addition, incentives provided do not incorporate equity aspects in their design, as sometimes more incentives are given to higher income buyers. Sheldon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2022</xref>) found that in the USA, lower income households (annual income &lt; 25,000 USD) may have to spend more than 50% of their household budget on vehicle ownership costs, including fuel, maintenance, insurance and purchase costs, while households with annual income &gt; 150,000 USD may have to spend less than 10%. In the USA, most buyers purchase used EVs due to the high price. Hardman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2021</xref>) indicated that even new EVs cannot create an ample supply to provide affordable used vehicles. Risk of battery pack failures also acts as a concern for poor households to buy EVs. Whether EVs are cost saving is still a debate because new studies argue that the high upfront cost may not get partially offset by fuel cost savings (Sheldon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par29">In countries where “emergence” of EV is taking place, policies are playing a key role. Multiple initiatives are being taken by central and state governments in India and Nepal to create a market for EVs, for example, road tax exemptions, reduced interest on loans for EVs and amendments to existing laws (e.g. Building Bye-Laws, 2016 in India) to allow charging stations in private and commercial buildings (Singh-Patyal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2021</xref>). However, there are many technology-, infrastructure- and societal acceptance-related challenges identified in the literature (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). For example, on the technology side—performance (battery range), recharge time and safety (like explosion due to overcharging and heating) are the key concerns. Charging infrastructure located far from home, concerns over unavailability of reliable electricity and power quality in case of in-home charging infrastructure are major concerns for potential EV purchasers. In India, subsidies on EVs have less impact on consumers, and they are more interested to know about the future policy roadmap for EVs and availability of post-purchase maintenance support, and are sceptic about performance efficiency (Goel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2021</xref>; Adhikari et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>). Other concerns include high upfront cost, resale value (due to uncertainty over life of batteries) and lack of awareness (unfamiliar with latest technology, lack of understanding about monetary return). At the national level, the concern is more about availability of rare-earth materials (lithium, nickel, cobalt and many other subcomponents) necessary to sustain the EV market and concerns over high import dependency (Dall-Orsoletta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>). Moreover, there are high chances of increasing inequality across regions for import and export because for EVs, Europe dominates the market, whereas for batteries, Asia is the largest exporter (Dall-Orsoletta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Implications of transport actions (EVs and public transport) SDGs, costs, equity and implementation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Aspects</p></th><th align="left"><p>Electric vehicles</p></th><th align="left"><p>Public transport</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Equity</p></td><td align="left"><p>EVs upfront costs and charging infrastructure (not equitably dispersed) (Romero-Lankao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2022</xref>; Sheldon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2022</xref>)</p><p>Jobs, health and emission related issues in lithium- and cobalt-rich countries (Dall-Orsoletta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>)</p><p>Export–import inequality (Dall-Orsoletta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>)</p><p>Rural–urban divide (Dall-Orsoletta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>)</p><p>Incentives for electric vehicles do not incorporate equity in their design (Hardman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2021</xref>)</p></td><td align="left"><p>High fares or unequal access for some sections of society (Ghosh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2022</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2022</xref>; Gössling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>)</p><p>Systems favouring private modes can result in excluding certain populations from equal access to mobility (Gössling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>)</p><p>Can lead to an increase in spatial division across economic lines (Seo and Nam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2019</xref>)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Implementation</p></td><td align="left"><p>Battery disposal–recycling is needed (Dall-Orsoletta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>)</p><p>Equity issue can be solved by user-centric strategies (Romero-Lankao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2022</xref>)</p><p>Policymakers may provide purchase-based incentives ( Singh-Patyal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2021</xref>)</p><p>Investment in infrastructure is needed (Jaramillo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2022</xref>)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Need to incorporate equity dimension in the transport policy framework to account for differentiated transport needs (Ghosh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2022</xref>; Roy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2021</xref>)</p><p>Public transportation policies should consider the residential location patterns of different socioeconomic classes (Gössling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Costs</p></td><td align="left"><p>High upfront cost for buyers</p><p>New/repurposed infrastructure cost</p></td><td align="left"><p>Low to medium (depends on the system and the capacity)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>SDGs (trade-offs are indicated)</p></td><td align="left"><p>SDG 11: EVs still consume a considerable amount of energy and contribute to other external effects such as congestion (Langbroek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR01">2017</xref>)</p><p>SDG 12: material resources and disposal issues for EV batteries (Asokan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2023</xref>)</p></td><td align="left"><p>SDG 11: trade-off between public transportation accessibility and housing size in Seoul, Korea (Seo and Nam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2019</xref>)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par30">Existing literature does point out many solutions to reduce the challenges such as providing a public charging system, improving technology to reduce range anxiety, removing knowledge barriers and providing warranties for used PEV batteries.

For example, initial costs of electric melting/heating furnaces and forklifts are high. In addition, the user may need to pay for augmenting the power connection infrastructure and make space available for additional equipment such as the transformers and panels. This barrier is especially relevant for the large number of small-scale industries who lack investment capital and access to commercial means of finance. This barrier can be overcome by making soft loans available, lowering the cost for power delivery, simplifying the approval process and standardising the required equipment and their specifications.</p><p id="Par45">Bataille (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>) highlights that a combination of policy packages will be required to decarbonise the industry sector, and these would have to differ by the capacity of countries, regional capacities, resources and other circumstances while also recognising the acceptance of stakeholders implementing these.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Digitalisation</title><p id="Par46">Digitalisation, circular economy and sharing economy are significant trends that will affect sustainability in the near future with implications in the medium and long term. Digitalisation can improve services, enhance efficiency and contribute to gender equality (Pérez-Martínez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2023</xref>). Mondejar et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2021</xref>) show that digitalisation can assist in attaining SDGs in different sectors such as (i) food–water–energy nexus, (ii) industry, (iii) citizens’ health and wellbeing and (iv) climate change and biodiversity protection. For instance, open-source tools that provide information on ecosystem services and trade-offs can help inform local decisions (Hamel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2021</xref>). Digitalisation could also potentially reduce emissions; however, so far, these have made limited contributions to climate change mitigation (Creutzig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par47">A comprehensive and systematic country-based analysis of the relationship between digitalisation and sustainability indicators found strong synergies with SDGs 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 16; medium positive correlation with SDGs 2, 8 and 11; and weak correlation with SDGs 5, 10 and 17 (Pérez-Martínez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2023</xref>). The study also finds that digitalisation indicators have a notable trade-off with SDGs 12 and 13 mainly due to air quality emissions related to imports and production, energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, generation of waste including e-waste, overexploitation of resources and impacts on biodiversity. Jones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2018</xref>) attributes 0.3% of the global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to data centres, and the entire Information and Communication Technology (ICT) ecosystem including personal devices, phone-networks and televisions could contribute over 2% of global emissions. Lange et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2020</xref>) show that despite the energy-efficiency effects, digitalisation in fact causes an increase in energy consumption through direct effects as well as indirect effects of economic growth and better access to services (Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Creutzig et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2022</xref>) assess impacts of digitalisation on the planetary scale and conclude that in addition to energy consumption and other direct environmental impacts, the indirect and systemic effects of digitalisation are more profoundly reshaping the relationship between humans, the technical landscape and the planet.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Implications of digitalisation on SDGs, costs, equity and implementation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Aspect</p></th><th align="left"><p>Digitalisation</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Equity</p></td><td align="left"><p>Unequal internet access for countries at different income levels and for different household income levels, can imply that digitalisation excludes some groups from services and markets (IIASA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Implementation</p></td><td align="left"><p>Structural obstacles need to be acknowledged and adequately managed (Pérez-Martínez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2023</xref>)</p><p>Ensuring responsible digitalisation through design, access and system complexity (Metta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2022</xref>)</p><p>International cooperation to avoid degradation of resources; appropriate choice of computing architecture and design and management of institutions (Creutzig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2022</xref>)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Costs</p></td><td align="left"><p>High costs of implementing wide access to the internet (IIASA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>SDGs (trade-offs are indicated)</p></td><td align="left"><p>SDG 3: trade-off between digitalisation and air quality emissions (Pérez-Martínez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2023</xref>)</p><p>SDG 13: energy-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (Jones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2018</xref>)</p><p>SDG 12: waste generation (Pérez-Martínez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2023</xref>)</p><p>SDGs 7 and 8: increase in energy consumption as a result of direct impacts as well as through economic growth (Lange et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2020</xref>)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par48">Two recent global assessments (IIASA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2019</xref>; Denton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2022</xref>) concluded that efficiency improvements, reduced resource consumption and new services can support the SDGs, but there were challenges, including in relation to equity, especially low level of access to technologies faced by the least developed and developing countries. The necessary preconditions for successful digital transformation include prosperity, social inclusion, environmental sustainability, protection of jobs and good governance of sustainability transitions. Digitalisation in the manufacturing sector could also provide a comparative advantage to developed countries due to the falling importance of labour costs, while the barriers to emerging economies seeking to enter global markets could accordingly be increased.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Discussion on findings and gaps in the research</title><p id="Par49">The paper takes a deeper dive into the literature on SDG trade-offs and synergies with mitigation actions and goes into further details in assessing mitigation options in cases where there can be mixed evidence with a specific focus on equity, costs, finance and implementation challenges as a supplement to the assessment included in IPCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2022a</xref>). Through evidence from reviews and case studies across a variety of contexts globally, we explore these synergies and trade-offs—specifically, what causes these trade-offs and challenges and what considerations should be taken to reduce or minimise and to avoid trade-offs, as these can act as a barrier to policy implementation. The sectoral studies included in this paper for in-depth analysis identified major barriers in relation to implementation including access to finance as well as costs associated with introducing new technologies in the transportation sector and with new production systems in industry. Regulatory frameworks and integration in comprehensive urban planning were also identified as major implementation barriers. In addition, equity could be at stake due to high costs and limited accessibility to urban green spaces, EVs, and technology access particularly for developing countries or low-income groups within countries.</p><p id="Par50">We find that despite a large number of studies identifying synergies between mitigation actions and SDGs, few studies in effect included an assessment of trade-offs. This is in line with findings from other studies, which show a gap in empirical studies on trade-offs, especially in the global South (Sharifi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2020</xref>; Bataille <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>). It is important to recognise that the identification of few trade-offs in studies do not imply that significant trade-offs do not exist despite the high number of studies indicating the potential of mitigation options to deliver synergies on a number of SDGs. We caution against interpreting this result as a guarantee that SDG synergies can always be achieved by implementing specific mitigations options. Here, equity is important, and synergies can vary spatially between countries or even within a city or between groups. At a global level, issues of equity include finance and technology access, for example, in relation to industrial decarbonisation options and digitalisation between countries at different development levels. Some interventions (e.g. digitalisation, public transport and urban green spaces) can deliver synergies with a range of SDGs, but also could potentially increase inequity. These issues arise mainly because of lack of universal access, for example, access to, raw materials, technology and finance among and within countries. At a more local level, equity issues arise as a result of unequal access to infrastructure (e.g. electric vehicle, public transport and urban green spaces). Reckien et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2016</xref>) identify three dimensions of equity associated with urban climate actions: (i) contextual, (ii) process oriented and (iii) outcome based. The studies identified in the paper do not explicitly address these. For example, there is very limited information on whether and to what extent stakeholders were consulted and the outcomes of such a process.</p><p id="Par51">The direction of interactions (synergies or trade-offs) between mitigation options and SDGs greatly depends on how the measure is adopted locally and at what cost and scale, for example, in the case of afforestation and biofuels - the direction of interaction changes from synergies to trade-offs when applied at scale and there is strong rivalry about, for example, land resources (e.g. afforestation). A general conclusion we found for the AFOLU sector is that before implementing large-scale biomass production/afforestation, it is important to develop policies for regulating trade-offs and negative externalities.</p><p id="Par52">Some mega trends such as digitalisation are already altering patterns of housing, work, travel, consumption and production and have a potential to reduce emissions and improve the wellbeing of humanity. However, digitalisation could also result in increased energy consumption and material consumption and create an unequal world with higher emissions and disadvantaged poorer countries and populations, which might be excluded from international markets due to limited digitalisation. Digitalisation needs to be used and promoted wisely including decisions around computing and institutions to manage data (Creutzig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2022</xref>). However, digitalisation is a relatively recent development, and more studies are needed to fully understand its impacts on society.</p><p id="Par53">Some measures are closely linked to others and can potentially provide much higher benefits if jointly implemented (e.g. electric vehicles, public transport and urban planning); however, the literature on combined effects is scarce, and capturing these synergies and avoiding/ minimising trade-offs can call for complex cross-sectoral implementation policies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par54">While literature on climate action and SDG interlinkages is growing rapidly, there are few robust studies which address implementation aspects and the role of trade-offs in relation to equity, costs, finance, infrastructure and technology access. While equity is a critical enabler of sustainable development, many interventions do not make any impact on improving the status quo and in some cases could lead to more adverse outcomes. We also find that even where synergies are shown, it is not necessary that these benefit the most disadvantaged groups. We, therefore, call for a careful interpretation of SDG synergies and more detailed studies of how trade-offs could show up and be coped with in practical policy implementation.</p><p id="Par55">Results of this study contribute to the existing knowledge on the extent to which trade-offs between mitigation options and the SDGs could act as implementation challenges and based on this recognises that there is a need to go more into details than the currently available studies on how mitigation options potentially could be aligned with meeting the SDGs and to be more context specific on policy implementation rather than what can be addressed in large-scale global and regional modelling studies. Locally based studies could be important in designing implementation policies and removing barriers in terms of costs, finance and equity. Future research needs include more detailed and place-based cases and should also move further beyond assessments of implementation options to review of actual experiences with implementation of mitigation options and how synergies and trade-offs have emerged and been addressed. Results from such studies could better inform our understanding of how to modify local actions, how to capture synergies between mitigation options and SDGs and resolve/ minimise trade-offs.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Open access funding provided by Royal Danish Library.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>This paper does not generate any quantitative data.
