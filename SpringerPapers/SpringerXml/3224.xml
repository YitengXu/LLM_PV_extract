However, system integration barriers as well as system balancing costs have not been quantified yet. Here we develop a bottom-up model to test the grid accommodation capabilities and design the optimal investment plans for offshore wind power considering resource distributions, hourly power system simulations, and transmission/storage/hydrogen investments. Results indicate that grid integration barriers exist currently at the provincial level. For 2030, optimized offshore wind investment levels should be doubled compared with current government plans, and provincial allocations should be significantly improved considering both resource quality and grid conditions. For 2050, offshore wind capacity in China could reach as high as 1500 GW, prompting a paradigm shift in national transmission structure, favoring long-term storage in the energy portfolio, enabling green hydrogen production in coastal demand centers, resulting in the world’s largest wind power market.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Offshore wind power may play a key role in decarbonising energy supplies.

China, responsible for 30% of global anthropogenic emissions in 2019<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, committed recently to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 if not sooner<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Northern inland China hosts major wind and solar resources and has been the beneficiary over recent years in important related investments. Significant economic activity and population are concentrated, however, in the eastern, coastal, area of the country. Coastal and neighboring provinces, accounting for only 30% of the land mass in China, host 76% of the national population and are responsible for 72% of total national power consumption and for 70% of total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> released from the region surpasses that from the entire US, and is equivalent to twice that from the EU<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. How to transition away from the fossil fuel-based energy infrastructure in this coastal area represents not only the core challenge for ambitions to achieve carbon neutrality in China, but also a signature target for plans to achieve GHG mitigation on a larger global scale.</p><p id="Par4">Decarbonizing the economic center of China has faced significant difficulty reflecting the important imbalance geographically between energy consumption and the distribution of renewable resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. With superior wind conditions, northern China is host to 170 GW of onshore wind investment, accounting for over 80% of national and 30% of global wind commitments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Wind turbines installed in northern China have suffered however from significant curtailment in output particularly in winter due to low local power demand and limited grid flexibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Further expansion of wind investments inland is currently limited by a combination of technical and policy restrictions. Additionally, effectively all hydro resources in China are sited in the western region of the country<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and optimal conditions for solar installations are located in the northwest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.In the absence of local renewable energy sources, nuclear has been considered as the primary solution for decarbonizing the eastern, coastal, area of China. However, nuclear units are not only more expensive and slower to build than alternative sources of power, but also prompt concerns from the public with respect to safety. Construction of nuclear units has fallen behind the agenda promoted originally by the government, in part reflecting reactions to the events at Fukushima, compounded by concurrent unanticipated increases in cost.</p><p id="Par5">A rapid development of offshore wind power offers a promising solution to the challenge for decarbonization of coastal regions of China. The installed capacity of offshore wind power has increased by a factor of 15 in Europe over the last decade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. As a result, the world average levelized cost for related power has declined from 126 $/MWh in 2017 to 84 $/MWh in 2019<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Bid prices for offshore projects in the EU are now in the range of 40–50 $/MWh<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, competitive for the first time with coal-fired generators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Rights for development of 390 thousand acres of wind resources off the coast of Massachusetts, US, were auctioned at an historically record level of $405 million, greater than revenues raised for allocation of comparable acreage for exploration of opportunities for development of offshore oil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. China had less than 6 GW of offshore wind projects in total as of 2019<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, minor compared with investments in other renewable resources. The landscape however is rapidly changing in response to the ongoing reduction in projected costs. Current plans call for development of more than 130 GW of offshore wind in China over the coming decade (see provincial allocation in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, equivalent to five times the total of the current global commitment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Levelized cost, wind directions and development plan of Offshore wind power in mainland China.</title><p><bold>a</bold> provincial peak load and offshore wind levelized costs for mainland China; <bold>b</bold> wind roses at typical locations for offshore wind development, with each location indicated in <bold>a</bold>; <bold>c</bold> offshore wind installation statistics and national planned capacity for all coastal provinces. 2020Q4 plan was incorporated in the analyses.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2023_37536_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par6">Recent literature has focused on analyses of projected levelized costs for electricity supplied from offshore wind resources. Jansen et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> reported that auction prices for offshore wind projects in Europe have been competitive recently with prices for conventional power generation. Wiser et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> envisages an accelerated decline in offshore wind levelized costs via expert elicitation, projecting a decrease for fixed bottom installations of 35% in 2035 rising to 49% by 2050. Sherman et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> quantified the offshore wind physical resources and economics for China, highlighting the significance of the economic potential for the resource on the basis of anticipated levelized costs, and the importance of the contribution it could make to ongoing carbon neutrality planning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Davidson et al. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> conducted the first comprehensive offshore wind potential analyses in 2016. They provided detailed supply curves for both onshore and offshore wind with specific cost breakdowns. However, due to the significantly higher capital expenditures prevailing at that time, they restricted their attention to limited investments designed to minimize costs with an emphasis on commitments close to shore. System integration testing was conducted at a regional level rather than at a provincial scale using heuristic methods due to data limitations. To the best of our knowledge, few analyses have focused on opportunities for province-by-province grid integration at elevated levels of offshore investment awaiting perhaps guidance from the government on future prospects. Restrictions imposed by the government have been particularly important for onshore wind development in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Lacking systematic analyses for system simulation at an early stage of onshore wind development, major financial losses of $15 billion have been incurred due to curtailment of these resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Since March 2016, the Chinese government has suspended approval for new wind farms in provinces where annual wind curtailment rates have exceeded 20%. In June 2018, the curtailment threshold was tightened further from 20% to 5%, with the exception of relaxed thresholds for three wind rich provinces (15% for Xinjiang and Gansu, 8% for WIM). As a result, the growth rate of wind investment in the “three north” area has declined from an annual rate of over 25% in 2015 (15% in NE, 20% in NC and 40% in NW) to less than 3% in 2019<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Had a comprehensive grid integration study been carried out in advance of the earlier investments in onshore wind, it might have been possible to have avoided the major financial losses that occurred subsequently due to curtailment.</p><p id="Par7">Investment planning of renewables is receiving increased attention at the national level. The national government is committed to a mid-term target of 1200 GW of non-hydro renewable installations by 2030. In response, provincial governments have released investment agendas for onshore, offshore wind and solar PV, which aggregate to a total of 1228 GW (refer to Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S23</xref> for collected provincial plans), in line with the national commitment. However, no research has been carried out to test the effectiveness of current government plans, to search for an optimal investment portfolio for renewables in 2030 that could take account of the rapidly changing economics of offshore wind. The optimal provincial allocation of offshore investments, and the trade-offs between offshore and onshore wind have not yet been defined in terms of the long-term transition plan for 2050. Attention must be directed to defining the role offshore wind power can play in the goal for carbon neutrality, the paradigm shift in the national transmission network that will be required to adapt to the accelerated investment in these resources, and the coordinated deployment of long-term storage systems and P2G infrastructures that will be required as a complement.</p><p id="Par8">Here we present a high-resolution assessment model to conduct a system integration analysis designed to develop an optimal deployment plan for offshore wind power in China. The model combines a refined analysis of offshore wind resources and economics, considering the micro siting of wind farms with optimization of delivery systems, and simulations of hourly power system demands, identifying optimal plans for provincial investments in offshore installations, transmissions and storage. First, the physical characteristics and economics of offshore wind projects are analyzed for all possible locations off the coast of mainland China, using hourly meteorological data for the past 40 years available at a resolution of 50 × 50 km<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> in combination with bathymetric data at a resolution of 15 arc second<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Detailed cost models are developed for offshore wind projects considering turbines, foundations, convergence cables, offshore substations, submarine delivery cables and reactive power compensators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, allowing for cost variations reflecting differences in water depths and distances to shore. Second, hourly grid integration simulations are conducted for a full year at all possible onshore and offshore wind investment levels for all of the provinces in the coastal area and in the wind-rich “Three North” region. The simulations cover 32 provinces in China, include unit level information for over 3000 thermal units, incorporate comprehensive flexibility constraints (including ramping, minimum on-off times and minimal load bounds) and recognize all existing inter-provincial transmissions Third, the analysis further includes an optimal investment model for thermal units, non-hydro renewables, and for transmission and storage systems, intended to complement system investment planning for both 2030 and 2050. For 2030 investment planning, the effectiveness of current government strategy is tested, and an improved renewable investment portfolio is proposed, analyzing trade-offs among offshore wind, onshore counterparts and solar power. For 2050, the role of offshore wind power in the deep-decarbonized energy economy is evaluated, and associated requirements for national transmission infrastructures, long-term storage facilities and P2G developments are analyzed.</p><p id="Par9">The results indicate that at least 1000 GW of offshore wind capacity could already be available at a levelized cost below that for nuclear units in China. Under current power system conditions, grid integration barriers heavily restrict the deployment of onshore wind power in wind rich northern regions, although they are more economical than offshore counterparts. For 2030, the Chinese government has committed to 1200 GW of renewable investments, and the current provincial investment agenda highlights onshore wind (41%) and solar development (43%), complemented with a relatively small contribution from offshore wind (16%, see details in SI). Our optimized plan would double the offshore wind investment in 2030 and avoid the ineffective onshore wind projects in central and southern areas. Current provincial deployment plans for offshore wind are also largely improved, shifting part of the investment from Guangdong to provinces such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Our optimized plan could boost the national renewable penetration from 31.5% to 40%, at a cost lower than that anticipated in the current plan. For 2050, offshore wind capacity in China could reach as high as 1500 GW, constituting a major building-block for the carbon neutrality transition in China, promoting development of the world’s largest wind power market. In the meantime, it will prompt a paradigm shift in national transmission structure, favoring long-term storage in the energy portfolio, enabling green hydrogen production in coastal demand centers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Offshore wind resources and economics</title><p id="Par10">We first incorporate wind speed and direction data from NASA’s MERRA2 dataset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, a reanalysis product defining the hourly meteorological wind field with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degree latitude by 0.625 degree longitude.

Ocean areas with unsuitable characteristics (harbor areas, shipping routes, and environmental protection zones for example, see SI) were excluded in deriving these supply curve results.

In response to this national policy, provincial governments released investment agendas for onshore, offshore wind and solar PV for 2025 and 2030 (refer to Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S23</xref> and figure <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S33</xref> for details).

Interprovincial transmission facilities account for existing and recently approved or government planned transmission corridors, following assumptions of rigid DC transmission network operation. We did not allow for additional transmission expansion in the 2030 timeframe as approval and construction of interprovincial transmission projects require longer time periods. Deployment for storage systems accounts for lithium batteries and pumped hydro. Hourly simulations of all of the generators, inter-provincial transmissions and storage systems in all provinces for a full year are embedded in the investment model to better reflect the curtailment issue. A full set of flexibility constraints for thermal units, operation properties for hydro power stations, and the practical restrictions for CHP plants are incorporated in the “system integration model” (see details in SI and methods).</p><p id="Par19">Two scenarios are considered in our simulation: (1) Business As Usual (BAU) strategy fixes the capacity investment for non-hydro renewables according to the provincial government plan, while allowing for free expansion of thermal units and storage systems; (2) optimal planning strategy (Opt) optimizes the provincial investments for all of the non-hydro renewables, thermal units and storage systems, to fulfill the 40% renewable penetration target proposed by NEA.

Our optimized results prioritize the deployment in (1) Zhejiang and Jiangsu, taking advantage of their superior offshore wind resources and adequate grid integration capabilities; and (2) in Fujian, the best offshore resources in China.

This largely reflects the changing economics of offshore wind. The overall costs are reduced by $32.5 billion with the increased offshore investment, attributed mainly to the reduced costs for renewables and storage systems. The offshore wind investment scale is boosted further to 1220 GW in S3, when allowing for the deployment of long-term storage options. We noted that lithium batteries are identified as the primary storage option in optimization results for the 2030 40% RPS scenario.

Deployment of P2G systems impose an additional demand for power from offshore wind, elevating its installation further to 1520 GW in S4. National hydrogen demand is generally concentrated in coastal regions (accounting for over 60%), mainly due to locally developed automobile and steel industries.

High resolution meteorological and bathymetric data as well as the latest technical-economic data for offshore wind power deployments are incorporated in the model, accounting also for data on power system operations, transmission, and consumption. We conclude that China has abundant wind resources and favorable bathymetrical conditions to develop offshore wind power. About 1000 GW of offshore capacity could be available at a levelized cost below that of nuclear power, equivalent to 2.5 times the present average coastal demand for power. However, power system integration and policy restrictions place a major limitation on harnessing renewable resources. Grid integration barriers are more severe for onshore wind power than for their offshore counterparts under current system configurations. Provincial renewable investments in onshore, offshore wind and solar power by 2030 are optimized and compared with the provincial government 14th five-year-plans. The resulting offshore wind investment level could be as high as 290 GW, more than double the current government target. The optimized renewable portfolio with an expanded contribution from offshore wind power elevates the national renewable penetration to 40% (accounting for existing hydro units), an 8.5% increase compared with the 14th provincial government five-year-plans and with lower system costs.</p><p id="Par29">President Xi Jinping announced recently a commitment for China to realize carbon neutrality by 2060<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Offshore wind power, the contribution for which has been underrated in almost all prior national roadmap studies, may become one of the most important options for China to realize the goal enunciated by the President. Deployment of offshore wind farms in China by mid-century could not only provide the largest market for the global wind industry in the upcoming decade, but it could offer also an important building block for China to transition away from fossil fuel-based energy systems, providing renewable power and generating green hydrogen.</p><p id="Par30">Given the abundance of the economically available offshore resources, the challenge is how to cost-effectively deploy the investment among provinces, recognizing significant differences in both economics and climate impacts. Currently 130 GW of nationally planned offshore wind capacity is concentrated in Guangdong province (60 GW before 2030)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, a more even distribution of offshore facilities among FJ, ZJ, JS, and GD provinces could elevate the national averaged offshore capacity factor from 33.9% to 40.1%, with lower total investments. Development of offshore wind farms in China follows a bottom-up strategy: determined by the local government with approval by the central NDRC. A coordinated, carefully studied, top-down government plan is required to facilitate the sustainable integrated development of the offshore wind industry.</p><p id="Par31">Since major onshore wind, solar and hydro resources are all located in northern and western China, the national transmission structure features a west to east, long distance, high voltage paradigm. With aggressive development of offshore wind power, the national energy supply structure should be altered; further strengthening of the grid connection in the eastern provinces is required and would render western-to-eastern UHV lines unnecessary. China announced plans for investment of 5 trillion USD in new infrastructure for the post COVID-19 recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, and investment in ultra-high voltage transmission systems is one of the seven major areas of emphasis in this plan. As indicated earlier, it is important to coordinate the offshore wind investments with the national UHV upgrade plan.</p><p id="Par32">A significant development of offshore wind power requires changes also in the portfolio of storage systems under elevated levels of renewable penetration. Long-term storage systems will replace lithium batteries and become the primary contributor to the storage portfolio. Long-term storage systems could not only address the long duration fluctuations, but function as a powerful back-up capacity for system reserves. However, recognition of the importance of this capacity is not reflected in pricing mechanisms incorporated in current market operations nor has it been recognized in the most recent initiatives for power market reform. China is transitioning now to open the world’s largest national electricity market—approximately $500 billion trading volume annually. The current emphasis is on designing functional wholesale markets. We note here that introducing proper capacity payment strategies reflecting the contribution of wind power and storage systems will be vital for the ultimate economically driven replacement of coal-fired units.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Numerical simulation and cost estimation for offshore wind farms</title><p id="Par33">The detailed analytical model for estimating the cost of offshore wind projects for all possible locations in China is developed here considering mainly techno-economic characteristics of three subsystems: turbines, foundations and transmission systems.

For the consumption sector, real-world provincial load demand is provided by the State Grid Corporation of China on an hourly basis for the entire year. The heating period for Northeast China, North China and Northwest China is also identified on a provincial basis. For the transmission sector, parameters are incorporated for all of the existing and recently planned inter-provincial transmissions, including the connected provincial regions, capacity ranges and line types.</p><p id="Par42">Fast unit commitment is employed to improve the computational efficiency in recognition of the large scale of this analysis. Instead of scheduling the committed and dispatched behavior for thousands of individual generators at each time interval, thermal units in each provincial region are aggregated according to fuel type, nameplate capacity, and as to whether they involve CHP units or not. Installed capacity, online capacity and actual power output within each thermal group are optimized for different time intervals. All chronological constraints are included and formulated equivalently as compared with the regular UC model. This method is shown to be more than 20,000 times faster than the rigorous UC model, with less than 1% deviation in simulation results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Mathematical formulation of the proposed model is detailed further in the SI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Integrated Investment Model for All of the Non-hydro Renewables, Thermal Units, Transmission and Storage</title><p id="Par43">The optimal investment for all the non-hydro renewables (onshore, offshore wind and solar PV), thermal units, inter-provincial transmissions and storage systems is optimized in this investment model. This model determines in a single optimization both the investment decisions and system operations. Investment decisions account for capacity expansions and geographical allocations for all the non-hydro renewables, thermal units, inter-provincial transmissions and storage systems. Operational decisions account for the committed and dispatched status for all the generation categories over the 8760-hour operation of these systems. Capacity available during dispatch is linked directly with the investment decisions.</p><p id="Par44">The objective of the investment model is to minimize the overall system cost, including (1) system operational costs: start-up costs and operation costs for thermal units, fuel costs for nuclear plants, fixed O&amp;M expenses for each generation category; and (2) system investment costs: amortized capital expenditure for newly deployed non-hydro renewables, thermal units, transmissions and storage systems. Investment costs for offshore wind are determined on a provincial basis using the cost estimation model indicated above, also with respect to local investment levels and provincial physical potentials.</p><p id="Par45">This integrated investment model considers a full set of constraints for system operations. Besides the constraints mentioned previously in the power system simulation model, investment and operation characteristics for newly installed transmissions and storage systems are also specified. Over 600 AC/DC transmission options between different provinces at different voltage levels are identified as technically feasible and included in the optimization model. Related investment costs on a per megawatt basis are obtained by the parameter fitting of real-world project data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, with spatial distance and engineering difficulty as the main considerations. Storage systems account for all of the mainstream technologies (short-term storage such as lithium batteries, and long-term options such as pumped hydro and compressed air). Long-term storage options are modeled explicitly accounting for their technological, economical and geographical feasibility. Deployment of compressed air energy storage considers the properties of available caverns in each province, including their geographical distribution, volume and mining activity estimations. Investment for the storage devices is divided into energy and power items, incorporating regional limitations, annual throughput and life cycle for typical storage systems. Functions in power balance and system standby are both considered for the storage systems.</p><p id="Par46">The future hydrogen economy is also considered in our research. Existing hydrogen generation amounts to 33Mton in 2021, mainly sourced from fossil fuel and employed as the basis material in chemical sectors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. Methanol, ammonia and refining industries account for over 75% of the existing demand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Hydrogen demand is projected to increase to 60Mton in 2050, mainly attributed to its applications in heavy-duty transportation and steel production<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Hence, future national hydrogen demand increment is divided into each province proportional to the road freight transportation and the steel production (refer to SI for detail). Coastal, near coastal and the inland provinces account for 65%, 20% and 15% of the hydrogen demand, respectively.</p><p id="Par47">For the production side, P2G infrastructures are deployed for each provincial region, including different technologies as AEC, SOEC and PEM. Technical parameters such as conversion efficiency, minimum load and output pressure are incorporated for different technologies. Minimum on-off times and ramping rates are not considered given the superior flexibility of mainstream electrolyzers.</p><p id="Par48">For the transportation side, this study considers: (1) gaseous hydrogen: hydrogen is pressurized and transported through underground pipeline; (2) liquid hydrogen: hydrogen is liquefied and delivered by truck; and (3) organic carriers: hydrogen is transformed into a chemical carrier, transported by trunk and de-hydrogenized at the destination. Chemical carriers include NH3 (Ammonia), DBT (Di-benzyl toluene) and TOL (toluene). For any two provincial regions, cost for the above three transportation modes is pre-calculated on a per kilogram basis. Transportation with the lowest cost is fixed, and the hydrogen transportation cost is calculated as hydrogen transportation amount multiplied by the unit transportation price in our model (refer to SI for details).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Cost Data Adopted</title><p id="Par49">Offshore wind capital expenditure is modeled as noted in the “Numerical Simulation and Cost Estimation for Offshore Wind Farms” subsection, provincially varying from 2255 to 2870 $<bold>/</bold>kW in 2020, adopting a 30% cost reduction for 2030, and a 49% cost reduction for 2050<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>, accounting for learning curves and improved efficiency. The capital expenditure for onshore wind and solar PV is evaluated on a provincial basis according to the Manual of Renewable Energy Data 2015 released by the National Energy Administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>. Cost for onshore wind is estimated assuming a 27% cost reduction by 2030 with a 37% cost reduction by 2050<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. The cost for solar PV is derived from the Annual Technology Baseline available from NREL<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par50">Capital expenditure for storage systems is divided into energy and power investment items.
