Photoelectrochemical cells with bio-hybrid electrodes from photosynthetic proteins and inorganic semiconductors have thus potential for the use in artificial photosynthesis. We investigate here processing routes for the functionalization of hematite photoanodes with PC, including <italic>in situ</italic> co-polymerization of PC with enzymatically-produced melanin, and using a recombinant PC genetically engineered to carry a hexa-histidine tag (αHisPC). First, the effect of the immobilisation of PC on the electrode morphology and photocurrent production is evaluated. Then, the electronic charge transfer in dark and light conditions is assessed with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and valence band (VB) X-ray photoemission spectroscopy. The relative shift of the VB spectrum towards the Fermi energy E<sub>F</sub> upon illumination is smaller for the more complex processed coating and virtually disappears for αHisPC immobilised with a melanin film. Optimal conditions for protein immobilisation are determined and the dark currents benefit most from the most advanced protein coating processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Artificial photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>Antenna protein C-phycocyanin</kwd><kwd>Hematite photoanode</kwd><kwd>Impedance spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>Valence band (VB) X-ray photoemission spectroscopy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Korea Nano Technology Research Society, co-published with Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Korea Nano Technology Research Society</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2014</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40580_2014_Article_40.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanoscale Science and Technology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanotechnology and Microengineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry and Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p id="Par2">Hematite, a ferric oxide with 2.1 eV optical band gap energy, is considered a low cost and environmentally benign photoanode material for solar hydrogen production by water splitting in photoelectrochemical cells (PEC). The research and development of photoelectrodes for PEC is focused on the tailoring of the electronic structure and the microstructure, and recently also on the design of hetero structures. The functionalization of a photoelectrode with light harvesting proteins was recently demonstrated for hematite using C-phycocyanin (PC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], which constitutes basically a dye sensitization.</p><p id="Par3">Dye sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] is an established technology for the extension of the light absorption range of inorganic photoelectrodes for solar energy conversion. To be fully functional, the electric charge generated in the dye upon light absorption needs to be transferred to the photoelectrode, i.e. the interface between the dye and the photoelectrode must warrant proper charge transfer for electrons or holes.</p><p id="Par4">We recently developed a process which enhances the photocurrent of hematite thin-film electrodes by immobilising light-harvesting proteins such as PC on the surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. So far, the functionalization has been performed with the commercially available PC from <italic>Spirulina</italic> sp. which contains the α- and β-subunits of the protein. In the present study, we evaluate the simpler α-subunit of PC from <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC6803 which is recombinantly produced in <italic>E. coli</italic> and engineered to carry an N-terminal hexa-histidine tag (αHisPC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

Briefly, strain <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α was co-transformed with plasmids pAT101 and pBD414V and transformants were selected for resistance to both kanamycin (50 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>) and spectinomycin (100 μg ml<sup>−1</sup>). Cultures were routinely set up in TB medium (500 ml volume), incubated at 37°C under constant shaking (180 rpm), and expression was induced by adding IPTG (final conc. 1 mM). Cells were harvested by centrifugation 17 h post-induction and stored at −20°C. Upon thawing and re-suspension in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer with pH 7.5 (5 ml g<sup>−1</sup> wet cell weight), lysozyme (final conc. 1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>) and a protease inhibitor mix (Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets, Roche) were added. The cell suspension was then subjected to a freeze-thaw cycle at −20°C. Cells were further disrupted by sonication, and the cell-free extract, isolated by ultracentrifugation, was loaded onto a HisTrap column (1 ml, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) for purification by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC). αHisPC was eluted with imidazole (conc. 200 mM) in 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.5). αHisPC-containing fractions were concentrated and desalted with a Vivaspin ultrafiltration device (10000 cut-off, Sartorius). The purified αHisPC was stored at −20°C for further use. Protein concentrations of αHisPC solutions were determined spectrophotometrically with a Synergy Mx spectrophotometer (Biotek, Switzerland) and using an extinction coefficient of 140000 M<sup>−1</sup> cm<sup>−1</sup> at 620 nm.

Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass slides (12 mm × 30 mm × 2 mm, TEC-8 from Hartford Glass Inc.) were automatically dip coated (DipMasterTM-50, Chemat Technology Inc., USA) with the precursor solution and dried at 75°C for 5 min on a hot plate. The samples were then further annealed for 30 min at 500°C in an air vented muffle furnace. Dip coating and annealing were repeated three times so as to obtain a film of four layers of hematite, which has typically a thickness of 500 to 600 nm. Prevalence of the hematite phase was confirmed with X-ray diffraction (Siemens D5000).</p><p id="Par8">The thickness of the hematite films was determined with a mechanical profilometer (XP-1 Stylus Profiler by Ambios Technology).

Protein immobilisation was carried out by coating the hematite surface with a melanin-forming mixture containing PC or αHisPC (concentration 0.2 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>), L-tyrosine (concentration 0.1 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>), and tyrosinase (50 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> concentration) in 0.05 M phosphate buffer saline (PBS; 160 g l<sup>−1</sup> NaCl, 4 g l<sup>−1</sup> KCl, 28.88 gl<sup>−1</sup> Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 4.4 g l<sup>−1</sup> KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 7.2-7.4) for 3 h. The surface was dried between all the steps, eventually rinsed with PBS and distilled water, and then stored at 4°C in the dark until the actual measurements were performed. Because the tyrosinase preparation contains traces of trypsin, the protease inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) was added to the coating mixture at a 1 mM final concentration.

Linear voltammetry in the dark and under illumination was conducted using a specifically designed spectro-photoelectrochemical cell (known as EPFL cappuccino cell) made of polyether ether ketone (PEEK) and a potentiostat (Voltalab80 PGZ 402). The hematite photoanode was connected as the working electrode in a three electrode configuration. A platinum sheet of 5 mm × 5 mm was used as counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl (with saturated KCl) electrode was used as reference electrode. The electrolyte was 0.05 M PBS. Sunlight was simulated by a 1 Sun Oriel Lamp (L.O.T.–Oriel AG) with a quartz filter, corresponding to AM 1.5 global standard solar spectrum. The bias potential was scanned from 0 mV to 1000 mV. All shown results are the arithmetic average of data of at least three consecutive measurements. Electrochemical impedance spectra were recorded with the Voltalab80 PGZ 402 using the same cell in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 100 mHz with 20 data points per decade and a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV. Spectra of hematite films coated on FTO glass and of variously prepared PC films on hematite were recorded. Dark and light conditions as described above were applied during the impedance measurements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Photoemission spectroscopy</title><p id="Par16">X-ray photoemission (PES) spectra were recorded at beamline 8–1 at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, Menlo Park, CA. Specifically, the spectra were recorded under Fe 2p resonant condition with 53.2, 54.4 and 55.8 eV photon energy, so that the valence band spectra were particularly representing the Fe relevant features. The PES spectra were measured from the surface finished (0001) hematite single crystals that were coated with PC in the aforementioned different processing routes. The measurements of PES were carried out under ultrahigh vacuum condition, i.e. 10<sup>−10</sup> mbar base pressure. At the time of experiment, the films could be considered dry by ambient conditions.

The protein layer causes the higher photocurrent density. The higher photocurrent densities can be attributed to the panchromatic light harvesting action of protein and the electronic transfer to the hematite surface.

Yet we measure in KOH a significant increase in photocurrent density (left panel, Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). A possible explanation might be found in the newly occurring absorbance feature at 750 nm for PC and αHisPC, when measured in the strongly alkaline environment (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). While the proteins may become denatured, the chromophores may still be intact and absorb light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and produce electron–hole pairs which add to the photocurrent. Moreover, the recombinant monomeric αHisPC appears to be a valid alternative to the commercial PC preparation. The 55% increase measured for αHisPC is significantly higher than the 8% increase measured for analogous samples prepared with PC (all measured in 1 M KOH). We thus speculate that PC and αHisPC couple differently with the surface, thus conferring different charge transfer. As a possible explanation, the presence of the Histag on αHisPC might provide a better conducting bonding to the hematite surface as histidine residues are known to coordinate iron ions and the Histag has been shown to bind iron in some proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For the evaluation of the effect of melanin alone, samples lacking any photosynthetic protein were prepared and analysed as a control experiment. Compared to the hematite films with coatings containing PC or αHisPC and melanin, no significant increase in photocurrent was observed. Therefore the key factor for the increase in photocurrent is the biliprotein, and not the melanin. Based on these results, a 0.2 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> protein concentration and 3 h enzymatic reaction time was used for further experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Surface morphology of phycocyanin-melanin coated samples</title><p id="Par24">Electron microscopy was used for the closer visual inspection of the hematite coated with melanin and different amounts of PC. Electron micrographs of hematite coated with melanin and PC show the formation of strands of protein-melanin complexes (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Since the same concentration of melanin was present in all samples, strand formation depends on the protein concentration. At the lower 0.2 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> protein concentration, SEM micrographs of samples coated with PC (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) shows formation of stretched dense formations in tight contact with the hematite surface, and this could play a role in the enhancement of the photocurrent. A significant strand formation is visible in samples with a PC concentration of 2 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> rather than at 0.2 mg ml<sup>−1</sup>. In addition to the protein strains, spherical granules with a diameter of 200 nm are observed (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These are likely due to melanin which tends to organise in such granules when isolated from natural sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

Refined immobilization strategies like co-polymerization of PC with melanin or genetic engineering to attach a His-Tag to PC successively increase the photocurrent. Analysis of the charge carrier dynamics of the bio-hybrid electrode assembly under photoelectrochemical conditions shows that upon illumination the enhanced charge transfer and DC bias are substantially amplified (factor 10) when the hematite film is coated with the light harvesting protein. This, however, seems to have not the same strong effect on the photocurrent density (only factor 2). A clear and systematic dependency of spectral shift of the valence band is observed in the dark and in the illuminated condition. While the His-tag strategy clearly improves the charge transfer between PC and hematite in the dark, no further enhancement is observed under illumination condition. This might be due to the fact that the illumination generates electron hole pairs, but this should have no effect on the charge transport characteristic of the covalent linkages between protein and hematite.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded at large by the VELUX Foundation under project no° 790 (Biomimetic photoelectrochemical cells for solar hydrogen generation: Bio-PEC) for K.
