sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p id="Par19">Aging is the greatest single risk factor for cancer, cognitive decline, frailty, and immunological dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], yet consistent genomic alterations related to aging have been elusive. For example, few genetic variants regulating human life span have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. At the same time, there is a growing realization that environmental factors are major contributors to aging and age-associated illness. Epigenetics is the study of chemical modifications of the genome, heritable by cell progeny, and it has been an attractive target for studies of aging and environmentally influenced disease. Several groups have shown differences in DNA methylation - a covalent modification of cytosine at CpG dinucleotides - in peripheral blood samples and other tissues with increasing age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Some of these differences are possibly confounded by changes in cell type distribution with aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], but many are likely real as they are seen across multiple cell types. Studies of identical twins have shown markedly divergent patterns of DNA methylation in whole blood over the lifespan, suggesting an environmental component to epigenetic change with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and the epigenetic drift hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">The skin as a model of aging offers the advantage of studying the influence of environmental factors by virtue of its direct exposure to the sun. The superficial layer of epidermis (approximately 60 μm) interfaces more directly with the outside world than the deeper dermal layer. Even penetration of solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation is mostly in the epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, skin affords the ability to compare the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic (environmental) aging through the comparison of chronically sun-exposed (for example, forearm and face) and sun-protected skin (for example, upper inner arm) in the same individual. Both layers offer a relatively homogenous system for analyzing DNA methylation; the epidermis especially is composed of around 95% keratinocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Histological changes associated with aging and sun exposure in human skin have been extensively studied. The primary histopathological changes associated with aging and sun exposure are independent of cell type change: in some studies of the epidermal layer, increased thickness is associated with sun exposure, decreased thickness is associated with aging. Within the dermal layer, loss of collagen and altered fibroblast morphology is associated with both chronological aging and sun exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Despite the lack of large cell type shifts, both extrinsic and intrinsic skin aging are associated with broad changes in gene expression, with many similar pathways differentially regulated in each. Pathways associated with intrinsic aging in sun-protected skin are seen to be amplified by chronic environmental exposure in sun-exposed skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that epigenetic changes might mediate the changes associated with environmental exposure in aging skin.</p><p id="Par21">A previous study of DNA methylation in aging skin tissue was limited technologically. This study used the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip, which measures 27,000 CpG sites, focused on dense CpG regions termed CpG islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It showed little change related to skin aging (hypermethylation at 0.38% of sites) and even less change associated with sun exposure (hypomethylation at 0.05% of sites) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We and others have recently observed widespread differentially methylated regions (DMRs) across the genome that distinguish tissues (t-DMRs), stages of stem cell reprogramming (r-DMRs), and cancer (c-DMRs). Most of these alterations are either at regions near but not in CpG-dense islands, termed CpG island shores, or distal from both islands and shores (the 'open seas') [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These distal regions were discovered to be large blocks, corresponding to heterochromatin regions termed large organized chromatin lysine-modifications (LOCKs) or nuclear lamin-associated domains (LADs), and these large blocks show substantial hypomethylation in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Almost none of these regions is represented on the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip, and thus were not included in the previous study. A more recent study used whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to examine methylation in aging skin more comprehensively, but they looked only at samples from one body site, the inner forearm, of each individual and thus were not able to characterize the interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic aging in these samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">In order to more fully examine methylation in human skin samples affected by age and sun-exposure, we performed array-based DNA methylation analysis using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array, which includes islands, shores, most known c-DMRs, t-DMRs, and r-DMRs and probes within the 'open sea' regions identified as part of the hypomethylated blocks in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. We applied recently developed algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] capable of identifying differences in large blocks as have previously been detected in cancer samples using WGBS, and we confirmed these results directly with WGBS of additional samples. Here we describe profound changes in DNA methylation associated with combined aging and sun exposure, involving 670 Mb of the genome, and including large blocks similar to cancer. In human subjects, these changes are progressive with quantitative measures of skin aging. These same blocks are observed to be hypomethylated in squamous cell carcinoma samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par23">We undertook a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in human skin to test specifically for alterations associated with age or with sun exposure, and the potential relationship between these regions. Ten younger individuals (&lt;35 years old) and 10 older individuals (&gt;60 years old) each submitted one sun-protected biopsy specimen from the upper inner arm, as well as one sun-exposed specimen from either the dorsal forearm or crow’s feet (lateral epicanthus) (donor information in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Donors were carefully selected to exclude individuals with active skin conditions or individuals using topical medications (exclusion criteria detailed in methods). As methylation and sun-exposure effects both vary with race, we limited this sample set to Caucasian donors. In addition to tissue biopsies, donors volunteered health history information. For each donor, a dermatologist evaluated their degree of apparent skin aging in both sun-exposed and sun-protected regions using two established scales.</p><p id="Par24">In order to study more homogenous tissue samples, each punch biopsy was mechanically separated into epidermis and dermis following overnight incubation with dispase, a procedure associated with unappreciable fibroblast contamination in cultured epidermal sections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and analyzed separately. In previous work, epidermal sections separated in this manner show the same age- and sun exposure-related methylation changes as epidermal sections separated by suction blister, indicating the dispase separation does not have significant effects on the methylome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To confirm uniformity of our technique among sample groups, we sectioned a subset of dispase separated epidermal layers and performed hematoxylin and eosin staining. Examination of stained sections showed separation below the basal layer for all age and sun exposure groups, consistent with previous histological analysis of dispase separated epidermis (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. To characterize methylation genome-wide, we used the Infinium HumanMethylation450 bead chip (450k), which includes most CpG islands and shores, additional regions shown to be differentially methylated in cancer and development, and other functionally important regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">We classified the samples from each skin layer into four groups: younger sun-protected (Y-pro), younger sun-exposed (Y-exp), older sun-protected (O-pro), and older sun-exposed (O-exp). To obtain an overview of the genome-scale differences among these eight groups, we performed principal component analysis and created scatter plots of the first two principal components. As expected given the established differential methylation between tissue types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], the greatest differences were between dermis and epidermis, supporting the experimental rationale of dissociating those two tissues. There was also clear separation between samples obtained from either sun-protected or sun-exposed arm and from the face, indicating that this anatomical difference had to be considered during subsequent analysis. When a principal component analysis was repeated with just the epidermal arm samples, there was striking separation among the four groups, with the greatest difference between O-exp and Y-pro (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A). The sun-exposed samples obtained from the face cluster separately, but maintain the separation between old and young. Principal component analysis on dermal arm samples did not show separation related to age and exposure (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B), suggesting that the number of differences would be much less than in epidermis, consistent with the previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>DNA methylation in epidermal but not dermal samples clusters by age and sun exposure. <bold>(A)</bold> In epidermis, DNA methylation segregates old versus young individuals, and also segregates sun-exposed and sun-protected anatomical regions, shown by multidimensional scaling of pairwise distances derived from methylation levels assayed on the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450k). <bold>(B)</bold> In dermis, DNA methylation does not segregate samples by age or anatomical region, shown by multidimensional scaling of pairwise distances derived from methylation levels assayed on the 450k.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13059_2015_644_Fig1_HTML.gif" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hypomethylated blocks associated with aging and sun exposure in epidermis</title><p id="Par26">In previous studies comparing methylation in colorectal cancer and normal samples, large hypomethylated blocks spanning large, primarily CpG-poor regions of the genome were seen to be the major source of methylation change in cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Given the large differences found by principal component analysis within epidermal samples, we hypothesized that similar large blocks might underlie the methylation changes seen with age and sun exposure. Recent advances in analysis of 450k data through the <italic>Minfi</italic> package now make it possible to identify such large blocks in addition to small DMRs by applying the Bumphunter approach to probes in open sea regions using a large smoothing window [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. We began by using this block finder to identify any large blocks differentially methylated between the samples that appear most different upon principle component analysis, the epidermal O-exp and Y-pro samples. Sun exposed samples obtained from the face were included in this analysis. Identified blocks were filtered by size and the calculated family-wise error <italic>P</italic>-value. We identified 224 blocks, of which 223 were hypomethylated in the O-exp samples compared to Y-pro samples, with an average size of 443 kb (ranging from 202 kb to 1.3 Mb) and 9.2% reduction in DNA methylation, ranging from 5.2 to 16% (examples in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A,B; list of block locations in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>). These blocks cover a total of 99 Mb of the genome. It is likely that more blocks of hypomethylation are present in these samples but our detection is limited by the coverage of the 450k array in open sea regions.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Block hypomethylation progresses from younger sun-protected to older sun-protected to younger sun-exposed to older sun-exposed tissue. <bold>(A)</bold> Example of a region identified as a block comparing older sun-exposed to younger sun-protected epidermal samples using 450k data.

To address this, we performed the block finding analysis comparing Y-exp and Y-pro samples.

While significant, the relatively small area involved (3.8 Mb compared to 99 Mb) indicates the magnitude of block hypomethylation observed comparing O-exp and Y-pro samples cannot be attributed only to body site differences. By contrast, when comparing the O-exp and O-pro samples, we identified hypomethylated blocks of a comparable magnitude to the O-exp and Y-pro comparison, 239 blocks encompassing 100 Mb, with a mean difference of 8.6% hypomethylated. While these analyses were performed without regard to individual specific changes, comparing the paired and unpaired t-statistics for each methylation location demonstrates that the unpaired analysis is conservative and only underestimates the magnitude of change present (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">5</xref>).

By contrast, when we compared O-exp and Y-exp samples, we identified 33 block regions with an average of 10% difference in methylation, 32 of which are hypomethylated with age, encompassing 12.7 Mb (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">6</xref>). The presence of age-related hypomethylated blocks in the sun-exposed body site but not the sun-protected body site further demonstrates that hypomethylated blocks arise only in epidermal tissue affected by both aging and sun exposure. In contrast to the epidermis, all block finding comparisons in the data from dermal samples identified no significant blocks, consistent with the lack of differential clustering seen in the principal component analysis. Thus, hypomethylated blocks encompassing a significant portion of the genome are only observed in epidermal samples affected by both age and sun exposure.

While most population studies of aging and environmental exposures have focused on methylation changes in single CpGs or small DMRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], here we identify changes across large block regions encompassing approximately 20% of the genome. This extent of altered methylation suggests that the change associated with chronic environmental stress should be studied on a genome scale, rather than only focusing on changes in DNA methylation in discrete regions. While our sample size is relatively small, the large scale change identified is informative for future study. The overlap of our identified blocks with other structural domains, including LADs and LOCKs, further supports the idea that the observed changes in DNA methylation are indicative of alteration to the epigenomic structure. Future studies of chronic exposure should examine methylation at a similar, genome scale to determine if the changes identified in our sample set are more broadly relevant.</p><p id="Par49">We chose to examine skin in this study because it offers a relatively homogenous system with regard to cell type for studying aging and exposure. Once separated, the epidermis in particular consists of 90 to 95% keratinocytes in both sun-exposed and sun-protected body sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The other main cell types in the epidermis, melanocytes and Langerhans cells, account for a small percentage of cells - there are approximately 36 keratinocytes per melanocyte and approximately 53 keratinocytes per Langerhans cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. While small increases in melanocyte density in sun-exposed body sites and small decreases in melanocyte density with age have been reported, these are not of the correct pattern or sufficient magnitude to confound the observed blocks of hypomethylation: comparing sun-exposed and sun-protected body sites from young and old individuals shows up to a twofold increase in melanocytes in heavily sun-exposed sites and a decrease in melanocyte density by 6 to 8% per decade in both sun-exposed and sun-protected locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. As melanocytes account for approximately 3% of cells present, a doubling or complete loss of these cells could account for up to a 3% change in methylation, smaller than the magnitude of change observed in blocks. Further, as we demonstrate, the observed hypomethylated blocks are not present comparing sun-exposed and sun-protected body sites in young individuals, so they cannot be attributed to the increased percentage of melanocytes present in sun-exposed body sites of both young and old individuals. The age related decrease in melanoctyes would amount to approximately a 1% change in cell composition over four decades (32% decrease in 3% of cells), which is again not sufficient to account for the changes we observe. Consistent with the very small changes in cell composition reported in the literature, analysis of gene expression data from our samples indicates no significant changes in melanocyte marker genes.</p><p id="Par50">In the recent literature, multiple methods have been developed to <italic>in silico</italic> correct for cell type heterogeneity, including SVA, EWASher and refFreeEwas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. All of these methods assume that the signal between cases and controls is small compared to the effect of cell type heterogeneity and that any large scale change identified in principle component analysis is due to cell composition changes. Using these methods will therefore remove any large scale signal between cases and controls, even if these differences are not due to cell composition effects. An example is given by the EWASher paper in which applying the methodology to comparison of colon cancer tumors and normal colon leaves only two CpGs identified as significantly differentially methylated in cancer, contradicting 25 years of literature on this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and acknowledged by the authors themselves to be a significant blind spot of such correction methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Despite the significant body of evidence supporting the absence of large scale cell composition changes in our samples, the methylation changes we describe encompass a large portion of the genome and are large enough to affect clustering (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), so it is not surprising that the application of these algorithms to our data removes the widespread hypomethylation observed in the older, sun-exposed samples. However, given the substantial evidence indicating no large changes in cell composition with aging and sun exposure, we attribute this to the degree of differential methylation within the keratinocyte population and not changes in cell type composition.</p><p id="Par51">The identified blocks are distinct from the single CpGs used to calculate 'methylation age' by Horvath and the small hypermethylated DMRs overlapping bivalent chromatin domains identified as markers of chronological age in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We see no evidence of hypomethylation within our blocks or within 450k open sea probes associated with chronological aging in publically available data from adipose tissue or peripheral blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] (Figure S9A-D in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM20">20</xref>), reinforcing our finding that block hypomethylation in epidermal tissue occurs only with chronic exposure, not aging alone. Heyn <italic>et al</italic>. report widespread hypomethylation with age in CD4+ T cells from WGBS of cells sorted from one newborn and one centenarian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], indicating that large blocks of hypomethylation may be relevant in other models of aging, although we see only a moderate overlap of our identified blocks with hypomethylated CpGs in their study (OR = 1.77; Figure S9E,F in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM20">20</xref>) and the use of single samples in that study makes it difficult to draw further conclusions about the regions involved.</p><p id="Par52">A functional role of altered block methylation is supported by the correlations between block methylation and clinical measures of skin aging. Our analysis of the relationship between hypomethylated blocks and gene expression is limited by the low number of samples available for gene expression analysis. In studies of cancer and EBV transformation, large publically available expression datasets have allowed identification of a clear relationship between hypomethylation and variability of expression of genes within blocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Another recent study linked loss of methylation in gene-poor regions with activation of distal enhancers, indicating that loss of methylation may have functional consequences beyond regulation of nearest genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Consistent with an environmental exposure-driven effect, the magnitude of age- and sun-related change was greater in epidermal samples compared with dermal samples. These results suggest that molecular aging and UV exposure studies focused on dermis or full thickness biopsy may miss the relevant epigenetic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">The occurrence of blocks of hypomethylation related to age and sun exposure in regions previously seen to be hypomethylated in cancer is highly intriguing. Similar blocks identified in colon cancer samples were seen to develop very early in cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], suggesting epigenetic reorganization may be an early event in carcinogenesis. While the blocks observed in our study encompass a smaller portion of the genome and have a smaller magnitude of change, their occurrence in non-malignant tissue suggests that epigenomic change may be initiated by exposures, rather than only during oncogenesis. Our observation in this work, that blocks identified as hypomethylated with chronic exposure in non-malignant tissue are hypomethylated in SCC, while most other sites are not, suggests that these changes may occur prior to malignancy. Our identification of this subset of the 'cancer blocks' that become hypomethylated with chronic exposure offers a potential target for chemoprevention strategies.</p><p id="Par54">We note that these results suggest that an early change quantitatively related to chronic exposure in skin is a large-scale epigenomic alteration that was missed by earlier studies focused on individual genes or loci such as CpG islands. Intriguingly, a recent study by Cruickshanks <italic>et al</italic>. identifies similar large regions of hypomethylation in cells cultured to replicative senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], linking such loss of methylation to cell turnover and cell stress in culture. Further, Takeuchi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] recently demonstrated that repeated exposure of aged cells to UVA induces expression of progerin, the mutated form of Lamin A seen in Hutchinson-Guilford progeria, and abnormal nuclear morphology. This is intriguing given the observed overlap between our blocks and lamina-associated domains. While speculative, a general model consistent with these data is that repeated stress and cell turnover leads to progressive destabilization of heterochromatin along the nuclear membrane, with attendant changes in DNA methylation. These changes could serve both as a molecular epigenetic clock of environmental exposure and a potential target of increased risk. They fit well an age-associated epigenetic drift hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These results may have therapeutic implications. For example, future experiments should be performed to determine whether modifiers of sun damage, such as retinoic acid, or specific inhibitors of laminopathies, such as lonafarnib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], might modify the development of the epigenomic alterations described here. Finally, we emphasize that the changes observed here may be restricted to the specific sample types and method of analysis used here.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par55">Our data demonstrate widespread blocks of hypomethylation, involving 670 Mb of the genome associated with chronic exposure in older, sun-exposed epidermal samples. The degree of hypomethylation correlates with clinical measures of photo-aging. We observe these same reasons to be similarly hypomethylated in SCC.

Samples from 20 of these donors were used for 450k analysis, and samples from the additional six donors were used for WGBS. All participants provided written informed consent, and this study was approved by the Johns Hopkins Medicine Institutional Review Board (IRB# NA_00041408 for sun-exposed and sun-protected samples, NA_0036868 for SCC samples). All human experimentation was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Exclusion criteria included use of topical medications within 2 weeks of sampling, active or dormant skin conditions, and pregnancy. To control for pigmentation, only Caucasian subjects were selected. For each subject, a dermatologist evaluated the degree of apparent skin aging using two established scales: Griffiths’ photodamage age grading measures coarse and fine wrinkling, photopigmentation and yellowing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] while Helfrich’s photo-protected skin aging scale, in contrast, was developed for sun-protected skin and measures more nuanced fine wrinkling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Paired punch biopsy samples, 4 mm in diameter, were collected under local anesthesia from the outer forearm or lateral epicanthus (sun-exposed area) and upper inner arm (sun-protected area). Immediately after removal, samples were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and transferred to DMEM (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) containing dispase (2 U/ml). Following dispase treatment overnight at 4°C, epidermis and dermis were separated, flash frozen and stored at -140°C. SCC containing tissue was obtained from 10 previously diagnosed patients (8 females and 2 males; median age 67 years) undergoing either Mohs micrographic or excisional surgery for treatment of their skin cancer.
