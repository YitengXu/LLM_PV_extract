The synthesis of high-quality graphene is a precondition for its real-time application. However, conventional synthesis methods have certain drawbacks including laborious procedures and structural defects in graphene nanosheets. Plasma-based synthesis techniques such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and atmospheric pressure microwave plasma are high-tech synthesis practices that can produce graphene without any solvents in a few seconds. This article reviews these state-of-the-art techniques emphasizing mainly their process parameters for the synthesis of high-grade graphene, which is defect-free, and comprises mono to few layers, great carrier mobility, and high purity. The applications of as-synthesized graphene in various fields are also provided. Moreover, the potential breakthroughs and the prospect of these techniques are also discussed in this work.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition</kwd><kwd>Atmospheric pressure microwave plasma</kwd><kwd>Process parameters</kwd><kwd>Growth of graphene</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Griffith University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>41</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Division of Plasma Physics, Association of Asia Pacific Physical Societies</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>31</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41614_2022_Article_102.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Plasma Physics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Astronomy, Astrophysics and Cosmology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nuclear Fusion</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Optics, Lasers, Photonics, Optical Devices</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Physics and Astronomy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The astonishing discovery in the field of materials science in the last two decades is indeed graphene. Graphene was synthesized by Professor Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov in 2004 who won a noble prize for this (Hancock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2011</xref>). Although graphene was under investigation before 2004 under different names, however, due to the lack of suitable synthesis techniques, graphene failed to appear in the limelight. Prof. Geim and Novoselov used a simple approach of mechanical exfoliation, which involved using scotch tape on graphite (Allen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>). Eventually, the exfoliated single layer of graphite, comprising a thickness between 0.4 and 1.7Â nm was termed graphene (Shearer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">Graphene is a 2-dimensional monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb structure. It is basically composed of sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon atoms. Just like other allotropes of carbon i.e., diamond, graphite, fullerenes (C<sub>60</sub>), and carbon nanotube, graphene is also an allotrope of carbon (Shunhong, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2015</xref>). Graphene has a large theoretical specific area (Wei and Qu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2012</xref>) and possesses extraordinary mechanical, electrical, optical, thermal, etc. properties (Iqbal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2020</xref>). It is the thinnest as well as the strongest known material, surpassing diamond (Wagner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">2017</xref>). Owing to all these properties, Prof. Geim called it a âwonder materialâ (Geim and Graphene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2009</xref>). Also referred to as âmagic materialâ in some writings by others (Aliofkhazraei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">The main challenge towards the practical application of any material comes during its synthesis process. A variety of synthesis techniques have been used to produce pristine graphene. Mainly, it can be divided into bottom-up and top-down approaches, which are further divided into various techniques based on the synthesis approach. Each synthesis method has its own merits and demerits (Bhuyan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>). FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> gives the division of techniques.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Top-down and bottom-up synthesis techniques of graphene</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_102_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par5">The methods which involve the breakdown of the bulk material, such as graphite to acquire a single or few layers of graphene are regarded as top-down methods. Based on how exfoliation is carried out, various techniques have been reported as top-down methods. It includes, mechanical exfoliation (Park et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2010</xref>), Chemical synthesis, liquid-phase exfoliation (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2017</xref>) etc. However, these techniques lack a good production rate, give poor quality of graphene (Whitener and Sheehan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">2014</xref>), or require the reaction of graphite with strong oxidizers such as sulphuric acid, potassium chlorate, nitric acid and potassium permanganate which produce toxic gases (Lotya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2009</xref>). Conversely, bottom-up approaches use molecules or atoms as building blocks of a complex structure and are considered very promising since these involve no wastage of materials (Biswas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>). The processes include epitaxial growth (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2019</xref>), chemical vapor deposition (CVD) (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">2020</xref>), plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) (Jacob et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2015</xref>; Alancherry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>) and atmospheric pressure microwave plasma synthesis (Toman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">In vapor deposition techniques, a precursor in the form of gases is sent into a reaction chamber set at a higher temperature. When gases are exposed to the substrate, a reaction occurs and a monolayer to a few layers of graphene are created on the surface of the substrate. CVD, also known as thermal CVD, involves a high temperature of about 1000Â Â°C (MuÃ±oz and GÃ³mez-Aleixandre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2013</xref>). However, with the assistance of plasma, graphene can be grown at lower temperatures ranging from 600 to 800Â Â°C. The plasma generates an enormous chemical environment, producing a mixture of molecules, radicals and ions from hydrocarbon precursors, as a result facilitates lower formation temperatures and a faster synthesis process than thermal CVD (Boyd et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2015</xref>). The atmospheric pressure plasma is the state-of-art technique in which synthesis is carried out at atmospheric pressure; rendering it a substrate-free process without the need for high vacuum or temperature. This literature review focuses on PECVD and atmospheric pressure microwave plasma synthesis of graphene. Particularly, the parameters involved in the synthesis of graphene and their role in the structure of the graphene are addressed. Lastly, a detailed outlook on these techniques is provided as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Carbon nanostructures</title><p id="Par7">The carbon allotropes of the nano-sizes comprising different shapes, sizes and dimensionality are widely sought-after research materials. This is due to their diverse properties, structural diversity and myriad of applications (Peng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2012</xref>; Hahm et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>; Novoselov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2012</xref>; Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2017</xref>). Until now variety of carbon nanostructures have been developed, and many efforts have been made to tailor the properties of those materials for targeted applications (Hatakeyama <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2017</xref>). These nanoscale carbon structures can be classified based on their dimensionality i.e., zero, one and two-dimensional carbon nanostructures. Their division is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Types of Carbon nanostructures (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2017</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_102_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Zero-dimensional carbon nanostructures</title><p id="Par8">Zero-dimensional carbon nanostructures include fullerenes, carbon dots or graphene quantum dots. The first synthesis of fullerenes was reported in 1990, where it was prepared by evaporation and recondensation of graphite (KrÃ¤tschmer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">1990</xref>). Now fullerenes is prepared massively and thus easily available. Fullerenes have many interesting characteristics. For instance, the delocalization of charges within spherical carbon network and aromatic p-sphere are important for stabilizing charged units (Al-Jumaili et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">Carbon dots or graphene quantum dots are the recent addition in zero-dimensional carbon nanostructures. The very first reported fabrications of these materials were from candle soot (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2007</xref>) and laser ablation method (Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2006</xref>). However, now a variety of techniques have developed to synthesize carbon dots which include hydrothermal and electrochemical methods, and pyrolysis or microwave conversion of waste materials (Gao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2014</xref>). The luminescence of carbon dots spans into the visible spectrum (Baker and Baker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>One-dimensional carbon nanostructures</title><p id="Par10">Carbon nanotube is a one-dimensional allotrope of carbon. Carbon nanotube is basically a cylindrically tube which can be obtained by rolling the graphene film (Zhang and Li <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">2009</xref>; Iijima <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1991</xref>; Avouris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2007</xref>). Carbon nanotubes are two types, single-wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) (Niyogi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2002</xref>) and multiwall carbon nanotube (MWCNT) (Lehman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2011</xref>). Carbon nanotube offers interesting properties such as semiconductor, semi-metallic and metallic which make them an ideal material for sensing applications (Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">2010</xref>; Allen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>; Kauffman and Star <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2008</xref>). The synthesis of carbon nanotube is usually obtained through chemical vapor deposition method due to great merits of this method (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2022</xref>; Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Two-dimensional carbon nanostructures</title><p id="Par11">The newest example of two-dimensional carbon nanostructure is graphene (Geim and Graphene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2009</xref>). Graphene is basically an atomically thin single layer of carbon hexagonal structure (Huang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2017a</xref>). Graphene has myriad of applications due to its extraordinary properties, such as highest electron mobility, high surface area, and excellent conductivity, stronger than diamond etc. (Al-Jumaili, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2022</xref>). Owing to this, extensive research has been devoted on developing the preparation methods of graphene. CVD (MuÃ±oz and GÃ³mez-Aleixandre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2013</xref>; Deng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019a</xref>), PECVD (Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">2013</xref>), epitaxial growth (Hass et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2008</xref>), Hummers method (Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">2016</xref>) and mechanical exfoliation (Martinez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2011</xref>) are widely used methods to produce this two-dimensional material.</p><p id="Par12">In addition to pristine graphene, various surface-treated forms of graphene i.e. graphene oxide, reduced-graphene oxide, photoluminescent graphene oxide, nitrogen-doped graphene/graphene oxide have also been developed (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2017</xref>). Graphene oxide is rich with oxygen functional groups such as hydroxyl, carboxyl, and epoxy groups (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020a</xref>). Due to these oxygen functional groups, a negative charge is developed on the surface of the graphene. The non-altered areas of graphene contains free p-electrons, allowing p-interactions. The charge, surface chemistry, and hydrophilicity of graphene oxide add interesting properties in the graphene (Dreyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>; Mao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>PECVD synthesis of graphene</title><p id="Par13">The PECVD process for the synthesis of graphene can be divided into three parts, i.e., precursor delivery, decomposition, and graphene formation. A precursor in the form of gas is supplied into the plasma region, where it breaks down into smaller reactive reagents i.e., C, H, H<sub>2,</sub> or CO, etc. depending on the composition of the precursor. Carbon in the form of graphene is deposited on the substrate, whereas, the residual gases flow out from the plasma region. The entire process is completed within a few seconds (Hatakeyama <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2017</xref>; Dato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>). Upon cooling, graphene deposited substrates are collected from the chamber and are well-kept for further investigations.</p><p id="Par14">The PECVD reaction process is fast and efficient; however, it involves several factors influencing the process. For example, process parameters such as plasma power, precursor flow rate, chamber pressure, substrate temperature, etc. affect the synthesis method significantly (Al-Jumaili et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2022</xref>; Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2016a</xref>). An overview of the method is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The next section will address these factors, explaining how they have been used in the past and their impact on the quality of graphene.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>An overview of the PECVD process to synthesize graphene</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_102_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Input parameters</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Plasma power</title><p id="Par15">Plasma sources such as radio frequency (RF) and microwave (MW) in the frequency range of 1â500Â MHz and 0.5â10Â GHz respectively, and direct current (dc) plasma are commercially available to be utilized in different applications. For the synthesis of graphene, most researchers prefer using RF and MW at the frequencies of 13.56Â MHz and 2.45Â GHz respectively (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2016a</xref>). These are standard industrial frequencies and are considered optimum values for the quality of the product (Vollath <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2008</xref>). Both types of plasmas have been optimized for different powers and have shown quality results.</p><p id="Par16">Nang and Kim (Nang and Kim <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">2012</xref>) studied the effect of RF power on the synthesis of graphene on Cu substrate from CH<sub>4</sub> precursor. For this purpose, the substrate was first preheated at 950Â Â°C. Then among 50, 200, 400, and 600Â W they reported 200Â W, as a suitable power for quality production of graphene. Unlike RF plasma, high power of the microwave, typically above 1Â kW was used to synthesize the graphene (Hiramatsu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2013</xref>; Kalita et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2012</xref>; Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2011a</xref>; Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2013</xref>; Malesevic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2008</xref>). However, it should be noted that contrary to RF plasma, no substrate pre-heating is involved in microwave plasma. In the substrate-free synthesis of graphene using microwave plasma, (Dato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>) varied the plasma power from 350 to 1100Â W and determined that the change in power had no substantial effect on graphene synthesis. It was noted that the low power of plasma was sufficient to produce the required quality of graphene.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Precursor</title><p id="Par17">Precursor, also known as monomer or feedstock plays a vital role in the synthesis and properties of graphene. It has been found that the properties of synthesized graphene are not only affected by the composition of the precursor but also the flow rate of the precursor (Dato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>). Therefore, scientists have investigated varieties of precursors. The key point in all precursors is that they must contain carbon compounds (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2016</xref>). The fragmentation of a precursor is the primary step in all PECVD processes. The fragmentation process of a hydrocarbon precursor is highly endothermic and thus require a high temperature. Because of this process, the carbon will form graphene on the substrate. The by-products in the reaction are H<sub>2</sub> and CO, depending on the composition of the precursor. Some have used carbon-based chemicals, which are fossil fuels. These include but are not limited to methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) (Guermoune et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2011</xref>; Wassei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">2012</xref>; Zafar and Jacob <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">2022</xref>), toluene (C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>8</sub>) (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">2012</xref>), xylene (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>) (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2014</xref>), hexane(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>) (Gao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2012</xref>), ethylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>) (Somekh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2014</xref>), ethanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH), methanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH) (Guermoune et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2011</xref>), acetylene(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) (Qi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2013</xref>) etc. The hydrocarbons are usually mixed with hydrogen before they are supplied into the chamber. These precursors, mostly produced by fossil decomposition are highly toxic as well as prone to depletion over time.</p><p id="Par18">Lately, renewable hydrocarbon-based precursors have been used which are found in enormous amounts on earth. The prime benefits of using these precursors are that they are easily accessible and can keep the reaction process green. To date, following precursors have been used; sesame oil (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2014</xref>), <italic>Melaleuca alternifolia</italic> is commonly known as tea tree (Jacob et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2015</xref>), camphor (Sharma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2013</xref>), turpentine (Awasthi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>), geranium (Al-Jumaili, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2022</xref>), eucalyptus (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2017</xref>), palm (Nasir et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2017</xref>), and soybean oil (Seo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2017</xref>). Moreover, eatable products such as honey, biscuits, sugar, milk, and cheese have excitedly shown the viability of being potential precursors for the synthesis of graphene (Seo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2013a</xref>).</p><p id="Par19">Overall, it has been found that the used precursors can be in solid, liquid, and gaseous forms. Nonetheless, the results have shown that the quality of graphene is far better in gaseous precursors compared with solids or liquids (Deng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2019a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Gas and precursor flow</title><p id="Par20">Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) gas in combination with a precursor is generally used in the synthesis of graphene. Only a few have used argon (Ar) without H<sub>2</sub>, however, the quality of graphene is compromised in this method (Peng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2013</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">2011</xref>). The proportion of gas relative to that of the precursor also has a significant effect on the synthesis process. Not only does it determine the final product, i.e., carbon nanotube (CNT), graphite, and/or graphene but also plays a role in shaping the morphology and structure of the graphene (Bo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>). (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">2004</xref>) studied the effect of the H<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> ratio in synthesis on gold (Au) substrate. Using the MW-PECVD at temperatures between 650 and 700Â Â°C, and varying only H<sub>2</sub> concentration, they found considerable impact of H<sub>2</sub> gas on synthesis. A higher concentration of H<sub>2</sub> i.e., H<sub>2</sub> /CH<sub>4</sub> ratio of 100, which is used for diamond film formation, showed no observable outcome. Decreasing the ratio to 30 showed some columnar structures, further decrease showed a mixture of fibers/tubes and graphite nanosheets. Additional lowering of the ratio to reach the range of 4â8 produced vertical graphene nanosheets. (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">2004</xref>) studied the effects of CH<sub>4</sub> concentration by varying it from 10 to 100% in H<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. They used an RF plasma system at the power of 900Â W while changing substrate temperatures from 600 to 900Â Â°C. All specimens yielded the same vertically standing graphene flakes of similar thicknesses. However, with the increase of CH<sub>4</sub> concentration, the size of sheet decreased; meanwhile the density of graphene decreased as well. Generally, gas ratio of CH<sub>4</sub>/H<sub>2</sub> higher than 1:20 is depicted as optimum for vertical graphene synthesis in PECVD (Bo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par21">Hydrogen, either mixed with inert gasses (argon or helium) or in pristine form, play a vital role in the synthesis of graphene film on a substrate. Hydrogen acts as a catalyst and controls the grain size and shape by etching away the weak carbon bonds. Hydrogen partial pressure also affects the number of layers of graphene. It also has been noted that in the absence of hydrogen, graphene might not form (Vlassiouk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Chamber pressure</title><p id="Par22">The chamber pressure has shown remarkable influences on the production rate of graphene. For instance, sub-atmospheric pressure has a low production rate while high vacuum pressure is favorable to attain a high production rate in microwave plasma. It happens, because the collisions between electrons and heavy particles which causes high temperature, is a key part of the process. Sub-atmospheric plasma does not favor this collisional phenomenon, hence a rise in temperature does not occur which eventually slows down the graphene synthesis (Dato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>). However, to get high-quality graphene, without any impurities, it is important to vacuum the chamber. In literature, a wide range of chamber pressures has been used. It includes high vacuum pressure, low pressure (0.01â0.02Â mbar), and atmospheric pressure (1014Â mbar) (MuÃ±oz and GÃ³mez-Aleixandre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Temperature</title><p id="Par23">Temperature is an essential factor in any graphene synthesis process. Depending on C-H bonding energy, temperature also varies from one precursor to another. Compared with thermal and CVD processes, the PECVD process can be performed at lower temperatures. It is due to the presence of active ions and energetic electrons which can assist in breaking down the chains of molecules (Dato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>). Based on the plasma source, some PECVD processes require precursor and/or substrate heating. In dc glow discharge, the substrate as well as the precursor must be heated. MW and RF-PECVD also require substrate heating. However, some of the MW plasma systems do not rely on the heating of the precursor or the substrate (Bo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">The substrate is heated externally, thus an additional heating element is coupled with the quartz tube. The heating temperature of the substrate depends on the conditions of other parameters. In most of the studies, substrate temperature usually differs from 600 and 1000Â Â°C. (Rao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2009</xref>) have shown a very low substrate temperature i.e., 400Â Â°C for the synthesis of carbon nanostructures. In another study, it was revealed that graphene could not be produced at a temperature below 600Â Â°C. In addition, the substrate temperature happens to have an effect on the density of the synthesized graphene. Higher temperatures, for example, more than 730Â Â°C produced high-density graphene (Bo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2013</xref>). Apart from substrate temperature, plasma generation also causes some increase in the temperature. Therefore, at the time of reaction, the temperature inside the chamber is always higher than the measured substrate temperature (RincÃ³n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Process</title><p id="Par25">RF and MW plasma are widely studied plasma sources. The main role of plasma is twofold, i.e., heat transfer and transfer of momentum to breakdown the chains of precursor molecules. This role helps to lower the pre-heating temperature of the substrate.

They used a high 1000Â W plasma power, which can build a temperature from 400 to 450Â Â°C. The Raman spectroscopy results showed evidence of some graphene. However, the quality of graphene was compromised, as the D peak, which indicates the number of defects, was quite high. (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015a</xref>) attempted to synthesize graphene at a quite low temperature of 300Â Â°C and studied the effects of deposition time on the thickness of graphene. Their results presented graphene of thickness varying from 10 to 600Â nm, which is higher than most reported thicknesses of graphene. The Raman spectra also did not produce the desired outcome as the D peak was quite higher and the 2D peak was quite lower than the G peak.

It can be attributed to the fact that the plasma power leads to the formation of a high concentration of radicals on the surface of Ni, which in turn promotes carbon growth on the surface. Likewise, (Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">2010</xref>) adopted the same parametric approach using relatively medium temperatures. They used Cobalt (Co) as a substrate. In their results, they mentioned that Co has a vital role in synthesizing better quality graphene.</p><p id="Par28">(Vizireanu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2008</xref>) performed a parametric study and found that the gas mixture Ar/H<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> flow rate has a noteworthy influence on the morphology of graphene. In addition, temperatures greater than 600Â Â°C, plasma power between 250 and 400Â W, and the argon mass flow rate greater than 500 sccm are important factors for graphene growth. Song et al.

(Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2019a</xref>) studied the effect of gas pressure on graphene synthesis at a higher temperature. For instance, the growth rate of graphene at 950Â Â°C temperature and 1.2Â torr pressure is slower than that at 570 mTorr. It is mainly due to the slower carbon supply from the gas phase to the substrate.</p><p id="Par31">(Ma et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2019b</xref>) studied the effects of plasma power source and growth temperatures on the morphology of vertically grown graphene. Varying the power source from 80 to 280Â W, they noticed vertical graphene flakes forming a bush-like shape. They named it a tree-like structure as it appeared like one when seen from above in SEM microscope. Similarly, varying the temperature of the substrate from 700 to 850Â Â°C greatly influenced the tree-like morphology. When the temperatures are lowered, the distance between each tree is reduced prominently, while the height of tree-like structure increases. The flakes of graphene in tree-like structure become interlinked.

At later stages of growth, they observed a similar formation phenomenon in which layers of graphene flakes were developed. (Kalita et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2012</xref>) prepared graphene film at the lowest temperature of 240Â Â°C.

For graphene, (Dato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>) were the first to show the possibility of synthesis of free-standing graphene in a similar reactor. They used a quartz chamber, which has an alumina tube concentrated in a quartz tube. The alumina tube was used to deliver carbon precursor i.e., ethanol, directly into the plasma stream. The schematic illustration of their system is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a. The dissociation of ethanol vapors and their conversion into solid matter occurred in a short interval, and a 2Â mg/min production rate was recorded.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic illustrations of plasma reactors used by (Dato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>) <bold>b</bold> (Tatarova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2017</xref>) <bold>c</bold> (MÃ¼nzer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2018</xref>) <bold>d</bold> (Toman, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2021</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_102_Fig5_HTML.png" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par43">(Tatarova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2013</xref>) used surface wave-induced microwave plasma to synthesize free-standing graphene. Considering the crucial role of outlet plasma stream, they modified the system with a cryostat to control the temperature at the nucleation zone. With small modifications, they used the same system for the synthesis of N-doped graphene as well. Briefly, it consists of a 2.45Â GHz generator, which is connected with the waveguide, quartz tubes, and hurricane cyclone system followed by a methanol trap. They actively controlled the gas flow rate and temperature by MKS247 Readout and infrared irradiation of the wall respectively. Vaporization was performed by passing argon gas through an ethanol tank (Tatarova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2017</xref>). The system is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b.</p><p id="Par44">(Melero et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2017</xref>) used a special microwave plasma torch, named as TIAGO (Torche a Injection Axiale sur Guide dâOndes, in French) torch. It is a one-nozzle component, providing a single flame of plasma. The torch supplied with argon gas opens inside a quartz chamber and forms plasma having the appearance of a jet conical flame. They adjusted the system with efficient argon and precursor input i.e. ethanol mixer system, which allowed the control of ethanol vapors supply. The Controlled Evaporator Mixer (CEM, Bronkhorst) along with the ethanol vaporization system is superior to bubblers in terms of stability and accuracy.</p><p id="Par45">(MÃ¼nzer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2018</xref>) used the same approach as (Dato <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2019</xref>) and (Tatarova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2013</xref>) as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c. However, they supplied ethanol using an external syringe pump at an optimized flow rate. Moreover, they also investigated the effect of reactorâs pressure by varying it from 1000 to 1500Â mbar.</p><p id="Par46">(Toman, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2021</xref>) synthesized graphene in a dualâchannel microwave plasma torch at atmospheric conditions. The setup is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>d. The system was fixed with two supply channels i.e. central and secondary channels for argon and argon-ethanol mixture respectively. The advantage of this specific design is that the system can also be fed with oxygen and/or hydrogen gasses through the central or secondary channel. The precursor flow was controlled by the mass-loss method, which may not have had a precise and active control on ethanol vapors. Nonetheless, an efficient method for the collection of graphene nanosheets is needed, as the collection from the walls of the container is tiresome for upscaling of the method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Precursors and their role in graphene formation</title><p id="Par47">Few precursors have been explored for microwave plasma synthesis of free-standing graphene. (Dato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>; Dato and Frenklach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2010</xref>) employed different precursors and investigated their role in shaping the final morphology of graphene. They supplied precursors into the plasma in an aerosol form. Their main study was on investigating ethanol as a precursor, however, they also studied methanol, isopropyl alcohol (IPA), dimethyl ether (DME). The methanol feed showed no apparent formation of substances. It could be due to two possibilities; either plasma power was not enough to breakdown the methanol into its constituents or only gas substances were formed which escaped the outlet of the reaction chamber. On the other hand, IPA formed carbon soot, whereas, DME showed encouraging results for graphene synthesis.</p><p id="Par48">Ethanol is the most commonly used precursor in the gas-phase synthesis of graphene. In (Dato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>) work, ethanol formed single and bilayers graphene nanosheets at a microwave power of 250Â W at the rate of 2Â mg/min. (Tatarova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2013</xref>) made graphene having 1â5 number of layers from ethanol at a microwave power of 900Â W. Similarly, (Melero et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2017</xref>) observed 2â7 layers of graphene from ethanol at a microwave power of 300Â W. In their work, ethanol produced 1.33Â mg/min of graphene from 33Â mg/min of ethanol consumption, which is comparable with the findings of (Dato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>), where they obtained 2Â mg/min graphene but at the cost of 3 times higher ethanol consumption.</p><p id="Par49">The composition of the precursor especially C/O ratio has a profound effect on graphene formation (Dato and Frenklach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2010</xref>). It was noted that to develop CâC bonding in graphene, a suitable amount of carbon is necessary. Since the C/O ratio in methanol (CH<sub>3</sub>OH) is one, it is more likely to produce CO instead of CâC bonding. On the other hand, a higher C/O ratio as in the case of IPA (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O) will form carbon soot. The C/O ratio in ethanol (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH) has been reported to be appropriate to initiate CâC bonding. DME (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O), which has the same C/O ratio as ethanol, showed promising results for graphene synthesis. A single carbon is deemed insufficient to give forth CâC bonding, instead it may form CO. The above description also highlights the significance of the presence of oxygen in the formation of graphene as well as overall production rate.</p><p id="Par50">Encouraging results on graphene formation have been reported using methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) as the only source of carbon at a microwave power ofâ~â1Â kW (Bundaleska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018a</xref>; Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2019a</xref>). Interestingly, methane, which carries only one unit of carbon negates the fact that carbon should be in CâC form to produce graphene. However, it should also be noted that the O in methane is absent and CO formation might not happen.</p><p id="Par51">The influence of the flow rate of ethanol and plasma gas on the structure of synthesized products has also been analyzed. (Tatarova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2013</xref>; Tatarova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2014</xref>; Tatarova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2016</xref>) studied the effect of aerosol flow rate ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 sccm. A flow rate of 0.6 sccm for ethanol and 250 sccm for Ar showed the highest quality graphene. In another study, (Tatarova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2017</xref>) raised the ethanol flow rate to 30 sccm, and Ar to 1200 sccm to synthesize graphene. It was suggested by them that a short precursor residence time would avoid the agglomeration of graphene into graphite. They observed ethanol decomposing into C, H, H<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, and CO (Tatarova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2014</xref>). (Dato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>; Dato and Frenklach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2010</xref>) mentioned the formation of CO, C<sub>2,</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> as well. However, they linked C<sub>2</sub> formation with the C/O ratio of the precursor. In mass spectrometeric analysis, (RincÃ³n et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2015</xref>) observed CO, H<sub>2</sub>, and traces of acetylene and methane as a by-product. (MÃ¼nzer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2018</xref>) synthesized high quality and largest quantity of graphene at 1Â mL/min flow rate of ethanol. (Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2019a</xref>) added hydrogen in the precursor to study the influence of hydrogen on graphene structure. They found that higher the ratio of H/C, greater would be the yield of graphene.</p><p id="Par52">The role of oxygen in the synthesis of free-standing graphene using microwave plasma has also been investigated. It was found that the reactant concentration has a great influence on the graphene formation. The low content of the reactant concentration reduces the soot formation, and promotes the graphene production. The amount of water in the precursor promotes CO formations, and hence the graphene formation (Fortugno et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Microwave power</title><p id="Par53">Microwave power plays an important part in dissociating the precursor and raising the electron temperature in the plasma chamber (Dato and Frenklach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2010</xref>). A range of microwave powers, for instance, as low as 250 W (Dato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>) and as high as 2 kW (Tatarova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2017</xref>) have been investigated to synthesize graphene. It has been noted that for ethanol precursors, the microwave power does not significantly affect the structure of graphene. Graphene was formed at all microwave powers. However, other alcoholic compounds, such as isopropyl alcohol, start forming soot-like carbonaceous particles at higher microwave power (Dato and Frenklach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2010</xref>).</p><p id="Par54">In another study on the synthesis of graphene from ethanol, (Tatarova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2014</xref>) observed that decreasing the power below 500 W formed carbon nanoparticles instead of graphene (Fig <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). They ascribed this to supersaturation occurring inside the chamber due to the decrease in gas temperature. However, the TIAGO torch operating at a low microwave power of 300 W revealed the formation of pure graphene consisting of a few layers (Melero et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2017</xref>). Thus, it can be stated that the design of the plasma reactors also carries a strong influence on the final structure of the carbon material.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Effect of ethanol flux and microwave power on carbon nanostructure (Tatarova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2014</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_102_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par55">(Bundaleska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2018a</xref>) synthesized graphene from methane at a microwave power of 1 kW. Interestingly, the same microwave power of 1 kW but with higher methane and Ar flow rates formed diamond-like structures. They also developed a theoretical model, which indicated the formation of solid carbon compounds at higher microwave powers such as 1.5 kW. (Toman, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2021</xref>) have studied the influence of the microwave power on the structure of graphene. They reported that the transition of material from amorphous to crystalline form depends on the microwave power, ethanol flow rate, and molecules mixture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Comparison of the graphene structure and morphology</title><p id="Par56">(TATAROVA et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2014</xref>) controlled the wall temperature of the plasma chamber using a cryostat and studied its influence on the quality of graphene. It was noted that external heating or cooling does have some effect on the structure of graphene. For instance, low wall temperatures form carbon nanoparticles, whereas temperatures above 60Â Â°C promote graphene formation. Also, the samples showed lower number of monolayers when the wall temperatures were kept above 60Â Â°C. However, the Raman spectra shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> displayed an intense peak for the wall temperature of 60Â Â°C as compared to that of 80Â Â°C. This can be attributed to the structural defects in the samples created at 60Â Â°C. The low-resolution images shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> showed monolayers and a few layers of graphene nanosheets. In addition, it can be observed that some of the sheets are overlapping and folded at the edges.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Raman spectra and corresponding TEM images showing the effect of chamber wall temperatures (Tatarova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2014</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_102_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p><p id="Par57">The effect of precursor flow rate on the quality and production amount of graphene has also been investigated thoroughly. In a work presented by (Casanova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2021</xref>), they found that varying the ethanol flow rate from 2 to 3.4Â g/hr, increases graphene production steadily. However, a further rise in ethanol flow rate not only reduces the quantity of graphene but also starts forming carbonaceous particles. This can be illustrated through the Raman spectra (shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>a, b) which also shows the intensity ratios i.e., <italic>I</italic><sub>2D</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>G</sub> and <italic>I</italic><sub>2D</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>G</sub> at different ethanol flow rates. Only 4Â g/hr flow rate of ethanol showed I<sub>2D</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> value of less than one, which is indicative of multilayer graphene. However, a 3.4Â g/hr flow rate of ethanol can be considered optimum parameter in this synthesis since the value of I<sub>D</sub>/I<sub>G</sub>, which suggest the defects in the structure, is the lowest. Overall, all the samples of different ethanol flow rates showed evidence of graphene formation. The D (~â1350Â cm<sup>â1</sup>), G (~â1580Â cm<sup>â1</sup>) and 2D (~â2700Â cm<sup>â1</sup>) bands can be observed in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. The low values of I<sub>D</sub>/I<sub>G</sub>, ranging between 0.2 and 0.35 indicated the low number of defects in the sample. The shoulder peak in G band arises due to intra valley transition (Sukumaran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2018</xref>) and corresponds to weak disorder-induced feature (Toth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">2015</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Raman spectra of samples showing the effect of ethanol precursor flow rate, <bold>b</bold><italic>I</italic><sub>D</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>G</sub> (black circles) and <italic>I</italic><sub>2D</sub>/<italic>I</italic><sub>G</sub> (red squares) values of the Raman spectrum obtained at different flow rate of ethanol (Casanova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2021</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_102_Fig8_HTML.png" id="MO8"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene</title><p id="Par58">The scope of atmospheric pressure microwave plasma has now been extended to the synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene (N-graphene). It has been proven that it is possible to synthesize a good quality N-graphene in a single-step using an atmospheric pressure microwave plasma system. However, the high-resolution N1s spectra of these materials have revealed that the pyrollic N that is considered important for some applications was absent. Moreover, the procedure involved the usage of an additional nitrogen gas supply along with the consumption of a 2Â kW high microwave power. This practice makes the process energy-intensive (Tatarova et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2017</xref>). In another attempt to synthesize in-situ N-graphene, (Bundaleska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018b</xref>) used ammonia instead of nitrogen along with ethanol. The high-resolution N1s results showed the presence of pyridinic, pyrrolic, and graphitic nitrogen. However, they also used a high microwave power of 2Â kW. Moreover, ammonia being a toxic chemical is not an appropriate choice for the synthesis.</p><p id="Par59">(Tsyganov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2020</xref>) synthesized N-graphene by injecting ammonia directly into different zones of plasma. They found that the injection position plays a role in determining the doping level of nitrogen in graphene and the yield of N-graphene. Recently, another approach for single-step synthesis of nitrogen-doped graphene oxide (N-GO) has been reported (Zafar, et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">2022</xref>). They eliminated the usage of any additional gas or precursor and synthesized the N-GO from aniline as a sole precursor. Also, they brought down the microwave power to 80Â W, which was a substantial reduction in the usage of the energy.

However, nitrogen-doped graphene oxide coating improved the flux recovery ratio (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>d), which can be attributed to the excellent anti-scaling properties of the nitrogen-doped graphene oxide material (Zafar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">2022b</xref>).<fig id="Fig14"><label>Fig. 14</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic demonstration of the nitrogen-doped graphene oxide -coated-polyamide membrane, <bold>b</bold> water contact angle of the polyamide and <bold>c</bold> nitrogen-doped graphene oxide-coated-polyamide membranes, and <bold>d</bold> flux recovery ratio after number of cycles of water filtration (Zafar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">2022b</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41614_2022_102_Fig14_HTML.png" id="MO14"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Applications in catalysis and battery</title><p id="Par92">The dispersion of nanoparticles on base materials is critical for catalysis applications. It is highly desired that the catalytic nanoparticles should have high surface area, and avoid any aggregation (Zhu and Xu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">2016</xref>; Gao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2019</xref>). Graphene for dispersion of nanoparticles can play an important role. In a study, gold nanoparticles of varying diameters were spread on graphene synthesized through atmospheric pressure microwave plasma. The study revealed that the small sizes nanoparticles i.e. less than 10Â nm tend to locate on the edges of the graphene nsnosheets, and avoided aggregations. It means, nanoparticles less than 10Â nm dispersed on graphene nanosheets can be useful in catalysis applications (Jeon and Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2011</xref>).</p><p id="Par93">In another study by (Jo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2016</xref>) Pt/graphene nanocomposite was prepared in microwave plasma. The nanocomposite was investigated for its application in electrocatalysis. Investigated through cyclic voltammetry, the Pt/graphene nanocomposite showed excellent electrocatalytic activity for the methanol oxidation. Compared with other Pt composites with carbon and graphene, this study revealed that the electrocatalytic results were superior. It can be attributed to the high dispersion of Pt on graphene, and grapheneâs high electrocatalytic properties.</p><p id="Par94">Graphene nanosheets synthesized in atmospheric pressure microwave plasma havw also been used for its application in battery. For instance, graphene nanosheets and Si nanocomposite was used in Li-ion battery. Compared with other reported Si composites, graphene/Si nanocomposite anode outperformed all those and showed superior Coulomb efficiency and longer stability (MÃ¼nzer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2018</xref>; Tan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2103</xref>; Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Conclusion and future outlook</title><p id="Par95">The production of superior quality graphene in a fast and efficient way is one of the merits of Plasma-based synthesis method. PECVD synthesis of graphene is a widely adopted bottom-down approach capable of producing monolayer to few layers graphene. In comparison to top-down methods where graphite is the main resource for graphene, PECVD is a versatile approach as it can synthesize graphene from a diverse range of precursors, such as natural gas, botanical hydrocarbons, food products, polymers, wastes, etc. Furthermore, shorter processing time and absence of additional chemical requirements are two more benefits of PECVD. However, the need for high vacuum and low chamber pressure makes the process tiresome. In addition, the requisite for a substrate and the subsequent transfer of graphene for further applications are some issues needed to be addressed in this procedure. Moreover, the biggest challenge for this technique is the scalable preparation of graphene. Therefore, to convert this system into an industrial-scale process, more attention must be given to the scalable synthesis of graphene.</p><p id="Par96">Atmospheric pressure microwave plasma synthesis of graphene is another state-of-the-art technique to synthesize graphene. This method certainly has some advantages over PECVD as it does not require high vacuum or low chamber pressure conditions to produce graphene. In contrast to PECVD, it offers scalable graphene; however, the amount synthesized is still not adequate for large-scale production. Besides, the process is generally reliant on the usage of non-sustainable precursors. Thus, it is pivotal to substitute these unrenewable precursors with environmental-friendly and sustainable resources. It is extremely critical to demonstrate the real application of any material; however, the practical usage of graphene synthesized through atmospheric pressure microwave plasma has scarcely been reported. Therefore, it is highly crucial to demonstrate the potential applications of graphene produced through this method.</p><p id="Par97">Furthermore, a theoretical study of the complex growth environment of the atmospheric pressure plasma, as well as PECVD, should be carried out for a complete understanding of the process. The above-mentioned processes have used only a continuous mode of plasma. Varying the plasma source to pulse mode may vary the chamber environment substantially. Thus, its effects on the synthesis should be investigated. Remarkable work on the synthesis of nanocomposite of graphene with other nanomaterials using wet chemical methods is widely reported. However, the synthesis in a dry and chemical-free environment of plasma still lacks. Scale-up of the laboratory-scale reaction chambers is essential for the industrialization of the technologies. Although, applications of plasma-synthesized graphene in electrochemical sensors, batteries, supercapacitors, membranes, etc. have been demonstrated at a lab scale. It is also very important to showcase its broad use in potential future applications such as transistors, semiconductors, bendable phones, medical science, wearable electronics and sensors, metals recovery, crop protection and growth, etc.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>M.A.Z. gratefully acknowledges James Cook University, Townsville for research funding and Australian Government for stipend through International Research Training Program Scholarship.</p></ack><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par98">The authors claims that they have no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aissou</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Braidy</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Veilleux</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">A new one-step deposition approach of graphene nanoflakes coating using a radio frequency plasma: synthesis, characterization and tribological behaviour</article-title><source>Tribol.
