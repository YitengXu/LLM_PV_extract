The implementation of large-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems is often disrupted due to the unavailability of land. The FSPV systems, where the PV modules are floated in water bodies facilitate optimal utilization of water resources and land assets. The FSPV  provides higher power output compared to land-based PV systems of the equal area because of improved energy conversion efficiency at a lower temperature. Another opportunity for the FSPV system is integration with hydropower stations, storage systems, and the electric grid. This paper explores the flood duration curve-based optimal sizing of the FSPV System with the objective of electrification of rural micro-grid. A comparison of energy output and module temperature rise has been made for the FSPV system and its equivalent land-based PV system of equal area. The system generates 18.08 GWh, which is 10.04% more than the land-based PV system. The DC Capacity factor is 17.2%. The Demand Supply Factor (<italic>DSF</italic>) for a particular day in winter, spring, summer, and monsoon is 37.55%, 41.7%, 45.9%, and 25% respectively. The results indicate that the FSPV system is a sustainable alternative to power renewable energy-based mini micro-grid and provide cost effective electricity to all.

With rising population and increase in per capita energy consumption, the government is seriously concerned about energy security.</p><p id="Par3">Especially in 2021, the world saw a 6% increase in electricity demand (over 1500 TWh) primarily due to economic recovery from covid-19 pandemic; accompanied by unforeseen weather-related events such as colder-than-average winter and hotter summer. This resulted in serious fuel and power shortages worldwide in the first half of 2021. Simultaneously the environmental impacts of conventional fossil fuels and extreme weather conditions due climate change has emphasised the need for sustainable development in the electricity sector. In 26th Conference of Parties (COP26) more than 50 countries including European Union have committed for net zero greenhouse gas emission (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>). Renewable Energy Sources (RES) like wind, solar photovoltaic (PV) and small-scale hydropower are instrumental for meeting the energy demand of the future as well as fulfilling the net zero emission targets. Net capacity addition of renewable energy is expected to exceed 300 GW in 2022; PV installations being the largest share in terms of technology (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">As on 2021, the worldwide installed capacity of PV was 843,086 MW (IRENA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2022</xref>). For rural electrification, the PV based micro-grids are recognised to have positive economic and social impacts that improve the standard of living in remote areas (Tsai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2021</xref>). PV systems, when coupled with other renewable sources like wind or hydroelectric plants improve system reliability and economy. Goswami et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>) proposed a solar-wind hybrid system for electrification of a remote island in Sunderban. The levelized cost of electricity was found to be lower than the grid electricity of the area. Solar PV systems, by the virtue to its scalability find diverse applications as ground mounted, roof-top PV, Building-Integrated-PV and FSPV systems. As the sizes of roof-top PV and BIPV systems are constrained by the building architecture, policymakers have relied on the ground mounted PV systems for PV capacity addition on large scale (IRENA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">However, unavailability of land for large scale PV installation is a major issue for countries with a large population density. If the installation is based solely on maximisation of PV generation potential, agricultural land, forest and biodiversity would be heavily impacted, which in turn contribute to environmental degradations and increment in carbon-emission (Kiesecker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2019</xref>). A study on EU, India, Japan and South Korea indicated that land-based PV system at 25 to 80% energy mix will occupy 0.5 to 5% of the total land area by 2050. The corresponding change in land cover result an emission of up to 50 g CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh electricity generation (Van de Ven et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2021</xref>). The current PV technology converts nearly 20% of solar energy to electricity; the rest amount is dissipated as heat energy to the ambient. Large-scale land-based PV installations cause Photovoltaic Heat Island (PHI) effect, due to lack of thermal regulation. With PV installations in proximity to residential areas, PHI might contribute to the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects that increase the local temperature (Barron et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2016</xref>). Land based PV systems are impacted by non-uniform shading conditions caused by neighbouring trees, civil constructions (buildings and towers), soiling and dust. This results in higher mismatching losses in the array that reduces output power generation and creates multiple peaks in power-voltage and current–voltage characteristics that puts the conventional Maximum-Peak-Power-Tracking (MPPT) systems in challenging situation (Yadav and Mukherjee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Floating Solar Photovoltaic (FSPV) systems overcome the limitations of land-based utility scale PV installations. The PV panels are kept on a structure floating over the water-bodies such as artificial reservoirs, estuary and ocean, lakes, mining pit, water treatment plants etc. Spencer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2018</xref>) presented the opportunity of FSPV systems on man-made reservoirs. The FSPV design and installation is easier on such reservoirs due to availability of accurate bathymetric data. The FSPV plants installed on the reservoirs previously made for irrigation and hydroelectric generation; has opportunities to integrate with main grid as well as to the pumped storage plants. Such hybrid systems provide better energy security with increased generation capacity and better hydropower generation due to reduction of evaporation loss (Gonzalez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2021</xref>). Ravichandran and Panneerselvam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2021</xref>) evaluated an FSPV system of 5 MW capacities on an artificial reservoir in India. The FSPV provides annual electricity of 160 GWh and saves 1.4 million cubic meters of water by reducing evaporation losses. Lee et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2020</xref>) estimated a global generation potential of 10,616 TWh for FSPV integrated hydropower systems. Shyam et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2022</xref>) explored the integration of small scale FSPV system with a pumped-storage hydroelectric plant<bold>.</bold></p><p id="Par7">In FSPV system the land-energy conflicts (electricity generation vs. agricultural use of land) are avoided by optimal utilization of land assets and water resources. For FSPV systems, the cost for land acquisition and site preparation is drastically reduced (Goswami et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>). Makhjia et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2021</xref>) proposed the off-grid FSPV system for electrification of a remote area in Chhattisgarh where grid extension would have caused deforestation and more right of way cost. Moreover, the losses due to shading and soiling in FSPV are lesser than that of land-based PV. Hafeez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2022</xref>) identified two key benefits of FSPV on urban lakes, firstly avoidance of land-acquisition costs and lesser maintenance cost due to reduced soiling. The FSPV system has higher energy output compared to land-based PV systems with equal area and equal solar irradiation. Liu et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>) estimated the improvement in efficiency of floating solar cell as 1.58 to 2% compared to terrestrial solar cell in Chinese climatic conditions. In Norway, 5% to 6% higher yield due to evaporative cooling of FSPV system is reported by Kjeldstad et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2021</xref>). The points of concern that prevents the widespread development of FSPV system are lack of exhaustive guidelines for installation, proper design analysis, economic operation, maintenance of FSPV system and regulatory barriers regarding water rights (Gadzanku et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par8">This paper presents a design analysis and optimal sizing methodology for a FSPV system installed on a reservoir addressing the above issues, to power a mini micro-grid in India.

The maximum available area is chosen in terms of the 80% availability of reservoir water level. 1% of that area has been utilized to cater the demand of rural micro-grid. The requirement of mooring and anchoring design has been evaluated from flood duration curves where the fluctuation of water level is estimated to be 3 m.</p><p id="Par69">The study area has an annual energy requirement of 15.85 GWh at a load factor of 55.24%. The FSPV system requires total 42,068 PV modules (26 modules per strings and 1618 strings in parallel) and 5 inverters of 2 MW rating. The system with an 11 MW installed capacity annually generates 18.08 GWh, which is 10.03% higher than the equivalent land-based PV system. March experiences the highest monthly generation and July corresponds to the lowest, due to variation in solar irradiation and average temperature. The energy yield is found to be 1507 kWh/kW (10.03% higher than the equivalent land-based PV system). The performance ratio of the FSPV system is calculated to be 83.4% which is 7.8% higher than the land-based PV system. The comparison between statistical distributions of power output in FSPV system and equivalent land-based PV system indicates better utilization of installed capacity for floating solar photovoltaic systems. For the FSPV system with 11 MW installed capacity, 19.20% of the data points have the generation higher than half of the installed capacity (i.e. 5.5 MW), compared to 16.49% of the datapoints for equivalent land based PV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par70">This paper presents a systematic study on design and development of FSPV system for powering micro-grid with an objective of improving energy security and RES penetration. The selected study area has a lower-than-average but steadily increasing per capita demand; resulting in occasional power outages. The lower share of renewable sources due to overreliance on coal-based-thermal-power plant indicates a remarkable scope of expansion for PV installation. The FDC based sizing methodology has been utilized in designing the FSPV plant. The FSPV system covers less than 1% of the reservoir which indicates that probable ecological impacts of FSPV would be negligible. The FSPV system reliably meets the electricity demand of the region for 9 to 11 h a day, with a small exception of few days in monsoon. The power for rest of the hours is to be supplied by the grid. However, the cost of electricity purchase from the grid is entirely or partially compensated if the excess generation from FSPV in day time is fed to the grid. The results indicate competitive advantages of FSPV over traditional land-based PV systems. This study would help the policy-makers, engineers and academia for planning and implementation of FSPV system as economic, low-carbon and renewable energy sources for sustainable development.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The authors acknowledge the help of Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT (ISM) Dhanbad for offering the necessary facilities to perform the research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Not Applicable.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par71">The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p id="Par72">This article does not contain any studies with human participants or animals performed by any of the authors.</p></sec><sec><title>Informed consent</title><p id="Par73">Informed consent is not applicable since human participants were not involved in the study.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Agrawal, S., Bali, N. and Urpelainen, J., (2019) Rural electrification in India: Customer behaviour and demand. <italic>Report, Smart Power India &amp; Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy</italic>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Al-Ghussain</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Samu</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Taylan</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Fahrioglu</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Sizing renewable energy systems with energy storage systems in microgrids for maximum cost-efficient utilization of renewable energy resources</article-title><source>Sustain Cities Soc</source><year>2020</year><volume>55</volume><fpage>102059</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.scs.2020.102059</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alktranee</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Bencs</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Effect of evaporative cooling on photovoltaic module performance</article-title><source>Proc Integ Optim Sustain</source><year>2022</year><volume>6</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>921</fpage><lpage>930</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s41660-022-00268-w</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Barron-Gafford</surname><given-names>GA</given-names></name><name><surname>Minor</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>NA</given-names></name><name><surname>Cronin</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>Brooks</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name><name><surname>Pavao-Zuckerman</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">The Photovoltaic heat island <underline>effect</underline>: larger solar power plants increase local temperatures</article-title><source>Sci Rep</source><year>2016</year><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1038/srep35070</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Central Electricity Authority (CEA) Dashboard.
