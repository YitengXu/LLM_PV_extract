To improve its efficiency, ferric chloride (FeCl<sub>3</sub>) was introduced as main catalyst. As mono catalyst, phosphomolybdic acid (PMo<sub>12</sub>) was much better than phosphotungstic acid (PW<sub>12</sub>) and FeCl<sub>3</sub> was intermediate between them. Compared with PMo<sub>12</sub> at the optimal dose of 0.30 mol/L, the combination of FeCl<sub>3</sub> (1.00 mol/L) and PW<sub>12</sub> (0.06 mol/L) achieved similar power output from glucose (2.59 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) or starch (1.57 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>), and even improved the maximum power density by 57% from 0.46 to 0.72 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> when using cellulose as the fuel. Long-term continuous operation of the LCFC indicated that carbohydrates can be hydrolyzed to glucose and then oxidized stepwise to carbon dioxide. At the latter stage, there was a linear relationship between the electron transfer number from glucose to catalyst and the subsequent cell performance. Based on these findings, the contribution of FeCl<sub>3</sub> to LCFC should be derived from the accelerated hydrolysis and oxidation of carbohydrates and the enhanced electron transfer from glucose to anode. The addition of FeCl<sub>3</sub> reduced the usage of polyoxometalates by 80%, and the replacement implied that LCFC can be operated less toxically and more economically.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_5535.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Bioenergy has been recognized as a key contributor to a sustainable society because of annual great yield of biomass and biomass waste. For example, the National Energy Administration of China reported that biomass waste could provide energy equivalent to 4.6 hundred million tons of standard coal annually in China, but only 5% of the biomass waste had been actually utilized<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Hence, bioenergy has great potential as a renewable energy source. Biomass can be converted to heat, electricity or fuels through different approaches including direct incineration, liquefaction, pyrolysis, gasification and anaerobic digestion. Compared with these conventional ways, fuel cells can convert biomass to electricity with higher energy efficiencies, but most of them can only utilize simple micro molecular fuels like hydrogen and methanol. For example, phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFCs), molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have been used for commercial applications, but they only deal with hydrogen, methane or carbon monoxide at high operational temperatures and biomass has to be decomposed or reformed to these simple fuels before fed into SOFCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">For complex biomass utilization and organic waste treatment, those fuel cells directly consuming biomass under mild conditions are very valuable and have been developing rapidly in recent years. Alkaline fuel cells (AFCs) or alkaline anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AAEMFCs) can be fueled by glucose and even cellulose, but these chemicals cannot be thoroughly decomposed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are capable to fully degrade large molecular organic compounds under mild conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, but some types of shock loading or toxics into MFCs would probably depress microbial activity during biomass waste treatment. Some kinds of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) can also directly utilize complex biomass for electricity generation. For example, an intermediate-temperature (75‒250 °C) fuel cell using phosphoric acid as catalyst can convert wood sawdust and pulp to carbon dioxide with output power density of 10 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> 
                        <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Alternatively, a novel liquid catalyzed fuel cell (LCFC) was also proposed with the assistance of polyoxymetalates (POMs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and it performed well in generating electricity with nature polymeric biomasses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In fact, direct liquid redox fuel cells have been investigated in 2008 as an improvement to direct methanol fuel cells for numbers of advantages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Most of all, this type of fuel cells allowed the use of three-dimensional electrodes and consequently increased the reaction area. LCFCs share a similar structure with liquid redox fuel cells, and POMs work as both homogeneous catalysts and charge carriers in catholyte and anolyte.</p><p id="Par4">The conversion from biomass to electricity in a LCFC includes three main steps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Biomass was first oxidized by a type of POM (noted as POM-I) in anolyte, and then the reduced POM-I was re-oxidized during the cell reaction between anolyte and catholyte. In catholyte, oxygen was directly supplied or another kind of POM (noted as POM-II, relatively higher electrode potential than POM-I) was used as the electron carrier between oxygen and cathode. POMs are fine catalysts for the oxidation of biomass and the hydrolysis of macromolecule organics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. With its help, starch and cellulose can be hydrolyzed to glucose and then oxidized to carbon dioxide in LCFCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Moreover, unlike other fuel cells, LCFCs use POMs for homogeneous catalysis instead of loading noble metal catalysts and they are insensitive to most contaminants. Due to its efficiency and adaptability, high output power density of 51 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> was achieved even using bush allamanda as the fuel at the operating temperature of 80 °C and the condition of sunlight<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. The high power output and the complete degradation of complex organic compounds implied its promising application in the field of organic waste treatment.</p><p id="Par5">Although limited works on LCFCs have been carried out, optimization and improvement are still necessary for its further practical application to biomass waste treatment. The current LCFCs use POMs as catalysts, which are commonly complex, toxic and relatively expensive. Hence, in this study, Lewis acids were introduced as co-catalysts, aiming to replace most POMs and also enhance the degradation of complex carbohydrates. Glucose was first chosen as the model substance to conclude the optimal operational condition of LCFC and compare the capabilities of different POMs and Lewis acids. After that, the degradation abilities of glucose, starch and cellulose in LCFCs were analyzed. Based on the degradation process of carbohydrates and the electron transfer process in LCFC, the function of the added Lewis acid in LCFC was deduced. Finally, we developed a new type of LCFC using ferric chloride to replace most of complex POMs as co-catalyst, which is simpler, cheaper and more effective in degrading complex carbohydrates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Construction and operation of LCFC</title><p id="Par6">The structure of the LCFC studied herein combined some features of PEMFCs and redox flow batteries (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Both the anolyte and the catholyte were stored in two electrolyte tanks and pumped into the fuel cell using peristaltic pumps. The cell was separated by a proton exchange membrane (Nafion 115, Dupont, USA) and it was sandwiched by two graphite felts as 3D extended electrodes. The sandwich was clamped by two graphite plates (Hongjun, Shanghai, China). All the contents were inset into an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic shell. There was a square-shaped channel on the shell with 7 mm deep, 20 mm long and 20 mm wide, and the graphite plat was fixed on the bottom of the channel and a part of it stretched out of the shell for exporting the current. The graphite felt with a thickness of 10 mm was loaded in the channel, fitting closely with the graphite plate. A gasket was put between the shell and the proton exchange membrane to prevent liquid leakage. The thickness of the gasket was 2 mm so the place for the graphite felts was totally 9 mm in depth considering the depth of the channel itself. Thus, the graphite felts were compressed by approximately 10%, so that they had a relative low resistance.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Structure of the LCFC.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2017_5535_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par7">In order to clean the Nafion 115 membrane, it was pretreated in sequence in boiling solution of 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1 h, in boiling deionized water for 1 h, in boiling solution of 1 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> for 1 h and finally in boiling deionized water for 1 h. The 3D extended electrodes were activated to improve their hydrophilia. At first, the graphite felt was cut to suitable size and washed three times using deionized water in an ultrasonic cleaner (40 KHZ, KQ-400D, Nanbei Ltm., Zhenzhou, China) for 30 min. The cleaned graphite felt was dried in an air dry oven (DHG-9053A, Yiheng Ltm., Shanghai, China) at the temperature of 180 °C for 8 h, and then baked at 420 °C with dry air inlet in a muffle furnace (SX-G01123, Zhonghuan, Tianjin, China) for 10 h. Finally the carbon felt was cooled to ambient temperature (23‒25 °C).</p><p id="Par8">The anolyte used phosphomolybdic acid (H<sub>3</sub>PMo<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>, PMo<sub>12</sub>) or phosphotungstic acid (H<sub>3</sub>PW<sub>12</sub>O<sub>40</sub>, PW<sub>12</sub>) as POM-I. The former was purchased from Aladdin, USA and the latter was purchased from Sigma, USA. Glucose (Maklin, Shanghai, China) was used as the model compound to investigate the performance of the LCFC. Calculated quantities of POM-I and glucose were dissolved in deionized water (0.30 mol/L POM-I and 2.00 mol/L glucose), and the pH of the solution was adjusted to about 0.1 using concentrated phosphoric acid (85 wt. %, Aladdin, USA) and the concentration of phosphoric acid was 3.00 mol/L. The prepared mixture was placed in a water bath with the temperature of 95 °C for 2 h, and then taken out for natural cooling to ambient temperature (25 °C) in a dark box. The cell was developed aiming to deal with real organic waste or wastewater, and thus we tried to investigate its performance at ambient temperature without heating. When using different Lewis acids replace some POM-I, phosphoric acid of 1.50 mol/L was adopted to keep the acidity for FeCl<sub>3</sub> and CuSO<sub>4</sub>, while sulfuric acid of 1.50 mol/L was adopted for VOSO<sub>4</sub> to avoid the precipitation of V<sup>4+</sup> and V<sup>3+</sup>.</p><p id="Par9">The catholyte used non-Keggin-type molybdovanadophosphoric acid (H<sub>12</sub>P<sub>3</sub>Mo<sub>18</sub>V<sub>7</sub>O<sub>85</sub>, P<sub>3</sub>Mo<sub>18</sub>V<sub>7</sub>) as POM-II, which was synthesized referring to the method reported before<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Unlike conventional Keggin-type POM, this kind of non-Keggin-type POM contains more vanadium atoms in a molecule. For the synthesis, 1200 ml deionized water was kept at 0 °C by ice water mixture, and a magnetic stirrer was applied to mix the following solutes. At first, 0.1575 mol (28.65 g) V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (Sigma, USA) was added, and then 180 ml H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Maclin, Shanghai, China) was added. V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> was dissolved after about half an hour. Next, 10 ml H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> (85 wt. %, Aladdin, USA) was diluted to 20 ml, and 5.56 ml of the diluted H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> was added to the V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> solution. Stirring continued for 2 h at room temperature until the residual H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was fully decomposed. The final solution was moved to a beaker (noted as solution A). Another solution (solution B) was prepared using 1000 ml deionized water, 0.81 mol (116.64 g) MoO<sub>3</sub> (Aladdin, USA) and 13.2 ml diluted H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> in a flask. The solution was heated to boiling with magnetic stirring. After solution B turned to yellow, 200 ml solution A was added repeatedly until all the solution A was injected. The mixture was evaporated naturally to 150 ml and finally 0.30 mol/L P<sub>3</sub>Mo<sub>18</sub>V<sub>7</sub> was obtained.</p><p id="Par10">When the LCFC was operated in batch mode aiming to study the cell reaction and optimize the operational conditions, the prepared anolyte (kept at room temperature of 23‒25 °C after 2 h reaction with fuel at 95 °C) and the catholyte were separately circulated between their storage vessels (conical bottles) and the cell using peristaltic pumps (BT100-2J, LongerPump, Baoding, China). Accompanied with the cell reaction, the reduced POM-I and Fe<sup>2+</sup> was oxidized and reborn, and the POM-II was reduced. The LCFC was also operated with continuous redox reaction in anolyte so as to study the degradation degree and rate of carbohydrates. The conical bottle containing the mixture of the anolyte and a type of carbohydrate was put in a water bath at 85 °C so that the redox reaction in the anolyte and the cell reaction proceeded continuously (with excess catholyte). Thus, carbohydrates could be possibly oxidized stepwise to CO<sub>2</sub> and water.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Characterize the performance of the LCFC</title><p id="Par11">The performance of the LCFC only using POMs as the catalyst was first measured, and then the effects of several Lewis acids as co-catalyst were compared.</p><p id="Par12">Linear sweep voltammetry analysis was carried out to check the performance of the LCFC.

The anolyte containing glucose or starch was kept in a water bath of 85 °C. As a consequence, the oxidation of biomass and the regeneration of reduced POM-I could take place simultaneously. The LCFC was operated continuously for a relative long time (21 days) and TOC in the anolyte were recorded. Along with the consumption of glucose, the concentration of raw PMo<sub>12</sub> (yellow) in the anolyte decreased gradually and the color of the solution turned to blue (reduced PMo<sub>12</sub>). At the end, PMo<sub>12</sub> was finally regenerated and the color of the anolyte recovered to yellow. The decrease of TOC in the anolyte verified a conversion from soluble biomass (glucose or starch) to carbon dioxide that escaped to air (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). In 21 days, more than 93% of glucose and starch were completely decomposed in the LCFC. The degradation of glucose or starch means the release and transfer of electrons. The redox reaction between POM-I and glucose or starch was relatively slow compared with the subsequent cell reaction. From this point of view, the current density of the cell should be determined by the degradation rate of glucose or starch. Furthermore, the degradation rates of glucose and starch were almost the same, indicating the hydrolysis of starch to glucose was not the rate-limit step while the oxidation of glucose was relatively slow. Although the hydrolysis rate of cellulose was obviously slow (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), the hydro lysate of cellulose is also glucose and it would be also oxidized completely in the continuous LCFC.

One was the quantity of electron transfer from biomass to catalyst during thermal redox reaction, and the other is the transfer efficiency of electrons and protons from anolyte to POM-II in the catholyte. The former can be enhanced by increasing the concentration of biomass and selecting suitable catalyst; the latter can be improved by adding acid and electron shuttles in anolyte or enlarging the effective area of electrodes. For the first step, the electron transfer from glucose to POM-I can reflect the oxidation degree of glucose, and also indicate the performance of catalysts oxidizing glucose. In fact, the efficiencies of PMo<sub>12</sub>, PW<sub>12</sub> and FeCl<sub>3</sub> varied greatly (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).

The redox process between PW<sub>12</sub> and glucose follows a zero-order reaction, indicating that both reactants were excessive during the reaction period and the rate of electron transfer was independent of the concentrations of PW<sub>12</sub> and glucose. PMo<sub>12</sub> showed a higher rate of electron transfer, which was nearly 40 times the rate of PW<sub>12</sub> in the initial 1 h.

On the other hand, it was obvious that more than one electron was given by one glucose molecule. The number of electron transfer during thermal redox reaction of POM-I and glucose would have a direct influence on the output power density in the subsequent cell reaction since more electrons transfer from glucose to POM-I resulted in higher concentration of reduced POM-I in the anolyte.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Numbers of electron transfer during redox reaction of PW<sub>12</sub> (<bold>a</bold>) or PMo<sub>12</sub> (<bold>b</bold>) and glucose (The concentrations of PW<sub>12</sub> and glucose were 0.3 and 2 mol/L, respectively; the concentrations of PMo<sub>12</sub> and glucose were 0.1 and 0.6 mol/L, respectively; the concentration of phosphoric acid in anolyte was 1.5 mol/L).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2017_5535_Fig7_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par37">Further tests were carried out to verify this conjecture.

As a consequence, the usage of polyoxometalates can be reduced by 80% and the performance of the LCFC kept at the same level. Moreover, the improved LCFC exhibited 57% better capability of utilizing cellulose as fuel.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China under grant No. 51478239 and the Shenzhen Science and Technology Research and Development Fund under grant No. JCYJ20150320154458994.</p></ack><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Fan Xu finished most of the experiments.
