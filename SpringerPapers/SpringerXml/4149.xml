The recent advances in electronics and microelectronics allow the development of low-cost devices that are widely used by many people as monitoring tools for well-being or preventive purposes. Remote healthcare monitoring, which is based on non-invasive and wearable sensors, actuators and modern communication and information technologies offers efficient solutions that allows people to live in their comfortable home environment, being somehow protected. Furthermore, the expensive healthcare facilities are getting free to be used for intensive care patients as the preventive measures are getting at home. The remote systems can monitor very important physiological parameters of the patients in real time, observe health conditions, assessing them, and most important, provide feedback. Sensors are used in electronics medical and non-medical equipment and convert various forms of vital signs into electrical signals. Sensors can be used for life-supporting implants, preventive measures, long-term monitoring of disabled or ill patients. Healthcare organizations like insurance companies need real-time, reliable, and accurate diagnostic results provided by sensor systems that can be monitored remotely, whether the patient is in a hospital, clinic, or at home.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Healthcare</kwd><kwd>Sensors</kwd><kwd>Monitoring</kwd><kwd>Sensing technologies</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-3-030-10752-9_Chapter_10.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></book-part-meta><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Quality of life in most countries has been increasing a lot over the several few decades due to significant improvements in medicine and public healthcare. Consequently, there is a huge demand for the development of cost-effective remote health monitoring, which could be easy to use for elderly people. The remote health-care monitoring includes sensors, actuators, advanced communication technologies and gives the opportunity for the patient to stay at his/her comfortable home instead in expensive health-care facilities. These systems monitor the physiological signs of the patients in real time, can assess some health-conditions and gives the feedback to the doctors. Why these systems are so comfortable and necessary to use? The first reason is that they are portable, easy to use, with small sizes and light weight. A typical example is a Health-care Monitoring System (HMS) that mostly uses a microcontroller, which tracks and processes health data and sends an SMS to a doctor’s mobile phone or any family member who could provide emergency aid (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The main advantage of this system is that a person could carry it everywhere because the device is small, light and wireless. Another advantage of these systems is that they can monitor health conditions in real time and all the time. People use HMSs in hospitals, for home care, and to track the vitals of athletes (heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature). All this data can be processed by various sensors integrated into the systems.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Block diagram of Health-care Monitoring System (HMS).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/477428_1_En_10_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par3">Health monitoring systems can use microcontroller, wearable sensors or FPGA.</p><p id="Par4">A transmitter receives physical signals of the heartbeat, processes the data and sends through Wi-Fi to the ZigBee. Then the data is transferred by the receiver to the computer. The transmitter uses a microcontroller which detects the patient’s pulse and converts it to a voltage signal and then displayed. The idea is the same with HMS with wearable sensors, the difference comes in the fact that here the sensors which detect body temperature, blood pressure or a heartbeat rate are located on patient’s body with no wires. For wireless data transmission in short distances protocols such as Bluetooth or ZigBee are used. The wireless sensor device contains respiration sensor, electro dermal activity sensor (EDA sensor) and electromyography sensor (EMG sensor). FPGA means field-programmable gate array, which could be programmed after production through HDL (hardware description language). A Health-care monitoring system using this technology contains a low-cost, analogue-to-digital converter. Digitization allows users to connect the FPGA to the entire system.</p><p id="Par5">E-health Monitoring Architecture can be divided into three main layers as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>E-health Monitoring Architecture.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/477428_1_En_10_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par6">Perception layer contains different medical and environmental sensors that are collecting data in real-time. Medical sensors measure patient’s vital signs while environmental one’s measure indicators, which affect a patient’s condition, such as the oxygen level or room temperature.</p><p id="Par7">API layer includes various application programming interfaces (APIs). The data is stored through cloud technologies providing access to patient’s health data and current health records. The API layer is a layer that stores new patient health information by generating a profile using one API, and displays existing medical information for a previously registered patient data using another API.</p><p id="Par8">Service layer contains an e-health application, which analyses the received data and suggests methods to improve patient’s condition or give a prescription.

Gas sensors determine the concentration of gas in its neighborhood. Gas sensing systems are increasingly investigated for applications in environmental monitoring (air quality control, fire detection), automotive industry (fuel combustion monitoring and polluting gases of automobiles), industrial production (process control automation, detection of gases in mines, detection of gas leakages in power stations), medical applications (e.g., electronic noses, alcohol breath tests), boiler control, home safety, etc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Different types of gas sensors exist such as optical, surface acoustic wave (SAW), electrochemical, capacitive, catalytic, and semiconductor gas sensors. Gas sensing methods can be split into two categories: based on variation of electrical properties and based on variation of other properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">The electrical variation methods rely on the following substances as a sensing material: metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) stacks, polymers, moisture absorbing materials, and carbon nanotubes.

MOS based sensors have been widely utilized as they are low cost and have high sensitivity. However, some MOS sensors need high operating temperature, which restricts their application. The problem is solved by implementing microsensor components with microheaters produced by VLSI CMOS technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Another issue is the relatively lengthy time needed for the gas sensor to recover after each gas exposure, which is impractical for applications where gas concentration changes quickly.

Optical sensors rely on spectroscopy, which uses emission spectrometry and absorption. The principle of absorption spectrometry is based on absorption of the photons at specific gas wavelengths; the absorption depends on the concentration of photons. Infrared gas sensors operate on the principle of molecular absorption spectrometry; each gas has its own particular absorption properties to infrared radiation with different wavelengths. In general, optical sensors could attain better selectivity, sensitivity, and stability in comparison to non-optical methods.

Planar Field Effect Transistors (FETs) can be converted to chemically sensitive sensors by adjusting their gate oxide with membranes or molecular receptors to sense an analyte of interest. Fundamental rule of the molecular detecting is the selective attraction between the test molecules and the target molecules. As the target molecules have electrical charges in the electrolyte solution, the nearby channel conductance is affected by these electric charges via the field effect.

It has been found that frequent (possibly continuous) measurement of blood glucose levels is essential for conducting insulin therapy and minimizing the harmful effects on the body. Modern methods of testing include periodic tests in specialized laboratories or analysis of daily profiles (periodically over several hours), using a portable blood analyzer at home. For this purpose, after a pinch, usually on the fingertip, a certain amount (drop) of blood is delivered to a special test strip which is placed in the analyzer and within a few seconds the current blood glucose level is indicated. These persistent pricks cause discomfort, especially in young children, and rarely can lead to infections. New developments in the art are directed to alternative methods for measuring glucose concentration, e.g. bloodless, by measuring glucose levels in body fluids (sweat, tears, urine) as indicated in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Saliva nano-bio-sensor is presented there for noninvasive glucose monitoring which provide low-cost, accurate and disposable bio-sensor. Another method for non-invasive method is proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. The described methods are still not applicable in mass practice. Another part of the research is directed to the development of invasive methods for the delivery and analysis of blood micro-bleeds. At this stage, there are no data on the implementation and applications in the mass practice of nanobiobs for determining blood glucose levels by analyzing blood micro beats in the absence of pain sensations for the patient.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Activity Recognition for Sports</title><p id="Par136">Research of human activity is becoming a most popular and relevant topic for multiple scientific areas. Human activity recognition includes mobile computing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>], surveillance-based security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>], context-aware computing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>] and ambient assistive living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. The sensor technologies and data processing techniques have achieved much progress. Work on these supporting technologies has led to developments in the area of data collection and transfer and information integration. Many of the solutions to real problems related to human life are increasingly dependent on the human activity recognition. Recognizing human activity as a topic of work can contribute to many important activities related to security and monitoring, preservation of the environment, help in maintaining independent living and aging, etc. To develop such a system, it is crucial to work on four main tasks. The tasks include selection and deployment of sensors designed to collect information about and capture a specific user’s behaviour while simultaneously monitoring respective changes within the environment. Another task is related to the application data analysis techniques which are used for/while processing and storing the accumulated information, to create computational activity models which, when incorporated within complicated software (packages/products), are designed to select algorithms to provoke responsive activities from sensor data through reasoning and manipulation. There is a variety of tools, methods and technologies available to implement each task.</p><p id="Par137">Sensor-based activity is used for activity monitoring. The approaches involve computer surveillance, structural modelling, characteristic elements extraction, action extraction and movement tracking with the main purpose being to make analysis aiming to recognize certain pattern based on collected visual information. Another category is based on the application of recently developed sensor network technologies for activity monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>].</p><p id="Par138">Sensors are attached to the monitored person. This approach is applicable in order to follow physical movements such as workouts. There are multiple types of sensors available for activity monitoring (contact sensors, accelerometers, audio and motion detectors etc.). The sensors are divided according to their purpose – there are different types based on particular output signals, involving theoretical principles and defined by technical infrastructure. They are represented within two basic categories according to the way they are positioned during the activity monitoring process. Activity monitoring based on Wearable sensor. This type of sensor is attached directly or indirectly to the observed person. While the monitored object performs any type of action, the sensors generate signals. In this way we are able to monitor features which describe the human state of mind and respective motion patterns. The sensors can be put into clothing, in shoe soles or heels, inside cell phones, watches and other mobile devices etc. They can be located directly on the body as well. From them we get the necessary indicators about the position and movement of the test object at a given moment, the pulse, temperature, and so on. There are different types of relevant sensor information applicable for various types of activities. Accelerometer sensors are sensors for activity monitoring. They are used to monitor actions such as body movements such as walking, running, jumping and more. In a paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>] a network of three-axis accelerometers has been reported. These accelerometers are fixed on different parts of the object’s body and provide movement and orientation data for the part of the body that is selected. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>] are used body worn microphones and accelerometers to measure acceleration and angular velocity through accelerometers and gyroscopes. In the paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>] provides a method for determining the user’s location. With this method, the behavior of sitting, standing and walking can be recognized. Another used wearable sensor are GPS sensors. These types of sensors are mostly applied when monitoring activities involving location changes or open air and mobile environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>].</p><p id="Par139">The state of the art can be divided into two sub-topics, the recognition of human activity and Human Activity Prediction. Activity recognition is a complex process. The basic tasks include:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par140">selecting and using appropriate sensors to objects and environments.

The provided data can be a series of video or digitally presented visual image. Common are computer vision techniques for action extraction, feature extraction, structural modelling, motion detection, and motion tracking to specify pattern recognition.</p><p id="Par146">The second one is based on sensor-based activity recognition using the newly developed sensor network systems for motion monitoring. The acquired sensor data is presented as time series of state changes. They can be used as parameters for data integration, probabilistic or statistical analysis. Beside the already described attachment techniques, the sensors can be also placed within the object’s environment as long as the position allows the tracking activity. These types of sensors use inertial measurement units to capture the object’s behavior. This method is used for registering motion. The use of multiple multi-modal miniature sensors enables a robust capture of activities to be accomplished by monitoring interactions between a person and an object. The activity information can be acquired through motion monitoring models. The motion monitoring models can be built to recognize activity models from previous experiments including rich database about monitored persons’ behaviors. For this purpose, they can be used data mining and machine learning techniques through creation of statistical activity models. This method is based on data. The actions that follow are based on probabilistic or statistical classification. This approach has its advantages as handling uncertainty and timing information. On the other hand, requires large datasets for training and learning, and also suffers from the problems of scalability and re-usability. Another method involves the use of predefined models with a large database and research results directly using knowledge engineering and management technologies. The models in this method are used for activity recognition or prediction through logical reasoning. Knowledge-driven approaches are semantically clear and easy to get started. The drawback of this method comes from handling uncertainty and temporal information.</p><p id="Par147">The field of vision-based activity recognition is focused on surveillance, improvement of robots and counter-terrorism, and this field includes a wide variety of options.</p><p id="Par148">Human body structure extraction data from images, action recognition and tracking across frames [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>], survey on the approaches based on the movement recognition as opposed to structured approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>], research focused on monitoring human movement using 2D or 3D models and the other recognition techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>] etc.</p><p id="Par149">In the 2000s, a new approach based on sensors utilizing other sensors fixed to objects was development. This approach has been named “dense sensing” approach with the main purpose of performing activity recognition through user-object interactions. Over the past few years, there have been numerous impressive developments in sensor-based activity recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>].</p><p id="Par150">There are two approaches:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par151">Wearable sensors focus mainly on mobile computing.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par152">Dense sensing-based activity recognition is predominantly driven by smart environment applications such as ambient assisted living. The application smart sensors and sensor fusion directed to biomedical applications and the different types of sport are an interesting topic. There is an ever-growing demand in the field of systems for monitoring with local processing or a network of sensors.

The interconnection between two or more sensors present in the same system is called sensor fusion. This provides a more complex analysis which is not achievable using a single or multiple separate sensor. Sensor fusion combines this data with strategies to provide consistent and effective responses.</p><p id="Par157">In the sensor fusion, two cases are possible. In the first case, sensors with different signals are merged, while in the second case, data is merged from sensors operating in different situations. The sensor fusion has three levels: acquisition and data merger, fusion of characteristics, and merger of decisions.</p><p id="Par158">Figure <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> shows the three levels of a sensor fusion system. Signal types can be physical, chemical or biological quantities or images. Below is description of processing obtained signals. Smart sensors are used when the accuracy of signal processing complexity is not as significant, but different points should be interconnected. The smart sensors must contain a discrete communication system. In this way the sensors are integrated into a sensor network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>].<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10.</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Sensor fusion system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>].</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/477428_1_En_10_Fig10_HTML.png" id="MO10"/></fig></p><p id="Par159">In Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> a single module which includes the acquisition of all physical quantities by the sensor(s) is presented.

The physiological, physical and technical types of data can be analyzed in the development of athletes in sport. The physiological variables can be described as power, oxygen consumption, and others, to the physical variables: detach speed, acceleration, and fatigue index, and technical variables: starting time, correct execution of movements, correct gait, posture, etc.</p><p id="Par161">Sensor fusion contains the following sensors: Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer. The concepts of sensor fusion and smart sensor can be used in combination.</p><p id="Par162">Athletics is the basis of many sports. For many types of sports, the main thing is running, jumping and throwing. The main thing is to perform an analysis during training and to have an interaction between the trainer and the sportsperson thus giving more help in a competitive environment and in sport. Inertial sensors are widely used in athletics. This category includes an accelerometer, a gyroscope and a magnetometer. They provide data for quantities such as acceleration, angular velocity and magnetic field and provide orientation analysis. When we fusion the data with video signals, we can compare and analyze the performance of two athletes. In order for the coach to provide corrections and instructions to the competitor, it is important to investigate the inertial behavior of the sensors, depending on the time of displacement of two athletes. In this way can be corrected positioning at starting time, starting time and others. It is also important to analyze the gait and the correct execution of movements in training and racing in real time.</p><p id="Par163">In almost all kinds of sport (athletics, figure skating, short track speed skating, hockey, soccer, basketball, etc.), gait analysis is important. The gait depends on the correct position and movement. This analysis can be done by means of sensors for force and inertia in the athlete’s footwear. In order to achieve the necessary analysis of the athlete’s pace, three sensors measure force, acceleration and angular velocity.</p><p id="Par164">In Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref> some examples of area to attached smart sensors are shown: (a) sensor on each ankle, (b) two sensors that are positioned on the thigh and tibia and (c) a sensor placed in the lumbar.

Two variables in the development of the sport person are important, the resistance and propulsion of the body in water, and also the efficiency of the arms during the movement. Based on these results, an analysis of the style of swimming and assessment of the necessary adjustments is made. In team sports (hockey and football), protection of the athlete is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Using the same type of sensor application, an analysis of the impacts experienced by the athlete can be made.

The impact monitoring system is built of smart inertial sensors. The sensors transmit impact acceleration, impact time, impact locale, impact direction, and the amount of impacts in sequence. A research impact on the head is important, such as the protective equipment is the helmet. The vest can also be instrumented. There are smart sensors in the hockey stick as well. These sensors analyze athlete movements, force and position of the hands. To analyze the stick movement in the hands during movement, the fusion of three sensors installed on the stick can be used. Inertial sensors at the top of the stick analyze the movements of the stick in the hands and linear potentiometers can be used to analyze the position of the hands on the stick and deflection of the stick at the time of the strike [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>].</p><p id="Par166">Figure skating (Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>) is an individual’s, duos, or groups sport.

UD biomechanics analysis is used to improve the potential in figure skaters. A behavioral analysis of 60 figure skaters was made. Richards and his research team used an array of 10 cameras that capture data from reflective markers. The markers are placed on the skaters. The cameras capture their precise positions, the speed of their rotation, and their time in the air. The movement in the air are monitored.
