Since most of this energy is produced by burning fossil fuel, the resulting environmental pollution has rapidly increased. This has resulted in the air that people breathe becoming detrimental to their health. Also, the amount of clean fossil fuel has been decreasing. An alternative source of energy is the sun. As long as man is alive, this will be an unlimited source. In recent years, there have been several reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] on how solar energy can be developed so that it can become the alternative source of energy. For this to occur, new ways to convert sunlight to useable energies must be found.</p><p id="Par3">Photovoltaic conversion of solar-to-electrical energy is one of these methods. One of the more promising conversion technologies is the use of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). These consist of organic dye molecules adsorbed on a wide band gap of semiconductor such as TiO<sub>2</sub>, and much research has gone into fabricating and developing these DSSCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Recently, the use of quantum dots to extend the absorption spectrum of TiO<sub>2</sub> has been proposed. This has lead to the development of quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. They are considered to be a new generation of photovoltaic devices. The QDs exhibit unique optical and electrical properties based on them having tunable band gap across a wide range of energy levels. Earlier reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] have focused on the QDs such as CdS, CdSe, PbS, and PbSe or any combinations of them or on the electrolytes in the cells.</p><p id="Par5">Another factor that should be considered is the morphology of TiO<sub>2</sub>-based photoanode materials. There have been several studies on how the morphology affects the conversional efficiency of solar cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A mesoporous structure TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle film has a higher surface area. This increases the amount of semiconducting quantum dots that can be loaded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, the increase in the amount of surface defects and grain boundaries in the film would greatly retard the electron transport needed for the electron recombination process. To solve this problem, arrays of one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure (rod, wire tube) can be formed. It is generally believed however that a 1D structure (through a combination of a reduced recombination (achieving high electron-transfer rate) process and lower surface area) would have reduced solar-to-electrical conversion efficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Recently, composites consisting of mesoporous (or 3D hierarchical) structures of TiO<sub>2</sub> grown on the individual TiO<sub>2</sub> rods forming into a layered array have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The morphology of these composite allows for the high specific areas needed for greater sensitizer adsorption, remarkable light scattering ability, and void space for electrolyte infiltration which in turn would improve the solar energy harvesting (and the conversion efficiency). The replacement of the dye with the QDs to extend the spectrum range of solar absorption requires that different electrolytes be used in the cell. A typical electrolyte for QDSSCs would be the redox polysulfide couple (S<italic>n</italic><sup>2−</sup>/S<sup>2−</sup>) (DSSCs is I<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>/I<sup>−</sup>). Commercial Pt counter electrode would not be suitable for these QDSSCs since the strong chemiadsorption of the sulfide ions in three of the QDs mentioned would result in low connectivity between the two electrodes and this in turn would lead to decreasing catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this regard, the studies on the metal sulfide, such as CuS, CoS, Cu<sub>2</sub>S, and composite electrodes (CuS/CoS) as counter electrodes, have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. All of the studies reported that there were increases in the electrocatalytic activity and noticeable improvement in the power conversion efficiency when sulfide-based counter electrode was used in place of a Pt counter electrode.</p><p id="Par7">In the present study, we have studied the loading of semiconducting QDs onto the surface of three-dimensional flower-like titania structures grown on one-dimensional array of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods formed on a conducting fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate. Flower-like structures on the rod-shaped titania layer (FTiR) were synthesized via two-step hydrothermal technique. This formation of 3D flower-like structures on the 1D titania rods of FTiR (acting as the photoanode) would lead to a greatly increased surface area needed for the QD loading. This would lead to a greater light harvesting, resulting in a greater solar-to-electric conversion. CuS was used as a counter electrode in order to improve the conversion efficiency of the QDSSCs. The use of CuS instead of Pt to create the FTiR photoanode needed to bring about the redox reaction of polysulfide studied is shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The structure, morphologies, and optical properties of the photoanodes were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and UV–vis spectroscopy. The QD-sensitized FTiR solar cells were assembled with CuS or Pt as the counter electrodes. The effect of using CuS or Pt in the QDSSCs on the photovoltaic performance on the open circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic>oc), short circuit current density (<italic>J</italic>sc), fill factor (FF), and efficiency (<italic>η</italic>) were investigated.

To obtain the TiO<sub>2</sub> rod arrays on the FTO glass substrates, a mixture of 12 mL of deionized water and 12 mL of HCl solution was stirred for 5 min. Then, 0.4 mL of titanium butoxide was added and stirred at room temperature until the solution became clear. The precursor solution at this point contained the colloidal TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles. A previously cleaned FTO glass substrate is placed in the precursor solution.

Both the top and cross-sectional views show the blossom-like structured growth on each nanorod. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d is the TEM image of the nanorods in the FTiR array. The TEM images show that the nanorods in the TiR material (Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b) have formed into a single layer of thickness of a few micrometer and that the nanorods in the FTiR material (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>d) form into a double layer of aligned (array) rod-like objects. The latter image shows the lengths of the newly formed rod-like particles with a size range from 10 to 50 μm with the blossom-like formations on top of the rods of the original layer (see the insert in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c).

The spectrum indicates that incident photons of lower energies can be utilized by the QDSSCs with the CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDs.

This shows that the CuS counter electrode for CdS/CdSe/ZnS QD-sensitized photoelectrode made with the FTiR substrate possessed higher efficiency of about 3.72-fold larger when compared to a cell having Pt as its counter electrode. Considering the overall performance parameters, the QD-sensitized FTiR sandwich having CuS as its counter electrode is better than the QDSSCs having Pt as the electrode. This may be due to the greater catalytic activity between the CdS/CdSe/ZnS QD-sensitized FTiR photoanode and the polysulfide electrolyte when CuS is used as the counter electrode. The faster S<sub>2</sub><sup>2−</sup> reduction rate on the CuS electrode can accelerate the regeneration rate of QDs. The use of the Pt electrode would lead to a more inferior catalytic activity with the lowest current density and open circuit voltage for the S<sub>2</sub><sup>2−</sup> reduction since the surface activity leading to interaction with the polysulfide redox coupled is poor. To explain the phenomena, Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] pointed out that the polysulfide (S<sub><italic>x</italic></sub><sup>2−</sup>) also plays as an electron acceptor to receive electron from the counter electrode through the following reaction: S<italic>x</italic><sup>2−</sup> + 2e → S<italic>x</italic><sub>− 1</sub><sup>2−</sup> + S<sup>2−</sup> which describes the adsorption of sulfide on the surface of a QDs. This reaction plays an important role in the hole-recovery and electron–hole separation. Both effects are expected to give a better hole-recovery rate and, therefore, lead to a higher efficiency of the cell. In support of this hypothesis, we note that the performance of solar cells based on the CdS/CdSe/ZnS QD-sensitized FTiR photoanode and polysulfide electrolyte is greatly improved when using the CuS counter electrode and then when using the Pt counter electrode. However, using the CuS counter electrode on the performance of CdS/CdSe/ZnS QD-sensitized FTiR photoanode, we obtained only 2.715% of power conversion efficiency which is rather low compared to result from other groups (<italic>η</italic> of 3% to 6%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. We believe that there is hope for more improvement in the efficiency through the optimization of the FTiR/CdS/CdSe/ZnS photoanode by improving the QD adsorption time and changing the surface morphology of the individual 3D nanostructured TiO<sub>2</sub> nanorods. The latter will increase the surface area allowing for more QD loading and for an ordered pathway for faster electron transport. This will lead to an enhancement of the light harvesting which will improve the solar-to-electric conversion. In addition, the catalytic activity for redox couple may also be improved by controlling the thickness, morphology, and conductivity of CuS counter electrode and is also an important area of our investigation. The influences of these three parameters for increasing the electrocatalytic activity have been studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and noticeable improvement in the power conversion efficiency (up to <italic>η</italic> of 4% to 6%) has been seen.</p><p id="Par23">To see if the above activity is actually occurring, we have measured the electrical contact between the photoelectrode and the electrolytes in the QDSSCs using electro-chemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). We find that the impedance spectra of the QD-loaded FTiR matched to either a CuS counter electrode or to Pt counter electrode under forward bias (−0.7 V) and dark conditions are quite different. The Nyquist plot (plot of the imaginary part of the impedance vs. the real part) of the EIS of QD/FTiR/CuS (Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>a) solar cell appears to be two semicircles (a small one at low frequency and a dominant one at higher frequencies). The values of the series resistance (the <italic>Rs</italic> at intercept of the frequency with the real axis) for the QD/FTiR/CuS (52.10 Ω) will be higher than those of those of junctions having Pt (29.94 Ω) as the counter electrode.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Impedance spectra of the assembled QDSSCs.</bold> Impedance spectra of the assembled QDSSCs having the FTiR photoelectrode performance on the <bold>(a)</bold> CuS and <bold>(b)</bold> Pt counter electrode.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11671_2015_844_Fig9_HTML.gif" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par24">The reason for this is the poorer conductivity of CuS when compared to that of Pt. The large semicircle corresponds to electron injection at the CuS/electrolyte interface and to the transport in the electrolyte at high frequencies (<italic>R</italic>1), meaning that transfer time is due to two processes, transport to from the CuS/electrolyte interface and the electron transfer at the TiO<sub>2</sub>/QDs interface, i.e., the TiO<sub>2</sub> film (<italic>R</italic>2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The EIS results for the QD/FTiR/Pt solar cells under the same conditions (Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>b) exhibit the signature of the capacitive nature of the system. The capacitive nature is due to the buildup chemical potential which is caused by charge accumulation in the surface traps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The results reported here for the EIS results of QD/FTiR/CuS solar cells are similar to the results reported by Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. They proposed that the relative contribution to the impedance associated with the electron transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface (<italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>) could be determined from the radius of the semicircle. From this, they concluded that there were increases in the electrocatalytic activity at the CuS or CoS counter electrode [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], compared with that at a Pt counter electrode. The use of these two materials as the counter electrode leads to an acceleration of the electron transfer process at the interface. The increase in the power conversion efficiency is due to the increased electron transfer. We believe that the arcs arise from the electron transfers which occur at the electrolyte-counter electrode interface. The values of charge transfers R of Pt and CuS counter electrodes were 3.97 × 10<sup>3</sup> and 206.30 Ω, respectively. As a result, the lower charge transfer resistance of CuS CE interpreted as a better electro catalytic activities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par25">In present study, the FTiR structures have been synthesized through a double hydrothermal process.

After using the CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDs to sensitize the FTiR photoelectrodes, it was seen that the light absorption shifted to higher wavelengths and that there was a noticeable improvement (about a 3.72-fold improvement) in the power conversion efficiency when CuS instead of Pt was used.
