id="Abs1"><title>Abstract</title><p>The Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) will investigate environmental factors directly tied to current habitability at the Martian surface during the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission. Three major habitability factors are addressed by REMS: the thermal environment, ultraviolet irradiation, and water cycling. The thermal environment is determined by a mixture of processes, chief amongst these being the meteorological. Accordingly, the REMS sensors have been designed to record air and ground temperatures, pressure, relative humidity, wind speed in the horizontal and vertical directions, as well as ultraviolet radiation in different bands. These sensors are distributed over the rover in four places: two booms located on the MSL Remote Sensing Mast, the ultraviolet sensor on the rover deck, and the pressure sensor inside the rover body. Typical daily REMS observations will collect 180 minutes of data from all sensors simultaneously (arranged in 5 minute hourly samples plus 60 additional minutes taken at times to be decided during the course of the mission). REMS will add significantly to the environmental record collected by prior missions through the range of simultaneous observations including water vapor; the ability to take measurements routinely through the night; the intended minimum of one Martian year of observations; and the first measurement of surface UV irradiation. In this paper, we describe the scientific potential of REMS measurements and describe in detail the sensors that constitute REMS and the calibration procedures.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the most remarkable characteristics of Mars is that it possesses an atmosphere in many ways similar to that of the Earth, that may have been even more similar in the past. It is the presence of a dynamic atmosphere, and the story of dramatic climate variations that most intrigue us about Mars, including the possibility that a moist climate appropriate to life once may have existed there. Mars continues to have an interesting climate system to this day and its climate may still allow habitable zones near the surface (Jakosky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2005</xref>). Currently Mars is known to support aeolian processes—dust lifting and sand transport by winds—that dominate contemporary geological activity (Sullivan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2005</xref>). It also has an active water cycle that exchanges water between the subsurface and atmosphere (Jakosky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1997</xref>) on seasonal and diurnal timescales, and may move substantial amounts of ground ice over obliquity time scales. Mars’ thin atmosphere, lack of oceans, and widespread coating of low thermal inertia dust favor large seasonal and diurnal temperature variations (Tillman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1994</xref>; Smith <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>; McCleese et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>). Intense horizontal and vertical winds develop near the surface, which compensate for the low density of the atmosphere and yield widespread dust devil activity and dust storms that grow to global events.</p><p>The Martian atmosphere can be divided in 3 vertical regions: an upper atmosphere with very high temperatures and where mixing is weak such that different gases start to have separate scale heights; a middle atmosphere with a strong winter polar jet stream; and, a lower atmosphere dominated by turbulent interactions with the surface and strong mesoscale circulations forced by topography and horizontal temperature contrasts. The Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) is the dynamically varying region of the lower atmosphere where heat, momentum, water, dust and other tracer species are directly exchanged by turbulent mixing the atmosphere and the surface. On Mars, the PBL varies greatly in depth and properties depending strongly on the local time, but also on location, season, and the atmospheric dust and water ice opacity. During the day, intense convection may take place, with plumes and vortices rising to heights in excess of 10 km (Haberle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1993a</xref>; Larsen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2002</xref>; Fisher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2005</xref>; Hinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2008</xref>). At night, convection is inhibited and radiative cooling produces a stably stratified layer at the surface, and the PBL reduces to a shallow layer (as little as a few 10’s of meters deep) forced by mechanical turbulence at the bottom of the stable layer.</p><p>Our understanding of the Martian climate has increased greatly in the last 15 years—a period of nearly continuous orbiter observations. Mars Global Surveyor, Mars Express, the Mars Odyssey, and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter have provided new information about the Martian climate, which is characterized by extreme seasonality that results from the high eccentricity of the orbit of Mars. Nevertheless in spite of the great increase in spacecraft observations, the near surface remains one of the least understood regions of the atmosphere. The near surface is not particularly amenable to observations from orbit because the processes of interest generally occur on spatial scales too small to be resolved. In addition, quantitative orbital remote sensing techniques like infrared radiometery have difficulty retrieving information within the lowest few kilometers to scale height of the surface due to the strong surface/atmosphere temperature contrasts. Only the rather sparse and irregular high resolution data from radio occultation observations are of particular use for study of this important region of interchange between the surface and atmosphere (Kliore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1965</xref>).</p><p>A good understanding of Martian lower atmospheric processes and the ability to simulate them with climate models is necessary for the potential planning of future safe operations of humans at the surface, and is a concern even for robotic mission operations. To compensate for limited data, models based on the relatively well understood circulation and thermal structure of Earth’s atmosphere have been developed to study Mars (e.g. Haberle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1993b</xref>; Forget et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1999</xref>; Rafkin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2001</xref>; Richardson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2007</xref>). As on Earth, numerical modeling of the Martian atmosphere has been applied at a range of scales: from the typically low-resolution (≈300 km) General Circulation Models (GCM) to the higher resolution limited area mesoscale (≈10–100 km) and microscale or Large Eddy Simulation (LES) models. Unfortunately, on the smallest scales and in the crucial region of the surface-atmosphere interface, the models are not well constrained by current data. <italic>In situ</italic> measurements of near surface wind, temperature, moisture, and pressure are necessary to constrain the models and these measurements require a set of dedicated meteorological sensors such as those provided by REMS.</p><p>A separate concern for habitability is the ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of the surface and lower atmosphere. UV radiation ionizes atmospheric gases and damages life as we know it. For this reason, knowledge of the UV radiation flux and its spectrum at the surface of Mars is important for the understanding current habitability conditions. Moreover, UV radiation is a significant driver of photochemistry in the atmosphere and on the surface. REMS is the first <italic>in situ</italic> instrument capable of measuring the UV radiation reaching Mars’ surface.</p><p>Several meteorological stations have predated REMS on the Martian surface, each one with its own characteristics. A comparative list of all the meteorological stations flown to the Mars surface is shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The main distinguishing characteristics of REMS are its ability to measure: vertical winds, the downward ultraviolet radiation at the surface, time series of surface temperature along with simultaneous atmospheric temperatures and winds, and the ability to measure time series of relative humidity within the context of simultaneous meteorological fields and surface temperatures. The simultaneity of multiple, consistent, and constraining environmental variables is essential for meaningful interpretation of near-surface processes. <table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison between the design science requirements of Mars meteorological stations flown before REMS (Chamberlain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1976</xref>; Seiff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1997</xref>; Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2006</xref>; Taylor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2008</xref>).

REMS is intended to operate for 2 Earth years, during which time it will acquire data every hour, for 5 minutes each and at a sampling rate of 1 Hz, on the wind speed and direction, air and ground temperature, atmospheric humidity, pressure and UV irradiation. These measurements will enable analysis of diurnal and seasonal environmental variations and provide the first measurements of UV radiation incident on the Martian surface. It should also be noted that the regularity of planned higher observation sampling frequencies (1 Hz) and the expected observation period should bring REMS closer to the extended baseline provided by Viking than any meteorological instrument in the last 30 years.</p><p>MSL will land and operate within Gale Crater (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Gale provides a far more complex meteorological environment than that sampled by prior missions due to the large and varied topography. The crater is 154 km in diameter and is located in the north-eastern portion of the Aeolis quadrangle on the boundary between the southern cratered highlands and the lowlands of Elysium Planitia. Both its location and morphology make Gale an interesting place from a meteorological point of view. Sitting just south of the equator (4.6 <sup>∘</sup>S 137.2 <sup>∘</sup>E), Gale Crater is expected to be situated in the seasonally reversing ‘trade wind’ or ‘monsoon’ circulation of the surface branch of the tropical overturning circulation (sometimes—possibly inaccurately—referred to as the ‘Hadley circulation’). Gale also sits on the edge of the dichotomy boundary, which tends to be associated with somewhat intensified day/night circulation. The complexity of the expected meteorological context doesn’t stop there since Gale Crater is characterized by a massive elevation change between the expected landing site, sitting about 4 km below datum, and the layered Mt. Sharp near the crater center, which reaches up to almost 1.5 km above datum. This mountain in the center of the crater may result in significant local day/night slope winds. The orientation and distribution of dark surfaces around the peak and extending to the south of the crater also suggests that wind scouring of dust is an active process, at least during some seasons (most likely southern summer). Being close to the equator, thermal tide signatures at Gale should be strong and may yield information on the global scale dust heating of the atmosphere and the large scale distribution of winds. The signature of far reaching mid latitude baroclinic systems may also be detectable. <fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Gale Crater and MSL landing ellipse.

A combination of REMS measurements with that from other MSL instruments will be useful for studies of the cycles of dust and volatiles such as water vapor, while a combination of REMS measurements with that from orbiters will be useful for studies of the effects of synoptic scale processes on the local meteorology and the UV radiation environment.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Microscale Dynamics: Characterization of the Near Surface Meteorological Environment</title><p>REMS will characterize the near-surface meteorological environment by measuring air temperature, ground temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind, and UV radiation. The Martian surface experiences much greater variations in temperature than that of the terrestrial surface (Petrosyan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2011</xref>). This forces more intense atmospheric convection and deeper PBL during the day, as well as stronger near-surface temperature inversion during the night. These large variations in the properties of the PBL have a major impact on the exchange of heat, momentum, dust, and water between the surface and the atmosphere (Petrosyan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2011</xref>). REMS will shed new light on these processes by making hourly measurements at high sampling rate for at least one Mars year.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Turbulence</title><sec><p>Measurements of temperature and wind at 10–100 Hz are necessary to properly characterize turbulence in the Martian atmosphere (Petrosyan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2011</xref>). Unfortunately continuous measurements at high sampling rates are not possible yet from a Mars lander because of large constraints on mass, power and data volume. Instead, turbulence can be studied using a combination of measurements at lower sampling rate and theory (Tillman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1994</xref>). This is the approach taken by REMS, on which hourly measurements made a sampling rates of up to 1 Hz are used in combination with theory to study microscale atmospheric phenomena. A combination of measurements of temperature and wind at up to 1 Hz with data from Large Eddy Simulation (LES) numerical models will then be used to study turbulent motions. REMS measurements at 1 Hz for at least 5 minutes at each hour will provide insights into near-surface turbulence and their role on atmospheric-surface interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Dry Convective Vortices or “Dust Devils”</title><p>REMS will sample dry convective vortices such as dust devils and will study their role in the local dust cycle. Dust devils have been sampled by the Viking and Mars Pathfinder landers and have been imaged from the surface by the Mars Pathfinder, the Phoenix Lander, and the Mars Exploration Rovers (Renno et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2000</xref>; Ferri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2003</xref>; Holstein-Rathlou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>; Greeley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>). Modeling and analysis of the images of the Mars Pathfinder indicate that dust devils play an important role in the Martian dust cycle (Ferri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2003</xref>). While global dust storms are the most dramatic aspect of the Martian dust cycle, the fluxes of heat and momentum are quantities that determine the exchanges of dust, water, energy and momentum between the surface and the atmosphere. The permanent atmospheric haze that is maintained by dust devils appears to have greater climatological importance than the large-scale dust storms (Ferri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2003</xref>); without the ubiquitous dust haze, the mean mid-level (10 to 40 km) air temperatures would be roughly 5–10 K cooler throughout the year. REMS will study dust devils in a region of dramatic topography that has not been studied before. Since convective circulations are expected to be intense in this region, it might shed new light on the role of dust devils in the Martian dust cycle. REMS identifies dust devils as sharp pressure drops (of a few Pa or ∼1 %) associated with increases in temperature and a rapid rotation of the winds. By making hourly measurements at 1 Hz for a Mars year, REMS is expected to characterize dust devils better than previous Mars missions. REMS will also characterize other convective structures such as convective cells and gust fronts. LES and high-resolution mesoscale simulations predict that bands of relatively low and high pressure perturbations associated with up- and down-drafts within convective cells are common on Mars (Petrosyan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2011</xref>), REMS is expected to detect these atmospheric structures in situ for the first time. Measurements of these atmospheric structures would provide strong constraints on theory and modeling of the Martian PBL, and shed light on their scales and velocities.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Mesoscale Dynamics</title><p>Most of what is known about mesoscale weather systems on Mars is based on theory and numerical modeling. Mesoscale flows include a disparate range of dynamical structures grouped together on the basis of scale. The mesoscale typically includes (is defined as) motions larger than those that occur within PBL turbulence but smaller than the synoptic scale motions of the tropical overturning circulation, large-scale atmospheric waves, and mid-latitude low pressure cyclones. The dynamics of frontal evolution within such cyclones is within the mesoscale purview, however. Of more relevance to MSL in the tropical Gale Crater are mesoscale motions driven by sharp topographic and thermal contrasts. REMS will provide unique data on mesoscale circulations because of the range of measurements it collects with good diurnal sampling; because MSL will land in a location expected to generate a range of mesoscale systems; and, because as a rover-based system, REMS will be able to sample a large number of different sites within the Gale Crater system.</p><p>Numerical models suggest that variations in surface properties and topography will force diurnally-reversing flows, such as flows up-and-down the extended walls of the crater and the central Mt. Sharp. The strength of such flows in relationship to the topography and known thermal forcing will help to constrain mesoscale models of these flows. Differential heating associated with these contrasts are expected to generate migrating air masses with associated mesoscale fronts (also know as ‘microfronts’ to distinguish them from fronts associated with mid-latitude low pressure cyclones that are unlikely to be seen at Gale Crater). These fronts would appear in REMS data as sharp temperature changes, associated with changes in wind speed and direction. Fronts are frequently created as cold air drains off a crater rim or mesa plateau and flows across a plain. The cold air undercuts warmer environmental air, pushing it up and out of its way. Sharp fronts can develop if the onset of air flow is abrupt, with cold microfronts expected to be narrower and more conspicuous than warm fronts, and thus easier to identify in REMS data. REMS observations of microfronts may also be of use in quantifying their role in dust lifting and local dust storm origination if there is evidence of active eolian transport of dust from simultaneous camera imaging.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Synoptic Dynamics</title><p>Long time-series of <italic>in situ</italic> measurements will provide unique information about the global atmosphere. Four Landers thus far have acquired such observations (Viking Landers 1 and 2, Mars Pathfinder, and Phoenix), but none with the regularity and continuity planned by the REMS investigation. Thus, MSL will provide a unique meteorological data set for the scientific community. Acquisition of these data in concert with thermal sounding from the Mars Climate Sounder and imaging from the Mars Color Imager, both aboard Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), will yield unprecedented insight into the global atmospheric circulation. Three major types of large-scale systems can potentially be studied with REMS: thermal tides, mean large-scale circulations, and low-pressure weather systems. The thermal tides are in many ways the most diagnostically useful.</p><p>Thermal tides are global-scale wave systems excited by the diurnal cycle of solar forcing. Because the forcing function is not a smooth sine wave (the forcing is zero throughout the night) and because of complex interactions with topography and other waves, harmonics at frequencies above the diurnal are present. These tides are evident in pressure and wind data, but more evident in the former. The tidal response of the atmosphere varies with the harmonic, but is sensitive to the global wind distribution and atmospheric dust abundance, through the influence of dust on atmospheric radiative heating. Indeed, it has been shown that the amplitude of semidiurnal tides provides a useful constraint on the total atmospheric dust opacity. Should large dust storms occur at locations hundreds or thousands of kilometers from the MSL rover, REMS pressure data will thus still provide uniquely valuable data on the response of the atmosphere and that will help constrain global climate models. Large-scale dust storms did not occur during the Pathfinder mission, and therefore only the Viking surface pressure records have been available for study of their effect on thermal tides. Nonetheless, the existence of these data make the Viking dust storm observations in many ways more valuable than the otherwise better observed 2001 global dust storm. REMS will fill this gap in the event of a dust storm during MSL operations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Local UV Radiation Environment and Surface Habitability</title><sec><p>The ultraviolet (UV) irradiance sensor will provide in-situ measurements of the UV radiation on the Martian surface during at least two years of nominal mission length. Several science goals shall be achieved by analysis of the measured irradiance.</p></sec><sec><title>Atmospheric Constituents: Dust and Ozone</title><p>Solar UV irradiance is absorbed and scattered by gases and dust particles in the Martian atmosphere (Zorzano and Córdoba-Jabonero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2007</xref>). While CO<sub>2</sub> absorbs most of the radiation at wavelengths shorter than 200 nm, at longer wavelengths, the strong terrestrial ozone absorption is not present due to the presence of O<sub>3</sub> in only trace amounts. Also unlike for the Earth, dust aerosols provide significant opacity. Thus the Martian UV radiative transfer scenario is very different from that of the Earth, where molecular ozone absorption and Rayleigh scattering by the dense atmosphere are both more significant than the aerosol extinction. A further complexity is that the aerosol sizes are comparable to the UV wavelengths, and thus scattering is more complex than molecular Rayleigh scattering (if the particles are approximated as spheres, Mie scattering theory can be used).</p><p>REMS observations will allow the direct and diffuse UV irradiance to be determined as the Sun moves across the sky within and outside of the instrument field of view and by using the rover mast to block the direct beam. Using the direct irradiance measurements in the different bands observed by REMS, spectral opacities can be calculated given the known downwelling solar UV. These opacities provide information on the aerosol abundances and particle size distribution, the scattering/absorbing properties of the aerosols, and the abundance of ozone (Zorzano and Córdoba-Jabonero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2007</xref>; Zorzano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2009</xref>). The ozone concentration may in turn be used as a proxy for atmospheric water vapor, since their presence is anti-correlated.</p></sec><sec><title>Validation for Radiative Transfer and Retrieval Models</title><p>Previous studies of the Martian UV environment have focused on remote observations. Remote sensing in the UV has been undertaken by Mariner 7 and 9 (Barth and Hord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1971</xref>; Barth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1973</xref>), Phobos-2 in the UVA region (Moroz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1993</xref>), the Hubble Space Telescope (James et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1994</xref>), and most recently by SPICAM (Perrier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2006</xref>) and MARCI (Wolff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2010</xref>). Radiative transfer codes, that can cope with Mie multiple scattering and arbitrary observation geometries, must be used to retrieve an estimate of the surface UV flux or the total column of ozone from orbiter based observations. These models make certain assumptions about the values of unknown critical parameters of the scattering and reflection processes such as the surface UV reflectance (UV albedo) properties, vertical dust profile, dust absorption and scattering parameters, etc. The REMS-UV sensor will measure, for the first time, at least two years of continuous, and systematic, surface based UV direct and diffuse spectral irradiance measurements and will provide ground-truth to the orbiter based measurements and allow for better tuning of key parameters of the radiative transfer models.</p></sec><sec><title>Surface Habitability and Chemistry</title><p>UV photons have enough energy to excite and remove electrons from atoms and molecules, inducing the formation of radicals and ions. Some of these products may recombine in a chemical reaction leading to the formation of new molecules. A reliable knowledge of the UV radiation levels on the Martian surface is thus important for photochemical models of the atmosphere (Rodrigo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1990</xref>), for the chemistry of the surface minerals and the formation of oxidating radicals (Mukhin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1996</xref>; Yen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2000</xref>; Quin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2001</xref>) and, because of its interaction with organic molecules, is paramount for the estimate of biological doses (Cockell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2000</xref>; Patel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2004a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2004b</xref>; Cordoba-Jabonero et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>). In particular, the most relevant organic molecules, nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and proteins, which are furthermore common to all known living forms, are very sensitive to UV radiation. Nucleic acids show a strong absorption band in the range of 260 nm and proteins in the range of 280 nm. Therefore a high level of UV radiation can totally dissociate these molecules and sterilize a surface. The adverse Mars surface conditions are restrictive for life as we know it on Earth but a very thin regolith layer or snow cover can play a protective role for making the conditions compatible for microbial life as it was reported by Amaral et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>), Gómez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2010</xref>) and Cordoba-Jabonero et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>). The simultaneous measurements provided by RAD, the particle detector instrument of the MSL rover, and REMS-UV sensor will help understanding the radiation environment on Mars and its implication on surface sterilization processes and dissociation of organic molecules.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Volatile and Dust Cycles</title><sec><p>There are three fundamental climate cycles that need to be understood if we are to gain predictive understanding of the Martian atmosphere and climate. These are the cycles of the two dominant volatiles, CO<sub>2</sub> and water, and that of dust. Based on existing data and heavily leaning on numerical models, we believe we understand the basic outline of these cycles. However, we need more data, especially at the surface, to test our theories of surface/atmosphere exchange and to determine the roles of reservoirs such as the regolith for the water cycle. In most cases, many aspects of the processes are not well understood.</p></sec><sec><title>The Seasonal <italic>CO</italic><sub>2</sub> Cycle</title><p>Viking observations suggest that the dominant seasonal surface pressure variations are due to the cycling of the seasonal CO<sub>2</sub> polar ice caps. This suggestion is in good agreement with model predictions and other spacecraft observations and is widely accepted. Open questions exist in regard to why the seasonal cycles observed by Viking were so repeatable despite differences in dust activity and if the cycle is in long-term balance. REMS measurements will provide additional constraints for models of the CO<sub>2</sub> cycle by providing a long-term time series of pressure data at a tropical site where the dynamical contribution to surface pressure is expected to be relatively small. REMS pressure measurements may also be able to determine if the south polar residual cap is disappearing as hypothesized based on images of the southern residual polar cap. The purported rate of disappearance is estimated to be equivalent to an increase in global mean pressures of about 1 % of the present atmospheric mass per Mars decade (Malin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2001</xref>). By the time MSL begins surface operations, the expected rise in global mean surface pressures since Viking is ∼15 Pa (see Haberle and Kahre <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref> for details), which should be detectable in REMS pressure data provided, there is no significant post-launch change in the calibration of its pressure sensors.</p></sec><sec><title>The Water Cycle</title><p>Martian atmospheric water vapor observations require water to be exchanged between the surface/subsurface and atmosphere on seasonal timescales. Exchange almost certainly occurs with the seasonal and residual polar water ice caps, and may also involve the adsorption/desorption of water from the regolith. However, the relative importance of these processes is not well constrained. The dynamics of water transport depends on the interplay of surface characteristics (soil water content, porosity, albedo, composition, and stratigraphy), atmospheric conditions (stability, circulation patterns) and insolation (variable on diurnal, seasonal and geological time scales).</p><p>The Martian PBL plays an important role in the exchange of water between the surface and the free atmosphere (Jakosky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1997</xref>). The sublimation/desorption of water from the regolith is regulated by both turbulent and molecular processes. REMS vapor measurements along with the PBL measurements mentioned in Sect. <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">2.1</xref> will provide insight into how and to what degree water exchanges between the atmosphere and the local surface/subsurface and help constrain the role of the regolith in the water cycle. These measurements, in combination with ground temperature and surface compositional information may also allow insight into the thickness of the soil active layer on Mars and its freezing/sublimation water dynamics (Ramos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The Dust Cycle</title><p>Suspended dust is a major modulator of the atmosphere and climate of Mars because of its impact on radiative heating of the surface and atmosphere. REMS will provide a global monitoring of atmospheric dust via the thermotidal signature in the surface pressure observations (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">2.3</xref>). These observations will not only allow the seasonal evolution of dust to be assessed, but will also provide crucial information should a large dust storm develop during the MSL mission. REMS will also provide information on conditions necessary for dust lifting, should aeolian transport of dust be observed at Gale by the MSL or orbiter cameras.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>REMS Design Requirements</title><p>The overaching goal of REMS is to assess the current habitability at the Martian surface at the MSL landing site. Habitability is determined on the basis of: environmental conditions, which are in turn determined by meteorology; solar irradiance and especially the UV irradiance at the surface; and, by the cycling of water. The investigation goal consequently maps to objectives of understanding meteorology on various scales, the UV irradiance, and volatile cycles (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The objectives in turn dictate a specific set of measurements. Meteorology requires the thermal state, air motions, and pressure to be measured; UV irradiance requires direct measurement; and, the cycling of water requires measurement of humidity in addition to those measurements required for meteorology. Specific requirements on these measurements<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> are as further discussed in this section and as summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Air and ground temperature.

Both booms include their associated Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)-based Sensor Front-End (SFE) electronics. The ICU includes the instrument electronics and the Pressure sensor (PS). The booms are located on the MSL Remote Sensor Mast (RSM) (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), while the UV Sensor is on the rover deck and the ICU-Pressure Sensor package is placed inside the rover body. <fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Artistic view of Curiosity, where the position of the REMS Booms and the Ultraviolet Sensor can be seen.

In particular, to best achieve the REMS science goals, a boom or arm of sufficient length to isolate the sensors from the rover thermal and aerodynamic perturbations would have been required. However, because of imposed engineering requirements (e.g. the REMS boom could not be an obstacle during mast deployment), it was not possible to satisfy this instrument requirement.</p><p>The REMS final design thus represents a balance between science goals and vehicle constraints, with the following results: (i) while strictly being too short, the boom length was the maximum allowed by RSM deployment constraints; (ii) two booms were implemented with an angular offset of 120 degrees, so that at least one of them will always be outside of the RSM wake, and (iii) the booms are high enough with respect to the rover deck to minimize the rover body perturbations (430 and 380 mm above rover deck and approximately 1.6 m above the surface). In order to analyze the impact of these engineering constraints, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with the final rover configuration have been performed.</p><p>The components of the REMS instrument are: <list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The Wind Sensors (WS) that are based on hot film anemometry and are composed of three recording points around each Boom.

The GTS is mounted on Boom 1, and it is directly connected to the Sensor Front-End electronics. The thermopiles look downwards, pointing at the ground alongside the rover and covering an area of about 100 m<sup>2</sup>. The sensor includes an active self-calibration system to compensate potential degradation during the mission associated with dust collection on the sensor window (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">4.2</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Ultraviolet Sensor (UVS) that is located on the rover deck, and is composed of seven photodiodes (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec25" ref-type="sec">4.10</xref>) and a thermistor to monitor the temperature of the UVS. Due to its location, the sensor is exposed to dust deposition and design constraints ruled out any active protection system. Nevertheless, to mitigate the dust degradation effect, each photodiode has a magnet around it, creating a magnetic field that deflects magnetic dust.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Pressure Sensor (PS) that is located in the rover body, and is composed of a Vaisala Barocap<sup>®</sup> and associated Vaisala Thermocap<sup>®</sup>, both provided by the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI).

They are attached to the lower edge of the SFE ASIC housing, protruding in the direction of the boom front-end and under the booms shaft. The sensors are small rods manufactured with low thermal conductivity material and with a thermistor at the tip to measure the ambient temperature. The rod is heated by the boom itself and contaminates the tip thermistor data. To estimate the error induced by this effect, an additional thermistor has been located in the middle of the rod (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">4.3</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Instrument Control Unit (ICU) (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec28" ref-type="sec">4.13</xref>) that provides the interface with the rover in terms of data, telemetry and power, receives digital data from the booms sensors, powers the SFE electronics, and processes data from the PS, HS and UVS. The SFE (Sensor Front-End) ASIC (see Sect. <xref rid="Sec27" ref-type="sec">4.12</xref>) in turn provides the sensor electronic interface for the ATS, WS and GTS at boom level. The UVS-ICU communication is analog in order to avoid any electronics at the sensor unit; the harness have been properly shielded to minimize line noise.</p></list-item></list></p><p>An important effect to take into account is the fact that the rover radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) is a constant source of heat, which heats the rover itself but also the fluid around it and the ground illuminated by its infrared radiation. These latter two effects have an impact on the REMS measurements. If the REMS booms happen to be in the lee of the RTG the thermal wake will perturb the air temperature measurements and the steady heat of the RTG may create a standing thermal plume over the rover in low wind situations. More generally, the RTG infrared emission will heat the ground sampled by the GTS.</p><p>The REMS design had to abide by stringent restrictions with respect to mass, power and dimensions.

The observational requirements are for ground temperature to be measured over the full range expected in the Martian tropics and over the full year (roughly 150–300 K) and with a resolution of 2 K and an absolute accuracy of better than 10 K. Spacecraft resources combined with the need to measure routinely along with the other REMS sensors dictated that deployable contact probes were not practical (indeed, other issues such as determination of the depth of a contact probe measurement combined with the rapid change of temperature within centimeters of the surface present other issues for contact measurements). As such, and based on the precedent set by the MER mini-TES instrument, infrared radiometry was selected for the GTS.</p></sec><sec><p>The GTS is located in the REMS Boom 1 positioned on the MSL RSM mast (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

The orientation of the FoV was selected to minimize direct heating of the observed ground by the rover, however, the area remains too close to rule out rover heating. This is made much worse by the orientation that JPL selected for Boom 1 that leads to significant thermal contamination of the ground viewed by the RTG.</p></sec><sec><title>Choice of Thermopiles</title><p>Thermopiles were chosen as the IR detectors for the GTS because they are small and lightweight, and capable of functioning at almost any operating temperature applicable to Mars. Furthermore, they are sensitive to the whole IR spectrum, comparatively cheap and require only simple readout electronics, enabling further reductions to be made in the weight and size of the complete instrument. Finally, thermopiles can operate without the need for any sort of temperature control system, because they are less sensitive than other systems to the emergence of thermal gradients.</p><p>Thermopiles are not standard parts for space applications, however and at present no formally space-qualified thermopile sensors exist. Nevertheless, it should be noted here that the Infrared Thermal Mapper (IRTM) on the Viking orbiters and the MUPUS-TP experiment on the ROSETTA mission have demonstrated that thermopile detectors are well suited to measure low surface temperatures under spaceflight conditions. The thermopile model selected for the REMS is the TS-100, from the Institute for Physical High Technology (IPHT) in Jena (Germany), encapsulated within a TO-5 with no optical system but rather a thermopile filter built to specifications and pre-bonded onto the TO-5 as the thermopile window. The thermopiles have a non corrosive insulator and transparent <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> atmosphere filling, as well as an internal RTD, a Pt1000, to measure temperature at the thermopile case base, which acts as a temperature reference for the thermocouple cold-junction.</p></sec><sec><title>Need for Inflight Calibration</title><p>As the GTS is downward-looking, it is not expected that a high level of dust will be deposited on it, based on the experience of previous Martian optical instruments with similar configurations. However, it is not realistic to assume an <italic>a priori</italic> estimation of the degradation due to dust over the mission lifetime. To mitigate against dust deposition as the likely key source of degradation and hence to recover accurate ground temperature measurements, an in-flight recalibration system has been implemented. This system is based on a simple low mass and high emissivity calibration plate (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), which can be heated to a given temperature and is placed in front of the thermopile housing piece, so that each IR detector looks at the ground through a hole in the plate. Thus, part of the FOV is obstructed by the calibration system, hence defining the measurement solid angle (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Indeed, the calibration plate system allows an estimate of the factors that influence the global sensitivity of the detectors to be determined and hence to correct GTS measurements over the mission. One thing that calibration cannot correct for is that continued dust deposition shall imply a directly proportional reduction of the signal to noise ratio for GTS, increasing sensor uncertainty (<italic>e.g.</italic> in the limit of complete dust obscuration the signal shall fall to zero and hence the measurement uncertainty shall rise to infinity even with perfect calibration). <fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><italic>Left</italic>: 3D mechanical layout of REMS GTS. <italic>Right</italic>: Picture of the REMS GTS flight model.

The first two bands are optimized for the warmer and cooler portions of the Martian ground temperature range. Following Wien’s law, the wavelength of maximum blackbody spectral radiance for a given temperature is given by <italic>λ</italic><sub>max</sub> [μm]=2898/<italic>T</italic> [K]. If the maximal and minimal Martian temperatures are 300 K and 150 K, then the sensor is designed to work optimally in the range from 9.9 μm to 19.3 μm. Additionally, the measurements must be performed within a range where the ratio of IR radiance emitted by the Martian surface to the solar IR radiance reflected by the Martian surface, for typical Martian soil emissivities, is significantly greater than one. This condition is achieved above 8 μm, where the solar reflected radiance is smaller than 0.5 % for 150 K. Finally, the last restriction involved in the selection of these bands was to avoid the CO<sub>2</sub> atmospheric absorption band centered at 15 μm, with a bandwidth of 1 μm, that is the main component of the Martian atmosphere IR absorption/emission. Within this band gaseous atmospheric absorption can significantly alter the brightness temperature, even over the few 10’s of meters path of the GTS. Indeed, a third GTS band is centered on the CO<sub>2</sub> absorption band. This allows any residual influence that the atmosphere may have on the other two thermopile bands to be determined and may allow the brightness temperature of the air at roughly 0.5 m above the surface to be retrieved, in analogy with the MER mini-TES experiment. <table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>GTS thermopiles characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th><p>GTS Item</p></th><th><p>Wavelength</p><p>Sensitivity</p></th><th><p>Unit</p></th><th><p>Range</p><p>Min-Max</p></th><th><p>Sensitivity</p><p>Min-Max</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Thermopile A</p><p>(Group of thermocouples)</p></td><td><p>8–14 μm</p><p>(average transmittance 75 %)</p><p>see Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></p></td><td><p>Volts</p></td><td><p>±1.6 mV</p></td><td><p>35–70 μV/K</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Thermopile B</p><p>(Group of thermocouples)</p></td><td><p>15–19 μm</p><p>(average transmittance 75 %)</p><p>see Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></p></td><td><p>Volts</p></td><td><p>±0.64 mV</p></td><td><p>12–16 μV/K</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Thermopile C</p><p>(Group of thermocouples)</p></td><td><p>14.5–15.5 μm</p><p>(average transmittance 75 %)</p><p>see Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></p></td><td><p>Volts</p></td><td><p>±0.25 mV</p></td><td><p>4.7–6.6 μV/K</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec><title>Effect of Surface Emissivity Uncertainty on Interpretation of GTS Measurements</title><p>The measurement requirements for GTS are for 2 K resolution and 10 K absolute accuracy. Aside from the uncertainties within the GTS system, the choice of brightness temperature measurements to determine surface kinetic temperature contains its own uncertainty: we do not know the surface emissivity (e.g. Kieffer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1972</xref>; Daniel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1990</xref>). The choice of IR thermopile radiometery for GTS was based on results from the Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) and more recently and directly, the MER mini-TES results. In particular, mini-TES results suggest that surface emissivities at two Martian landing sites were generally at or above 0.95. Emissivities at or below 0.9 were very rare. These results are generally consistent with TES orbital observations. Orbital data suggest that the Gale Crater site will have a relatively high emissivity, above 0.95. Given that the ratio of kinetic surface temperature to brightness temperature is given by the inverse of the fourth root of emissivity, for emissivities of 0.85, 0.9, 0.95, and 1 the error for a 300 K surface is 12.4 K, 8 K, 4 K, and 0 K (4.1 %, 2.7 %, 1.3 %, and 0 % respectively). Given that the 0.9–1 range covers the vast majority of Martian surfaces, a retrieval assumption of 0.95 for emissivity introduces a centering of the error such that the spread shifts to 3.8 K, 0 K, 4 K, and 8 K (1.3 %, 0 %, 1.3 %, and 2.7 %, respectively). Since the FoV is large and the resolution is only relevant for repeated measurements at the same site, hence with the same emissivity, the emissivity uncertainly only influences the absolute accuracy. Hence, even for the unlikely case of anomalously low emissivity the induced error for absolute accuracy is below the 10 K requirement.</p><p>In fact, it is likely that information from other instruments and from laboratory experiments will help reduce the emissivity further. The emissivity is determined by the composition of the surface, both its mineralogy and the particle size distribution. In this light, the laboratory Fourier transform IR (FTIR) reflectance spectra of a set of selected astrobiologically significant minerals (including oxides, oxi/hydroxides, sulphates, chlorides, opal and clays) and basalt (as the main and most widespread volcanic Martian rock) has been measured (Martín-Redondo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2009</xref>), taking into account different mixing amounts of minerals and covering the GTS spectral range. A set of minerals were selected for the experiments, from verified standards (SARM, NCS, USGS) and Mars analogs (e.g. Rio Tinto, Jaroso, Atacama): hematite, goethite, magnetite, jarosite, halite, smectite/montmorillonite and opal (all inerals that have been detected on Mars). The mineral composition was previously verified by XRD (Seifert XRD 3003 TT). Samples were cut into small pieces, ground in an agate mortar, and sieved to get a powder smaller than 45 μm (in accordance with the expected average size/mean diameter of Martian regolith dust). All mineral powders were dried in order to fit the Mars arid surface conditions before their final analysis using a Nicolet Nexus FT-IR (Thermo), using a Reflectance accessory (Praying Mantis Diffuse Reflection attachment, HARRICK). Binary and ternary mixtures were performed, covering different percentages and using basalt (BDR-2, USGS) as general matrix/groundmass for the mineral combinations. All spectra were recorded, covering the working wavelength range of the REMS GTS. The results obtained indicated significant percentage increases or decreases of reflectance in the whole wavelength range (e.g basalt-hematite vs. basalt-magnetite) and specific variations restricted to some spectral bands (e.g. basalt-smectite vs. basalt-opal). Data showed that the basalt reflectance percentage increases or decreases, even up to 100 %, depending on the mixing of the different minerals. This study confirms the necessity of taking into account the chemical-mineralogical assemblages (and textures) for any study and interpretation of Mars surface environment (e.g. its ground temperature), and that it will be necessary: (a) to incorporate new mineral phases (e.g. carbonates) and (b) to compare the results obtained in the laboratory with additional IR measurements, carried out directly on the field, on geological outcrops displaying different mineralogical associations. Significantly, it suggests that mineralogy and surface texture determined from other MSL instruments likely can be used to help reduce uncertainty in the emissivity and help improve the GTS absolute accuracy.</p></sec><sec><title>The GTS Instrument Thermal Model</title><p>The thermal model for the GTS system is needed to determine the planetary surface brightness temperature from the various sensor measurements and to interpret the calibration plate results. It is based on an energy balance equation that accounts for the heat fluxes exchanged by radiation, conduction and convection between thermopile detector and the elements around, considering explicitly the sensor’s internal and external physical structure and operation. Despite being more mathematically complex than that commonly used, this model has permitted the design of practical methodologies to compensate the effects of sensor spatial thermal gradients, and to calibrate model constants based on a differential approach.</p><p>The model starts from the definition of an energy balance equation (<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>) which accounts for the heat fluxes entering the thermopile bolometer from all the bodies around it, disregarding the heat fluxes between physical elements other than the bolometer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). The bolometer is designed to be well insulated from the thermopile case and to have low thermal mass, so that the following equilibrium condition is reached after a settling time of a few milliseconds.

These data were taken during the System Thermal Test (STT) performed at JPL during the final rover assembly tests. The tests were run within an environmental chamber at Martian pressure with an almost fully operational rover, with all its instruments operating, including a device emulating the heating generated by the RTG. The Solar lamps of the Martian chamber were adjusted to different levels of intensity to emulate the radiative forcing during the solar cycle on Mars and the thermal diurnal cycle of the air was emulated by injection of <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> at different temperatures. A set of wire-hung thermocouples (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>’s) were used to monitor the ambient temperature in the vicinity of the rover. The temperature sensed by the <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>’s is free from solar heating contamination, because of the small size of the <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>’s, and from rover conduction contamination because they were hung from wires and were not directly connected to the rover. An average of the temperature sensed by the two <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>’s that were placed on either side above the rover mast shall be taken as the reference temperature for the air.

The sensor resides inside the REMS ICU box. The transducers of the Pressure sensor can be used in turn, thus providing some redundancy and improved reliability. Each transducer has 2 Vaisala Barocap<sup>®</sup> pressure sensor heads and 2 Thermocap<sup>®</sup> temperature sensors.

The measurement is based on capacitor plates (electrodes) moved by pressure, thus changing the capacitance of the sensor head. The nominal capacitance of a Barocap<sup>®</sup> at Mars is between 10 and 15 pF depending on its type. Similar pressure heads as used by REMS have been utilized in the highly successful Huygens/Cassini mission at the Saturnian moon Titan as well as by Phoenix Mars mission (Harri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1998b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2006</xref>; Taylor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Pressure Sensor Calibration</title><p>The pressure sensor is calibrated by measuring its output in several pressure and temperature points under stable and changing temperature. The stable temperature measurements are performed over the range of 0–14 hPa (vacuum to Martian pressure range) with 100 Pa intervals and −45 <sup>∘</sup>C…+55 <sup>∘</sup>C (operational temperature range inside REMS ICU box) with max 15 <sup>∘</sup>C intervals. In the measurements under changing temperature pressure is kept in 8 Pa while temperature is swept over the operational range down and up with rates ±15 <sup>∘</sup>C/h and ±30 <sup>∘</sup>C/h. A Vaisala PTB201 pressure transmitter modified for the Martian pressure range is used as pressure reference.

In REMS this compensation algorithm is a part of the data processing pipeline. Changes in ambient temperature also cause slowly evolving temperature hysteresis, the magnitude of which depends on the magnitude and rate of the temperature variations. In “Day in life” scenario in the MSL System Thermal Test, the temperature of the Pressure sensor varied from +10 <sup>∘</sup>C to +33 <sup>∘</sup>C during one sol and the fastest temperature change rate was 6 <sup>∘</sup>C/h. Corresponding short-term variation in the reading of the high-stability Barocap is less than 1 Pa peak-to-peak, and in the worst case scenario it would be 2 Pa peak-to-peak.</p><p>Another phenomenon that affects the readings of the Pressure sensor is water in- and outgassing of the Barocap<sup>®</sup> sensor heads. During the storage in ambient pressure, water is condensed in the sensor heads changing their temperature dependence. When the pressure is lowered and/or the sensor is heated, the water outgases. This has been taken into account in on-ground tests and calibrations by giving the sensor enough time to outgas warm temperature and in low pressure before measurements. Based on experience from the Phoenix pressure sensor the water in-gassed during pre-launch storage may not outgas completely during the interplanetary cruise. Consequently, outgassing during the surface operations phase may still change the temperature dependence of the Barocap<sup>®</sup>. The time scale of this uncertainty is one sol and the magnitude for the high-stability Barocap<sup>®</sup> is estimated to be less than 1.5 Pa peak-to-peak during the most of the mission. During the first few weeks after landing the magnitude might be stronger as a consequence of moisture outgassing.</p><p>Aging affects slightly the offsets of the pressure readings of the Barocap<sup>®</sup>. This effect can be almost fully compensated by subtracting a pressure value measured in vacuum from the readings in other pressures. The offset of the high-stability Barocap<sup>®</sup> stayed constant with ±2 Pa precision during the whole test campaign. Also the offset of high-resolution Barocap<sup>®</sup> #2 stayed constant with ±2 Pa between the last check-out in May 2009 and MSL System Thermal Test 22 months later, if kept under +55 <sup>∘</sup>C temperature. Taking into account the accuracy of the reference sensor and the shown stability of the Barocap<sup>®</sup> during the test campaign, the absolute accuracy of daily averaged readings of these two Barocap<sup>®</sup> is 3 Pa after the first weeks of the mission, when most of the moisture has outgassed. The EOL accuracy will potentially be slightly worse, taking into account possible systematic drift with rate max 1 Pa/year. Offset drift is the only error source affecting daily averages as the deviations caused by other error sources average out.</p><p>The warm-up behavior of the sensor is such that there is an uncertainty in the readings measured right after power-up. The uncertainty decreases exponentially with time with the following time constants: 2 minutes for high-stability Barocap<sup>®</sup>, and 15 s for the high-resolution Barocap<sup>®</sup>. Thus the readings measured in the end of each 5-minute session are more accurate than the readings measured in the beginning, and they should be used in studies of long-term phenomena instead of the averages of the whole 5-minute sessions.</p><p>Based on the above effects, the Pressure sensor calibration is based on a number of tests, some of them for calibration purpose and other one for checking out, the list is the following one: <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Temperature calibration.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Calibration 1.

The transducer electronics and the sensor heads are placed on a single multi-layer PCB of a 36×15 mm<sup>2</sup> size protected by a metallic Faraday cage. The PCB is supported by a mechanical interface mounted on the REMS Boom. The Faraday cage is perforated to allow sufficient ventilation. The holes are covered with a PTFE filter material to protect the sensor head from dust (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>).</p><p>The Humicap<sup>®</sup> sensor heads contain an active polymer film that changes its capacitance as function of relative humidity, with 0 to 100 % RH measurement range. The film reacts to the relative humidity, even if the instrument is not powered. Once powered, the relative humidity can be read almost immediately (1 s is allowed for electronics stabilization). Nominal capacitance of Humicap<sup>®</sup> is in order of 6 pF. The dynamic range of the Humicap<sup>®</sup> changes with temperature, being approximately 1 pF around 0 °C and ∼0.3 pF around −70 °C. The Humicap<sup>®</sup> also becomes logarithmically slower with lower temperature, its time constant is ∼0.1 s at +20 °C, but for example at −40 °C it is ∼30 s and at −70 °C ∼700 s. The time lag is about 5 min around −60 °C. The timelag can be mathematically partially compensated on-ground. The Thermocap<sup>®</sup> temperature sensor heads have no time lag.</p><p>The Humicap<sup>®</sup> sensor heads also have Pt heating resistors that are used periodically to heat the sensor heads to +135 °C…150 °C to eliminate possible contaminants that can affect the capacitance.

Pt100 sensors attached directly to the instrument are used as reference sensors in the temperature calibration. These Pt100 sensors are in turn calibrated in a temperature calibration bath, the reference sensor of which is calibrated at Finnish Metrology and Accreditation Center and is traceable to national standards. As the result of the temperature calibration, ±0.1 °C accuracy compared to the Pt100 reference sensor is achieved for the Thermocap<sup>®</sup>.</p><p>At the same time with Thermocap<sup>®</sup>, also the heating resistor used for regeneration is calibrated against reference Pt100. ±0.1 °C accuracy is achieved also here.

The lowest temperature point for humidity calibration is −70 °C. Dry conditions are achieved in a vacuum chamber and wet conditions in a closed vessel with substantial humidity, which is then cooled down until dew/frost point is achieved.</p><p>Humicap<sup>®</sup> behavior is linear (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref> in terms of both temperature and humidity (ref: Vaisala)). As the result of dry and wet point measurements in different temperatures and Humicap<sup>®</sup> linearity, isohumes of relative humidity in different temperatures can be calculated.

During the first couple of minutes of operation the sensor heats up about 1.5 °C that would lead to a considerable difference with the actual ambient humidity.

More recently, the Phoenix Mars lander reached Mars in 2007 equipped with a very simple windsock design (Taylor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2008</xref>). Mars Polar Lander and Beagle 2 Lander, launched in December 1999 and June 2003 respectively, were designed to also measure wind speed and direction.</p></sec><sec><p>Hot wire anemometry was used in the Viking mission and from then, has been a reference in the design of wind sensors for Mars due mainly to its simplicity. The wind sensor assembly in Viking 1 and 2 consisted of two hot wires oriented at right angles to each other. A reference air temperature was measured using an identical hot wire located between the two wind sensors. A quadrant sensor at the top of the assembly provided the wind direction. Finally, air temperature was measured independently using a thin wire thermocouple (Chamberlain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1976</xref>). Three small aluminum windsocks were included on the Mars Pathfinder meteorological boom. The windsocks were mounted at different heights (0.53 m, 0.82 m, and 1.12 m above ground) in order to return information about the near-surface wind profile (Seiff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1997</xref>). The Phoenix mission carried the ‘telltale’ also based on the dynamic pressure exerted on a thin kapton tube, which retrieved very coarse wind speed information (Taylor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec><p>REMS follows Viking design and uses thermal anemometry to record the wind speed also. Hot wire anemometry is based on recording either the amount of power required to heat a wire so that it maintains a constant temperature difference with the ambient (CTA) or to record the temperature of the wire when supplied with a constant amount of power (CPA). The convective power is then calculated, which in turn is used to obtain the wind speed. The REMS wind sensors use a thin film instead of a wire: titanium thin film resistors patterned on the surface of a silicon chip (Domínguez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec><p>In all previous missions, an arm or mast isolated the wind sensor from the lander body.

Each die has resistors to heat itself and to measure its own temperature. They are isolated from the board by four pillars with a low thermal conductance material. These dice are assembled in a square configuration and kept at a fixed temperature difference with respect to a cold die (located further apart) using an individual electro-thermal sigma-delta control loop that supplies power to each hot die. The four dice electronics concept is described in detail in Domínguez et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>).

This configuration assures that for most of the wind directions there will always be one boom outside the mast wake. To identify the best boom for the wind determination we prepared a look-up-table extracted from a set of CFD simulations run at representative “average” Gale conditions (700 Pa, 223 K, CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere, two wind speed ranges (0–20 m/s and 0–70 m/s), and a range of different incident angles) using a simplified model of the rover, which includes the RSM mast where both booms are located. The local components at the location of all the thermal anemometers was registered, and a database with those local components and with the wind flow speed and yaw and pitch angles was produced. The look-up-table provides a series of rules which are applied to the two boards which give the highest readings for the local components for each boom. The rough estimate of the wind direction is based on sorting the local components, their signs, as well as sorting the two components ratios for each board. The rules were identified after analyzing the results of 90 simulations of the base set at constant speed (10 m/s), varying both the pitch and yaw angles. A fine tuning of the rules was necessary when all Reynolds numbers were considered (particularly for the lowest and the highest wind speeds). This algorithm gives an estimate of the wind horizontal direction (yaw) with a maximum precision of ±30<sup>∘</sup> and a minimum precision of ±90<sup>∘</sup>. For predicted direction intervals contained in [−90 90] boom 2 will be selected, and boom 1 for direction intervals contained in [90 270]. When the predicted direction isn’t fully contained in either interval, it means both booms are receiving a strongly distorted flow, and boom 2 is selected, as it has proven to be more accurate in average than boom 1 in these circumstances (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>) showing the booms’ positions and their prediction intervals). This algorithm will be refined with real test data of two booms mounted on an RSM mast dummy in the linear tunnel facility at INTA. <fig id="Fig17"><label>Fig. 17</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Diagram showing the intervals for which each boom is selected as input for the inverse model.

The query is done for 4 local components of the selected boom (two boards with two local components each). The (pitch, yaw) pair, which minimizes the difference in the local components is selected as center point for the interpolation of a finer grid mesh database with interpolated values for the two boards local components. The new interpolated database is again queried, retrieving as solution the mesh point (pitch, yaw, Reynolds) which minimizes the local components readings difference. Independent retrieval tests with training and non-training mesh data have been carried out and have shown that the initial pitch and yaw angle retrieval to be used as center for the finer mesh interpolation is achieved. This will guarantee the 30<sup>∘</sup> error requirement, as the training mesh currently used is finer than that. The Reynolds number retrieval algorithm will require additional training data.

For the WS tests to be representative we required: (1) same model geometry, (2) same materials and manufacturing processes and (3) same operation Reynolds and Prandtl number. The CM fulfills the first two and the third requires to reproduce gas composition, pressure, wind speed and temperatures. Three Mars facilities were considered, but some drawbacks were detected in all of them: the NASA AMES Mars wind tunnel is only operated with nitrogen; the new Mars tunnel at the University of Aarhus was not yet operative and Oxford University Mars tunnel test section proved to be too small for testing REMS wind sensor. Due to this, a facility was developed for the calibration of the REMS WS at CAB. At INTA Mars wind linear tunnel facility, full tests are being performed with the CM model and the same batch of tests compared with CFD simulations.</p><p>Due to the use of identical materials and manufacturing processes for the Calibration Models (CMs) and the Flight Models (FMs), both showed the same performance. Three types of tests were conducted on the FM and CM models: one set of minimally intrusive tests on both the FMs and the CMs to characterize electronically the models, a second set of tests (also done on the FMs and CMs) to determine in detail the possible manufacturing differences between them, and the third set of tests, more intrusive that are being done only on the CMs at the INTA linear wind calibration facility to determine in detail the aerodynamic response of the sensor, which is identical to the response of the FM as it only depends on the mechanical design of the sensor.</p><p>The electronic characterization of all models consists on the measurement of heater currents, polarization and reference currents, comparator offsets and amplifier gains for several voltages. It also includes the characterization of the resistivity of the platinum alloy of the dice. These variables are needed to calibrate the factors converting from measured voltages to the heating power needed to estimate the winds.</p><p>The calibration of the WS temperature sensors is performed following the same procedure as the PT1000s of REMS ATS, and is described in Sect. <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">4.3</xref>.</p><p>In order to optimize tests and simulations, the effect of temperature (in ambient, boards and hot dice) will be compensated, so that the same set of calibration tests and simulations (performed at a single temperature) are valid for the wind speed retrieval when operating under all circumstances.

For each yaw and pitch of the test mesh, the wind speed correction curve for the non-calibrated rover presence is calculated: The wind flow speed at 3 boom diameters distance is compared in both simulations for several free flow speeds. This correction factor will use the rover perturbed wind speed measured at the booms to estimate the unperturbed free flow speed.

Each broadband photodiode shall provide an approximate evaluation of the incident flux within its range of responsivity: photodiode C provides a first order estimate of the level of biologically damaging irradiance; the outputs of photodiodes A and B are to be compared with terrestrial irradiance while photodiode ABC gives an estimate of the total UV irradiance, and photodiodes D and E are designed to match two UV channels of the MARCI instrument on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) satellite such that a direct comparison with simultaneous reflectance measurements is possible. Each individual photodiode provides information that can be directly compared with their equivalent measurements on Earth or on the top of the Martian atmosphere. But besides, the combined use of the simultaneous measurements of the 6 photodiodes will provide not only better estimates of the incident irradiance per channel, but also a smooth approximation to the spectral shape of the down-welling flux.</p></sec><sec><title>Transfer Process</title><p>To obtain the band integrated irradiance per channel, the usual approach with narrowband radiometers is to calibrate the responsivity. This factor is usually called responsivity <italic>R</italic> by the manufacturer and is associated with an average (or weighted average) of the spectral responsivity of the photodiode. This scalar factor relates the output of the sensor (a current) with the incident band integrated irradiance. The scalar factor approximation is fairly good provided that the spectral range of the radiometer is narrow, that the spectral shape of the irradiance within the spectral support of the detector is smooth or that the response is calibrated for a known spectrum, where only the intensity level is expected to change and the spectral shape is constant. However for intermediate to broadband sensors, as it will be illustrated later on, this scalar factor is dependent upon the spectral shape of the incident irradiance.</p><p>For REMS UV in-situ measurements the challenge is to deliver integrated flux values per channel for varying, unknown, spectral shapes of the incident UV irradiance. The down-welling irradiance depends on the total mass of dust and ozone which in turn may change strongly from one acquisition to another (because of the variation with Solar Zenithal Angle of the path traversed) and also along seasons (due to atmospheric chemistry processes and to the natural dust cycle evolution). Since the dust scattering processes are non-linear, an increment in the total column of dust seen by UV photons will lead to a change in the spectral shape of the diffuse irradiance and, if ozone traces are present, the ozone absorption band will be enhanced in the diffuse component of the irradiance (Zorzano and Córdoba-Jabonero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2007</xref>; Zorzano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2009</xref>). Furthermore the spectral irradiance exciting the photodiodes may also change abruptly with the sudden passage of dust devils or clouds within the line of sight of the direct beam coming from the Sun.</p><p>The response of the photodiodes under different experimental environments has been investigated, the responsivities are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>. The setups considered the response to a Deuterium lamp (<italic>D</italic><sub>2</sub>) in vacuum (<italic>V</italic>), response to a Deuterium lamp in ambient conditions (<italic>A</italic>, and thus with ozone absorption), response to a collimated <italic>Xe</italic> lamp and response to a distant Solar emulator <italic>Xe</italic> lamp within the end-to-end STT REMS tests in <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> ambient with the MSL rover completely integrated. For comparison the averaged response of the photodiodes, as provided by the manufacturer, is shown. This illustrates the dependence of the responsivity with the spectral shape of the irradiance.

Photodiodes C and D are sensitive to the ozone absorption band and thus the spectral shape in this area changes strongly from one scenario to other. As for the ABC and A photodiodes the bandwidth is relatively big and the responsivity depends strongly on the shape of the spectral irradiance. As expected, the <italic>R</italic> factor varies with the spectral shape of the responsivity (and thus with temperature and angle of incidence) but mostly, as illustrated above, with the spectral shape of the incident radiation. Through these examples we have illustrated that for an arbitrary incident spectral shape the power cannot be correlated with the current of the photodiode by simply applying a universal scalar factor.</p><p>To cope with this, an specific algorithm has been developed to retrieve from the 6 broadband measurements of REMS filtered SiC photodiodes an added value product: a smooth approximation to the incident spectrum. This is possible due to spectral support of the chosen photodiodes, which have intersecting ranges of spectral responsivity. In other words, this retrieval process transforms REMS-UV photodiode sensor into something intermediate between a radiometer and a spectro radiometer. This mathematical method, whose details are described elsewhere (Vázquez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2007</xref>; Zorzano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2009</xref>), has been validated numerically.

For this hypothetical case the modeled incident spectra is convoluted with the spectral responsivity and the output delivered currents are evaluated. Using the currents and the responsivities as an input for the retrieval mathematical process an smooth approximation is obtained, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig23" ref-type="fig">23</xref>. The integral UV flux for each channel is then calculated and compared between the initial incident modeled spectrum and the output of the retrieval.

However for channels C and D (those dedicated to ozone absorption), the variation goes beyond 15 %, since the shape of the Martian solar UV irradiance differs widely in this range from the one of the <italic>Xe</italic> lamp. In summary, the scalar responsivity values shown above can be used for quick look calculations, but during operation the full retrieval algorithm shall be applied to the set of 6 currents to retrieve a smooth approximation to the spectral shape of the incident irradiance and from here the integrated irradiance within each wavelength. By doing this we avoid the error associated with variations in the spectral shape of the irradiance.</p><p>Applying this specific processing to REMS-UV deliverables (currents), and taking into account the calibrated spectral responsivities (at a given temperature and corrected by the angle dependent factor), the retrieval process delivers an smooth approximation to the UV spectral irradiance together with REMS-UV nominal deliverables, namely, the band-integrated flux per channel. The smooth approximation of the UV spectrum provided as by-product of the retrieval process, is extremely interesting and shall be used to provide more insight into scientifically relevant issues such as: (1) evaluation of specific biological damaging doses (DNA, protein, skin doses, etc.), photolysis rates and oxidant production (to asses the habitability of the Martian surface), (2) daily evolution of the spectral opacity (to monitor atmospheric dust load, size and absorption-scattering properties), (3) seasonal variation of the absorption band of ozone which serves as proxy for water vapor and (4) comparison with radiative transfer models and satellite measurements (Zorzano and Córdoba-Jabonero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2007</xref>).</p><p>The functional requirements of the REMS-UV sensor were specified for a non dust-degraded sensor. The main plausible limitation for this sensor is its degradation due to dust deposition within the line of sight. A mitigation strategy has been implemented, using magnetic rings to deflect the trajectories of infalling dust and camera images to calibrate the obscuration of a white control target. Further error sources are associated with the contribution of the unfiltered diffuse irradiance in particular to those channels where the signal is expect to be small (namely C and D) (Zorzano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2011</xref>), the approximation of the incident spectrum by a smooth function (as shown above) and the errors in the calculation of the solar incidence angle of the direct beam at the time of acquisition. Finally also the electronic errors have been taken into account. The original functional requirements of REMS photodiodes were to deliver integral UV irradiance measurements with a resolution better than 0.5 % and accuracy better than 10 % with respect to the maximum expected values. These values were given because of expected instrumental capabilities. However, in practice, and according to the laboratory and field site validation of the instrument, the accuracy is expected to be of the order of 5 % (or even better) w.r.t. acquired value.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Ultraviolet Sensor Calibration</title><p>The values of the spectral response at different temperatures and angles of incidence are needed to retrieve from the output current the corresponding incident UV flux. This information is obtained in the calibration process. The response of the flight model and spare photodiodes was calibrated at ALTER Technology Group (Spain) in a nitrogen <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> chamber with a UV transparent window. The <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> atmosphere creates a neutral environment (to avoid the ozone molecular absorption of terrestrial air). The calibration setup consist of a Deuterium (<italic>D</italic><sub>2</sub>) lamp as UV source (Hamamatsu L2D2), an optical bench, focusing optics, a monochromator, a beam splitter and a multimeter. For traceability of the calibration process, the response of three photodiodes under different conditions was characterized at the National Physics Laboratory (NPL, UK) calibration laboratory, for spectral response (ABC type, reference report E07060366/1), linearity (B type, reference report E07060366/2) and angle dependence (E type, reference report E07060366/3). The REMS-UV calibration setup was referenced with these results. All the calibration measurements were performed after a long warm-up period of the UV lamp (of the order of 4500 s), as it was observed that this time is required to achieve full stabilization of the UV spectral profile and intensity. The following list summarizes the main calibration studies. <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Spectral scanning, absolute calibration.

The SiC UV quantum efficiency, varies slightly with temperature specially for higher wavelengths (lower energy photons). The filter spectral response may change with temperature as well. The UV box is embedded within the warm part of the rover and therefore the sensor temperature is expected to vary slowly and within a much narrower temperature range that the nominal calibration temperature interval. This temperature will be continuously monitored by the RTD sensor of the REMS-UV box. Within this thermal range and for wavelengths longer than 280 nm, the responsivity of the SiC dice increases with temperature (about 1 % per <sup>∘</sup>C) and shifts (about 10 to 20 nm) towards longer wavelengths, see Fig. <xref rid="Fig24" ref-type="fig">24</xref> for an illustration of this spectral change in the responsivity. This effect is the dominant one, and thus photodiodes whose spectral response are sensitive in this area, namely E, A and partly B, show a significant temperature dependence. This effect shall be taken into account in the retrieval model using the spectral responsivity of the corresponding temperature in the transfer process. <fig id="Fig24"><label>Fig. 24</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Temperature dependence shift of the SiC responsivity (channel ABC) and influence on the spectral responsivity of channels A, E and B.

It has been observed that the response does not decay as cosine law but as a cos<sup><italic>a</italic></sup>-law instead (with <italic>a</italic>=5.765 from NPL data fit and in agreement with the observed angle dependence of the spectral calibration).</p><p>Linearity of the response is essential to assume that the calibration products, obtained at a given incident spectral power, can be extrapolated to arbitrary irradiance levels on Mars. According to the manufacturer the linearity of the photodiodes is of the order of 1 %. This has been verified within the range [0.12–0.5] W/m<sup>2</sup> at NPL for a B type photodiode. Finally this has been calibrated for all photodiodes types, using the <italic>N</italic><sub>2</sub> temperature chamber, at different temperatures. The UV lamp was operated at maximal power. To reduce the incident power a set of UV filters with different opacities were placed in the beam path and the total, integrated power of the lamp plus filter was recorded at one end of the beam splitter.</p><p>In summary, the overall spectral responsivity of the photodiodes for a given angle of incidence (<italic>θ</italic>) of the direct Sun beam and a known temperature of the UVS box, is obtained by interpolation of the calibrated responsivities at fixed temperatures to the desired temperature point and correction by the cos<sup><italic>a</italic></sup>(<italic>θ</italic>) factor with <italic>θ</italic> the solar angle of incidence to the photodiodes (i.e. taking into account the rover tilt at the moment of acquisition). In fact this later correction factor by a scalar factor may be implemented on a second correction stage, once that is known the exact angle of the sun with respect to the photodiodes (this depends on the Sun position in the sky and on the rover tilt with respect to the surface at the acquisition time).</p><p>Additionally, a set of field validations have been performed to quantify the unfiltered contribution of diffuse radiation (Zorzano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2011</xref>).

An internal timer wakes REMS to take observations according to the pre-determined schedule, saves the data internally, and goes back to sleep. The instrument housekeeping tasks can also be performed according to a schedule. The file loaded into REMS to control all these activities and the times when these are executed is known as Schedule Table (ST).</p><p>In case of being commanded directly by the RCE, the REMS instrument will execute the instrument commands at the moment they are received.</p><p>Basically, REMS is capable of performing the same set of activities in either (of the aforementioned) operational modes. However, the flexibility of the autonomous mode will allow REMS to take observations over night, when the RCE is off. This aspect is a critical factor in achieving REMS science objectives.</p><p>Besides these two working modes, the instrument capabilities are defined on the basis of a <italic>Command/Telemetry Dictionary</italic> that states the communication to/from the instrument. This communication between REMS and RCE is based on a command-response protocol where the RCE is always the master, and the instrument the slave.</p><p>The instrument Command Dictionary allows the RCE and, therefore, the instrument operators through it: <list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Synchronizing and managing the instrument clock.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Managing the built-in self test that the instrument performs during booting process.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Managing the transitions between instrument states.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Managing what copy (image) of the APSW is executed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Commanding REMS to load and enable/disable the execution of the internal Schedule Table.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Managing the REMS EEPROM, RAM and Flash memory banks.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Setting the internal configuration parameters that govern the instrument functionality.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Performing sensor maintenance operations.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Retrieving the scientific and engineering data recorded in memory.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Subsequently to those instrument commands, REMS generates and send a reply on the basis of the defined Telemetry Dictionary. Besides sending back the reports and engineering/scientific data to the Rover, the RCE is kept informed about the status of the instrument by means of these telemetries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>REMS Measurement Strategy</title><p>In order to attain the goal of performing long-term investigations of meteorological phenomena and the UV radiative environment REMS will regularly make brief measurements throughout the Martian day and night, over the lifetime of the mission.</p><p>Typically, REMS will be performing regular observations for approximately 5 minutes every hour, every day. Additionally to this baseline hourly observation cadence, the instrument will operate 60 minutes per sol in some special modes to take additional data. These special modes are: (a) scheduling additional pre-defined observation periods to examine phenomena of known interest, not exceeding those 60 minutes per sol; and/or (b) making real time comparisons between data taken during the hourly 5 minutes periods and a set of pre-defined values in order to algorithmically trigger additional observations immediately following the schedule hourly periods. This last case, namely, the <italic>Event Mode</italic>, tries to detect any ongoing episodic and transitory atmospheric event.</p><p>In addition to their value in understanding Martian meteorology, REMS results will be used to help understand the environment in which the other instruments and the rover are performing their tasks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>REMS Scientific Operation</title><p>Although REMS operation is mainly autonomous, a minimum communication between the instrument and the scientists/engineers on the Earth is required every sol. This communication provides the common framework for exchanging Instrument Commands and Instrument Telemetry between these two ends, using the RCE on the vehicle as relay.</p><p>The scientific operation of the instrument is based on the definition of a sequence of high-level <italic>activities</italic>, which are the essential building blocks of the surface mission, providing a structure for planning of science operations, as well as modeling of those operations. These activities will be the outcome of scientific daily meetings where data from previous sols are analyzed and commented, and will constitute the sequence of actions that all the instruments on the Rover (not only REMS) will execute in the coming sol. This one-sol turnaround commanding and execution cycle is called <italic>Tactical decision procedure</italic>, in opposition to the <italic>Strategic decision procedure</italic>, which is focused on the definition of long term scientific objectives and global resources allocation.</p><p>Participation of REMS team members on those tactical and strategic discussion and decision forums is stated on the basis of the roles defined by the MSL operation framework</p><p>It is also worth to mention that the tactical and strategic operation of REMS will not only fulfill the scientific objectives stated by the MSL Atmosphere and Environment Theme Group. Information provided by REMS will be of a valuable interest in contextualizing the science by the other Science Theme Groups (Volatiles and Isotope Geochemistry; Inorganic Chemistry and Mineralogy; Geology; and Atmosphere and Environment), as well as contributing to the generated cooperative science framework. As an example, the REMS wind forecasts will be decisive in order to schedule science activities which can only be performed under light winds, such as drilling, brushing collection and handling of regolith samples and their deposition in the SAM and CheMin inlet tubes on the rover deck.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Software Tools in Support of REMS Operations</title><p>In order to successfully fulfill their corresponding role objectives and the global MSL goals, REMS scientists and engineers involved in operations will make use of the Ground Data System (GDS). This GDS is made up of various software tools in support of their activities: data validation, processing and archiving, science analysis and instrument commanding.</p><p>The two main cornerstones within the GDS are: (a) MSLICE, a software tool developed by JPL in charge of general science surface operation visualization, activity planning, resource modeling and allocating, and commands sequencing; and (b) QRS, developed by the REMS team and specially focused on the REMS-specific data visualization and analysis, instrument health assessment, and generation and validation of the ST prior to be transmitted to Mars.

From REMS perspective, these EDR are low level instrument science and engineering data (raw voltages, counts, …) at full resolution and time ordered. JPL is responsible for delivering these EDR assembled volumes to PDS according to the schedule stated by the mission.</p><p>Further processing levels, the so-called Reduced Data Records (RDR), are generated by the REMS team as part of the downlink data flow: in a first processing stage, electrical values and temperatures are estimated in combination with calibration information (these datasets are called TELRDR in REMS terminology); as a second processing step, environmental physical magnitudes are estimated (ENVRDR datasets); and finally, some corrections and models are applied in order to eliminate the rover’s influence as well as other factors that may be altering the measurements (MODRDR datasets).</p><p>REMS team and the Centro de Astrobiología are responsible for generating and validating these RDR, and delivering those to PDS six months after landing, and in following intervals of three months along the mission life.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Summary</title><p>The REMS instrument onboard MSL has sensors that will record air and ground temperature, pressure, relative humidity, wind speed in the horizontal and vertical directions, as well as ultraviolet radiation in Mars.
