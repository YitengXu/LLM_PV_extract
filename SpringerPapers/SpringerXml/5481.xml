Storage technologies include a variety of solutions that have been used for different grid services, including frequency control, load following, and uninterrupted power supply. A recent interest is being triggered by the increasing grid balance requirements to integrate variable renewable sources and distributed generation. In parallel, lithium-ion batteries are experiencing a strong market expansion driven by an uptake of electric vehicles worldwide, which is leading to a strong decrease of production costs, making Li-ion batteries an attractive solution also for stationary storage applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en" specific-use="web-only"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Energy storage</kwd><kwd>Electricity</kwd><kwd>Batteries</kwd><kwd>Li-ion</kwd><kwd>Economics</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>chapter-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/978-3-030-86884-0_Chapter_14.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></book-part-meta><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The energy consumption related<index-term id="ITerm1"><term>Economics</term></index-term>to<index-term id="ITerm2"><term>Batteries</term></index-term><index-term id="ITerm3"><term>Electricity</term></index-term> human activities always involved a specific energy supply chain, which provided to the final users the exact amount of energy required at a specific time. Since it is not always possible to match the energy supply with the user’s demand, there is a need for storing energy to compensate this mismatch. The storage may be required with a large diversity of durations, ranging from fraction of seconds to months or even years. Different energy carriers involve multiple storage solutions, based on limits and opportunities related to the form of energy that is stored (chemical, potential, kinetic, electro-static, etc.), as well as on technical and economic features of the available storage technologies.</p><p id="Par3">The easiest energy storage<index-term id="ITerm4"><term>Energy storage</term></index-term> usually happens with fuels, especially solid and liquid, which can be generally stored in their normal form without the need of specific solutions. While attention must be paid in avoiding potential self-combustion, chemical degradation, or phase change, solid and liquid fuels are usually stored in simple tanks (eventually cooled or heated in particular climate conditions).</p><p id="Par4">Additional requirements are usually needed for gaseous fuels, mainly natural gas. Due to its low volumetric density, its transportation and storage are usually performed either by compressing it at high pressures or by liquefying it with the need of providing continuous cooling. Natural gas storage is usually performed on a seasonal basis, to match the continuous supply with the fluctuating demand driven by different weather conditions throughout the years. Such storage strategies usually involve large-scale underground formations, either depleted reservoirs or saline formations. The low energy and fuel losses are generally compensated by the significant economic savings that can be obtained with continuous upstream operations for natural gas.</p><p id="Par5">Another energy carrier that is commonly stored is heat, usually in the form of warm or hot water, either in large-scale facilities connected to district heating networks or industrial users or at small-scale heat storage systems for domestic users. Heat storage is mostly used to exploit the better efficiency related to heat generators operating at constant load, especially biomass boilers and heat pumps. However, large seasonal underground systems are being used in some countries to store solar energy in summer and supply district heating in winter. Some systems exploit the ground as storage medium, while others rely on very large water volumes (Bott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2019</xref>). For small-scale storage, alternative technologies based on phase-changing materials are the objective of multiple research efforts, although commercial applications are still limited.</p><p id="Par6">Electricity stands out among the most difficult energy vectors to be stored. Electricity storage solutions are usually relying on its conversion to another form of energy. With the exception of superconductivity, other current technological solutions rely on chemical, mechanical, gravitational, or electro-static forms of energy. Nevertheless, electricity storage systems are strongly needed to guarantee the continuous balance of the power grid and provide reliable and effective service to the final users. For this task, a wide range of services is required, which are usually categorized with respect to storage duration: from few seconds or minutes for frequency control; to energy transfers across weeks, days, or day-night (also called arbitrage); and to the need of providing UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply) for industrial consumers connected to the grid (Crampes and Trochet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">Each available storage technology is usually tailored to a preferred application, based on technical limitations, design choices, and economic features. Today, most electricity storage worldwide is performed by pumped hydro systems, which rely on a mature technology with lower costs in comparison with the alternatives. Although pumped storage may be used also for frequency regulation, the flexibility provided by its potentially long discharge time (up to a few dozens of hundred hours) is usually exploited for arbitrage. Frequency control is provided through flywheels but more often by backup power generators. Batteries are somewhat in between, since they have discharge times that usually reach some hours, but at the same time they are responsive enough to provide frequency regulation services. Compressed-air storage systems have similar applications than pumped hydro, but due to limited available sites few applications exist.</p><p id="Par8">While most storage systems are mature technologies, there is currently an interesting potential in the deployment of electric batteries, especially based on lithium-ion. The two leading drivers are the additional flexibility required by non-dispatchable renewable sources (mainly solar and wind) and the strongly decreasing cost expected by massive upscaling of battery manufacturing for electric vehicles. Although other chemistries may prove to be disruptive in the future, the current choice appears to be firmly oriented toward Li-ion<index-term id="ITerm5"><term>Li-ion</term></index-term>, which is the preferred choice of numerous large-scale factories worldwide (so-called gigafactories). Their modularity also allows a large range of applications, from utility-scale grid storage to beyond-the-meter batteries for final users, usually coupled with distributed PV generation.</p><p id="Par9">For these reasons, this chapter focuses on Li-ion<index-term id="ITerm6"><term>Li-ion</term></index-term> batteries, given their expected central role in the future power systems. Alternative chemistries will be briefly mentioned, with the aim of highlighting the potential advantages they may provide. Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> provides a technological perspective to highlight the main aspects that are involved in battery design, deployment, and operation. Section <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">3</xref> focuses on battery economics, with attention on the manufacturing supply chain and on the sizing and operational logics. Finally, Sect. 4 closes the analysis by recapping the main take-aways, together with some policy implications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Battery Technologies</title><p id="Par10">Different technologies exist for electric batteries, based on alternative chemistries for anode, cathode, and electrolyte. Each combination leads to different design and operational parameters, over a wide range of aspects, and the choice is often driven by the most important requirements of each application (e.g. high energy density for electric vehicles, low cost for stationary storage, etc.). The current rise in battery manufacturing capacity worldwide is associated with Li-ion<index-term id="ITerm7"><term>Li-ion</term></index-term> batteries, which are meeting the requirements of the electric vehicles (EVs) industry and offer a viable solution also for stationary storage applications, both for utility-scale batteries and behind-the-meter distributed storage.</p><p id="Par11">The historical trend of global stationary storage capacity (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">14.1</xref>) shows an increase in recent years, from around 0.6 GWh in 2010 up to 3.5 GWh in 2017. While up to 2010 most of the capacity was relying on sodium batteries, in 2017 almost 60% of the total capacity is made up of Li-ion<index-term id="ITerm8"><term>Li-ion</term></index-term> batteries (figures may slightly differ when considering output power, since the energy/power ratio is usually different from one technology to another). This rise is due to different factors, but the most important is surely declining costs driven by manufacturing upscaling of this technology for use in EVs, as is further explained later.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 14.1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Evolution of installed capacity for stationary storage (utility scale), per technology.

This capacity is made up of a large number of storage systems with small capacity, usually coupled with local generation from RES (mostly solar). While utility-scale batteries are usually managed centrally, an optimized operation of the distributed energy systems requires the operation of smart grids and networks supported by digital platforms (such as virtual aggregators<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par15">It is important to highlight that stationary storage may refer to different services for the power network, at both the transmission and the distribution levels, which differ based on the response time of the batteries, the discharge duration, and the size of the system. The applications may include services for the transmission grid (arbitrage, frequency regulation, peak shaving, black start, and ramping<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref>) or for the distribution grid and users (voltage support, balance management, uninterruptible power supply (UPS), and support to self-consumption from PV generation<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">The following section will describe the main characteristics of the most significant available technologies, not only with a strong emphasis on Li-ion<index-term id="ITerm10"><term>Li-ion</term></index-term> batteries but also with a discussion of the main alternatives: lead-acid (Pb-A) batteries, sodium-sulfur (Na-S) batteries, and vanadium redox (V-R) flow batteries.

Particularly, the energy/power (E/P) ratio is crucial for the choice of the application, and while there is some room for adjustment by considering specific design parameters (such as electrodes thickness in Li-ion<index-term id="ITerm11"><term>Li-ion</term></index-term> batteries), each technology usually fits best in a specific application as presented hereafter.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Li-Ion Batteries</title><p id="Par20">Li-ion<index-term id="ITerm12"><term>Li-ion</term></index-term> batteries are a recent technology, initially developed at Bells labs in the 1960s and first commercialized by Sony in 1990. The Nobel prize in Chemistry in 2019 has been awarded to J. B. Goodenough, M. S. Whittingham, and A. Yoshino for their crucial role in the development of Li-ion batteries at different steps (Nobel Media AB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2019</xref>).

In particular, most research is focusing on alternative cathode chemistries to improve energy density and safety or reduce cost through limited use of specific materials (especially cobalt). Other areas of research include anode and electrolyte materials and manufacturing processes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Other Battery Technologies</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Lead Batteries</title><p id="Par23">Pb-A batteries are the most mature and diffused battery technology in the world, with their first applications dating back to the 1860s. The extensive research that has been made on many different aspects now guarantees low costs, although with limited life cycles and energy density. Specific additives are available to reach specific objectives, such as reducing the self-discharge or decreasing corrosion issues (Leadbetter and Swan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2012</xref>). Lead batteries are seldom used for heavy cycling applications, but they are generally suitable for infrequent cycle applications such as peak shaving or uninterruptible power supplies. Large batteries have been installed as case studies in different countries, up to 20 MW and 40 MWh, demonstrating good performance over several cycles, although requiring appropriate energy management methods. Notwithstanding the technology maturity, research is still active in different domains with the aim of decreasing costs and addressing specific challenges, such as longer lifecycles or more accurate determination of the state of charge (SOC).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sodium-Sulfur Batteries</title><p id="Par24">Na-S batteries are another relatively new technology, having been developed from the 1960s to the 1990s. While they were initially investigated for electric vehicles without much success, they eventually became among the lowest-cost options for grid storage and renewable applications. The operation of Na-S batteries involves peculiar aspects, including the need of high temperature operation for liquid sodium (300–350°C) and the potential very high reactivity of sodium with air in case of containment losses. While the inefficiency during the operation is generally enough to keep the sodium at the right temperature without the need of an external energy supply, in case of non-operation the battery records up to 20% of daily capacity losses due to heat dissipation. Existing installations have grown rapidly in the last decades, with the largest system for stationary storage reaching to date a capacity of 34 MW and 245 MWh coupled with a 51-MW wind farm to stabilize its power output (Leadbetter and Swan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Flow Batteries</title><p id="Par25">The most diffused technology for flow batteries is the vanadium redox battery (VRB), whose development began in the early 1980s. Its peculiar features include a very long life cycle, the possibility of independently designing the required power and energy output, very low self-discharge losses, and moderate efficiency and costs. In a flow battery, two electrolytes are stored in two separate tanks, and an electrical current is created through a redox reaction by circulating H<sup>+</sup> ions through a membrane. Storage capacity can be raised by increasing the size of the tanks, at constant power output, while increasing the membrane area has the only effect of expanding the power output (i.e. with constant storage capacity). A significant issue is the limited temperature operational range (10–35°C), which usually requires the installation of a temperature control system, although additions to the electrolytes can increase this range. VRB batteries are at a lower technology readiness level in comparison with other solutions, and there are few and small commercial applications to date.

Battery pack prices are strongly decreasing, driven by economies of scale related to EVs deployment, and the remaining costs are also expected to decrease sharply, thanks to increased standardization of storage modules and increased competition on the market.</p><p id="Par27">The economics of Li-ion<index-term id="ITerm15"><term>Li-ion</term></index-term> batteries can be quantified by defining a levelized cost of storage (LCOS), in analogy to the well-known definition of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), with the aim of accounting for all technical and economic parameters affecting the lifetime cost of discharging stored electricity (Schmidt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>). This metric has been defined to improve the limitations of considering only the investment cost, which is often the only indicator that is analyzed, by including replacement and disposal costs, maintenance and operation costs, as well as performance parameters such as capacity degradation over time. LCOS is thus defined as the total lifetime cost of the investment in an electricity storage technology, divided by its cumulative delivered electricity (Schmidt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>); the calculation involves a more in-depth analysis on the expected performance of the unit.</p><p id="Par28">A general formulation of the LCOS is represented in Eq.

Charging costs are also related to the specific price of electricity, which can show large variations, and the round-trip efficiency, for which a degradation over time should be considered.

As already discussed, the most important trend is currently the strong demand of batteries for the EV sector, which is leading to factory capacity expansion in different regions of the world. While this trend is pushing toward a decrease of battery packs cost, Li-ion<index-term id="ITerm17"><term>Li-ion</term></index-term> batteries for stationary storage also include additional components, such as balance of system, power conversion system, energy management system,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref> engineering, procurement, and construction. Some of these additional components may face similar cost decreases in the future thanks to potential synergies with other industries (e.g. inverter costs decrease thanks to their application in the PV deployment).</p><p id="Par36">Detailed information on the investment cost breakdowns is usually not available, due to confidentiality restrictions. Moreover, due to the high variability of both technologies and battery configurations related to specific applications, it is difficult to draw conclusions related to the weight of each component of investment costs. Material-related costs analyzed in different literature studies range from one-third to almost two-thirds of the total system costs, depending on the source, as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">14.3</xref> (IRENA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 14.3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Investment cost breakdowns from five different sources.

Notwithstanding the variable impact of materials in the total investment cost of batteries, the increase of the energy density driven by technology innovation will eventually lead to cost savings, thanks to the lower material input required for the same output capacity.</p><p id="Par38">Many authors calculate learning curves based on the historical trend, assuming that the cost decrease has no significant limitations related to external constraints (Berckmans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2017</xref>; Kittner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2017</xref>; Schmidt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017</xref>). However, other works highlight the fact that the cost of active materials, especially under rising global demand, may act as a strong constraint to further reduce battery costs and may slow down the learning curves (Hsieh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par39">The rise of battery demand will translate to fast-increasing raw materials requirements, as estimated in the chart of Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">14.4</xref> with reference to the expected increase of Li-ion<index-term id="ITerm19"><term>Li-ion</term></index-term> battery production capacity worldwide. In particular, cobalt demand could roughly triple in the period 2018–2028, lithium and graphite demand would grow by 5.5 times, and nickel demand may increase ninefold. Although there has been much debate on the possible lack of materials to support such an expansion, the most critical bottlenecks are expected in the short term, due to the need of adequate planning to upscale the mining industry and the downstream supply chain. Particular issues are related to cobalt, both for the spatial concentration of the resources (more than two-thirds of global cobalt in 2018 have been mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo) and for the fact that is usually obtained as a by-product of nickel and copper mining, making a production upscale more difficult. Moreover, the market concentration of raw materials processing is even more critical, with China representing the largest part of products manufacturing for lithium (51%), refined cobalt (62%), and spherical graphite (100%) worldwide in 2018 (Colbourn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2019</xref>). Industry concentration also limits market opportunities, since the lack of diverse perspectives may result in conservative supply expansion plans from existing players (IRENA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 14.4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Expected increase in raw material demand for global Li-ion<index-term id="ITerm20"><term>Li-ion</term></index-term> batteries manufacturing.

O&amp;M costs vary depending on the application, but their share on the total LCOS shows limited variation, in the range of 16%–24% for current installations (Lazard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>). Higher costs are related to wholesale and transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) applications (22%–24%), while utility-scale or behind-the-meter applications coupled with PV usually have a lower impact of O&amp;M costs (16%–19%).</p><p id="Par42">The electricity cost for charging is an important aspect, and its variability is related not only to the application, with large differences in electricity prices for T&amp;D and behind-the-meter systems, but also to the location of these systems, as electricity price has very large variations from country to country. Moreover, all the applications coupled to variable RES generation are usually considering a null cost for charging, although a part of the investment cost of generation plants should somehow be factored in.</p><p id="Par43">Charging costs in LCOS studies generally consider a fixed average price (and in some cases some increment over the lifetime of the system), usually around 50$/MWh for T&amp;D applications and 100$/MWh for behind-the-meter applications (Schmidt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>). However, while it is difficult to forecast more accurate values on such a long interval, it is important to remind that this cost often shows significant variability over time, and for some applications (e.g. energy arbitrage), it is the main driver of the frequency and duration of battery charge/discharge cycles. Behind-the-meter applications usually face rather constant electricity prices, albeit higher.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>End of Life: Decommissioning and Recycling</title><p id="Par44">The end of life of Li-ion<index-term id="ITerm22"><term>Li-ion</term></index-term> batteries may include different pathways: reusing or repurposing for other applications, recycling of materials, and disposal. While current research is strongly focused on potential recycling procedures, it is estimated that the large majority of batteries is currently disposed, and recycling of Li-ion<index-term id="ITerm23"><term>Li-ion</term></index-term> batteries has not yet emerged as a competitive solution on the market (Pellow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>). However, other more mature battery technologies, especially lead-acid, have already established recycling pathways, but establishing clear policy targets is a key component in the development of adequate technological solutions.</p><p id="Par45">As discussed for battery manufacturing, also in recycling the larger share of EV batteries will probably drive the market for recycling processes. However, end-of-life conditions of these two applications may broadly differ. Research studies suggest the possibility of reusing EV batteries as stationary storage for residential and industrial applications (Mirzaei Omrani and Jannesari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2019</xref>). While a certain level of performance degradation of battery packs may not be acceptable for transport requirements, they could be repurposed for stationary applications thanks to their very low cost. If this option gains interest, the direct material recycling of EV batteries may remain limited, thanks to their extended lifetime through this potential second life.</p><p id="Par46">Few studies currently estimate the potential recycling cost of Li-ion<index-term id="ITerm24"><term>Li-ion</term></index-term> batteries, and the very different assumptions across research works lead to very low comparability of the results. Recovery rates of specific materials are very highly variable, and it is difficult to compare academic studies with the few real applications. There is still a lack of consensus on the sustainability of the end-of-life of Li-ion<index-term id="ITerm25"><term>Li-ion</term></index-term> batteries, both concerning specific energy consumption and environmental impacts (Pellow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Performance Parameters</title><p id="Par47">While it is important to focus on the total costs over the life cycle of a battery, its performance is another relevant aspect for the comparison of different solutions, since it directly affects the available electricity that can be supplied by the battery for a given electricity input. Batteries are usually compared based on their energy capacity, although their nominal charge/discharge rate, the maximum depth of discharge (DoD), and their cycle efficiency<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn6">6</xref> are just as important. An additional aspect is the potential degradation rate of these parameters over time, which can lead to total life-cycle performances lower than the nominal conditions for a new battery. Some aspects are related to the specific technological solution, while others can be adjusted by an accurate choice of design parameters, often based on the specific application that is of interest.</p><p id="Par49">An additional aspect that has an impact on Li-ion<index-term id="ITerm26"><term>Li-ion</term></index-term> batteries performance is the operation temperature, which can affect efficiency, safety, and lifetime. High temperatures accelerate the rate of unwanted chemical reactions that degrade the battery cells, reducing the total lifetime up to 50% for each 10°C of difference with respect to design temperature (IRENA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>). The longest lifetime is usually achieved in the range 20°C–30°C, resulting in the need of cooling systems in hot climates. On the other hand, operation at extremely low temperatures leads to significant power loss, resulting in significant limitations for electric transport systems in some locations.</p><p id="Par50">Therefore, attention should be paid on the discrepancies for actual operational performance in comparison with expected ratings from manufacturers or testing results, especially considering the different cycling hypotheses and their effect on battery degradation.

A similar driver exists at residential level, where households equipped with a PV system try to maximize their self-consumption if they face high electricity prices (IRENA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2019b</xref>).

It is often coupled to distributed generation systems, such as photovoltaics.</p></fn><fn id="Fn2"><label>2</label><p id="Par14">Virtual aggregators are digital platforms that coordinate the operation of multiple systems, including generation units, energy storage<index-term id="ITerm9"><term>Energy storage</term></index-term> systems, and demand response, with the aim of reaching the minimum threshold of power required to participate to wholesale markets (usually higher than 1 MW).</p></fn><fn id="Fn3"><label>3</label><p id="Par16">Arbitrage is the practice of purchasing electricity from the grid when it has a low price and storing it for later use when the price increases. Frequency regulation is a service provided to the grid that ensures that alternate electric current is maintained within the required tolerance bounds by synchronizing the power generators. Peak shaving is the practice of using available storage capacity to limit the maximum power demand during peak hours, to optimize the generation units and avoid excessive variations. Black start is the process of restoring the operation of an electric grid after a partial or total shutdown, while ramping is the operation of increasing or decreasing the output power of a generation unit.</p></fn><fn id="Fn4"><label>4</label><p id="Par17">Voltage support and balance management are flexibility services provided to the distribution grid that allow a proper operation of all the network within the tolerance boundaries. UPS units guarantee that in the case of a network failure the electricity supply is not interrupted, and it is usually required by expensive machineries that may be sensitive to power shortages. Support to self-consumption from PV generation may be required to maximize the local use of electricity to improve the energy efficiency of the system and/or decrease costs for the users.</p></fn><fn id="Fn5"><label>5</label><p id="Par35">The balance of system includes the components that monitor the battery operation to avoid that specific parameters reach values outside the acceptable range, including the calculation and reporting of indicators. The power conversion system includes the components that allow to convert electricity from one form to another, such as from direct current to alternate current, and modifying voltage or frequency. The energy management system includes the software and operational logics that guarantee the interaction between the battery and the power grid, to support the charging and discharging phases and ensure an efficient operation of the energy storage<index-term id="ITerm18"><term>Energy storage</term></index-term> system.</p></fn><fn id="Fn6"><label>6</label><p id="Par48">The discharge rate measures the speed at which a battery is designed to be charged or discharged, giving the information on the average duration of these processes. The maximum DoD is the share of usable amount of energy with respect to the nominal energy capacity of the battery that can be safely used without compromising the battery performance, due to the fact that some battery chemistries need to guarantee a minimum state of charge. The cycle efficiency is usually calculated as the ratio between the energy supplied by the battery during the discharging phase and the energy consumption of the charging phase, and this ratio is lower than 100% due to the energy losses of these processes.</p></fn><fn id="Fn7"><label>7</label><p id="Par51">The operation of the battery in conditions that go beyond the designed values may induce different problems. An excessive charging of the battery and/or excessive electric currents may degrade its chemical components, and due to the volume changes that are associated with charging and discharging processes, additional mechanical stresses can be induced into the materials.</p></fn></fn-group></back></book-part></body></book-part></book-part-wrapper></records><facets><facet name="subject"><facet-value count="1">Economic Policy</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Economics</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Energy Policy, Economics and Management</facet-value><facet-value count="1">International Political Economy</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Natural Resource and Energy Economics</facet-value></facet><facet name="keyword"><facet-value count="1">Batteries</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Economics</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Electricity</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Energy storage</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Li-ion</facet-value></facet><facet name="pub"><facet-value count="1">The Palgrave Handbook of International Energy Economics</facet-value></facet><facet name="year"><facet-value count="1">2022</facet-value></facet><facet name="country"><facet-value count="1">France</facet-value><facet-value count="1">Italy</facet-value></facet><facet name="type"><facet-value count="1">Book</facet-value></facet></facets></response>
