The alveolar model was exposed to 0.05, 0.5 and 5 μg/cm<sup>2</sup> of test compounds at ALI using a state-of-the-art exposure system (Vitrocell™Cloud System). Endpoints related to the oxidative stress induction, anti-oxidant defence mechanisms, pro-inflammatory responses and cellular death were selected to evaluate the biocompatibility of silver particles and nanowires (AgNMs) and to further ascribe particular biological effects to the different morphologic properties between the three types of AgNMs evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">Significant cytotoxic effect was observed for all three types of AgNMs at the highest tested doses. The increased mRNA levels of the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>CASP7</italic> suggests that apoptosis may occur after exposure to AgNWs. All three types of AgNMs increased the mRNA level of the anti-oxidant enzyme <italic>HMOX-1</italic> and of the metal-binding anti-oxidant <italic>metallothioneins</italic> (<italic>MTs</italic>), with AgNWs being the most potent inducer. Even though all types of AgNMs induced the nuclear translocation of NF-kB, only AgNWs increased the mRNA level of pro-inflammatory mediators. The pro-inflammatory response elicited by AgNWs was further confirmed by the increased secretion of the 10 evaluated interleukins.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">In the current study, we demonstrated that the direct exposure of a complex tetra-culture alveolar model to different types of AgNMs at ALI induces shape- and size-specific biological responses. From the three AgNMs tested, AgNWs were the most potent in inducing biological alterations. Starting from 50 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>, a dose representative for an acute exposure in a high exposure occupational setting, AgNWs induced prominent changes indicative for a pro-inflammatory response. Even though the acute responses towards a dose representative for a full-lifetime exposure were also evaluated, chronic exposure scenarios at low dose are still unquestionably needed to reveal the human health impact of AgNMs during realistic conditions.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Air-liquid interface</kwd><kwd>Tetra-culture</kwd><kwd>Silver nanoparticles</kwd><kwd>Silver nanowires</kwd><kwd>Inflammation;</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>BioMed Central</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/12989_2019_Article_297.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedicine</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Pharmacology/Toxicology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Pneumology/Respiratory System</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Public Health</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Health</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedical and Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (<ext-link xlink:href="10.1186/s12989-019-0297-1" ext-link-type="doi">https://doi.org/10.1186/s12989-019-0297-1</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par4">The rapid advancements in the field of nanotechnology produced a vast number of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) with unique physical and chemical properties. Exhibiting a broad utility and versatility, ENMs are currently incorporated in a large number of consumer products, offering also unique advantages as diagnostic and therapeutic tools in the emerging field of nanomedicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Silver nanomaterials (AgNMs) are one of the most widely used ENMs, with more than 300 commercially available products in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], due to their antimicrobial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Silver nanowires (AgNWs) are incorporated in flexible thin films with high conductivity, and further used in the production of liquid crystal displays, touch screens and solar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">Respiratory exposure is of primary concern due to release of AgNMs to the ambient air during manufacturing processes and the use of consumer products. Inhaled ENMs are efficiently deposited given the high intake of air (&gt; 20 m<sup>3</sup>/day) and the large surface area (75–150 m<sup>2</sup>) of the respiratory tract. The alveolar barrier is of main concern due to the deposition of small particles and the susceptibility of the gas exchange membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Despite the pulmonary retention and systemic distribution of spherical AgNMs, the majority of in vivo studies reported no or only mild effects involving chronic pulmonary inflammation and abnormalities in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In contrast, pronounced effects including cytotoxicity, pro-inflammatory responses and genotoxicity were reported using various epithelial and immune cell types in in vitro studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. These differences between in vivo and in vitro data are most likely due to the unrealistic exposure scenarios and concentrations used. Submerged exposure of alveolar cells has several intrinsic limitations, as it disregards the basic structure of the respiratory system and the physical laws behind respiratory exposure. Moreover, by suspending ENMs in cell culture media, important changes in their physicochemical properties including surface reactivity and agglomeration state occur influencing the exposure concentrations and outcome of the experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. An improved in vitro technique which encompasses the above-mentioned limitations is represented by air-liquid interface (ALI) exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This allows a direct exposure to ENMs, closely mimicking realistic inhalation conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It is generally accepted that the use of ALI exposure in respiratory toxicology is more suitable in the assessment of ENMs toxicity, and together with other improved in vitro approaches may hold the promise to bridge the current gaps between in vitro and in vivo data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The aim of the present study was to assess and compare the toxicological effects of two types of spherical silver particles with sizes of 20 and 200 nm (Ag20 and Ag200, respectively) and of AgNWs with a diameter of 50 nm and a length up to 50 μm, using a 3D tetra-culture model representative for the alveolar barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The model was exposed to 0.05, 0.5 and 5 μg/cm<sup>2</sup> of AgNMs at the ALI using a state-of-the-art exposure system (Vitrocell™Cloud System). Specific endpoints related to the oxidative stress induction, anti-oxidant defence mechanisms, pro-inflammatory responses and cellular death were evaluated at different time points.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characterization of ENMs in liquid suspension</title><p id="Par8">Based on the rationale that spraying a homogenous suspension is a prerequisite for a homogenous exposure, the first step was the characterization of the AgNMs in liquid suspension. Preparation of the AgNMs dispersions according to a published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] resulted in a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 232 ± 125 nm, 362 ± 56 nm and 262 ± 160 nm for Ag20, Ag200 and AgNWs. The measured Zeta potentials for Ag20, Ag200 and AgNWs were − 40.5 ± 4.8, − 32.2 ± 4.6 and − 24.6 ± 8.2 mV, respectively. The values obtained for AgNWs served to calculate the necessary energy input to obtain a stable suspension and are not an accurate measurement of the hydrodynamic diameter, as the Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) method is based on the assumption of a spherical shape [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The stability of AgNMs suspension was not verified at later time points, as suspensions were prepared freshly before each exposure. According to BET measurement, the specific surface area of the Ag20 and Ag200 were 2.52 ± 0.05 and 1.18 ± 0.01 m<sup>2</sup>/g, while the specific surface area for the AgNWs was not measured due to specificities of these AgNWs.</p><p id="Par9">Based on the Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis, we observed that the sonication process had a minor impact on the release of Ag<sup>+</sup> from all AgNMs tested, with Ag<sup>+</sup> representing less than 0.2% from total silver species immediately after the sonication process. The stability of the AgNMs suspensions was maintained at the same Ag<sup>+</sup> level over 24 h. Furthermore, incubation with the pulmonary surfactant did not increase the release of Ag<sup>+</sup> for either of all AgNMs tested.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Characterization of the deposited ENMs</title><p id="Par10">The deposition uniformity was evaluated by two visualization techniques. Using the high-resolution dark-field microscopy technique (CytoViva®), a circular-like deposition pattern rather than a homogenous particle distribution was observed with the majority of AgNMs distributed on the exterior of the circle (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This pattern is in accordance with the droplet size distribution generated by the nebulizer, and may be due to the drying of highly concentrated droplets onto the glass substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. We believe that this artefact is not present when the cellular model is exposed to the AgNMs due to the presence of the liquid lining. The shape and the analytical composition of the particles were investigated by Helium Ion Microscopy (ZEISS, Peabody, USA) (HIM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], coupled with a Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (SIMS) developed by LIST, Luxembourg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The sprayed AgNWs maintained their needle-like shape after the sonication and nebulisation processes, with the same ratio between length and diameter being observed as for pristine AgNWs (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Figure S1). Smaller fragments with more symmetric morphology were also observed (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>High resolution dark-field microscopy images (CytoViva®) of Ag20 (<bold>a</bold>, <bold>d</bold>), Ag200 (<bold>b</bold>, <bold>e</bold>) and AgNWs (<bold>c</bold>, <bold>f</bold>) after sonication and nebulisation on coverslips using the Vitrocell™Cloud System.

The dissolution of Ag<sup>+</sup> from the AgNMs due to the sonication process and the further incubation for 24 h was evaluated in order to exclude Ag<sup>+</sup> as a confounding variable. The sonication procedure with or without subsequent 24 h incubation, did not impact the dissolution rate for any material, with Ag<sup>+</sup> representing less than &lt; 0.2% of total Ag. Incubation with Poractant alfa, a surrogate of human lung surfactant in premature babies, had no effect on the dissolution kinetics of AgNMs. These results are in accordance with recent studies that investigated the influence of pulmonary surfactant and of other lung lining fluid components on the dissolution of AgNWs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and AgNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].

The sprayed AgNWs maintained their needle-like shape after aerosolization.</p><p id="Par31">The calculated deposition efficiencies after nebulisation were dependent on the concentration and the type of AgNMs sprayed. AgNWs displayed the lowest deposition efficiency, most probably due to their anisotropic shape, which may have interfered with the passage through the pores present in the membrane of the Aeroneb Pro® nebulizer. Deposition efficiencies for the AgNMs were lower than what was reported for solutions of substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], but in agreement with deposition efficiencies reported for other nanomaterials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] using the Vitrocell™Cloud System or a similar exposure device (ALICE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].

The assay was performed on both the apical and endothelial side and more pronounced effects were found on the apical side. The generation of ROS, with the subsequent initiation of a pro-inflammatory response, is currently believed to be the mechanism of toxicity for many ENMs, including AgNMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">A total number of 20 genes encoding proteins with anti-oxidant, pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic function were selected in order to have a broad overview of the elicited biological responses, and to further discriminate between the AgNM specific responses. All three AgNMs increased the mRNA level of the anti-oxidant <italic>HMOX-1</italic> in the apical compartment at 6 h post-exposure, with the highest fold increase being observed for AgNWs. This up-regulation returned to basal levels for Ag20 and Ag200, while for AgNWs it remained at similar levels at 24 h post-exposure. Moreover, exposure to AgNWs increased the mRNA level of <italic>HMOX-1</italic> in the endothelial cells located on the basolateral side. HMOX-1 is an enzyme with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant function which catalyses the degradation of the pro-inflammatory free haeme, as well as the generation of anti-inflammatory compounds, such as bilirubin and carbon monoxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Moreover, the Nrf2/HMOX-1 axis has been shown to inhibit the NF-kB pathway and to reduce endothelial activation and dysfunction by decreasing the expression of pro-inflammatory adhesion molecules on the surface of endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The induction of anti-oxidant defence mechanisms after exposure to AgNWs was supported by the increased mRNA levels of the three metallothioneins (MTs) studied. MTs are small, cysteine-rich metal-binding proteins, which act as protective stress response elements by preserving homeostasis during exposure to heavy metals or oxidative stress insults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Similar results were reported using various cell lines, including the respiratory cell line BEAS-2B, suggesting the universality of this defence mechanism after exposure to AgNMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Regarding the level of <italic>CASP7</italic>, a gene encoding an effector in the caspase cascade, only exposure to AgNWs had a statistically significant effect.</p><p id="Par35">All AgNMs induced the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-kB in endothelial cells. For AgNWs the nuclear translocation was visible starting from the intermediate dose while for the Ag20 and Ag200 it was visible only at the highest tested dose of 5 μg/cm<sup>2</sup>. The nuclear translocation of NF-kB is an early event in the pro-inflammatory cascade by initiating the gene expression of multiple pro-inflammatory mediators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Sustained nuclear translocation of NF-kB is an important hallmark in pathophysiological respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Even though all AgNMs induced the nuclear translocation of NF-kB at the highest tested dose, major differences in the mRNA level of genes encoding pro-inflammatory messengers were observed between AgNMs. Exposure to AgNWs induced an early increase in the mRNA level of adhesion molecules in both compartments, which returned to normal levels at 24 h post-exposure. Over-expression of adhesion molecules plays an important role in the perpetuation of chronic inflammatory processes in diseases such as atherosclerosis and asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The pro-inflammatory nature of AgNWs was further confirmed by the increased levels of the genes encoding the pro-inflammatory <italic>IL-6</italic> and <italic>IL-8</italic>. A dose- and time-dependent increase in the mRNA level of <italic>IL-6</italic> and <italic>IL-8</italic> was observed for AgNWs, while for Ag20 only the highest dose induced a significantly increased level of <italic>IL-6</italic> in the basolateral compartment at 6 h post-exposure. As the increased transcription or decreased degradation of pro-inflammatory genes does not necessarily translate into an actual pro-inflammatory response, the quantification of a battery of ten interleukins in cellular media from the basolateral compartment was performed (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Exposure to AgNWs induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in the secretion of all interleukins evaluated. A strong response was observed at 6 h post-exposure increasing the secretion of 6 out of 10 interleukins (IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-8), starting from the lowest dose applied. The secretion of the other interleukins at 6 h post-exposure was statistically significant increased starting from the intermediate dose of 0.5 μg/cm<sup>2</sup>. At 24 h post-exposure, the biological influence of 0.05 μg/cm<sup>2</sup> AgNWs was not different from the negative control, except for IL-1β, which was significantly decreased. Moreover, for the majority of interleukins evaluated, at the lowest tested dose of AgNWs, higher absolute concentration values were observed at 6 h post-exposure than at 24 h post-exposure, suggesting the existence of a transient acute response after AgNWs exposure. Conversely, at 5 μg/cm<sup>2</sup> higher concentrations for each interleukin were observed at 24 h post-exposure. The ability of AgNWs to induce the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-8 and IL-1β was previously reported, albeit under submerged exposure and at least one order of magnitude higher doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">Co-cultures of epithelial cells with immune cells have been shown to have an increased relevance in the evaluation of inhalable chemicals as they better preserve the inflammatory potential observed in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The bidirectional communication between epithelial and immune cells established by the direct cell contact or by soluble mediators is considered to be the main reason behind this increased relevance in the evaluation of the pro-inflammatory potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. In the current study, the THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophage-like cells by PMA treatment for 2 days with a subsequent 4 days of rest in medium without PMA. Based on the current literature and our experience, rested macrophages can respond better to stimuli then un-rested macrophages which are over-stimulated after the treatment with the differentiation factors and can no longer respond to other stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Moreover, the basal inflammatory state of the tetra-culture by using rested macrophages was lower than in the previously described model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The secretion of IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13, three interleukins which are mainly representative for an anti-inflammatory or regulatory response, increased in the same manner as the other interleukins with a pro-inflammatory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. This auto-regulatory nature of the inflammatory process is further supported by the detailed gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators observed. The early increase in the mRNA level of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules at 6 h post-exposure was followed at 24 h by a return to basal level. In normal circumstances, different subpopulations of macrophages with a pro-inflammatory (M1 subtype) or an anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2 subtype) are present at the alveolar level, and neither the M1 or M2 subtype is fully representative for the entire population of healthy macrophages in native tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Moreover, these different macrophage phenotypes are present in the lung tissue during the initiation and resolution of the inflammatory processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The increased secretion of both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in the current study highlights the capacity of the described in vitro model to reflect the intricate biological responses orchestrated by native respiratory epithelia.</p><p id="Par37">Taking into account the overall results obtained, shape specific effects were observed, with AgNWs displaying the highest pro-inflammatory potential, while inducing the biological anti-oxidant defence mechanisms. In vivo and in vitro studies found that long fibres are more pathogenic than short ones, with a threshold for the induction of the pro-inflammatory responses of up to 15 μm in in vivo studies, and 5 μm in in vitro studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. High aspect ratio nanoparticles, including AgNWs have been shown to induce frustrated phagocytosis, due to the inability of macrophages to engulf and further digest long fibres, this process being associated with a release of pro-inflammatory molecules which can cause extensive damage in the surrounding tissues and cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Even though we cannot attribute the higher pro-inflammatory potential of AgNWs to frustrated phagocytosis as the AgNWs sprayed were less than 5 μm in length, based on the results obtained in the dissolution experiments, the pro-inflammatory nature of AgNWs is due to their specific shape and not to the extra-cellular dissolution of Ag<sup>+</sup>. The increased intracellular dissolution of AgNWs due to their higher internalization or physical penetration is a possible explanation for the more pronounced effects of AgNWs. The above-mentioned hypothesis is supported by a recent study describing the ability of AgNWs to enter the cells through a “needle-like” insertion mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>].

The ultra-filtrates were further diluted in 1% HNO<sub>3</sub> and the soluble silver species were evaluated by ICP-MS (Elan DRC-e, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA, USA).</p><p id="Par43">In addition to the sonication process, which was proposed to have a significant impact on the dissolution of AgNMs, the influence of alveolar surfactant on the leaching of Ag<sup>+</sup> from the AgNMs was evaluated. Poractant alfa, a natural pulmonary surfactant isolated from porcine lungs, with properties similar to human pulmonary surfactant was kindly donated by Chiesi Farmaceutici (Parma, Italy). AgNMs were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with Poractant alfa diluted 1:100 in ddH<sub>2</sub>O in order to simulate the interaction between the surfactant produced by the alveolar model and the sprayed AgNMs. Soluble silver species were further quantified as previously described.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Exposures at air-liquid interface to aerosols of AgNMs</title><p id="Par44">The commercial available Vitrocell™Cloud System (Vitrocell™, Waldkirch, Germany) was used to mimic the inhalation exposure to AgNMs. The system is equipped with an Aeroneb Pro® vibrating membrane nebulizer, which generates a dense cloud of droplets with a median aerodynamic diameter of 4.0–6.0 μm that are deposited at the bottom of the exposure chamber. Cells exposed to the vehicle (PBS and ddH<sub>2</sub>O 1:1000) served as negative controls.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Characterization of the deposited AgNMs</title><p id="Par45">A total volume of 200 μL of Ag20, Ag200 and AgNWs suspensions at concentrations of 50, 500 and 5000 μg/mL were sprayed to measure the deposition in terms of efficiency and uniformity. The above-mentioned concentrations were selected based on a 50% deposition yield reported for a similar exposure device (ALICE system), in order to obtain a theoretical deposited dose of 0.05, 0.5 and 5 μg/cm<sup>2</sup>. The deposition efficiencies and the uniformity of depositions were assessed during three independent exposures for each AgNM tested. In each exposure run, 5 surrogate inserts filled with 1 mL of ddH<sub>2</sub>O were exposed to the AgNM aerosols, and the total content of the inserts was retrieved in metal-free tubes for further analysis. The quantification of the deposited mass per cm<sup>2</sup> was further done by measuring total silver species with ICP-MS.</p><p id="Par46">The uniformity of the deposition was further evaluated by Helium Ion Microscopy (HIM), Secondary Ion Mass spectrometry (SIMS) and Enhanced Darkfield Microscopy (CytoViva®). HIM consists in scanning the sample with a finely focussed He<sup>+</sup> ion beam of sub-nm resolution and detecting secondary electrons to generate images. In contrast to conventional Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) using an electron beam to scan the sample, HIM provides better contrast details due to smaller beam-sample interaction volumes, better depth of field and the possibility to image insulating samples without prior deposition of a conductive film. In addition, the HIM used for this study was equipped with a SIMS system developed by LIST. The integrated HIM-SIMS instrument hence allows acquiring both high-resolution structural information and elemental/chemical information from the same field of view [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The secondary electron images were obtained with a helium beam at a beam energy of 20 keV and a beam intensity of 0.5 pA. The SIMS images were acquired with a neon beam at beam energy of 20 keV and beam intensity of 2 pA.</p><p id="Par47">Suspensions of AgNMs were sprayed using the Vitrocell™Cloud System on glass coverslips for the high-resolution dark field microscopy, while for HIM-SIMS analysis silicon wafers were used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Cytotoxicity and metabolic impairment</title><p id="Par48">Alamar Blue (AB) and Lactate Dehydrogenase Assays (LDH) were used to assess a possible cytotoxic effect at 6 h and 24 h post-exposure. For AB assay, AgNMs exposed inserts were washed with PBS and further incubated with 250 μL of medium containing 400 μM resazurin for 1 h at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The assay was performed on both apical and basolateral sides. Aliquots of 100 μL were taken from both compartments and transferred into a 96 well plate to measure the fluorescence intensity.
