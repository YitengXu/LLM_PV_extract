The optical properties of AgNPs tuned by size considerably influence the performance levels of devices. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) was increased from 6.4% to 7.6% in poly[N-9-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4,7-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT):[6,6]-phenyl C<sub>71</sub>-butyric acid methyl ester (PC<sub>70</sub>BM) based-OPVs and from 7.9% to 8.6% in polythieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7):PC<sub>70</sub>BM based-OPVs upon embedding the AgNPs. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was significantly enhanced by the absorption enhancement due to the plasmonic scattering effect.

Recently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic bulk heterojunction solar cells was reported to surpass 8 ~ 9%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, the relatively low PCE of OPV cells compared with inorganic photovoltaic cells needs to be enhanced even more before these cells are commercially viable. Due to the low carrier mobility of the organic materials, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) tends to decrease as the thickness of the active layer increases. For active layers with a thickness of ~ 100 nm in a bulk heterojunction system, it is difficult to absorb all of the incident photons. Owing to this ultrathin film thickness, the low light absorption tends to act as a bottleneck, preventing high efficiency in organic solar cells. Many researchers have tried to develop new polymer materials that have broad absorption spectra<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, high carrier mobility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> and an appropriate optical band gap<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> to achieve high PCE but the issue of insufficient absorption has yet to be completely overcome by conventional OPV cell structures. The use of optical engineering to enhance light absorption is inevitable in OPVs due to the trade-off relationship between the absorption capabilities and the IQE. Various approaches, including tandem structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, surface texturing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, metal nanogratings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, resonance cavity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and ray-optical light trapping systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> have been suggested to increase the optical absorption. Among these approaches, recently there has been growing interest in the use of metal nanoparticles (MNPs) in OPVs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> because the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of MNPs has the potential to boost the absorption of the active layer. In addition, the easy tunability of the optical properties by modifying size<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, shape<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and surrounding materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> of MNPs has shown high potential as an optical engineering tool in thin-film optoelectronic devices. Many research groups have reported PCE enhancements by employing MNPs in what have been termed <italic>plasmonic</italic> OPVs. In addition, there have been many theories of the mechanism of PCE enhancement, such as the enhanced carrier effect and the exciton lifetime<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, conductivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and the surface morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> as modified by incorporating MNPs. However, the exact roles of the LSPR effect in the OPVs are not well understood.</p><p>The LSPR effect of MNPs occurs by interaction between oscillating free electrons in the MNPs and incident light. The LSPR of MNPs have the MNPs not only scatter anisotropically, but also absorb the incident light. To investigate the scattering and absorption efficiency, simulations of an isolated AgNP in PEDOT:PSS were performed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(a)</xref> shows the ratio of the scattering to the absorption power integrated from 300 to 800 nm for nanoparticles of different sizes (red line). For PV applications, ideally, the ratio should be close to 1 because the power absorbed by the AgNP is dissipated as Joule heating. Although the absorption power of a small AgNP (&lt;40 nm) dominates the scattering power, with a further increase in the size, the scattering power becomes stronger than the absorption power. Hence, it can be concluded that large MNPs (&gt;40 nm) may be beneficial from an optical point of view. However, few demonstrations have been reported on the performance-dependence of PVs on the size of embedded MNPs in the devices.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of a plasmonic OPV and optical simulation results.</p><p>(a) The analytical optical simulations were performed based on a previous report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

Anodic buffer layer consisting of PEDOT:PSS was doped with AgNPs of various sizes to induce forward scattering efficiently. The doping volume of the AgNP suspension was fixed at 40 vol% in order to maintain the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS at approximately 30 nm. The AgNP suspension was dispersed in deionized water so that it would be mixed well with the PEDOT:PSS solution. In this report, we fabricated two types of OPVs using poly[N-9-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4,7-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT) and polythieno[3,4-b]thiophene/benzodithiophene (PTB7) as photoactive donors and [6,6]-phenyl C<sub>71</sub>-butyric acid methyl ester (PC<sub>70</sub>BM) as an acceptor. The control device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Polymer:PC<sub>70</sub>BM/TiOx/Al. Our PCDTBT- and PTB7-based control devices have consistently shown PCEs of approximately 6.4% and 7.9%, respectively. It has been reported that PCDTBT:PC<sub>70</sub>BM-based OPVs show as high PCE as 6%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> or more with relatively low absorption and high IQE values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Therefore, appropriate optical engineering that can offset the low optical absorption without disturbing the high IQE will effectively improve the PCE.</p><p><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1(c)–(f)</xref> show transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of mono-dispersed AgNPs whose diameters range from 10 to 100 nm.

The PCE was substantially improved from 6.4% to 7.6%, resulting mainly from the significant short circuit current (<italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub>) enhancement of approximately 13%, from 11.22 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> to 12.67 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The fill factor (<italic>FF</italic>) was slightly improved and the open circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub>) was mostly unchanged, suggesting that the PCE enhancement resulted fundamentally from optical engineering via the incorporated AgNPs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(b)</xref> compares the EQE, absorption and IQE of the best plasmonic OPV with those of a control OPV. The EQE and absorption were primarily enhanced at the wavelengths of 400 ~ 500 nm, precisely coinciding with the location of the LSPR of the AgNP-67, as revealed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S2</xref>. Note that the relatively low absorption by the active materials in this region magnified the absorption enhancement effectively.

The complete statistical data of the devices performance are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Table S2</xref>. For each AgNP size, the AgNPs were doped at optimal concentrations to yield the maximum PCE. The maximum enhancement was gradually increased as the size of AgNPs was increased to 67 nm.

However, for AgNPs larger than 67 nm, the maximum enhancement declined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Origin of AgNPs size effect</title><p>To investigate the origin of the size-dependent plasmonic effect on the PCE, the spectral responses of the OPVs were measured according to the size of AgNPs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(d)</xref> illustrates that the external quantum efficiency (EQE) was primarily enhanced at wavelengths between 400 and 500 nm at all sizes and that the EQE enhancement peaked to 35% near the LSPR when AgNP-67 was embedded. However, when larger AgNPs (i.e., AgNP-94) were embedded in the OPVs, the EQE enhancement near the LSPR was reduced. In order to determine the influence of the AgNPs in more detail, we measured the spectral reflectance, R(λ), of the devices within an integrating sphere equipped with a photodetector; the total absorption of the entire device was estimated by 1−R(λ). The measurements of both the EQE and the reflectance were performed simultaneously at the same spots with the same sample so as to obtain the most reliable results. Refer to the Methods for more details. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(e)</xref> illustrates the pattern of the absorption enhancement, which resembles that of the EQE, revealing that optical modulation by the AgNPs had a strong impact on the electrical performance of the OPVs. The partial reduction of EQE and absorption at the wavelength of from 500 ~550 nm is caused by the increased optical loss due to the reflection and relatively high absorption of the active materials. Reduction of the absorption at AgNP-94 resulted from the increased back reflection as compared to AgNP-67. However, it does not contradict our prediction that the stronger scattering by the larger AgNPs can effectively improve the PCE, as implied in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(a)</xref>; the total scattering was indeed enhanced, but the back scattering power dominated the forward fraction with an increase in the size of the AgNPs, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3</xref>. We calculated the IQE of the OPVs by dividing the EQE by the measured absorption, as depicted in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(b)</xref>. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(f)</xref> illustrates the IQE enhancement. It should also be noted that our estimated IQE actually provides the <italic>minimum</italic> IQE of the OPVs because the estimated absorption consisted of the absorption by not only the active layer but also the MNPs and the electrodes. The IQE values were not greatly affected by the AgNPs at all sizes, except for AgNP-94, in which the IQE value near 400~450 nm showed a slight decrease, conceivably due to the absorption by the MNPs themselves. The unaffected IQE result strongly supports the fact that the enhanced <italic>J</italic><sub>sc</sub> resulted from the absorption enhancement from the plasmonic scattering by the AgNPs.</p><p>In fact, not only the scattering power but also the scattering direction must be considered, as the backward scattered power does not contribute to the absorption enhancement of the proposed OPVs. We calculated the amount of the forward scattering ratio to the total scattering power using optical simulations while assuming PEDOT:PSS as a medium and an incident wavelength of 430 nm, where the maximum EQE and absorption enhancement occurred, as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figs. 2(d) and (e)</xref>. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(a)</xref> (blue line) plots the result along with the size of the AgNPs; the forward scattering fraction is increased with an increase in size of the AgNP and is optimized at approximately 75 nm. Backward scattering grows stronger when the size of the AgNPs is greater than 75 nm while the total scattering power is still enhanced. The angular scattering power distributions of AgNPs at various sizes are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3</xref>.

It is important to note that the scattering enhancement of 142% in the AgNP-67 case was significantly larger than the topographical RMS enhancement of ~40%, implying that the enhanced scattering resulted predominantly from the intrinsic scattering power by the AgNPs themselves, as explained above, rather than from the geometrical scattering effect caused by the rough surface.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Dependence of photovoltaic performance on AgNPs concentration</title><p>Next, we investigated the performance dependence of the plasmonic OPVs on the AgNP concentration, which needs to be chosen appropriately for the optimization of the devices. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(a)</xref> shows the performances enhancement of the OPVs with AgNP-67 embedded at various doping concentrations.

In addition, the absorption enhancement follows the EQE tendency, as shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(c)</xref>. The IQE enhancement is nearly constant at all wavelengths, except for the “high” concentration, as shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(d)</xref>, providing further verification that the EQE is enhanced by the optical absorption enhancement. Note that with the increase in the density, the peak position is blue-shifted due to the increased dipolar coupling between the MNPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, as indicated in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4(b) and (c)</xref>. However, when the concentration of the AgNPs was higher than the optimum concentration, the EQE was degraded throughout nearly all of the wavelength range, especially at a longer wavelength, while the absorption enhancement was virtually identical to that at the optimal concentration, as shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4(b) and (c)</xref>. As a result, the IQE was largely reduced in all wavelength ranges. Large clusters of AgNPs were formed during the deposition of PEDOT:PSS at a high concentration of AgNPs. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(c)</xref> reveals that the peak position was not shifted at a “high” concentration, thereby showing that the inter-particle distance was not reduced further by the increased density of the AgNPs from the “optimum” concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Figure S8(a)</xref> reveals that the AgNPs were well dispersed at the optimal concentration.

At a “high” doping concentration of 9.0 × 10<sup>9</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>, the actual total number density of approx. 5.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup>, including large clusters, was slightly higher than the optimized concentration of approx. 4.5 × 10<sup>9</sup>/cm<sup>2</sup> due to aggregation despite the fact that the doping concentration had doubled.

The inset of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S8(b)</xref> shows a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of aggregated Ag clusters in a PEDOT:PSS layer.

The <italic>V</italic><sub>oc</sub> value was not affected in the “low” to “optimum” concentration range, but it showed a slight decrease at a higher concentration.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by a spectral measurement system (K3100 IQX, McScience Inc.). The light source (a xenon arc lamp at 300 W) was used with a monochromator (Newport) and an optical chopper (MC 2000 Thorlabs). The spectral absorption by the devices was directly measured at the system immediately after the measurement of the EQE. The measurement setup for the absorption measurement was as follows: the incident monochromic light is absorbed in the device area through an integration sphere. The device is tilted at about 8° because the reflected light must be scattered inside the integration sphere. Therefore, the reflected light is scattered in the integration sphere and collected by a photodetector located in the integration sphere. The device absorption was calculated by 1−R(λ), where R(λ) denotes the wavelength-dependent reflectance data. Finally, the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was determined by dividing the EQE by the absorption. The extinction spectra were measured by UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometers (UV-3600, Shimadzu).
