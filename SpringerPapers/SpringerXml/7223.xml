In this regard, 2D siloxene nanosheets, have escaped thorough exploration, despite being composed of earth-abundant elements. Herein we demonstrate the remarkable catalytic activity, selectivity, and stability of a nickel@siloxene nanocomposite; it is found that this promising catalytic performance is highly sensitive to the location of the nickel component, being on either the interior or the exterior of adjacent siloxene nanosheets. Control over the location of nickel is achieved by employing the terminal groups of siloxene and varying the solvent used during its nucleation and growth, which ultimately determines the distinct reaction intermediates and pathways for the catalytic CO<sub>2</sub> methanation. Significantly, a CO<sub>2</sub> methanation rate of 100âmmolâg<sub>Ni</sub><sup>â1</sup>âh<sup>â1</sup> is achieved with over 90% selectivity when nickel resides specifically between the sheets of siloxene.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">There is a strong push to develop new catalysts and supports to convert low-value CO<sub>2</sub> into high-value CH<sub>4</sub>.

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is a well-known greenhouse gas that can also be used as a zero- or even negative-cost carbon feedstock in the production of valuable chemicals and fuels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. This technology can be employed in the power-to-gas process, which consists of an initial hydrogen production step via electrolysis of water, followed by the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> via the Sabatier reaction (i.e., methanation). This process of converting CO<sub>2</sub> into methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) is among the most attractive and promising technologies for transforming electrical energy into renewable chemical energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In doing so, it is possible to circumvent the considerable difficulties associated with hydrogen storage, transport, and large-scale utilization. In addition, CH<sub>4</sub> offers several benefits over hydrogen, as it is easily liquefied, can be more safely stored and transported, and is widely used in energy-intensive applications as a major component of natural gas.</p><p id="Par4">For the catalysis of the CO<sub>2</sub> methanation reaction, earth-abundant and relatively low-cost Ni metal is an ideal candidate, which has led to its use being intensively explored. As the methanation reaction is highly exothermic, great effort has been devoted to anchoring or immobilizing Ni nanoparticles onto support materials in attempts to alleviate high-temperature sintering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Because of such efforts, spatial confinement has emerged as an effective and unique way to limit the growth of Ni nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Chen et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> pointed out that a âcageâ of mesoporous SBA-16 could confine small Ni nanoparticles, thereby contributing to their high activity in the reverse waterâgas shift reaction (i.e., hydrogenation of CO<sub>2</sub> to CO). However, the design and fabrication of Ni catalysts with high selectivity toward CH<sub>4</sub> production, rather than the competing reverse waterâgas shift reaction, remains a major challenge. In addition, the reaction mechanism for Ni catalysts is still largely ambiguous, both under laboratory conditions and in industrial applications.</p><p id="Par6">Only recently have theoretical and modeling studies begun to show some evidence regarding the CO<sub>2</sub> methanation mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Heine et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> used ambient-pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to probe the reaction pathways for CO<sub>2</sub> methanation on a Ni (111) surface. In this system, CO<sub>2</sub> first dissociated to CO and atomic oxygen at the Ni surface, whereupon CO then decomposed to atomic carbon (*C) before finally being converted to CH<sub>4</sub> via hydrogenation. This reaction pathway inevitably yields significant quantities of CO and may lead to catalyst poisoning via carbonization (coking) of the catalyst surface.</p><p id="Par7">In this context, a superior Ni catalyst must have high activity and selectivity toward CH<sub>4</sub> production, as well as good stability under operating conditions. A unique pathway for sustainable CH<sub>4</sub> production must therefore be achieved by designing the chemistry and structure of not only Ni itself but, more importantly, the supporting materials used to accomplish the desired surface engineering and spatial confinement.</p><p id="Par8">Silicon, being the second most earth-abundant element, is clearly deserving of investigation for such use. Aside from mesoporous silica, which could supply the aforementioned two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) confinement effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and some reports on metal on porous Si<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, the most widely used form of Si for supporting catalysts is SiO<sub>2</sub> particles, without further chemical or structural design. SiO<sub>2</sub>-supported Ni catalysts have relatively low selectivity toward CH<sub>4</sub> production (lower than 80%) with the remaining ca. 20% selectivity being toward CO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In this regard, various promoters were added to improve the CH<sub>4</sub> production selectivity of the Ni/SiO<sub>2</sub> catalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In addition, production selectivity could be switched from CO to CH<sub>4</sub> on Ni/SiO<sub>2</sub> catalysts by increasing the Ni loading from 0.5 wt% to a much higher value of 10 wt%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, it is still a challenge to design silicon-supported Ni catalysts with a distinctive structure and superior selectivity for CO<sub>2</sub> methanation. In an era where 2D catalyst materials are both in great demand and showing significant promise scientifically and technologically, 2D silicon nanosheet materials have historically been overlooked. Only a few reports for its use in catalysis can be found, exemplifying its use in water splitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, ethylene polymerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, formic acid decomposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, 4-nitrophenol reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, and butene isomerization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In this report, we employ 2D silicon surface chemistry to design catalysts consisting of Ni on siloxene nanosheets (SiXNS), in order to address the challenges posed by CO<sub>2</sub> methanation. Hydride- and hydroxyl-terminated layered silicon was chosen as the starting material for designing and constructing the uniquely supported Ni nanostructures used in this study. It is shown herein that SiâH hydrolysis can be triggered or avoided during synthesis by using a water- or ethanol-based Ni<sup>2+</sup> precursor solution, respectively. This strategic choice also determines whether Ni nanoparticles are obtained on the interior or exterior of the SiXNS. The Ni nanoparticles confined inside the SiXNS exhibit improved catalytic activity and selectivity to CH<sub>4</sub> relative to those on the surface of SiXNS, and this catalytic performance can be further improved under photothermal reaction conditions. With evidence from in-situ infrared studies, two distinct pathways for CO<sub>2</sub> methanation are observed for these two classes of materials, providing the insight and designing strategy for composite catalysts and materials with structural confinement effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials design and fabrication process</title><p id="Par9">SiXNS were exfoliated from bulk calcium silicide at 0âÂ°C using concentrated HCl<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. The composition and structure of such exfoliated 2D nanosheets have been studied for decades.

When actually synthesized in the lab, a mixture of the above mentioned structures with the general formula of Si<sub>6</sub>O<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>(OH)<sub><italic>y</italic></sub>H<sub>6-<italic>y</italic></sub> is observed, in which Si is terminated by âH and âOH functional groups, with SiâOâSi bridges also existing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Such configurations allow for dispersion in common polar solvents, such as water and ethanol, facilitating the next step of nanocomposite formation using the soluble Ni salt. A dispersion of the fresh SiXNS was mixed and sonicated with a nickel nitrate solution, dried by heating under vacuum, and then calcined under air at 400âÂ°C for 3âh. This procedure resembles the widely used impregnation method for producing conventional supported metal catalysts; however, it was found that the choice of solvent (i.e., water or ethanol), resulted in different structures in the product material. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> illustrates the philosophy of the design strategy: the circle of Taiji represents the unity of beginning from the same precursor, whereas the separated black and white halves symbolize the difference of the final products. When using water as the solvent, both the hydrolysis of the SiâH perpendicular to the plane to form SiâOH and the condensation of SiâOH into SiâOâSi will proceed during the impregnation process, as was also observed by Weiss et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> (the pioneer of the siloxene material) and, more recently, by Xie et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. This hydrolysis by water appears to inhibit the infiltration and deposition of nickel nitrate between the siloxene sheets. In contrast, ethanol preserves more SiâH and results in less condensation of SiâOH. These mechanisms are evidenced by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) of samples prepared using either water or ethanol. The spectrum of the SiXNS impregnated in ethanol resembles that of the original pristine SiXNS, with the extra peaks at around 1350âcm<sup>â1</sup> assigned to nitrate ions. In contrast, the sample impregnated in water exhibits significantly increased SiâOâSi peaks due to condensation of SiâOH, a weak mode at around 2100âcm<sup>â1</sup> for SiâH, and distinctive SiâOH modes between 3250 and 3500âcm<sup>â1</sup>, due to more extensive hydrolysis of SiâH. As a result, following the decomposition of nickel nitrate via calcination, the NiO so produced tended to be located on the more extensively hydrolyzed exterior surface of the stacked SiXNS impregnated in water (NiO@SiXNS-H<sub>2</sub>O) but between the sheets of less-hydrolyzed SiXNS impregnated in ethanol (NiO@SiXNS-EtOH). Due to this unique siloxene chemistry, significantly different final structures were obtained from the same precursor material. Notably, the Ni loadings were almost the same for NiO@SiXNS-H<sub>2</sub>O and NiO@SiXNS-EtOH, (4.9 and 4.7 wt%, respectively), as determined using inductively coupled-plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Preparation, growth, and electron microscopy characterization of NiO@SiXNS. <bold>a</bold> Structures of two different Ni<sup>2+</sup>-impregnated SiXNS samples.

Our DRIFTS spectra and catalytic performance tests on Ni@SiXNS-EtOH are consistent with the prediction that the generation of *CO, and thus CO, is limited due to the Ni nanoparticles being encased within the SiXNS. Therefore, the chemisorbed *CO<sub>2</sub> species for this structure could instead convert first to HCO<sub>2</sub><sup>â</sup> and then to formic acid (HCOOH). More pronounced CâH IR mode intensity from HCOOH could be detected by quickly cooling down the reactor during DRIFTS measurements (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. A small portion of the HCOOH so generated could decompose to gaseous CO and H<sub>2</sub>O; however, a larger proportion is likely to participate in the rapid generation of CH<sub>4</sub>, possibly by the formate pathway reported by Kattel et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. This additional pathway for CH<sub>4</sub> production on Ni@SiXNS-EtOH could be due to the tortuosity experienced by CO<sub>2</sub> within the interior of the catalyst, which enhances the probability of it being fully hydrogenated to CH<sub>4</sub> via the associative CO<sub>2</sub> methanation mechanism (in which carbonate is hydrogenated to bicarbonate and then quickly dehydrated to formate)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. Besides, the newly generated OH groups observed in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6d</xref> could provide additional H source and aid in formate formation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par25">The synthesis of Ni@SiXNS nanocomposites relies on a distinctive kind of silicon surface chemistry in which the SiâH hydrolysis and SiâOH condensation are selectively triggered or avoided. The resulting Ni@SiXNS materials are extremely active toward the conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to CH<sub>4</sub> with high selectivity and impressive stability. The nucleation and growth of Ni nanoparticles on either the exterior or interior of the SiXNS was solvent-sensitive, enabled by choosing water or ethanol, respectively. After a standard impregnationâcalcinationâreduction in water, a Ni@SiXNS-H<sub>2</sub>O catalyst was produced. For this material, Ni nanoparticles were immobilized on the exterior surface of the SiXNS. The corresponding CH<sub>4</sub> production rate was 41.0âmmolâg<sub>Ni</sub><sup>â1</sup>âh<sup>â1</sup> with heating at 300âÂ°C with assistance of light, but CH<sub>4</sub> selectivity was only 54.3%. In contrast, the Ni@SiXNS-EtOH catalyst favored Ni located within the interlayer space of the SiXNS. These samples featured a CH<sub>4</sub> production rate of 52.9âmmolâg<sub>Ni</sub><sup>â1</sup>âh<sup>â1</sup> and a CH<sub>4</sub> selectivity over 90%. This spatially confined Ni catalyst proved stable in the light and, over time, eventually reaching an impressive CH<sub>4</sub> production rate of ~â100âmmolâg<sub>Ni</sub><sup>â1</sup>âh<sup>â1</sup> with ~90% selectivity.</p><p id="Par26">An in-situ infrared study clarified the reaction pathways of the Ni@SiXNS catalysts for CO<sub>2</sub> methanation, revealing the origin of the observed differences in selectivity between the two types of structures. Distinct reaction intermediates (i.e., CO and formate species) were observed on the Ni@SiXNS-H<sub>2</sub>O and Ni@SiXNS-EtOH samples, respectively. For Ni@SiXNS-H<sub>2</sub>O, the exposed Ni on the surface of SiXNS could easily bridge-bond to CO, leading to the hydrogenation of *C to CH<sub>4</sub> following CO dissociation. For Ni@SiXNS-EtOH, the confined Ni sites are unable to form bridging *CO species and formate species were instead the main intermediates leading to CH<sub>4</sub> production.</p><p id="Par27">The gradual increase of the CH<sub>4</sub> production rate on Ni@SiXNS-EtOH in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref> originated from the gradual release of Ni during the CO<sub>2</sub> methanation reaction, corresponding well with the recent popular catalytic concept of the âsustained release catalyst,â designed to maintain the high reactivity and stability of the obtained catalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup>. A thorough in-situÂ Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) study illustrated the gradual evolution of Ni in Ni@SiXNS-EtOH under simulated reaction conditions (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). Due to the fact that the reaction under light conditions probably resulted in a higher reactor temperature than 300âÂ°C, and that the high flow rate would bring down the surface temperature, we performed the in-situ EXAFS study at 330âÂ°C at a flow of 4:1 H<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> (i.e., 130 s.c.c.m. 3.5% H<sub>2</sub> in He and 60 s.c.c.m. 2% CO<sub>2</sub> in He) after H<sub>2</sub> activation at 300âÂ°C. Significant changes in the XAS spectra began to occur and continued over a 90âmin period. The changes continued but gradually slowed and so the temperature was again increased to 350âÂ°C in order to more rapidly drive the sample toward redox equilibrium, which was reached within the following 90âmin period. This matched well with the rapid attainment of a steady CH<sub>4</sub> or CO formation rate in a stability test of Ni@SiXNS-EtOH under dark conditions at 300âÂ°C with pre-reduction at 350âÂ°C (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>).</p><p id="Par28">On the origin of high selectivity for CH<sub>4</sub> production of Ni@SiXNS-EtOH, apparent reaction orders were estimated from the variation in production rates with different inlet reactant concentrations according to the rate law equation <italic>r</italic>â=â<italic>kP</italic><sub>H2</sub><sup>a</sup><italic>P</italic><sub>CO2</sub><sup>b</sup> (Supplementary Fig.Â <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>, Supplementary TableÂ <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Notes</xref>) after the sample was stabilized, as described above. The apparent reaction orders of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> were 0.40 and 1.56, respectively, for CH<sub>4</sub> production, whereas the reaction orders of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> were 2.80 and 0.28 for CO production. Thus, the relatively large reaction order value of H<sub>2</sub> implies dominant control of the CH<sub>4</sub> production rate by the partial pressure of H<sub>2</sub>, which is indicative of the associative methanation pathway in which H<sub>2</sub> fully hydrogenates the activated CO<sub>2</sub>. In contrast, for CO production, the much larger reaction order of CO<sub>2</sub> indicates its greater dependence on CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption and dissociation.</p><p id="Par29">Over the range of H<sub>2</sub> partial pressure variations explored, it was determined that the fractional yield of CH<sub>4</sub> from CO<sub>2</sub> was consistently larger than that for CO production from CO<sub>2</sub>, indicating high selectivity toward CH<sub>4</sub> production. Further analysis revealed the rate-limiting step to be the decomposition and further hydrogenation of formate-type species HCOOH* (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Information</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">The crucial finding of this study is that control over the location of the Ni nanoparticles, either at the interior or exterior regions of the SiXNS, matters when it comes to selectivity favoring the methanation vs. the reverse waterâgas shift reaction. The CO pathway dominates for Ni at the exterior of the nanosheets, whereas the formate pathway is preferred for Ni confined to the interior. Although the former does not discriminate much between CO and CH<sub>4</sub> products, the latter strongly favors CH<sub>4</sub>. This innovative approach to the construction of designed architecture 2D Ni@SiXNS nanocomposites presents a paradigm in the field of gas-phase heterogeneous (photo)catalytic hydrogenation of CO<sub>2</sub> to synthetic chemicals and fuels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Synthesis of SiXNS and NiO@SiXNS</title><p id="Par31">In a typical synthesis of SiXNS, 1.0âg of calcium silicide powder (Flukaâ¢) was dispersed in 100âmL hydrochloric acid (36%, Caledon Laboratory Chemicals) pre-cooled to 0âÂ°C in a jacketed flask with a circulator (NESLABâ¢ RTE-111).
