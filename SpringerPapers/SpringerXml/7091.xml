Photosystem II subunit S (PsbS) is a pH sensor protein that plays a crucial role in plant photoprotection by detecting thylakoid lumen acidification in excess light conditions via two lumen-faced glutamates. However, how PsbS is activated under low-pH conditions is unknown. To reveal the molecular response of PsbS to low pH, here we perform an NMR, FTIR and 2DIR spectroscopic analysis of <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> PsbS and of the E176Q mutant in which an active glutamate has been replaced. The PsbS response mechanism at low pH involves the concerted action of repositioning of a short amphipathic helix containing E176 facing the lumen and folding of the luminal loop fragment adjacent to E71 to a 3<sub>10</sub>-helix, providing clear evidence of a conformational pH switch. We propose that this concerted mechanism is a shared motif of proteins of the light-harvesting family that may control thylakoid inter-protein interactions driving photoregulatory responses.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Photosystem II subunit S (PsbS) senses thylakoid lumen acidification when plants are exposed to excess light.

Key to vitality is a continuous balance between light excitation and substrate availability that prevents the formation of lethal reactive oxygen species. Excess light conditions cause acidification of the chloroplast luminal compartments. This provokes a kinetic switch of the photosynthetic antenna into a dimmer state, where excitations are rapidly quenched by a process called non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Whereas the photo-protective feedback response is beneficial for plant fitness, a large part of the absorbed solar energy is dissipated during the photoprotective state and its transient recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The heart of the photoprotective mechanism lies in the molecular response to a transmembrane pH gradient (ΔpH). The protein PsbS was identified as gene product required for NPQ activation in plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. PsbS is a member of the greater LHC superfamily, but in contrast to all other proteins in this family, it does not specifically bind any chlorophyll or xanthophyll pigments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. PsbS acts as a molecular pH sensor that senses thylakoid lumen acidification and transfers the signal to the antenna, enabling a switch into a photoprotective state via antenna-photosystem rearrangements that involve changes in protein–protein or pigment–protein molecular interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The light-stress signaling function of PsbS and its impact on photoprotective feedback activation offers prospective for targeted crop engineering. A recent study demonstrated that a ~15% crop yield increase could be achieved in engineered tobacco plants with increased levels of PsbS, violaxanthin de-epoxidase (VDE), and zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP) that had faster photoprotective response kinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Moreover, raising PsbS levels was shown to increase water use efficiency of tobacco plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and canopy radiation use efficiency in rice plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">PsbS activation involves two lumen-faced glutamate (Glu) residues and is associated with reversible monomerization of PsbS dimers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

This suggests that in the absence of other partner proteins, PsbS can interact with itself.</p><p id="Par6">PsbS consists of four transmembrane (TM) helices and two short amphipathic helical stretches (H1 and H2) at the luminal side and the structure displays an overall pseudo-two-fold symmetry (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The luminal loop adjacent to H1 contains a 3<sub>10</sub> short helix domain, which was named H3 in the recent work of Liguori et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. On the basis of the high sequence identity between the two halves of the protein together with the NPQ responses of site-directed Glu mutants in vivo, the two active Glu, E69 and E173 in spinach PsbS, were proposed to be equivalent in their response to pH: the mutants E69Q and E173Q both exhibited significantly reduced NPQ responses, while the double mutant E69Q/E173Q did not show any appreciable NPQ response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

PsbS has not been crystallized under neutral pH conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, which is likely due to increased dynamics compared to its low-pH state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In contrast to other light-harvesting proteins, its lack of pigments does not provide PsbS with intrinsic fluorescent probes to report on its function. Moreover, the low occurrence of PsbS in native membranes and its poor stability in commonly used detergents or membrane protein solubilization complicates its purification in high yields for structural studies. In this work, we overcome the experimental challenges for studying the PsbS molecular mechanism and uncover its pH-dependent response mechanism. We recently introduced strategies for large-scale recombinant production of PsbS and its detergent-based refolding into native-like protein complexes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In this work, we utilize those methods together with solid-state NMR and vibrational spectroscopies to evaluate the pH-dependent structure and dynamics of wild-type (WT) PsbS from <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> and that of a site-directed glutamate mutant, known to have impaired activity in vivo.

Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> presents 1D <sup>13</sup>C MAS-NMR spectra of PsbS at neutral and low pH. Direct <sup>13</sup>C polarization MAS NMR was applied because the dimensions of PsbS in detergent micelles are such that rotational correlation dynamics averages dipolar nuclear couplings, reducing the efficiency of cross-polarization-based MAS NMR, while the sizes are too large for detection of rigid protein sites by solution NMR. At pH 7.5, two clear peaks at 181.7 ppm and 178.0 ppm are observed of deprotonated Glu and Asp carboxylic-acid side chains (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). At pH 5.0 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), these two peaks fully disappear while gain of signal is observed of shoulders at 179.3 and 177.1 ppm.

In the spectral region around 1570 cm<sup>−1</sup>, also the Amide II mode is expected to contribute, which arises from the backbone C = N stretch coupled to the amide N-H bend.

Remarkably, the Amide I spectra of M2 under both pD conditions are similar to that of the wild type at low pD (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>), indicating that the M2 mutant resides in a conformational state that resembles (but is not identical to) the WT state at low pH. The deprotonated carboxyl signals at 1570 cm<sup>−1</sup> (negative) and the protonated carboxyl signals at 1700–1750 cm<sup>−1</sup> (positive) are conserved, indicating that also in this mutant, lowering of the pD induces protonation of titratable Glu and Asp residues.

Note that the sign of the 2DIR difference pattern is inverted with respect with that of FTIR, since in the former case, the signals on the diagonal in the equilibrium spectra are negative as explained above<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

Two diagonal peak pairs of opposite signs with respect to that at 1630 cm<sup>−1</sup> are located at 1638 and 1660 cm<sup>−1</sup>, i.e. with a negative amplitude on the diagonal, which indicates that these pairs represent population gain of two distinct secondary structure elements. The 1660 cm<sup>−1</sup> band has an amplitude that is somewhat (~30%) higher than that at 1638 cm<sup>−1</sup>. As discussed below, these two bands at 1660 and 1638 cm<sup>−1</sup> represent a gain or rearrangement of distinct helical elements, with different degrees of conformational disorder.</p><p id="Par18">The nature of the transition at 1630 cm<sup>−1</sup> warrants further attention, since this frequency falls on the boundary expected for α-helical and β-sheet Amide I oscillators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. A more precise assignment can be made by carefully inspecting the 2DIR spectrum in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>. First, the band anharmonicity (<italic>Δ</italic>) is an important parameter that reflects the extent of backbone Amide coupling and can help distinguish between structured and unstructured elements. The anharmonicity <italic>Δ</italic> of the 1630 cm<sup>−1</sup> transition here was determined to be 13 cm<sup>−1</sup> on the basis of the difference of the <italic>v</italic> = 0 ⟶ 1 and <italic>v</italic> = 1 ⟶ 2 peak maxima. Uncoupled Amide I oscillators carry <italic>Δ</italic> values of 16 cm<sup>−1</sup> and this value inversely scales with the degree of excitonic coupling between Amide I oscillators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. For example, an ɑ-helix or β-sheet generally ranges from 9–14 cm<sup>−1</sup> suggesting this element corresponds to an ordered structure and is therefore not representative of a coil or loop. Second, we can discriminate between a β-sheet and helical response on the basis of its peak pattern. Since β-sheets typically exhibit a characteristic “Z-shaped” peak pattern in the overall 2DIR spectrum, which is not observed here, we conclude that the 1630 cm<sup>−1</sup> feature corresponds to a helical element<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

A similar reasoning may be applied to the two band pairs at 1638 and 1660 cm<sup>−1</sup>, which show similar band anharmonicity and peak patterns to that at 1630 cm<sup>−1</sup> indicating distinct helical elements.

In FTIR, we observe a distinct negative/positive Amide I signal at 1625 (-) / 1660 (+) cm<sup>−1</sup>, and a positive-going shoulder at 1638 cm<sup>−1</sup> in WT PsbS (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). This signal is also reflected and refined in 2DIR spectroscopy, where loss of a helical signal at 1630 cm<sup>−1</sup> is accompanied by gain of two distinct helical signals at 1638 and 1660 cm<sup>−1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). As mentioned above, because of its low frequency, the helical signal at 1630 cm<sup>−1</sup> should originate from a helix element that is water exposed. This limits its assignment to the luminal amphipathic helices of PsbS (H1 and H2) as the transmembrane helices reside in a hydrophobic membrane environment. Strikingly, mutation of Glu-2 largely abolishes the structural Amide I response of PsbS to low pH (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), indicating that the helical signal at 1630 cm<sup>−1</sup> originates from the lumen-facing amphipathic helix H2 containing Glu-2 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). This assignment is consistent with the FTIR amplitude of the difference signal in WT PsbS, corresponding to at least 8 amino acids, consistent with the length of the Glu-2-containing H2 helix fragment in the X-ray structure with 9 amino acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. We note that H1 is much shorter and comprises 5 amino acids and therefore confidently assign the 1625 cm<sup>−1</sup> FTIR signal and the corresponding 1630 cm<sup>−1</sup> 2DIR signal in WT PsbS to a change in luminal amphipathic helix H2. Because Glu-2 is negatively charged at neutral pH, it is expected that at pH 7.5, the polar side of the amphipathic helix H2 will be stabilized in the aqueous environment of the lumen, consistent with the low frequency (1630 cm<sup>−1</sup>) of the helical element detected at that pH (pD).</p><p id="Par29">The work of Fan et al. gives evidence that at low pH, where the charge is neutralized, Glu-2 is in a hydrophobic phase.

The DCCD-soaked structure shows that DCCD binds to Glu-2 (E173), indicating that in the low-pH conformation, this Glu residue resides in a hydrophobic environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. In our results at pD 5.0, two populations of helical elements are detected with frequencies of 1660 and 1638 cm<sup>−1</sup>.

In FTIR, the small residual bleach at 1625 cm<sup>−1</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>) likely represents a small change in a solvent-exposed amphipathic helix given its unusually low frequency, and may correspond to a small change in either H1 or H2. In the M2 2DIR difference spectrum (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>), the overall signal amplitude is also significantly diminished with respect to WT (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref> where diagonal slices are shown for WT and M2).

Hence, the FTIR and 2DIR results are mutually consistent and indicate that in the M2 mutant, one of the amphipathic solvent-exposed helices undergoes a small motion or minor unfolding upon lowering of the pD. The FTIR difference spectrum also involves a band upshift from 1645 cm<sup>−1</sup> (−) to 1655 cm<sup>−1</sup> (+). Its very small amplitude indicates that it may involve only a single amino acid. Likewise, the 2DIR difference map shows a very small positive diagonal band at 1650 cm<sup>−1</sup>, indicating a small loss of helical signal. We interpret the 1645–1650 cm<sup>−1</sup> loss signal in FTIR and 2DIR as a loss or destabilization of transmembrane helix by a single amino acid, resulting in an upshift to 1655 cm<sup>−1</sup> in FTIR, which may correspond to coil or a loosened helix.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>E71Q (M1) and E71Q/E176Q (M1/M2) PsbS have non-native folds</title><p id="Par34">Next, we turn to the FTIR spectra of the M1 and M1/M2 mutants. In the FTIR spectrum of M1 at neutral pD, (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3a</xref>, orange line) the prominent band around 1630 cm<sup>−1</sup> that is visible for the wild type and for M2, has a lower amplitude as compared to the main band at 1655 cm<sup>−1</sup>. We consider two possibilities to account for this observation: (i) M1 has less water-exposed amphipathic helical content than wild type, which would imply diminished H2 or H1 absorption, or (ii) M1 has a higher transmembrane helix content as compared to WT, which increases the absorption around 1655 cm<sup>−1</sup>. We note that in the X-ray structure, TM2 does not span the entire membrane at the luminal side (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) and by mutation of Glu-1, the unstructured part adjacent to TM2 that loops into the lumen has the potential to fold into TM2, especially given that the TM2 sequence is similar to that of the pseudo-symmetry-related TM4. The spectrum of the M1/M2 mutant at neutral pD (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3b</xref>, orange line) shows a diminished 1630 cm<sup>−1</sup> band relative to that at 1655 cm<sup>−1</sup> as well, which means that its fold may be similarly altered with respect to wild type, as in the M1 mutant.</p><p id="Par35">The non-native folds of M1 and M1/M2 could be due to a non-native charge distribution in the loop connecting TM1 with TM2. At neutral pH, the negative charge on E71 is eliminated by the mutation, but other titratable residues in this loop (D69, E78, and E80 for <italic>P. patens</italic>) will be negatively charged, which gives a non-natural charge distribution along the loop as a whole (−4 in wild type, −3 in the M1 and M1/M2 mutants). In contrast, at the Glu-2 site, there are no additional titratable residues in the loop and H2, and elimination of the Glu-2 charge gives an overall charge of this segment that resembles the charge distribution of the wild type at low pH. In addition, the segment containing Glu-2 forms a well-defined structural element (i.e., an amphipathic helix of 9 amino acids) and its conformation should be less affected by a point mutation than the loop containing Glu-1 that is only locally structured, containing a short helix fragment H1 and a short 3<sub>10</sub> helix fragment that carries Glu-1. 3<sub>10</sub> helices are known to be intrinsically unstable, which is also demonstrated in the MD study of Liguori et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. A point mutation at Glu-1 therefore could easily induce an unnatural structural change.</p><p id="Par36">The FTIR difference spectrum of the M1 mutant shows significant changes upon lowering the pD to 5.0 (Fig <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3a</xref>, black line). The amplitude of the changes is similar to that of the wild type (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>, black line), but it qualitatively differs significantly: it exhibits a bleach at 1629 cm<sup>−1</sup> (1623 cm<sup>−1</sup> in wild type), with a negative shoulder at 1642 cm<sup>−1</sup> that is absent in wild type. It features a positive signal with a maximum at 1658 cm<sup>−1</sup> with an overall shape that is narrower and more symmetric than for the wild type. Likewise, the M1/M2 difference spectrum (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3b</xref>, black line) shows a negative band at 1626 cm<sup>−1</sup>, a negative shoulder at 1645 cm<sup>−1</sup> and a sharp, symmetric positive signal at 1658 cm<sup>−1</sup>. Because M1/M2 lacks both Glu-1 and Glu-2, the observed pH (pD) dependent changes for M1/M2 must originate from responses of other titratable residues. Given the fact that the fold of M1 and M1/M2 at pD 7.5 differs from that of wild type in a way that is uncertain to gauge, we cannot clearly relate the M1 and M1/M2 difference spectra with specific elements in the wild-type X-ray structure, and we refrain from interpreting these spectra in more detail.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Comparison with earlier MD results</title><p id="Par37">The pH-dependent motion of the luminal amphipathic H2 helix and the refolding of the H3 loop fragment into a 3<sub>10</sub> helix are intrinsic properties of PsbS that underlie this protein’s plasticity, defined by a complex potential energy landscape that dynamically responds to changes in pH. Notably, while H3 refolding was first proposed in MD simulations of Liguori et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and consistent with the FTIR and 2DIR signals, the pH-dependent repositioning of H2 was not observed in the MD simulations. This discrepancy could have several explanations. The limited time window after pH change in the simulation, which was 4.7 μs, may have precluded such observation: stimulus-induced conformational changes in proteins may take place on much longer timescales than that, i.e., from sub-milliseconds to milliseconds<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, and specific methods in MD are required to predict such slow dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in the current work, the H2 motion is revealed in (primarily) dimeric PsbS in detergent micelles; the MD simulations were conducted on a PsbS monomer, as taken from the dimeric X-ray structure, and equilibrated in a POPC lipid bilayer, which renders the system flat and planar. The latter difference between our experimental systems and the MD simulations may also contribute to the discrepancies in the results with respect to protonation. The NMR and FTIR data show that all titratable residues are protonated at pH 5.0, including Glu-1 and Glu-2, which are essential for the lumen acidification response in vivo. Our results indicate that also titratable residues at the stromal site have pKa’s that are significantly shifted with respect to their pKa’s in aqueous solvent whereas the MD study predicts that the stromal residues have very low pKa’s.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>The molecular response of PsbS to low pH in relationship with its function</title><p id="Par38">We now discuss how a pH-dependent repositioning of helix H2 and refolding of 3<sub>10</sub> helix H3 may be coupled to the pH-sensing function of PsbS. In the spinach PsbS crystal structure, Glu-1 (E69 in the X-ray structure) is located in a loop fragment close to H3 that connects two transmembrane helices TM1 and TM2, whereas Glu-2 (E173 in the X-ray structure) is located in the amphipathic short helix H2 at the water-membrane interface facing the lumen, and connects TM3 and TM4 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,c</xref>). These elements form an important part of the PsbS dimerization interface (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>): the backbone carbonyl and side chain carboxyl of Glu-2 each can form a hydrogen bond with two backbone amides of I74 and Y75 close to Glu-1 of the adjacent monomer, as schematically shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>. In <italic>P. patens</italic> PsbS, the latter two amino acids are L74 and T75 (note that the different nature of the side chains in <italic>P. patens</italic> vs. spinach will not have an immediate effect because the hydrogen bonding takes place to the backbone amides). The I74 and Y75 residues form the short 3<sub>10</sub> helix fragment H3 that was predicted to unfold at neutral pH, constituting a molecular response to pH. It was proposed that including this response, a network of tunable electrostatic interactions could create a pH-sensitive docking mechanism for PsbS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Here, we have shown that helix H2 exhibits pH-dependent structural dynamics in concert with H3, suggesting that their motion forms an integral part of the pH-dependent regulation pathway. In addition to the absence of motion for H2, we find no indication of pH-dependent H3 refolding in the M2 mutant according to the 2DIR results. Thus, the luminal loop element that contains Glu-1 and partly folds into H3 at low pH in WT PsbS, has its structural pH response abolished when Glu-2 is replaced by Gln. In the M2 mutant, H3 in the 3<sub>10</sub> conformation is able to form a native-like dimer interaction with helix H2 of its dimerization partner. We hypothesize that in the M2 mutant, H3 retains its 3<sub>10</sub> conformation at neutral pH because H2 of its dimerization partner remains in the hydrophobic phase and provides an energetically favorable hydrogen bonding site, even with deprotonation of Glu-1.</p><p id="Par39">Considering our results and that of earlier MD simulations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, both Glu sites have shown to undergo specific pH-dependent conformational changes that could affect the interaction of PsbS with itself or other interaction partners in a membrane. Indeed, in-vivo studies show that both M1 and M2 mutants have altered NPQ response according to Li et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. We find that at both pH conditions, the PsbS M2 mutant resides in a pseudo-WT low-pH conformational state, which is considered the active state of the protein. This is in apparent contradiction with in vivo results that indicate that mutation of Glu-2 partially impairs the NPQ response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The observed partial activity in vivo may result from the function of PsbS to interact with other type of proteins, like LHCII. The M2 mutant has a fixed position of H2 but could still confer a pH-dependent switching capability through the protonation state of Glu-1 in H3, and establish reversible interactions with flexible amphipatic helices of other types of proteins. In our isolated protein system, however, PsbS can only interact with itself. This means that in the M2 PsbS dimer, the interacting partner site of H3 (i.e., the amphipatic helix H2 of the other monomer) is in a fixed position, thereby locking also the conformation and positioning of H3. In addition, the reduced NPQ activity of Glu-2 mutants in plants suggests that not only the activation of PsbS, but its ability to switch on and off is crucial for its function. Indeed, PsbS is not only involved in switching on NPQ, but also essential for rapid deactivation and recovery of this process in fluctuating light conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par40">In thylakoid membranes, the water-membrane interface will be determined by the compositions of native lipids in the annular shell around the protein: the non-bilayer lipid monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (MGDG), digalactosyl diacyl glycerol (DGDG), sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG), and phosphatidyl glycerol (PG). The microenvironment of PsbS will change if it associates with other proteins in the membrane. The exact positioning of protein fragments at the water–lipid interface and the pKa’s of titratable residues therefore may differ from experimental or in-silico results on isolated protein.</p><p id="Par41">Based on our experimental results, we may extend earlier models describing the PsbS function in vivo interacting with key constituents of the thylakoid membrane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>.

PsbS is a member of the LHC superfamily, where proteins function as pH switches (namely PsbS and LHCSR) and/or photoprotective switches that can alternate between fluorescent and excitation-quenched states (namely LHCII and LHCSR). LHCs share a structure in which transmembrane helices are connected via amphipathic short helices at the luminal site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. As we mentioned, in isolation PsbS self-interacts to form dimers as described above. For interactions of PsbS with LHCs, the corresponding symmetry-equivalent luminal amphipathic helices of the latter proteins would provide a putative dimerization site. From our experimental results, we predict that (i) these LHC amphipathic helices need to be located in the membrane phase for proper positioning with respect to the PsbS helix H3 and (ii) these LHC amphipathic helices need to respond to pH (i.e., undergo a motion similar to that of H2 in PsbS) in order to tune the strength of PsbS – LHC interactions. Otherwise, H3 may remain constitutively folded as is likely the case for the PsbS M2 mutant, and the interaction is not switched on and off with varying the pH. Strikingly, the symmetry-related luminal amphipathic helices of LHC contain several titratable residues (Asp, Glu)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> which may enable such functionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Thus, responsiveness of the amphipathic helices to changes in pH, hydrophobicity, or other alterations in the physico-chemical environment could be a common motif that enables LHCs to operate as molecular controls for regulating photosynthetic light harvesting.</p><p id="Par42">Thus far, our understanding of PsbS action has mostly derived from the thylakoid membrane level; an important goal is to understand the precise mechanism by which PsbS causes NPQ on the molecular level through protonation events that trigger altered interactions with membrane partners, and how these dynamic interactions ultimately elicit the systems-level response that NPQ in essence represents. This work constitutes a first experimental characterization of the molecular pH response of PsbS, a starting point that allows to build a true molecular mechanistic model of PsbS activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Construction of mutants, protein expression, refolding, and purification</title><p id="Par43">Constructed plasmids of site-directed mutants of <italic>P. patens</italic> PsbS were purchased from BaseClear B.V.<sup>®</sup>.
