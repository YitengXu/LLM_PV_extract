sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Nowadays, antireflective coatings are common components used in windows, solar cells, display technology, sensors and eyeglasses to increase quantum efficiency and reduce light pollution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Such coatings consist of optical films that reduce the reflection of light at optical interfaces, generated by a contrast of refractive indices. One of the most effective ways to avoid this effect is the generation of refractive index gradient structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, they required to exhibit refractive indices around 1.22–1.23 when coating glass substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, a parameter not fulfilled by dense solids with refractive indices above 1.3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In this context, porous materials with pore sizes in the subwavelength scale are an alternative to develop such antireflective coatings.</p><p id="Par3">These porous materials might be also used to change the wettability properties of the surface of the material considered<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. By controlling the porosity, a surface can change their properties from hydrophilic to hydrophobic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Thus, combining the antireflective and hydrophobic properties it is possible to develop functional materials with improved properties for applications in self-cleaning antireflection coatings<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, self-cleaning solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> or sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The fabrication techniques used to produce such porous antireflective and hydrophobic coatings comprise methods such as spinning, spraying, dipping, electrochemical deposition, plasma etching or layer by layer deposition methods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, most of these methods suffer from complicated procedures, long deposition and aging times, in compatibility with organic components, repeated processing procedures and of expensive devices to produce these antireflective coatings, to name a few<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the nanopores generated can suffer from being filled by water molecules present in the ambient gas via capillary condensation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, or from a limited diffusion of the functional material into the pores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, which in any case, reduces the antireflective effect. Nanopores also might be blocked when using postsynthetic grafting procedures, resulting in a reduction of the porosity degree and consequently in an increase of the refractive index<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Another inconvenient to be taken into account is the need, in some cases, of high temperature calcinations to remove organic materials or templates, with the potential loss of functionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Thus, new low-cost preparation techniques and materials are required to produce mechanically and chemically robust, high-performance, and if possible, multifunctional antireflective coatings.</p><p id="Par5">Wurtzite gallium nitride (GaN) is a direct wide band gap semiconductor with important applications in opto-electronics, such as light emitting and laser diodes, high-power and high-frequency devices, and recently, chemical and biosensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Antireflective and hydrophic surfaces in GaN have been demonstrated in GaNnano-flowers fabricated by Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, and in N-polar GaN surfaces nanostructured by wet photochemical etching under UV illumination and chemically functionalized with lauric acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the wetting properties of GaNmicrobelts with rough surfaces synthesized by CVD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, and etched Ga-polar GaN surfaces functionalized with 1-dodecanethiol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> have also been investigated. Recently, by attaching a polymer layer with an array of micropyramidal structures on GaN, antireflective and hydrophobic structures have also been demonstrated for sensing purposes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. So, it is clear that it exists an increasing interest in developing antireflective and hydrophobic structures in this material.</p><p id="Par6">We demonstrated the possibility of producing nanoporousGaN by using the direct reaction between metallic Ga and NH<sub>3</sub> in a simple Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. With our approach, we produced nanoporous GaN in one single step, without requiring any post-growth treatment to induce the porosity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Furthermore, this technique allowed for an easy integration of nanoporousGaN on Si substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In the present work, we optimized the deposition conditions for nanoporous GaN, obtained by CVD, to produce antireflective polycrystalline films on Si substrates. These antireflective coatings reduced the reflectance of Si substrates, metal-coated (Au and Pt) Si substrates and GaN by 40% or more, depending on the wavelength region analyzed, improving the performance of the currently developed antireflective coatings technology especially for short wavelengths, below 400–500 nm. Furthermore, these polycrystalline nanoporous films probed also to be hydrophobic, contributing to generate multifunctional layers with improved properties for applications in different fields, but especially as UV sensors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental Section</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Deposition of polycrystalline nanoporous GaN</title><p id="Par8">Nanoporous GaN particles were grown on metal-coated Si substrates by the direct reaction of metallic Ga (Alfa Aesar 99.999%) and NH<sub>3</sub> (CarburosMetálicos &gt;99.98%) as Ga and N sources, respectively, in a CVD horizontal tubular furnace.

The quartz crucibles or Ga holders used had three different shapes to limit the spreading of liquid Ga along different directions: (i) a flat plate, where the spreading of liquid Ga is not restricted; (ii) the half of a cylindrical tube, where the spreading of liquid Ga is allowed only along the axis of the tube; and (iii) a concave crucible, where the spreading of liquid Ga is restricted in all directions.</p><p id="Par10">As substrates, we used silicon wafers with (100) and (111) crystallographic orientations. The Si substrate was placed above the Ga source at a vertical distance of 2 cm, supported by a BN plate. Prior to their introduction in the furnace, the silicon substrates were cleaned with piranha solution and ethanol.</p><p id="Par11">We tested the effect of different metallic catalysts on the formation and the structure and morphology of the polycrystalline coatings on the Si substrates. We used Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, deposited on the surface of the substrate by spreading several drops of an ethanolic solution of the compound used and continuous films, 20 nm thick, of Ni, Au, Pt, and Ti, deposited on the substrates by RF sputtering (AJA International) at a power of 150 W and a pressure of 3 mTorr. We selected this thickness for the metallic films owing to the impossibility of forming thinner continuous and uniform layers of Au on silicon. Afterwards, we kept this layer thickness constant in the rest of metals sputtered on silicon wafers for comparison.</p><p id="Par12">In a typical experiment of deposition of polycrystalline nanoporous GaN films, the quartz reactor, 5 cm in diameter and 1 m long, was degassed to a vacuum pressure of 1 × 10<sup>−2</sup> Torr. Ammonia was then introduced through a mass-flow controller at 75 sccm from one end of the quartz reactor and the furnace was heated up to the reaction temperature of 1200 K. Then, the furnace was kept at this temperature during the reaction time, which we tuned between 30–120 min, under a constant flow of NH<sub>3</sub>; keeping the pressure of the system constant at 15 Torr while the chemical reaction was taking place. When the reaction was finished, we cooled down the furnace to room temperature and stopped the ammonia flow. These parameters had been optimized previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Nanoporous GaN coatings characterization</title><p id="Par13">The aspect of the nanoporous GaN coatings deposited on the Si substrates was characterized using a JEOL JSM 6400 scanning electron microscope (SEM). Before observation, the samples were coated with Au in a Bal-Tec SCD004 sputterer.</p><p id="Par14">X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were recorded in a Bruker AXS D8-Discover diffractometer equipped with parallel incident beam (Göbel mirror), a vertical θ-θ goniometer, and a General Area Diffraction Detection System (GADDS) HI-STAR with a multiwire proportional counter with an area of 30 × 30 cm and 1024 × 1024 pixel density. The X-ray diffractometer was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA to generate the Cu Kα radiation. Data were recorded from 20–90° in the 2θ range. The incident beam and the detector were placed at a distance of 15 cm of the sample. Identification of the crystalline phases obtained was achieved by comparing the XRD diffractogram with the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) database using Diffrac<sup>plus</sup> Evaluation software.</p><p id="Par15">Focused ion beam (FIB) tomography was used to reveal the internal porous structure of the particles with a Zeiss 1540 Cross Beam microscope equipped with a FIB column with a Ga source and a high-resolution field emission electron column. The angle between the FIB and the electron columns was 52°, with the sample surface perpendicular to the ion column. 5 pA beam current was used for ion milling to minimize surface damaging and materials redeposition.</p><p id="Par16">Reflectance measurements of the nanoporous GaN coatings were done in an Agilent Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR Spectrophotometer equipped with an Internal Diffuse Reflectance Accessory (DRA) working in a specular configuration, so both, specular and diffuse reflections were collected.</p><p id="Par17">To evaluate the contact angle, a 2 μl water droplet was placed above the surfaces smoothly with a micropipette.

Up to 1177 K the GaN drop remained unaffected. From that moment, some cracks appeared at the bottom part of the Ga drop, marked with green arrows. The cracks appear in what it seems to be a solid layer formed covering the Ga drop, as a result of the continuous NH<sub>3</sub> flow through the reactor at high temperatures. From these cracks, the liquid Ga started to spread out when the furnace reached a temperature of 1203 K. Finally, at around 30 min after the furnace reached 1203 K we observed a scalation of the material covering the crucible, marked with orange arrows in the figure, identified later as GaN by XRD.</p><p id="Par21">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(b)</xref> shows the evolution of the Ga drop on the half of a cylindrical tube holder. The process is similar to that observed in the flat plate holder, although, the spreading process happened at lower temperatures. The cracks at the bottom of the Ga drop started to appear at 1170 K, and at 1203 K, the meniscus of the liquid Ga passed from a convex shape to a concave shape. From that moment, the liquid Ga climbed through the walls of the holder and spread on the quartz liner tube. This caused the leaning of the Ga holder at around 30 min after reaching this temperature. Finally, the scalation of the material covering the crucible occurred at around 32 min after the furnace reached 1203 K, later than in the previous case. All these observations seems to indicate that the deposition process lasts longer when using this Ga holder than when a flat plate holder was used.</p><p id="Par22">When using the concave holder (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(c)</xref>), despite the Ga drop followed a similar behaviour as in the previous cases, it was more challenging to see clearly what was happening inside the Ga holder. We could roughly see that at 1201 K two cracks appeared at the bottom of the drop latter than in the two previous cases, and just before the wetting of the crucible by Ga. What we could clearly see was that when the Ga drop reached a temperature of 1203 K it started to climb through the walls of the holder and it spread over the quartz liner. The lean of the Ga holder was observed 44 min after the beginning of the experiment, and the scalation of material was observed at 57 min, much latter than when the half of a cylindrical tube was used.</p><p id="Par23">SEM pictures of the nanoporous GaN coating layers deposited on Si (100) substrates covered with an ethanolic solution of Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> using different Ga holders are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(a–c)</xref>. In all cases, the temperature of the reaction was chosen to ensure the total spread of the Ga drop, generating the maximum extension of the surface of metallic Ga to favour its evaporation. The nanoporous GaN coating layers obtained when using a flat plate or a half cylindrical tube as Ga holders were similar, with particles with sizes between 2–3 µm, and a similar degree of porosity (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(a,b)</xref>). Nevertheless, the coatings obtained with the half-cylindrical tube have a more uniform thickness. From another side, the particles obtained using the concave crucible (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(c)</xref>) show bigger sizes (around 4 µm), and the pores seem to be smaller. The better uniformity obtained for the layers deposited when using a half cylindrical tube might correspond to the fact that the cracks from which the spread of the Ga drop started, occured at earlier temperatures, together with the observation of the scalation process at latter times. This implies that the deposition process lasted longer, contributing to form a more uniform film.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>SEM pictures of the nanoporous GaN coating layers obtained on Si (100) substrates using different Ga holders: (<bold>a</bold>) flat plate, (<bold>b</bold>) half cylindrical tube, and (<bold>c</bold>) concave crucible, and different amounts of Ga: (<bold>d</bold>) 0.2 g, (<bold>e</bold>) 0.4 g, and (<bold>f</bold>) 0.6 g.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2019_48202_Fig3_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par24">Since by using a half cylindrical tube we obtained more uniform layers, what is a necessary condition for the deposition of antireflective coatings on Si substrates, in the rest of the experiments, we used this kind of Ga holder.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Effect of the initial Ga amount</title><p id="Par25">Three sets of experiments using different initial amounts of Ga were carried out to analyze its effect on the coating of the Si (100) substrates, while keeping constant the other reaction parameters. Obviously, by changing the initial amount of Ga, what we are doing is changing its concentration in relation with NH<sub>3</sub>, that is maintained constant in all the experiments. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(d–f)</xref> shows SEM pictures of the nanoporous GaN coating layers obtained. In the three cases, particles with different sizes were observed. However, and more importantly, the amount of Ga used affected specially to the degree of coating of the substrate.</p><p id="Par26">When 0.2 g of Ga were used (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(d)</xref>) a low degree of coating of the substrate was achieved. This is attributed to the low quantity of Ga evaporated and deposited on the substrate, forming a small number of nucleuses on the substrate. This was confirmed by the fact that the GaN particles were bigger in diameter than in the other cases, around 5–6 µm. A larger surface of the substrate was coated when 0.4 g of Ga were used (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(e)</xref>). In contrast with the previous case, the particle diameters are smaller, of around 2 µm. This is attributed to the higher quantity of Ga evaporated and the formation of a higher number of Ga-metallic catalyst nucleuses, which leaded to a larger surface of the substrate coated with smaller nanoporous GaN particles. Finally, in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(f)</xref> we can see a SEM image of the nanoporous GaN coating layer obtained using 0.6 g of Ga. A similar density of particles and sizesis observed when compared to the experiment using 0.4 g of Ga. However, the shape of the particles is not as obvious as in the previous cases, their sizes are smaller, and the porosity is not as evident. Thus, from the image, it seems that even a higher number of nucleuses were formed in this case, contributing to the reduction in size of the particles. This reduction in size seems to affect also the porosity. These results seem to indicate that it exists an optimum amount of Ga that provides an equilibrium between the number of particles formed, to ensure a good coating of the substrate, and their sizes, to favour the formation of porosity in them. Thus, for the following experiments, the amount of Ga was kept constant at 0.4 g.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Effect of the deposition time</title><p id="Par27">We performed additional experiments to analyse the influence of the deposition time in the shape and porosity of the GaN particles that form the coating layers.

We selected these deposition times according to the different events observed in the images shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The first one (30 min) is related to the leaning of the crucible when a half cylindrical tube was used, due to the wetting of both, the crucible and the liner. The second one is the time corresponding to the scalation of the material covering the crucible, identified later as GaN by X-ray diffraction, 45 min after the reactor reached 1203 K.

In these images, we can see that the density of nanoporous GaN particles on the surface of the substrate increased when the deposition time increased, until a deposition time of 60 min. From there, it seems that no additional particles nucleated and the particles density remained constant. However, as we increased the deposition time, the morphology of the particles seems to fade away (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(d)</xref>). Smaller particles can be seen covering the substrate. This might be due to the decomposition of the previously formed particles, due to the high temperature and low pressure at which the sample is exposed during the growth experiment, and the further nucleation of smaller particles at expenses of the bigger ones.
