Nevertheless, cost-effective and scalable fabrication of regular 3-D nanostructures with decent robustness and flexibility still remains as a challenging task. Meanwhile, establishing rational design guidelines for 3-D nanostructured solar cells with the balanced electrical and optical performance are of paramount importance and in urgent need. Herein, regular arrays of 3-D nanospikes (NSPs) were fabricated on flexible aluminum foil with a roll-to-roll compatible process. The NSPs have precisely controlled geometry and periodicity which allow systematic investigation on geometry dependent optical and electrical performance of the devices with experiments and modeling. Intriguingly, it has been discovered that the efficiency of an amorphous-Si (a-Si) photovoltaic device fabricated on NSPs can be improved by 43%, as compared to its planar counterpart, in an optimal case. Furthermore, large scale flexible NSP solar cell devices have been fabricated and demonstrated. These results not only have shed light on the design rules of high performance nanostructured solar cells, but also demonstrated a highly practical process to fabricate efficient solar panels with 3-D nanostructures, thus may have immediate impact on thin film photovoltaic industry.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>4026</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2014</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep04243.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep04243" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep04243</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Thin film photovoltaics (PVs) are highly attractive for low cost solar energy conversion. In addition, potency of thin film solar cells to be made with remarkably light weight and excellent flexibility enables a wide range of applications in different scale from building-integrated photovoltaic generation to portable electronics. Nevertheless, due to utilization of ultra-thin material with limited light absorption capability and typically low crystalline quality, poor performance of thin film solar cells has placed them in a disadvantageous situation when competing with crystalline Si based solar cells. Meanwhile, the competition between light absorption and carrier collection in conventional type of planar thin film solar cells makes further performance boost a challenging and fundamentally intriguing research topic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Recent studies have revealed that nanostructured substrates/templates can benefit performance of thin film solar cells, via introducing advanced light management schemes, such as photonic and/or plasmonic light trapping and unique device design to improve minority carrier collection efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Although a number of different types of nanostructures, such as nanodome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, nanocoax<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, nanorod<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and nanopillars<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, etc., have been proven effective in this regard, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding on how morphological and structural change will affect the trade-off between photon absorption and carrier collection in a thin film solar cell device. This is in fact crucial in order to develop rational design guidelines for high efficiency solar cell devices. Moreover, from a practical standpoint, a cost-effective and scalable scheme to fabricate desirable nanostructures on flexible substrates is of an urgent need. In this work, a low-cost process has been developed to fabricate perfectly ordered arrays of 3-D NSPs on flexible Al substrates. These 3-D NSPs were formed with a unique defect nanoengineering approach in conjunction with scalable Al anodization and they have well controlled geometries, <italic>i. e.</italic> pitch and height. After Achieving NSP structures, <italic>p-i-n</italic> junction amorphous-Si (a-Si) thin films were used as model materials deposited on 3-D structures with different combinations of height and pitch to implement 3-D solar cell devices. Then systematic characterizations on device optical absorption and electrical performance were carried out, assisted with optical and device simulations in order to gain further understanding. In brief, it has been discovered that 3-D architecture does improve light absorption in the active material, with the effectiveness monotonically depending on aspect ratio. However, high aspect ratio compromises uniformity of a-Si coating on the nanostructures which adversely affects building potential in the thin film thus hurts carrier collection eventually. Through systematic experiments and simulations, an optimal 3-D structure was identified to achieve a good balance between light absorption and carrier collection, yielding as high as 43% improvement on power conversion efficiency from a planar counterpart. Furthermore, a roll-to-roll compatible nanostructure fabrication process was successfully demonstrated and 3-D flexible thin film solar cells were fabricated in a relatively large scale with respectable efficiency. These investigations have not only exemplified the critical necessity of the coupled optical/electrical design for device performance optimization and shown a set of generic guidelines, but also demonstrated a highly practical and scalable technological platform to develop a new generation of high efficiency thin film solar cells based on various materials.</p><p>Fabrication of irregular 3-D NSP arrays on aluminum has been developed by us previously and the structures have demonstrated excellent photon capturing capability after coating with photovoltaic materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, irregularity on periodicity and height of NSPs may introduce large variation on the coated film thickness. This may not significantly affect device optical absorption as it is typically measured in average, whereas it is detrimental for photovoltaic performance which is sensitive to local variation of junction depth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In this regard, a facile approach has been developed to fabricate highly regular arrays of 3-D NSPs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> demonstrates the schematics and the corresponding scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the process flow to fabricate a regular 3-D NSP array. It started with nanoimprint of squarely ordered nano-indentation on a clean and flat Al foil using a silicon nanoimprint master, as illustrated in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a1 and 1a2</xref>. Then the imprinted Al chip was anodized in an acidic solution with desirable direct current (DC) voltage (see the Method section). Notably, solution based Al anodization process typically lead to formation of porous alumina films on Al substrates with local hexagonal pore ordering, due to the fact that the honeycomb structure is the most stable structure in nature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, in this work, squarely ordered nanoimprint was utilized to introduce periodic defects intentionally. As the square order is not naturally stable, voids were formed between unit cells during anodization. These voids were consequently filled up with the un-anodized Al material during the formation of porous alumina, as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b1 and 1b2</xref>. And Al NSPs were obtained after wet chemical etching away of alumina, as illustrated in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>. The formation of NSPs by square pattern nanoimprint assisted anodization can be further evidenced by the bottom view of the anodic alumina shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>, in which the periodic voids can be conspicuously resolved. In contrast, bottom surface of a hexagonally ordered porous alumina film is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supplementary Fig. S1a</xref> and there is no void can be observed, leading to concave structure on the Al substrate without any NSP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S1b</xref>). <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1e</xref> demonstrates an SEM image of the resulting true three-dimensional Al NSP array with 1.2âÎ¼m pitch and approximately 1.2âÎ¼m height.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Fabrciation process of 3-D nanospike.</p><p>(a1âa2) Schematic diagram of nanoimprint process on flat Al foil with a silicon stamp and SEM image of a imprinted aluminum foil.

Therefore, the ability to control geometries of nanostructures, <italic>i. e.</italic> pitch, height, shape, is the prerequisite for seeking the optimal device structure. In this work, the pitch of the 3-D NSPs is determined by the nanoimprint master design together with the DC anodization voltage (Method section). In experiments, pitches of 1âÎ¼m, 1.2âÎ¼m, 1.5âÎ¼m and 2âÎ¼m were chosen in order to achieve acceptable film coating uniformity during the solar cell fabrication with plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and sputtering (Method section). Meanwhile, it was found that the height of the NSPs can be readily tuned via controlling anodization time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S2</xref>). However, it was also found that beyond certain time, the height of NSPs does not grow anymore and the greatest height of NSPs is found to be approximately equal to the corresponding pitch (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S2</xref>). <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> shows the schematics of an NSP array before and after a-Si solar cell device fabrication with each layer clearly labeled. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b1, 2c1 and 2d1</xref> show the 1.2âÂµm pitch nanostructures formed after anodization time of 30âmins, 3âhrs and 6âhrs, respectively. Interestingly, there can be seen a structural transformation from nanoconcave (NC) to NSP. Apparently NCs were formed with short time anodization. In this case the porous alumina film was too thin to support the growth of tall NSPs. Since their peak to valley height differences are 209ânm (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b1</xref>), 614ânm (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c1</xref>) and 1151ânm (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2d1</xref>), respectively, they are named as NC 200, NSP 600 and NSP 1200 correspondingly for the convenience. And the SEM images of NSP 400 and NSP 800 are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S3a and S3b</xref>. Note that all the NSP height mentioned here were obtained using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and the AFM images can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S6</xref>. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2b2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3c</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S3d</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d2</xref> show the SEM images of 3-D NSPs after depositing a-Si solar cell layers on NC 200, NSP 400, NSP 600, NSP 800 and NSP 1200, respectively. And the cross-section cut of these devices were obtained by focused ion beam (FIB) shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S4a ~ S4e</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S5a ~ S5f</xref> demonstrate SEM images of the NSP arrays before and after a-Si thin film device fabrication, with pitches of 1âÎ¼m, 1.5âÎ¼m and 2âÎ¼m. It is clear that 5 different NSP heights can be retained after thin film deposition. It is worth pointing out that Al is known to have higher thermal expansion coefficient than Si, it may cause cracks of a-Si film and failure of device. To address this issue, we have converted 100ânm of the Al surface to Al oxide via low voltage DC anodization (Method Section). This layer of Al oxide can serve as a buffer layer to mitigate the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch. In addition, we have observed that the a-Si devices fabricated on flat and smooth Al substrates are prone to crack and peel off, however, a-Si device fabricated on NSPs are much more robust, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S7</xref> This observation can be simply explained as following. In a planar device, expansion of the bottom Al substrate leads to stretching of the a-Si PV device atop which can result in film cracking. However, when a-Si thin film PV device is uniformly deposited on the 3-D structure, the strain caused by thermal expansion can be effectively released three-dimensionally.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>SEM of Al NC, NSP and thin film a-Si solar cell based on them.</p><p>(a) Schematic of multiple thin film layers deposited on NC and NSP for solar cell fabrication.

These three parameters are in fact tightly coupled in reality. Therefore, coupled optical and electrical property investigation of nanostructured solar cells is of critical importance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Herein, systematic optical and electrical characterizations on the fabricated 3-D NSP solar cells have been performed with experiments in conjunction with finite difference time domain (FDTD, Lumerical) optical simulation and semiconductor device simulation (Silvaco Atlas). <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3a</xref> shows the Air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5âG) spectrum integrated above-band-gap solar cell device optical absorption acquired after measuring the absorption spectra shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S8a and S8b</xref>. Obviously, the optical absorptions of all 3-D NSP cells are much higher than that of the planar cell which can only absorb about 64% of the solar spectrum. It can be also conspicuously seen that device optical absorption monotonically increases with the height of NSPs for pitches of 1.2âÎ¼m, 1.5âÎ¼m and 2âÎ¼m, with the optimal absorption of 88.8% for 1.2âÎ¼m pitch NSP device with 1.2âÎ¼m NSP height. This can be simply interpreted as the increased light trapping effect for higher aspect ratio structures. These results are further evidenced by FDTD optical simulation shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> in which the simulated integrated absorption in the entire device and in a-Si layer only, represented as <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub>, increase monotonically with NSP height. Note that the inset of <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref> shows the absorption profile in the 1.2âÎ¼m height device (other height device results are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S9</xref>), indicating that light absorption primarily occurs in the active a-Si layer, however, the absorption in the front and back indium tin oxide (ITO) is not negligible. Meanwhile, the fact that increasing pitch size for the same NSP height results in reduction of light absorption can be attributed to the reduced light scattering with large NSP to NSP distance at large pitch. However, device optical absorption for 1âÎ¼m pitch NSPs shows a maximal at 438ânm height. This is due to the excessively high material filling ratio for high aspect ratio NSP with 1âÎ¼m pitch, leading to high optical reflectance on the top surface of the structure, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S5d</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(a) AM 1.5âG spectrum integrated optical absorption of solar cell with different NSP heights and pitches.

However, this guideline may not be in harmony with the requirements for optimal device electrical performance. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3c</xref> plots the current density â voltage (<italic>J-V</italic>) characteristics of the best efficiency solar cells under AM 1.5âG condition of different NSP heights in pitch of 1.2âÎ¼m, with <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1a</xref> showing their detailed <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>oc</italic></sub><italic>, J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub>, <italic>FF</italic> and efficiencies. And the efficiency statistical data is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S10a</xref>. In addition, external quantum efficiencies (EQE) of these devices were measured and shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S11a</xref>. It can be seen that with the increase of the height of structures from NC 200 to NSP 600, the efficiencies of cells rise from 6.93% and reach the peak of 8.40% for NSP 600, which is 43% higher than that of the planar control device fabricated together. The same trend can be observed when comparing <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub>, which rises from 9.9âmAcm<sup>â2</sup> for the planar device to 14.72âmAcm<sup>â2</sup> for NSP 600 device. However, further increasing height of NSPs to NSP 800 and NSP 1200 leads to reduction of <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>oc</italic></sub>, resulting in even lower efficiency than the planar control device. The initial rise of <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> with height of NSP can be explained as the improved light trapping effect for 3-D structures. Nevertheless, loss on <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>oc</italic></sub> for structures with higher aspect ratio indicates that optical absorption cannot solely determine the performance of the devices. And this intriguing effect will be further examined with simulations later. Meanwhile, the <italic>J-V</italic> characteristics of solar cells with best efficiencies among different NSP heights in other pitches are plotted in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>, their detailed performance parameters, statistical data of efficiency and EQE are shown in <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S10b and Fig. S11b</xref>, respectively. It can be seen that the best performance for all four pitches can beat that of the planar control device, with the 1.2âÎ¼m pitch NSP solar cell demonstrating the greatest advantage mainly due to the enhancement on <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub>. And interestingly, it has been discovered that the best performance can be obtained when NSP height is ~50% of the pitch for pitch of 1.2âÂµm, 1.5âÂµm and 2.0âÂµm. However, the best performance for 1.0âÂµm pitch is from the device fabricated on 156ânm NSP height.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Electrical performance parameters of best efficiency solar cells on (a) different NSP heights of 1200ânm pitch and (b) devices with optimal height within different pitches</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2014_Article_BFsrep04243_Figa_HTML.jpg"/></table-wrap></p><p>Overall, the electrical measurements have shown that the NSP devices with intermediate height have the optimal performance and further increase the aspect ratio deteriorates device performance. In the past, it has been reported that excessive surface area for nanostructures may lead to performance degradation, especially for materials such as crystalline Si, GaAs, etc, which have rather low recombination rate in bulk but high recombination rate at surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, since a-Si is defective in nature with high recombination rate in bulk, the surface recombination may not have dominant effect on device performance. In order to uncover this intriguing phenomenon, we have carefully examined the structures of NSP device with different NSP height. As shown in the device cross-sections in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S4</xref>, it was discovered that for high aspect ratio structure, especially NSP 1200 device, a-Si film thickness on NSPs is rather un-uniform. Further observation from <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a1</xref> shows that a-Si at the top of the NSP tip and at the bottom in between the NSPs is around 280ânm, which is close to that of the other low aspect ratio structures. However, the a-Si film on the side wall of the NSPs is only 144ânm, which is ~50% of the expected deposition thickness. This observation can be attributed to the directionality of PECVD deposition leading to un-uniform coverage on high aspect ratio nanostructures. In fact, similar effect has been observed previously and it was found to be detrimental to photovoltaic performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. However, there has no clear understanding on the mechanism yet. Therefore, device physics was analyzed and modeled to facilitate understanding here. In experiments, ITO has been used as the transparent conductive contact to a-Si solar cell device. However, as it has non-ideal work function matching with <italic>p</italic> and <italic>n</italic> type a-Si, Schottky contact can be formed at the front and back side of <italic>p-i-n</italic> a-Si layers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4a3</xref> depicted a schematic of the band alignment of the device based on ITO work function of 5.0âeV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Due to the existence of the Schottky contact, <italic>p</italic> and <italic>n</italic> a-Si are partially depleted leading to a compromised building potential (<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>bi</italic></sub>) as compared to an ideal contact situation. In this scenario, reduction of <italic>p</italic> and <italic>n</italic> a-Si thickness may lead to more severe depletion in them and significantly compromise <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>bi</italic></sub> and eventually <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>oc</italic></sub> and <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub>. In addition, a-Si film thickness reduction on NSP side wall can also lead to loss of optical absorption which further hurts <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub>. Note that it has been reported previously on planar a-Si thin film solar cells that the thinner a-Si, especially <italic>p</italic> and <italic>n</italic> layers, can lead to drop of <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>oc</italic></sub> based on the similar rationale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. To confirm this effect on the NSP solar cells, device simulation with Silvaco Atlas was performed with the details described in Method section. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S12</xref> demonstrates the modeled energy band bending across the side wall of 280ânm, 140ânm and 70ânm a-Si thickness, respectively. Note that in these cases the nanopillar structure shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a2</xref> was utilized for device modeling for simplicity and the <italic>p-i-n</italic> thickness scaled down proportionally, with the top and bottom a-Si thickness remained unchanged at 280ânm. Furthermore, device <italic>J-V</italic> characteristics with 5.0âeV workfunction of ITO contact have been modeled and are shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>. It can be clearly seen that with the reduction of a-Si thickness, both <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>oc</italic></sub> and <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> decrease significantly, which is consistent with the above discussion. Beside, device performance with 4.8âeV and 5.2âeV work function of ITO contact were also modeled for comparison and the <italic>J-V</italic> characteristics (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Fig. S13</xref>) showed the consistent trend. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4c</xref> shows the device simulation results for the nanopillars with different height and with 280ânm side wall a-Si film thickness (spherical symbols) and 140ânm side wall a-Si film thickness (square symbols). Note that the un-uniformity was only applied to nanopillar device with 1200ânm height. It can be found <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> monotonically increases with the height due to the improved light trapping in the device when the a-Si film thickness is entirely uniform. However, when the side wall a-Si was decreased to 50% thickness (140ânm) for the 1200ânm height device, <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>sc</italic></sub> drops from 13.9âmA/cm<sup>2</sup> to 12.4âmA/cm<sup>2</sup> accompanied with a more significant <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>oc</italic></sub> reduction from 0.89âV to 0.69âV, leading to a peak performance for 800ânm high nanopillar.

The methodology can be also extended to rational design of other types of nanostructure photovoltaic devices, including nanopillar solar cells, nanocone solar cells, etc., which are being extensively explored<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, scalable fabrication for any type of nanostructure is of paramount importance for future cost-effective photovoltaic applications in large scale. As mentioned above, regular structures are preferred to obtain uniform coating of photovoltaic materials on the structures. Up-until-now, the most commonly used fabrication approach involves batch lithography and RIE which poses a challenge for low cost fabrication in large scale<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In this work, a roll-to-roll compatible approach have been developed to fabricate the regular NSP arrays in large scale. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> demonstrates the schematic of the fabrication process. Specifically, roll-to-roll nanoimprint is implemented by imprinting aluminum foil with a thin metal (Ni/Cu) foil nanoimprint master mounted on a roller. The metal foil nanoimprint master was fabricated with photolithography in conjunction with electrodeposition, as schematically shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a1 ~ 5a4</xref>. The detailed process can be found in the method section. Briefly, a squarely ordered nanohole array was defined on photoresist layers on a Si wafer by photolithography (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a1</xref>). Then bilayer TiW/Cu thin film was sputtered on the wafer (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a2</xref>) followed by electrodeposition of 20âÎ¼m Cu and 30âÎ¼m Ni (<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a3</xref>). Finally, flexible nanoimprint master foil was released, as shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a4</xref>. And <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5b</xref> show a photo of the as-made flexible metal nanoimprint master. Such a flexible master was then mounted on a custom-made roller system primarily composed of two parallel cylinder rollers, as shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5c</xref>. Then an Al foil was fed in the rollers for imprint as schematically shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5d</xref>. This nanoimprint process is apparently roll-to-roll compatible with much higher scalability as compared with the stamp imprint process shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. Meanwhile, it is worth pointing out that the solution based anodization and etching process have been demonstrated as roll-to-roll compatible as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Therefore low-cost fabrication of Al substrates with highly regular NSP arrays is feasible. To examine the effectiveness of this unique fabrication process, <italic>p-i-n</italic> junction a-Si thin film solar cell devices were fabricated on top of the NSP arrays with 1.2âÎ¼m pitch and ~600ânm NSP height, followed by encapsulation of the entire device into Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) for protection. Due to utilization of thin Al foil (0.2âmm) and flexible packaging material, the device showed appreciable flexibility. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6a</xref> demonstrates a flexible device with size of 2âcm by 7âcm. This device can be used to power up a toy wind turbine under the illumination of a table lamp (intensity: 25âmW/cm<sup>2</sup>), as shown in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">supplementary video</xref>. Note that Al substrate has a number of advantages over plastic substrates for flexible photovoltaic application. Al substrate allows PECVD deposition temperature up to 600Â°C, which is significantly higher as compared to other plastic substrate. Such temperature allows deposition of not only a-Si film, but also other types of films such as Copper-Indium-Gallium-Selenide (CIGS), CdTe, <italic>etc</italic>. In the case of a-Si, low temperature (~100Â°C) PECVD a-Si deposition needs to be performed on plastic substrates due to their low glass transition temperature, which leads to poor a-Si material quality and inferior performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. By using flexible Al substrates, the optimal a-Si deposition temperature on the rigid glass substrate (200 ~ 300Â°C) can be applied, leading to better device performance. The electrical performance of the large flexible solar cell here was characterized under AM 1.5 condition and compared with a planar control device with the same size. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6b</xref> plots the <italic>J-V</italic> characteristics of the two types of devices, showing 5.1% power conversion efficiency for the NSP solar cell and 3.7% efficiency for the planar device. This nearly 38% efficiency boost clearly demonstrates the improvement of performance with 3-D NSP structures at large scale. In order to evaluate the device performance variation during flexible operation, photovoltaic measurements were performed while bending the device with different angles using the set up shown in the inset of <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref>. The curve in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref> shows the efficiencies of the NSP device normalized with projection area of simulated light source with respect to bending angles up to 120Â°. There can be seen a marginal efficiency drop upon bending with the maximal change up to 7.4% for 120Â°. Besides, the reliability of the nanospike cells with bending cycles of 10, 100 and 1000 have been investigated and the results are shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref> revealing that the efficiency can remain over 85% of the initial's value after 1000 bending cycles. These results have demonstrated that the 3-D NSP solar cells have excellent flexibility and mechanical robustness which is crucial for future practical applications.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Roll-to-roll fabrication of large scale NSP substrate.</p><p>(a1) Silicon wafer patterned with double layers photoresist hole array.

This type of nanostructured substrate is an appealing platform for development of a new type of thin film photovoltaic technology. In this work, a-Si was used as the model material to demonstrate the effectiveness of the 3-D NSP arrays for thin film photovoltaics. Systematic experiments and modeling have shown that in general the NSP solar cells can beat their planar counterparts. However, proper structural design is crucial in order to balance photon capturing capability and carrier collection associated with the nature of contact and film thickness uniformity. In the optimal case, a 3-D NSP solar cells can outperform a planar device by 43%, shown in this work. Meanwhile, large size flexible solar cell devices have also been fabricated and their respectable electrical performance has been systematically characterized with various bending conditions. Meanwhile, there is still room to further improve the performance of the devices, by optimizing a-Si deposition conditions and quality of electrical contacts. It is worth pointing out that the technology developed here can be extended to other thin film photovoltaic material systems, including CdTe and Cu(In,Ga)Se, etc., to enable high performance flexible thin film photovoltaics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fabrication of three-dimensional nanospike (NSP) array substrate</title><p>Aluminum (Al) foil was cut into 1.7âcm by 3.5âcm pieces and cleaned in acetone and isopropyl alcohol.
