An economic and environmental evaluation of active distribution networks containing lithium ion batteries (Li-ion), sodium sulfur batteries (NaS) and vanadium redox flow batteries (VRB) was carried out using the EnergyPLAN software. The prioritization schemes of the combination of energy storage systems and intermittent energy systems were studied technically and economically based on some specific situations of the grid integrated with wind power. The results suggest that the technical and economic optimal intermittent energy-storage capacity ratio was 2:1 in predetermined energy system scenarios. Li-ion batteries storage system performed the best in critical excess electricity production (CEEP) absorption, energy saving and emission reduction while NaS batteries storage system was the most competitive among the three due to its cheaper costs.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Active distribution networks</kwd><kwd>Intermittent power sources</kwd><kwd>Battery energy storage</kwd><kwd>Economy</kwd><kwd>Optimization</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>17</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40565_2015_Article_148.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2015</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>27</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Systems</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Power Electronics, Electrical Machines and Networks</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>SC17</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="Misc"><p>CrossCheck date: 30 March 2015</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">Grid connection of large-scale intermittent power sources is an important method for power system restructuring in China. Energy storage systems effectively suppress the fluctuation of intermittent power sources and are therefore an important method to promote the greater use of large-scale intermittent power sources.</p><p id="Par5">However, the high cost of battery energy storage systems is one of negative factors for their commercial use. For example, the cost of batteries was about 20% to 30% of the total cost of the wind and solar storage integrated demonstration project in Zhangbei, China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], although the prices have already dropped a lot since building Zhangbei project. It is crucial to optimize the type and capacity of the batteries to reduce the cost of the energy storage systems.</p><p id="Par6">Currently, the economics of the power sources in an active distribution network are directly determined by the energy storage systems. However, it is difficult to evaluate the energy storage systems used in an active distribution network. The EnergyPLAN software can analyze and compare the performance of different energy systems, which are based on fossil fuels, nuclear fuels and renewable energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], with one-hour resolution. When the characterization of a reference energy system is completed by the EnergyPLAN software, another energy system can be quickly and easily analyzed through the model, which keeps continuity and consistency.

Distribution system operators (DSOs) have the possibility of managing the electricity flows using a flexible network topology. DERs take some degree of responsibility for system support, which will depend on a suitable regulatory environment and connection agreement” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Therefore, compared with a passive distribution networks, an active distribution network is a new form of distribution network, with a specific technical goal. It can achieve both energy efficiency and economic benefits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Energy systems based on active distribution networks</title><p id="Par9">The active and reactive power of battery energy storage can be controlled through four-quadrant power conversion systems, and used for many demand-side power management applications. For example, with a suitable control system, battery energy storage can reduce the difference between on-peak and off-peak demand, and improve power quality to increase the efficiency of electrical equipment which will reduce their energy consumption. Battery energy storage can also increase the application of renewable energy by reducing the effects of intermittency on the distribution network, particularly through active voltage regulation. Responsive energy storage systems, such as batteries, can also improve the system stability, by providing ancillary services to help maintain the frequency of the system and compensate load fluctuations and generator and transmission line outages. Especially, for large-scale intermittent energy networks, energy storage device systems can reduce grid instability caused by intermittent energy output, when controlled to achieve an appropriate dynamic response.</p><p id="Par10">There are many kinds of battery energy storage, which are divided into those most suitable for energy shifting applications and those most suitable for high-power applications, with different price dependence on the energy storage capacity (kWh) and the charge and discharge rate (kW). Currently, large-scale application of batteries is restricted by their price in comparison to the economics of their application areas, in this case the active distribution networks. Li-ion, NaS and VRB are three mainstream batteries in the present market, and they have distinctive features and advantages. Li-ion battery has the good features of high power density and no memory effect; NaS battery can discharge with high output power and large current; VRB is cost-effective for large energy capacity and very long life due to no chemical change and electrolyte. This paper evaluates the economics of the three energy storage systems in typical operating conditions and configurations of active distribution networks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Understanding typical operating conditions</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Wind resources in Chongming Island</title><p id="Par11">Chongming Island in Shanghai, China is assumed to represent the typical condition of intermittent wind power since it is rich in wind resources.</p><p id="Par12">The annual average wind power density of this region at 50 m high is 339.1 W/m<sup>2</sup>, which is much higher than 150 W/m<sup>2</sup>, the level normally required for wind energy to be extracted efficiently. In the island, the total capacity of wind power that may be installed is up to 1500 MW, and if the average utilization time of wind is 2000 hours per year (or 23% capacity factor), the achievable energy generation is 3 TWh per year or more, which would be equivalent to the largest wind farms in the world. Cost-effective development of wind power will occur where the average utilization time of wind exceeds 2000 hours per year, so that the generated electricity is greater than or equal to 1.2 GWh for a wind turbine with 600 kW capacity. When the average utilization time reaches 2500 hours per year, it may be economic to develop wind farms rather than individual turbine installations. In Chongming Island, the annual duration of effective wind is 8418 hours and the average utilization time is 2208 hours per year. In addition, the peak wind speed and peak wind power density both coincide with the peak period of residential electric load each day.

Therefore, the ratio of wind power and sodium sulfur battery energy system should be less than 2:1 in order to efficiently reduce the CEEP value. But for the lithium ion battery, the curve of CEEP also shows a slow decreasing tendency as the ratio of wind power and batteries changes from 5:1 to 3:1.

Proportions of wind energy between 0% and 100% were considered, the remainder of load being met by thermal generation, thus an energy system comprising 100% intermittent energy was included as an extreme case. The results show that the optimum ratio of wind power and battery is 2.5:1–2:1 for the three types of battery under certain wind capacity. The lithium ion battery has the strongest ability to reduce the CEEP, resulting in energy savings and emission reductions, but the total cost is much higher than the other two, which limits its large-scale application. The comprehensive performance of the sodium sulfur battery is best, due to its longer life, and its stronger economic and environmental benefits. Our work will continue to research complex energy storage systems including an economic benefits model, their applications, and their optimal power and capacity to meet the requirements of active distribution networks.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program) (No.
