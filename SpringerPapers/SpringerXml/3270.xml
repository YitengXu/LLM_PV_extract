The energy demand and the electrical price in a competitive electricity market are uncertain with stochastic values which are usually performed by a probability distribution function. Therefore, a stochastic mathematical model representing an optimal operation of energy hub is based on the objective function of minimization of energy costs (including electricity and gas). Several constraints such as energy balance, limited capacity of the transformer, air conditioners, gas boilers, absorption chillers, combined heat, and power and battery energy storage system are also incorporated into the model to guarantee the required specifications. The high-level algebraic modeling software, general algebraic modeling system has been employed to undertake calculations. Finally, numerical results have illustrated the efficiency and capability of the proposed models.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Energy hub</kwd><kwd>Mathematical model</kwd><kwd>Optimization</kwd><kwd>Stochastic</kwd><kwd>Uncertainties</kwd><kwd>GAMS</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40095_2018_Article_274.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>29</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2018</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>29</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Renewable and Green Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The energy internet covering all popular forms of energy (electric, thermal and gas energy) is an indispensable model in future. The model has been studied significantly and continued to be developed, because it offers many benefits such as high-energy efficiency and lower energy supply costs. The concept of the Energy Hub (EH) has been introduced in this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The power center is derived by the connection between the source and the load through the mixture of inputs and outputs of energy. The types of energy sources and storage devices are described in the form of matrices. This concept has promoted many effects on the planning and optimization process of the operation of the energy system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">Studies on EH in the energy internet in recent years are quite abundant with particular attention to the optimal operation of the EH in the energy network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The primary applications of the EH model are residential load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and industrial load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The EH model is developed primarily by a Combined, Heat and Power (CHP) architecture. CHP uses primary energy as less polluting energy, providing high-efficiency electrical and thermal loads. The current CHP model has been developed strongly all around the world. It is predicted that by 2023, total capacity will reach 483.7 GW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. CHP with various technologies has been introduced such as diesel engine, natural gas engine, steam turbine, gas turbine, micro-turbine, and fuel cells with efficiency up to 90%. In particular, the gas turbine and micro-turbine have many advantages such as less space, low noise, flexibility in control, high efficiency, and reduced environmental pollution and it should be used widely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Consequently, more researches on CHP applications in energy systems have been conducted. CHP enables the energy systems to improve their efficiency such as reducing energy purchase costs, improving energy efficiency and reducing environmental pollution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. At a higher level, the combined cooling, heat and power (CCHP) model was introduced in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] with the aim of supplementing the additional cooling demand of the system air conditioner (AC) or absorption chiller (ACh).</p><p id="Par4">Over the past decades, the electricity sector has made tremendous changes in business and administration. One of them is the process of restructuring the electricity market from the monopoly model to the competitive electricity market (CEM) model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In CEM, customers can choose suppliers and prices which vary in terms of time and market rather than fixed price over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It has a great impact on the planning, design, and operation of power systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Indeed, CEM has opened up the opportunity to introduce and adopt new approaches to increase the efficiency of energy systems. In particular, the energy price mechanism is one of the primary constraints in the optimal management of energy use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], a survey of 1000 households using a heat pump to optimize the demand for switching between electricity and heat, derived from fixed gas prices and electricity prices vary from time to time. The results show that in multi-energy systems, the household can be supplied without having to adjust the demand manually. Similarly, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] establishes a mechanism for minimizing the cost of energy use based on the electricity price factor through the CCHP model, thereby optimizing the need for heating in winter and cooling in summer of the system. Power pricing uses the time of use (TOU) schedule and the typical load characteristics of the load in terms of time are used. The EH model with random wind, electricity, and power tariffs is also presented in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] with a minimal objective function of daytime running costs as well as technical constraints of the EH.</p><p id="Par5">The load is a factor that is of a random nature, changes over time and the need to use it. Hence, there have been many studies on the random characteristic of loads through the Probability Distribution Functions (PDF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These studies mainly focus on solving the problem of operation and planning of the power grid considering the randomness of the load while assessing their impact on the economic and technical criteria of the power network. However, when considering the electrical power grid, especially the optimal operation problem, many studies have not mentioned this problem yet. A number of recent studies, such as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], present a new perspective on the ability to exploit multi-energy systems through EH, and the paper also extends some concepts of the uncertainty of the load and electricity price thus helping to regulate available energy sources within the allowable limits. Reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] examines some uncertainties then proceeded to optimize the energy output of dispersed sources and storage systems with the smallest total cost of the objective function. Although these studies have mentioned in detail the randomness of the load, it only considers electricity and heat loads, there are no studies to solve the optimal operations of the EH model while considering the randomness of all three types of load (electricity, heat, and cold).</p><p id="Par6">At present, optimizations and optimization methods are widely applied in many fields to effectively optimize the practical problems. Recent studies on the optimal operation of EH are approached in many directions with different objective and constraints. Tools used in computations are also varied, often using the advanced programming language like MATLAB, Fortran, Delphi, C++ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In recent times, the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) programming language has been developed and has widespread applications in the EH optimization problem. GAMS is capable of successfully solving optimal problems by solving algorithms built into the program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, this study uses the GAMS programming language to solve the optimal operation problem of the proposed EH model.</p><p id="Par7">From the above analysis, this study mainly solves the optimal operation problem of the EH model in the electricity market, taking into account the randomness of electricity and load factors to contribute to the improvement of the research perspective about the study on the optimal energy use problem in the energy grid, bringing the computational model closer to reality. In particular, the EH model is proposed with the ability to provide simultaneous electricity, heat, and cold for the loads. The model is capable of linking and exchanging between different forms of energy to select the optimum energy flow with minimum operating cost. The approach and problem solving are as follows: Firstly, the proposed EH model is based on the demand for electricity, heating, and cooling of the load. The structure and operational principles of the model will be introduced in Sect. <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref>. The randomness of the load, electricity price, and mathematical description will be introduced in Sect. <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">3</xref>. The optimal operation of the proposed EH model consists of the minimal objective function of the total energy cost of the system; the mathematical constraints which include input/output power balancing of the EH model, equipment conversion limits, power capacity limits of the system, and energy tariffs will be introduced in Sect. <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">4</xref>. The optimal operation problem using the GAMS programming languages solved in simulation result section. The optimal operation problem is considered in four specific cases to evaluate the random effect of the load and energy prices on the performance of the EH model.

A model that uses only one form of electrical energy is also less efficient. The demand for energy today is clearly different often designed in a systematic way and is mainly used which are in three forms: electricity, heating, and cooling. The demand for each type of energy varies widely during the day and is incidental. In addition, in the competitive electricity market, electricity prices often change over time, thus optimizing the energy purchase cost from the market by optimizing the energy flow supplied to the loads in EH.

If the number of states is too small, it will cause the large error. If the number of states is too large, the number of calculations is also very large. Therefore, a number of states in each time segment are chosen in accordance with the methods and calculation algorithms.</p><p id="Par25">The researches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] utilized technique choosing number of states depending on maximum and minimum values of parameters. The minimum value is considered to be the first state and maximum value is considered to be the last state. In this study, the above method is also used and it is assumed that the coefficient of loads (heating, cooling, and electrical) varies from 0 to 1. The step is adjusted to be 0.1 for coefficient of loads. Similarly, 0.1 also is utilized to be the step adjusted for the factor of electricity price compared with maximum price. Therefore, a number of maximum states in each component (electrical, heat, cold and electricity price) are 10. Thus, the maximum number of computational states per hour h will be 10<sup>4</sup> states.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Mathematical model</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>The objective function</title><p id="Par26">The goal of the problem is to optimize EH operating costs.

BESS storing electricity during low electricity price hours and transmitting at high electricity prices has reduced energy costs of EH. However, the above calculations with the load parameters and the electricity price assumed to be constant in each working hour have led to the errors, because loads are random quantities, as introduced in Sect. <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">3</xref>.</p><p id="Par53">When the uncertainty of load and electricity price is considered in case 3 and case 4, the load capacity varies in each computing state; hence, the energy flow in each device also changes. The energy flow in the operating state with a minimum load is the state 1 in the 3rd hour when the maximum load is the state 256 in the 19th hour, as presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. In state 1, the power consumed by the loads drops compared to the calculated maximum values in case 1, so the energy flow through the devices also decreases. The capacity of CHP is only 0.4 MW, the operating capacity of the GB is 0.11 MW, and the power purchased from the system reaches 0.86 MW. The entire demand for cooling is provided by AC due to low electricity price, which is similar to case 1. When considering the involvement of both BESS and the uncertainty of the demand and electricity prices in case 4, overall demand for cooling is still provided by AC, but the capacity received from the systems increases to charge BESS with the capacity of 0.15 MW in this period, corresponding to 17.44%.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Energy flow in cases 3 and 4</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40095_2018_274_Fig7_HTML.gif" id="MO23"/></fig></p><p id="Par54">At peak load, the state 256 at 7PM, electricity price reached the maximum, so all the cooling in case 3 and case 4 are both supplied by ACh through the heat with a capacity of 1.28 MW. The energy flow through CHP and GB is similar in both cases that are 4.0 MW 1.1 MW, respectively. Power capacity received from the system in case 4 decreases 0.15 MW due to the support of BESS.</p><p id="Par55">The calculation results also determine the charge and discharge capacity of BESS in both cases in each operating hour, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. During the lower electricity price hours (from 1AM to 3AM, from 10AM to 1PM, 3PM and 11PM, 12PM), BESS charges with a maximum power 0.15 MW corresponding to the maximum capacity. During the high electricity price hours (at 5 AM, 7 AM, 9 AM and from 5 PM to 10 PM), BESS discharges 0.15 MW back to the system. Due to the loss in BESS, the total power charged/discharged dropped by 0.15 MW, so the total power consumed in case 2 and case 4 increases compared to case 1 and case 3, respectively. The energy flow in GB, CHP also changes depending on the operating state as analyzed above.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Charging/discharging power of BESS</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40095_2018_274_Fig8_HTML.gif" id="MO24"/></fig></p><p id="Par56">The calculations in all states s, 24 h, in each day determine the energy required to purchase from the system in each hour for four cases, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>. In all four cases, the amount of gas purchased from the system increased during high electricity price hours such as from 7AM to 9AM and from 5PM to 10PM. Conversely, during the low electricity price hours, it can compete with gas, so the amount of gas purchased from the system is reduced and electricity increased.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Total energy input of cases in each hour</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40095_2018_274_Fig9_HTML.gif" id="MO25"/></fig></p><p id="Par57">Comparison of calculated results in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>a and c shows that energy purchased from the systems considering the uncertainties in case 3 always decreases compared to case 1, a minimum of 6.3% at the 6th hour and maximum of 11.3% at the 9th hour. In addition, the rate of electrical power in total energy input of case 3 always increases from 1.24 to 22% due to the impact of randomness of electricity prices.</p><p id="Par58">When BESS used in case 2 and case 4, it changes the energy flow received from the system in each operating hour compared to case 1 and case 3, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>b, d. In both cases, with the involvement of BESS, the power capacity received from the system increases during the off-peak hours and decreases during the peak hours to reduce the costs of electricity prices purchased from the systems of the EH. In addition, the maximum transmission capacity in the distributed system decreases due to the ability to adjust the load graph of BESS which may lead to delay in upgrading electrical equipment. The efficiency of BESS in adjusting the energy flow in case 4 is smaller than case 2 when the minimum loading capacity is only 3.33% compared to 3.71%.</p><p id="Par59">The total energy received from the system in all cases is also determined, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>. In case 1, it is 147.7 MW with the electrical power of 58.27% corresponding to 86.03 MW. When considering the uncertainty of the demand and the electricity price in case 3, the total energy received from the system is reduced to 133.4 MW due to the decrease in actual demand and the optimization of the power flow in all states. As a result, total energy has fallen by 14.3 MW (9.66%), with electricity falling by 23.2% and gas increasing by 9.0%. It shows that, given the uncertainty of the parameters, the total energy received from the system decreases compared between case 3 and case 1; this result is closer to the practical conditions.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Total energy input of cases</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40095_2018_274_Fig10_HTML.gif" id="MO26"/></fig></p><p id="Par60">When BESS participates in the optimal operation of EH, optimizing of the energy flow of CHP, AC, ACh, and BESS is achieved, the total energy purchased of the EH decreases.

The EH optimizes the energy flow and energy types in all four cases. The operating costs in case 1 is 10492.6$. When considering the uncertainty of demand and energy prices in case 3, the total costs of energy purchased fell sharply to 1205.4$ or 11.5% compared to case 1.<fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig. 11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Total energy cost of cases</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40095_2018_274_Fig11_HTML.gif" id="MO27"/></fig></p><p id="Par62">The BESS stores electricity energy at low electricity price hours and generates back to the systems during high peak hours, thus reducing operating costs in both cases. The total EH operating costs fell 0.4% or 45.52$ compared to case 1. The effectiveness of BESS increased sharply when considering the effect of the randomness of parameters and fell 1251.6$ or 11.9% in case 4. Therefore, the total operating costs of the EH, in this case, is only 9241.0$ per calculation cycle, 24 h.</p><p id="Par63">The test results show that the proposed model allows optimizing of energy flow in EH, thus reducing operating costs. Moreover, considering the uncertainty of the load and the electricity price, the net real demand of the system decreases, resulting in energy flow, the efficiency of the EH changes, and the response results are closer to the actual conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par64">This study addresses the following key issues:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par65">A more suitable model of EH with the diversity of the load is proposed. The model takes into account the BESS to increase operational flexibility and efficiency. Hence, the economic and technical aspects of the EH also are improved.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par66">The optimal operation schedules of the EH are calculated with the objective minimum of energy cost purchased from the system considering the uncertainties of the energy demand and electricity price. The mathematical model represents the uncertainties of three load types (electricity, heating, cooling) and electricity price. Two study scenarios have been proposed to specifically compare the differences considering the uncertainties in the model. The results obtained from hypothetical parameters show that the energy flow is optimized in all cases, states at the same time the technique requirements of the equipment also are ensured. The demand and total energy purchased from the system are reduced when uncertainties are considered. Therefore, the calculation error decreases and results are more suitable for real-world problems. The BESS incorporated in EH reduces the electrical energy purchased from the system and decreases operational costs of the EH.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par67">In this research, the EH model with uncertainties of the loads (electricity, heating and cooling) and electricity price is introduced to optimize energy cost. However, the renewable sources with stochastic characteristics (photovoltaic and wind generators) and investment cost of equipments are not considered. Hence, the above aspects should be further investigated in problems optimal planning and operation for EH.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work is supported by Thai Nguyen University of Technology (TNUT), Vietnam, as parts of a scientific project.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Favre-Perrod, P.: A vision of future energy networks. 2005 IEEE Power Engineering Society Inaugural Conference and Exposition in Africa Durban, pp 13–17 (2005)</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Geidl</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Koeppel</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Favre-Perrod</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Energy Hubs for the future</article-title><source>IEEE Power Energy Mag</source><year>2007</year><volume>5</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>24</fpage><lpage>30</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1109/MPAE.2007.264850</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moeini-Aghtaie</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Abbaspour</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Fotuhi-Firuzabad</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">A decomposed solution to multiple-energy carriers optimal power flow</article-title><source>IEEE Trans Power Syst</source><year>2014</year><volume>29</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>707</fpage><lpage>716</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1109/TPWRS.2013.2283259</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Thanhtung, H., Yongjun, Z., Thang, V.V.: Energy hub modeling to minimize residential energy costs considering solar energy and BESS.
