Synthesis of metal nanoparticles [like gold (Au), silver (Ag), lead (Pb), platinum (Pt), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), cadmium (Cd), and other metal oxides such as titanium oxide (TiO), zinc oxide (ZnO), etc.] by various chemical and physical approaches as well as the biological approaches mediated by number of microorganisms have been actively found. Plant-mediated synthesis approaches are found to be more reliable and economic route to synthesize these metal nanoparticles. Owing to the biodiversity of plant biomasses, the actual mechanism by which the plant constituents have contributed to the synthetic process is yet to be fully known. Although the feasibility of controlling, the size and shape of nanoparticles by variation in reaction conditions have been demonstrated in many studies. Conventionally, nanoparticles are synthesized by chemicals and physicochemical methods using several chemicals which later on become accountable for various risk due to their general toxicity, so that solving the objective biological approaches is coming up to fill these gaps. The plant-mediated synthesis process undergoes highly controlled approaches for making them suitable for metal nanoparticle synthesis. In addition, biological synthesis of metallic nanoparticles is inexpensive, one-step, and eco-friendly method. In addition, the plant-mediated nanoparticles are used as potential pharmaceutical agents for various diseases such as malaria, HIV, cancer, hepatitis, and other diseases. Including this some other relevant information regarding nanopharmaceutical products, companies that are involve in the manufacturing and commercialization process and their clinical trial status are also discussed. This review article gives an overview of the plant-mediated synthesis of metal nanoparticles, possible compounds, and mechanisms that might be responsible for the reduction process as well as the potential pharmacological applications, currently available nanopharmaceutical products and their marketing status.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p id="Par2"><fig

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par18">Nanotechnology is one of the most effective and novel area of research in modern material science. This field of science is developing day by day and is making a valuable impact in the life science, specially biotechnology and biomedical science. Nanoparticle exhibits completely new properties, as they contain specific characteristics such as shape, size, and distribution. A number of processes are available for the biosynthesis of nanoparticles for, e.g., reduction in solution, radiation aspired, electrochemical, and microwave-assisted process and recently via green chemistry route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The use of biological materials like plant extracts (leaves, flower, stem bark, fruit peels, seed, etc.), fungi, bacteria, and algae for the synthesis of nanoparticles offers a numbers of benefits of eco-friendlyness and compatibility for pharmaceuticals and other biomedical applications, as they do not require toxic chemical for the synthesis process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Biosynthesis of nanoparticles is more unique and reliable not only because of its less toxicity as compared to some of physicochemical production methods but also because it can be used to produce large quantities of nanoparticles that have well shape and size and are also free of combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The biological synthesis approaches may actually produce nanoparticles of a better defined size and morphology as compared to some of other physicochemical methods of production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">For the reduction of metal ions, use of plant extracts has been known since the early 1900s; however, the nature of the reducing agents involved in this method is still not well understood. Due to its simplicity, the use of plant or whole plant extract and plant tissue for reduction of metal ions has attracted significant attention within the last 30 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Use of plant extracts for making nanoparticles is quite simple and easy as compare to use of whole plant extracts and plant tissues. A diverse range of plant species has been reported for synthesis of metal nanoparticles. In plant extracts, some biomolecules are found which can be reducing metal ions to nanosized materials by a single-step mediated green synthesis approaches. In bioreduction process of metal ions, the plant-based biogenic reducing agents involve including the several water-soluble plant metabolites (like flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds) and co-enzymes. This is due to the fact that various plant extracts contain different combinations and concentrations of organic reducing agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Plant extracts may be act as a reducing agent and stabilizing agent during synthesis of nanoparticles. Process for making plant extracts is readily extensible and may be cheaper process as compared to the other relatively expensive methods based on microbial processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and whole plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Live plants can also be used for the synthesis of nanoparticles in addition to plant extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Usually, a plant extract-mediated reduction involves the addition of aqueous extract with an aqueous solution of the corresponding metal salt. Reaction occurs at room temperature and it is completed within a very few minutes.</p><p id="Par20">Due to the unique properties of metal nanoparticles like large fraction of surface atoms, large surface energy, spatial confinement, and reduced morphology make it significantly different from the corresponding bulk materials. These unique properties of nanoparticles make them applicable in the field of catalysis, agriculture, electronics, biomedical analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and even ground water purification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Gold, silver, copper, iron, zinc, and other metal nanoparticles are used in food packaging, wound dressings, catheters for drug delivery, and so on due to the broad range of antimicrobial effects. Silver nanoparticles are known to be mostly used in the field of biomedical science due to their great antimicrobial effect; zinc and titanium nanoparticles are known to be used in cosmetics. The second application area of biological nanoparticles is the formulation of biosensors for various molecules related to environmental factors and agriculture. In addition, nanoparticles are also used in gene delivery and cell labelling in plants and in medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Other applications of metal nanoparticles are still under research and in development, such as magnetically responsive drug delivery, photoimaging, and photothermal therapy. Nowadays, due to the physicochemical properties and the application of nanoparticles in many fields of sciences, scientific community decided to make extensive efforts to develop a novel route for producing nanoparticles. Although other physicochemical approaches cause environmental pollution by discharging heavy metals during synthesis process. Thus, the synthesis of nanoparticles using green approaches has the several advantages like non-toxicity, reproducibility in production, having easy scaleup, and well-defined morphology becomes new trends in nanoparticles synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In recent years, plants and microbes have found as new resources with considerable synthesis of organic metal nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this review paper, we review the methods of making nanoparticles using different plant extracts, possible mechanism of nanoparticle synthesis, and their pharmaceutical applications, and products available in the market their clinical trial status are also reviewed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Classical approaches for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles</title><p id="Par21">Nanoparticles are frequently synthesized by either top–down or bottom–up approaches. Top–down approach is based on the mechanical methods of size reduction by breaking down the bulk materials gradually to nanosized structures. Bottom–up approaches are based on the assembly of atoms or molecules to molecular structure in nanoscale range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the various methods for synthesis of metal nanoparticles. In top–down synthesis, nanoparticles are produced by their size reduction from a suitable starting material. This reduction in size may be achieved by various physical and chemical treatments. In top–down approaches, there will be imperfection in the surface structure of the product and is found which is a major limitation, because the surface chemistry and the other physical properties of nanoparticles mainly depend on the surface structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In bottom–up approach, nanoparticles are made up of smaller molecules for, e.g., by joining the atoms, molecules, and smaller structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In this the nanostructure, building blocks of the nanoparticles are formulated first and then assembled to produce the final particle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Both chemical and biological approaches of metal nanoparticles depend on the bottom–up approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In bottom-to-top approaches, synthesis of metal nanoparticles is achieved by chemical reduction method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. During this type of synthesis process, chemicals involved are toxic in nature and also led to non-ecofriendly by-products. Due to all these disadvantages of synthesis process, these are generally not employed for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles. Methods commonly used for the synthesis of nanoparticles are as follows:<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Different methods for synthesis of metal nanoparticles</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40097_2018_267_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Physical method of nanoparticle synthesis</title><p id="Par22">Physical methods of synthesis of nanoparticles include UV irradiation, sonochemistry, laser ablation and radiolysis, and so on. It is found that during physical synthesis process, evaporization of metal atoms takes place, followed by condensate on various supports, in which the metallic atoms are rearranged and aggregated as small clusters of metallic nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Using physical approaches, we can get nanoparticles with high purity and definite shape. However, these processes are usually required highly sophisticated instruments, chemicals and radiative heating as well as high power consumption, which lead to high operating cost.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Chemical method of nanoparticle synthesis</title><p id="Par23">Another method for the synthesis of nanoparticle is reduction of metal ions in solution using chemicals. On the basis of conditions of reaction mixture, metal ions may favour either the process of nucleation or aggregation to form small clusters of metals. The chemicals generally used as reducing agents are hydrazine, sodium borohydride, and hydrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Some stabilizing agents like synthetic or natural polymers such as cellulose, natural rubber, chitosan, and co-polymers micelles are also used. These chemicals are hydrophobic in nature, so that they require the addition of some organic solvents such as ethane, dimethyl, formaldehyde, toluene, and chloroform. These chemicals are toxic in nature and are non-biodegradable, which limit the production scale. Along with this, some of the toxic chemicals may also contaminate the surface of nanoparticles and make them unsuitable for certain biomedical applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this context to eliminate all these drawbacks of physical and chemical methods, scientists and researchers are focused on alternative process of metal nanoparticle synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Biological method of nanoparticle synthesis</title><p id="Par24">In recent years, biogenic synthesis process of metallic nanoparticle has attracted considerable attention. In biogenic synthesis process, the synthesis of nanoparticles is achieved through microorganisms and plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The biosynthesis may actually provide nanoparticles of a better defined size and morphology as compared to some of other physicochemical methods of production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It has been found that the microbial-based synthesis process is readily scalable, eco-friendly, and compatible with the use of product for pharmacological applications, but production through microorganisms is often more expensive than the production of plant-based materials. The main benefit of plant-based synthesis approaches over classical chemical and physical method is more eco-friendly, cheaper, and easily scale-up process for the large-scale synthesis of nanoparticles other than there is no need of to use high temperature, pressure, and toxic chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A large number of research papers have been reported on biological synthesis of metal nanoparticles using microbes like bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This is due to their reducing or antioxidant properties that are responsible for the reduction of, respectively, metal nanoparticles. In addition, it is found that microbe-mediated synthesis is not applicable for large-scale production, because they require high aseptic condition and special maintenance, so that the use of plants for the synthesis of nanoparticles is more beneficial over microorganisms due to the easy scale-up process, no additional requirement of maintaining cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Use of plant extract for nanoparticle synthesis also reduces the additional requirement of microorganism isolation and culture medium preparation, which increases the cost-competitive practicability over nanoparticle synthesis by microorganisms. Plant-mediated synthesis is a one-step process towards synthesis, whereas microorganisms during the cause of time may lose their ability to synthesize nanoparticles due to mutation; thus, research on plant is expanding rapidly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A number of synthesis process have been developed including chemical reduction of metal ions in aqueous solutions with or without stabilizing agents, thermal decomposing in organic solutions.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Nanoparticle biosynthesis using different sources and their possible mechanism</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Biomass</p></th><th align="left"><p>Possible mechanism of nanoparticle biosynthesis</p></th><th align="left"><p>References</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>(A) Plants</p><p> Leaves</p><p> Stems</p><p> Roots</p><p> Shoots</p><p> Flowers</p><p> Barks</p><p> Seeds</p></td><td align="left"><p>Secondary metabolites (alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins and other nutritional compounds) acts as reducing and stabilizing agents</p></td><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>]</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>(B) Algae</p><p> Macro algae</p><p> Micro algae</p></td><td align="left"><p>Polysaccharides have hydroxyl groups and other functionalities that can play important roles in both the reduction and the stabilization of nanoparticles</p></td><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>]</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>(C) Fungi</p></td><td align="left"><p>Reducing enzyme intracellularly or extracellularly and the procedure of biomimetic mineralization</p></td><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>(D) Yeast</p></td><td align="left"><p>Membrane bound (as well as cytosolic) oxido reductases and quinones</p></td><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>(E) Bacteria</p></td><td align="left"><p>The microbial cell reduces metal ions by use of specific reducing enzymes like NADH-dependent reductase or nitrate dependent reductase</p></td><td align="left"><p>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Green synthesis of metal nanoparticles using plant extracts</title><p id="Par25">Biosynthesis of nanoparticles is an approach that is compatible with green chemistry approaches in which the biomolecules secreted by the biomass can act as both reducing and stabilizing agents during the reaction.

In nanoparticle synthesis using plant extracts, the extract of plant is simply mixed with the aqueous solution of the metal salt at room temperature, so that these processes can be considered as a green synthesis approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The actual mechanism for the synthesis of nanoparticle remains the same for microorganisms and plants both.

throughout and their application is not investigated so much so far. Banana peels are examples of such a kind of abundantly available natural material. We usually discarded the banana peels, but recently, it is found that banana peel extracts can also be used for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles. Nowadays, researchers tried to utilize all these waste materials for the synthesis process. Gold nanoparticles synthesized by banana peel extract were found to be highly stable and have a size range of 300 nm, which is confirmed by the different molecular techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Similarly, <italic>Mentha piperita</italic> extract was also used to synthesize round-shaped gold nanoparticles and showed antimicrobial activity against <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. <italic>Coriandrum sativum</italic> (family: Apiaceae) leaf extract when exposed to the aqueous solution of gold metal ions resulted in the extracellular formation of gold nanoparticles with spherical, triangle, truncated triangles, and decahedral morphologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Synthesis of gold and silver nanoparticles has been successfully achieved using leaf extract of <italic>Aloe vera</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Obtained results suggested that the optical properties of nanoparticles mainly depend on the initial concentration of the metal salts and the <italic>C. sinensis</italic> extract. <italic>C. sinensis</italic> extract contains caffeine and theophylline which may have contributed to reduction of the metal ions and formation of the nanoparticles. Production of spherical- and triangular-shaped silver and gold nanoparticles using the fruit extract of <italic>Tanacetum vulgare</italic> was achieved by Dubey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. FTIR analysis of this revealed that the carbonyl groups were involved in the reduction of metal ions. It is also reported that the zeta potential of the silver nanoparticles has shown to variation when pH is varying, and a low zeta potential is recorded at strongly acidic pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Large size of nanoparticles can also be achieved by reducing the pH of the reaction.</p><p id="Par29">In another study, Banerjee and Narendhirakannan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] synthesize silver nanoparticles using <italic>Syzygium cumini</italic> seed extract as a reducing agent. They also studied their antioxidant activities. The synthesized nanoparticles have average size ranges of 93 nm. They also concluded that the green-synthesized nanoparticles have greater antioxidant activity as compared to seed extract of <italic>S. cumini.</italic> Similar work was carried out by Velusamy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and they reported silver nanoparticle biosynthesis using leaf extract of <italic>Azadiracta indica</italic> and studied their antimicrobial activities. The synthesized nanoparticles have size ranges of &lt; 30 nm and they were monodispersed and spherical in shapes. They also demonstrated that the synthesized nanoparticles have great antibacterial activity, which is confirmed by the degradation of test bacterial DNA. Results also suggested that the gum-mediated synthesized nanoparticles could be used as an antibacterial agent against a diverse range of clinical pathogens. It has been found that carbonyl compound of the plant extract plays a key role in the formation of gold nanotriangles by the slow reduction of gold ions (HAuCl<sub>4</sub>) with the shape-controlling effect of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Similarly, when aqueous solution of silver ions was incubated with <italic>A. vera</italic> extract, it produces only spherical silver nanoparticles.

Lukman et al.

It was found that the growth rate of particle is usually slower than the reduction process and also the nucleation of metal ions, which leads to the higher concentration of small size particles. Metal ions could interact with the biomass through the ionic bond with the bioorganic reducing agents such as flavonoids and terpenoids in the absence of other strong ligands.

The common techniques for the characterization of nanoparticles are as follows: UV–visible spectrophotometry, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">The UV–Visible spectroscopy is a commonly used technique among them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] in which the light wavelength in the range 300–800 nm is generally used for the characterization of metal nanoparticles in the size range of 2–100 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>].

However, different controlling parameters, such as metal salt concentration, mixing ratio of biological extract and metal salt, pH value, temperature, incubation period and aeration, still require optimization for producing homogenous nanoparticles of a similar size and shape. Biological synthesis approaches can also provide an additional capping layer on synthesized metal nanoparticles with the attachment of several functional groups which are found to be biologically active, which can enhance the effectiveness of metal nanoparticles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>].

When aqueous solution of auric chloride is treated with high concentration of NaCl, the size of gold nanoparticle decreases with increase in NaCl concentration, nanoparticles synthesized have size range of 5–16 nm, and those which were synthesized without the addition of NaCl solution have size ranges of 11–32 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. Chloride, bromide, and iodide have to be known to affect nanoparticle formation in plants.

When sundried biomass of plant <italic>Cinnamonum camphora</italic> leaf was when treated with aqueous solution of silver or gold metal ions at ambient temperature, it produces both gold and silver nanoparticles of size ranges (55–80 nm) which are spherical or triangular in shapes that could be attributed to the comparative protectable of secondary metabolites from leaf extracts.

Metal nanoparticles have emerged as a new drug delivery strategy for transporting drugs and gene through the nanosized delivery systems, because they have high surface area, low toxicity, and tunable stability.

Product forms by the interaction of silver and thio containing compounds where found to be highly active against several bacterial activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. Antibacterial activities of silver nanoparticles were found to be shape dependent. For this, Elechiguerra et al.

They disrupt the polymer subunits of cell membrane of pathogens. These nanoparticles subsequently stop the cell membrane and inhibit protein synthesis mechanism of bacterial system. It has been found that high concentrations of silver nanoparticles have higher permeability than those of lower concentration of silver nanoparticles and consequently rapture the cell wall of bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Antony et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>] reported that silver nanoparticles synthesized by <italic>Rhizophora apiculata</italic> show low number of bacterial colony in the text plate as compared to the silver nanoparticle-treated cell which is due to the smaller size of the particles and large surface area that induce increase in the membrane permeability and cell distraction.

Antibacterial properties of silver nanoparticles can be used as disinfectant to clean the materials and devices used in hospitals. Extracellularly synthesized gold and silver nanoparticles were effectively used in cleaning the materials such as clothes and some medical devices used in hospitals to prevent infections with pathogenic bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>].

Another study was carried out to study the effect of chemically and biologically synthesized silver nanoparticles on Gram +ve and Gram −ve bacteria, and obtained results were indicate that biogenic silver nanoparticles have higher toxicity then that of chemically synthesized silver nanoparticles. Suresh et al.

However, there are several reports available describing the possible mechanism behind its antimicrobial activity. It has been found that antimicrobial property of metal nanoparticles largely depends upon on several parameters including size, shape, and the surface charge of the particle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>]. Nanoparticles bind with the bacterial cell wall and can easily penetrated into it especially in Gram −ve bacteria, and then, they stop the protein synthesis, inactivate the DNA and the enzymes, and finally lead to death of the bacterial cell. In addition, nanoparticles also have large surface area for powerful microbial interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows possible mechanism of antimicrobial action of metal nanoparticles [331]. Activity of nanoparticles also depends on the morphology of nanoparticles. Pal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>] reported that silver nanoparticles with the same surface area but having different shapes can show diverse antimicrobial activity which may be due to difference in their effective surface area and active facets. Nanoparticles with triangular shapes show the highest antimicrobial activity, and this is due to that they have larger surface area-to-volume ratios and also their crystallographic structures. Due to their large surface area, nanoparticles accumulate on the surface of bacterial cell wall and enter by endocytosis. Sometimes, silver nanoparticle produces free radicals which may also cause the cell death of microbes. Because the free radicals have the capacity to damage the cell wall and the respiratory tract and make them more porous which ultimately terminate the microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>]. Another report leads to the fact that nanoparticles can regulate the signal transduction process in bacteria. In bacteria, signal transduction process is induced due to phosphorylation of protein substrates. It has been found that the nanoparticles alter the phosphorylation of peptides in bacteria. They dephosphorylate the peptides of tyrosine residue which causes the hindrance of signal transduction and thus leads to death of microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. The electrostatic force between the negatively charged bacterial cell and the positively charged nanoparticles is also another important factor for the antimicrobial activity. We all know that the Gram +ve and Gram −ve bacteria have different cellular membrane structures; most of them, they contain a -ve charge on their cell surface, so that the silver nanoparticles show greater antimicrobial activity as compared to Gram +ve bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. In addition, it was also reported that the silver nanoparticles interact with sulfur and phosphorus residues of the DNA and inhibit the replication of DNA and thus lead to death of microbes. Silver is soft acid and there are natural trends that soft acid reacts with soft base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>] and the sulfur and phosphorus are soft bases. Microbes contain sulfur and phosphorus to their cellular constituents and also the DNA is mainly build up of sulfur and phosphorus residues. The nanoparticles react with these sulfur and phosphorus of DNA and cell surfaces and finally lead to death of microbes.

The size distribution of liposome can range from 25 to 1000 nm. Most commonly used liposomes typically display a size range of between 50 and 200 nm. Liposomes are mainly used as drug carrier or drug-loading system for delivery of drugs. The hydrophilic molecules can be encapsulated within the aqueous internal space and the hydrophobic molecules are entrapped within the phospholipid bilayer membranes. To prepare the liposome suitable for therapeutic applications, their size distribution has to be controlled that can be achieved by passing them continuously under elevated pressure through membranes with definite pore size. Doxil is the first approved liposomal drug; in this, the PEG (polyethylene glycol) chains are present on the liposomal surface. PEG is encapsulated to phospholipids in the liposomal membrane through one-step chemical conjugation reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">141</xref>].</p><p id="Par82"><italic>Lipid-based nanoparticulate products</italic> Also known as non-liposomal nanoformulations. The uses of liposomes as nanocarriers have significant applications in drug delivery. Ambelcet and Amphotec are lipid-based nanoformulations. However, the electron microscopic images and other relevant data to support their unique ribbon and disk-like structure of these formulations occur to be unavailable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">141</xref>].</p><p id="Par83"><italic>PEGylated proteins and polypeptides as nanopharmaceuticals</italic> The physiological macromolecules like proteins, enzymes, and other molecules would already accept as nanopharmaceuticals due to their size alone. Nanoengineering techniques added some additional features and properties to the native macromolecules. PEGylation of biologically active macromolecules increases their hydrodynamic radius, prolong circulation, and retention time and decreases the proteolysis and renal excretion.

Soft tissue sarcoma are tumors which developed in soft tissues and joints and several other organs of the body like muscles, tendons, blood vessels, fats, nerves and synovial tissues. These are collectively referred as soft tissue sarcomas instead of their site of origin, because they exhibit similar symptoms and similar microscopic features and also share the similar treatment approaches and processes. Due to the heterogeneity of treatment of soft tissue sarcoma, the diagnosis and treatment of this cancer is challenging. Sarcodoxome is a non-pegylated liposomal product which contains Lipochromane 6. Lipochromane 6 provides stability to the formulation. Doxorubicin is entrapped on the wall of liposome which differentiates it from other conventional liposomal anti-cancerous drugs. It is also effective to treat the patient having advanced stage of sarcoma. It has been found that doxorubicin along with palliative treatments is the only therapeutic approach that is successful to treat the advanced stage of sarcoma patients. As compare to ifosfamide or dacarbazine that are conventional drugs, doxorubicin has been found to be superior to both of it.

The present review summarizes literature for understanding of biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles using plant extracts and their pharmacological applications. Synthesis of metal nanoparticles using plant extract is useful not only because its reduced environment but also because it can be used to produce large quantities of nanoparticles. In biosynthesis process of nanoparticles plant extract act as a reducing agents as well as stabilizing agents also. There are mainly two reasons to be explored in the biosynthesis of metallic nanoparticles, they are as follows: Firstly to identify the active metabolites of plants which is involved partially/fully in the metal reduction reaction and the second is laboratory scale production of metallic nanoparticles to extent their large-scale production and increase their functional mechanism against a wide range of pathogenic organisms.</p><p id="Par110">A detailed study is required to give actual mechanism of biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles using biomolecules present in different plant extracts that would be valuable to improve the properties of metallic nanoparticles.

Plants or their extracts can be effectively used in the biosynthesis of metallic nanoparticles, as a greener approach. By using the plants control over the size and shape of nanoparticles thought to be very simple and easy. Nanoparticles synthesized through plants have been used in various applications. However the actual mechanism of synthesis of such metallic nanoparticles using plant extracts is not fully known. Only a few clues are available like involvement of phenolics, steroids, proteins and reducing agents in the synthesis of nanoparticles. Nowadays elucidation of the mechanism of plant extract-mediated synthesis of nanoparticles is a very new area of current research. Hence the information available in this article may be useful in understanding in the mechanism of synthesis of nanoparticles using plants as well as it also opens the way for exploring other plants for this purpose. There is a critical need in the field of nanotechnology is to develop a reliable, eco-friendly and cost effective approaches for the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles. To accomplish this it is necessary to use natural bioresources like plants and microbes. Plants can be used as an efficient source to produce metal nanoparticles.</p><p id="Par112">The major advantages of green synthesis of nanoparticles are their application in protecting the environment, which is also one of the most important aspects in protecting the environment. We can also control the shape and size of the nanoparticles by varying in the reaction conditions. However the biosynthesis of nanoparticles by using plant system is still at its initial stage and currently still under exploited. The plant biomolecules such as flavonoids, reducing sugars, terpenoids, proteins and alkaloids are known to play important role during the bioreduction of metallic nanoparticles. However due to the complex nature of plant systems, more experiments are required to elucidate the synthesis mechanism so that a better process design can be implemented. Including this nanoparticles are providing a new direction to therapeutic strategies and providing a new hope for the treatment of several diseases. The success of nanoparticles based pharmaceutical products in clinical trials will thus not only boost future research but also provide a new therapeutic regime for some of the untreatable diseases, in addition to improved patient compliance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are thankful to Head, Department of Botany, GGV, Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, India for providing facilities to carry out the study.</p></ack><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par113">It is hereby stated that the authors have no competing interests.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gan</surname><given-names>PP</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>SFY</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Potential of plant as a biological factory to synthesize gold and silver nanoparticles and their applications</article-title><source>Rev.
