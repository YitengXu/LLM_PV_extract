TiS<sub>2</sub> is a candidate for being part of a range of future technologies. These applications are varied, and include supercapacitor and battery energy storage devices, catalytic substrates and the splitting of water. The driving force behind our interest was as a material for energy storage devices. Here we investigate a potential failure mechanism for such devices, namely oxidation and subsequent loss of sulphur. This degradation is important to understand, since these applications are highly property-dependent, and changes to the chemistry will result in changes in desired properties. Two approaches to study oxidisation were taken: ex situ oxidation by water and oxygen at room temperature and in situ oxidation by a 5% O<sub>2</sub>/Ar gas at elevated temperatures. Both sources of oxygen resulted in oxidation of the starting TiS<sub>2</sub> flakes, with differing morphologies. Water produced amorphous oxide slowly growing in from the edge of the flakes. Oxygen gas at ≥375 °C produced crystalline oxide, with a range of structures due to oxidation initiating from various regions of the observed flakes.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary" specific-use="web-only"><title>TiS<sub>2</sub> oxidation: moisture is the critical element preventing environmental stability</title><p id="Par2">The degradation dynamics of TiS<sub>2</sub> reveal that the flakes oxidise in water and atmosphere, pointing towards moisture as the key driving force. A team led by Valeria Nicolosi at Trinity College Dublin used advanced electron microscopy techniques to investigate the influence of different environments on the deterioration pathways of TiS<sub>2</sub>, a promising candidate for future energy storage applications. By comparing the effect of ex-situ oxidation by water and oxygen at room temperature, and in-situ oxidation at high temperatures, water was proven to effectively oxidise the TiS<sub>2</sub> flakes from the edges thereby forming an amorphous oxide phase. Conversely, the degradation was found to proceed more slowly in atmosphere or vacuum conditions. These results suggest that TiS<sub>2</sub> oxidation could be avoided in a desiccated environment that would prevent water molecules from dissociating in reactive ionic species.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>17</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41699_2017_Article_24.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Nanotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Surfaces and Interfaces, Thin Films</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry and Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Titanium (IV) sulphide, TiS<sub>2</sub>, is a candidate for applications in a range of future technologies, including catalytic substrates and the splitting of water, supercapacitors and energy storage devices. TiS<sub>2</sub> is a layered transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) with hexagonal crystal symmetry and takes the 1T phase and is relatively under explored in two-dimensional form. Each layer consists of three sheets of atoms: the two outer planes are sulphur, coordinated to three titanium atoms with a trigonal pyramidal geometry; the middle plane is titanium and each atom takes octahedral coordination to six sulphur atoms. These atomic sheets are stacked ABC (Supplemental Information Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), while the layers themselves stack AA in the 1T phase.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Initial status of TiS<sub>2</sub>. <bold>a</bold> TEM overview of TiS<sub>2</sub> flake, <bold>b</bold> HAADF STEM of region from A, from which maps C-E were acquired, <bold>c</bold> Ti L<sub>3</sub> EELS map, <bold>d</bold> O K EELS map, <bold>e</bold> S K EDX map</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41699_2017_24_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par4">The excellent capacitive properties of bulk TiS<sub>2</sub> (high energy-density and power-density<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> and excellent electronic conductivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>) have attracted interest since the 1970s, with bulk TiS<sub>2</sub> used as a cathode material in lithium-metal/alloy anode batteries, where lithium metal ions were intercalated, transferring charge to reduce titanium 3<italic>d</italic> orbitals and causing reduction from Ti<sup>4+</sup> to Ti<sup>3+</sup> (refs. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>).

We subsequently conducted in situ gas-heating and vacuum-heating experiments to try and observe oxidation in action, but decoupled from purely thermal effects.

Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref> is an HAADF (high-angle annular dark-field) STEM image of part of the TiS<sub>2</sub> flake, across which EELS and EDX spectra were acquired. Two regions were identified based on contrast levels and morphology—an outer and an inner region. Speckled contrast was observed in the outer region and to a lesser extent across the centre. This is indicative of fragmented pieces, suggesting the flakes are breaking down during the reaction to form a shell. A region of darker HAADF intensity was observed along the border between these regions – implying reduced thickness or mass. It is expected that the thickness of these flakes resulted in the retention of this inner region, due to difficulties in getting water molecules into the middle where the flakes were thickest. Thinner flakes would likely fully oxidise faster due to the relative increase in the number of layers near to the surface.

To minimise initial oxidation, the flakes were dispersed in anhydrous isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in the inert atmosphere of a nitrogen glove-box.

By contrast physisorption of a water molecule on a TiS<sub>2</sub> edge is quite exothermic ( + 0.76 eV). Oxygen could then either substitute for sulphur ( + 2.00 eV at the edge and + 1.98 eV at the centre of a nanoflake) or fill a pre-existing sulphur vacancy (the most exothermic at + 3.39 eV), both significantly more exothermic than the corresponding reaction with water (0.12, 0.11 and 0.21 eV, respectively).

During stage 1, sulphur in the outermost surface regions is exchanged with oxygen to produce the hydrogen sulphide smelled upon opening vials of the dispersion. This has previously been demonstrated theoretically,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and the mechanism reproduced in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>. Later, titanium in non-surface layers seems to diffuse out to react with oxygen, leading to titanium depletion within the core. The depletion region appears dark in both the HAADF intensity (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) and Ti EDX maps (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>), and is rich in sulphur relative to titanium. This would be consistent with the nanoscale Kirkendall effect, whereby atoms diffuse via vacancy exchange, with preferential diffusion of cations outwards over anions inwards.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> Reaction with water at the flake edge disturbs the crystallinity, generating Ti<sup>4+</sup> vacancies. These vacancies diffuse away from the edge as fresh Ti<sup>4+</sup> moves towards the edge to react with O<sup>2−</sup>, leaving sulphur to recombine and leave afterwards. The formation of the oxide layer hinders both the removal of sulphur and inward-diffusion of oxygen, leading to the formation of the depletion region observed. The apparent increase in thickness, observed from the increase in intensity in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, would likely be due to formation a less dense amorphous structure. This swelling of layers as they oxidise would serve to inhibit transport to the interface resulting in the slow rate of degradation of layers away from the surface, which would have the greatest impact on thicker flakes. A schematic representing this mechanism is shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>.</p><p id="Par29">We observed edge oxidation to be strongly preferential versus bulk suggesting that diffusion between layers is much faster than through layers.

There oxidation seems to result in the shrinking and crinkling up of the flake, albeit still with a polycrystalline structure. This could be due to large amounts of strain being rapidly induced in the flakes by the reaction. The elevated temperature makes all species more mobile, which is likely the reason behind both the higher rate of oxidation and the higher rate of sulphur recombination and removal. An alternative explanation for the striped appearance of the oxide is that oxide nucleates and starts to grow, dragging titanium towards it while expelling sulphur away. The sulphur-rich regions eventually combine into gaseous species lost into the atmosphere in the holder, leaving behind regions with much less material than those around the original nucleation sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par31">In conclusion, we studied the oxidation of TiS<sub>2</sub> in a range of environments using a range of advanced electron microscopy techniques.

The upper environmental cell chips consist of a heating element surrounding 30-nm thick Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> windows through which the electron beam can pass and the sample can be viewed. Material was drop-casted onto these windows for heating and imaging.</p><p id="Par36">The microscope used for Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> was an FEI Titan 80–300 S/TEM, operated mainly in STEM mode at 300 kV, with an EDAX EDX detector and a Gatan imaging filter (GIF) for acquiring EEL spectra. The convergence angle was 10 mrad, and HAADF collection angles were 39–200 mrad while EEL spectra were acquired with a collection angle of 21 mrad and an energy dispersion of 0.1 eV.</p><p id="Par37">Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> was acquired on a NION UltraSTEM operated at 200 kV with a Brucker EDX detector and Enfinia EELS spectrometer. The convergence angle was 27 mrad, collection angle of the HAADF detector 99–200 mrad, and EEL spectra were acquired with a collection angle of 15 mrad and an energy dispersion of 0.1 eV.</p><p id="Par38">The procedure for ex situ hydration of TiS<sub>2</sub> was to image flakes immediately after dispersion, then store the grid in deionised water between imaging sessions. The grid was dried in an Across International drying oven (V0-16020C3-Prong) at ~5 × 10<sup>−2</sup> mbar for an hour prior to imaging to remove as much excess water from the grid as possible, and then returned to DI water immediately afterwards. Attempts were made to re-image the same flakes, but build-up of carbonaceous contamination would coat imaged areas, retarding or fully preventing further oxidation. However, the range of flakes studied was broadly similar in both size and thickness, so reasonable comparisons could be drawn between them.</p><p id="Par39">In situ oxidation experiments have been performed using a Protochips Atmosphere system and a FEI Titan 80–200 ChemiSTEM equipped with probe-side aberration correction, anX-FEG electron source and four windowless SDD detectors. The experiment was performed using an acceleration voltage of 200 kV, a beam current of 600 pA and a convergence angle of 21 mrad. EDX spectrum imaging was performed with the specimen tilted at 25° to prevent shadowing of the X-rays emitted from the specimen by the specimen holder. In this configuration, two of the four (Super-X) EDX detectors were used for the acquisition, providing a solid angle of about 0.4 sr. EEL spectra were acquired using a GIF Quantum with an energy dispersion of 0.1 eV and a collection angle of 62 mrad, providing an effective energy resolution of 1.3 eV. In standard imaging mode, the HAADF collection angles were 62–142 mrad, while in spectroscopy imaging mode the HAADF collection angles were 60–190 mrad. The gas environmental cell holder was run with an oxygen/argon mix at 290–350 mbar operated between 150–500 °C. The holder had been modified previously, similar to the modifications reported for the liquid-cell holder,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> in order to significantly reduce the shadowing of the holder for two of the four available EDX detectors. The internal environment of the holder was shielded from the vacuum of the microscope by two silicon nitride windows, 30 and 50-nm thick.</p><p id="Par40">Selecting an appropriate sample size is a crucial step in designing a successful study. Electron microscopy studies were hereby designed to be representative of the sample. We based this study on multiple samples prepared exactly in the same way. Samples were individually screened at the microscope to make sure our findings were representative. Sheets thickness dependence is discussed in the manuscript.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Computational approach</title><p id="Par41">DFT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> calculations were performed with the <italic>CP2K</italic> package using the PBE (Perdew–Becke–Ernzerhof) exchange and correlation (XC) functional.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup><italic>CP2K</italic> uses Goedecker-type pseudopotentials and expands Kohn–Sham orbitals using a combination of a mixed Gaussian-type and plane-wave basis set.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> The atomic orbitals of the atoms involved (O, H, S, and Ti) were expanded in DZVP and DZV (double-zeta valence polarised and double-zeta valence) Gaussian-type basis sets, while charge density was expanded in plane-waves with a density cut-off of 800 Ry.</p><p id="Par42">An ideal TiS<sub>2</sub> monolayer was modelled using a hexagonal TiS<sub>2</sub> (1,1,1) 8 × 8 supercell containing 192 atoms, in which layers were periodically separated in the <italic>z</italic>-direction by a vacuum region 10.7 Å wide. A 4 × 8 supercell of TiS<sub>2</sub> was created to model a nanoflake, continuous in the <italic>y</italic>-direction and truncated in the <italic>x</italic>-direction, such that periodically repeated flakes in the <italic>x</italic>- (<italic>z</italic>-direction) direction were separated by 15.37 (10.73) Å. This supercell was created to be orthorhombic, replicating a (√3,1) rectangular unit cell over the primitive hexagonal unit cell. This nanoflake was created to study structural and oxidation properties at the edges, which were modelled with 50% S-passivation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> The structure of this edge was a zig-zag structure, with S atoms lying across the Ti terminal row such that the edge appears tilted. This has the effect of leaving the Ti atoms accessible to the oxidising molecules—gaseous oxygen and water.</p><p id="Par43">We determined the cell to be sufficiently large to be a good representation of the Brillouin zone at Γ, by comparison of edge geometry and oxidation energies between a 4 × 8 and a 4 × 20 supercell. Substitution of an O atom into the middle of the nanoflake was also performed to check that the same reaction energy was obtained for an infinite surface.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Data availability</title><p id="Par44">The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>E.L., S.O.′B. and V.N. wish to thank the support of the SFI PIYRA and AMBER grants, the European Research Council (2DNanoCaps and 3D2D Print projects) and the EU ITN MoWSeS project.
