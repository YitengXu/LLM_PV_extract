Large-area power sources such as solar cells and rechargeable batteries will be required for a long-time operation and there is significant demand for large displays. Thus, foldable device components are a key technology for the development of future portable devices that could be folded and placed in a pocket and then opened out at the time of use, like a newspaper or magazine.</p><p>Many electronic devices are manufactured on transparent, conductive substrates; such devices include displays and solar cells. The most commonly used transparent conductive substrates are doped metallic oxide glass and indium tin oxide (ITO) glass is used most frequently. However, present electronic devices are heavy and cannot be folded, because of the heavy and brittle nature of ITO glasses. To overcome these disadvantages, transparent conductive plastic substrates have been developed using carbon nanotubes, silver nanowires, or graphene instead of doped metallic oxides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. These transparent, conductive plastics have transparency and conductivity values as high as those of ITO glasses, but they do not have the high foldability that will be a requirement for future portable devices. Moreover, simple processes (not photolithography or laser etching) will also be required to fabricate transparent and conductive patterns on transparent substrates.</p><p>In 2009, we produced optically transparent nanofiber paper using 15-nm-wide cellulose nanofibers, which were nanofabricated from wood<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

Here, we report the processes used to fabricate optically transparent, electrically conductive nanofiber paper using 15 nm-wide cellulose nanofibers and 50 nm-wide silver nanowires. The nanofiber paper showed electrical conductivity as high as that of ITO glass and maintained its high conductivity after being folded many times.

In contrast, the nanofiber paper produced using 15-nm-wide cellulose fibers exhibited high optical transparency (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>), because the densely packed cellulose nanofibers did not produce light scattering either inside the paper or at its surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The nanofiber paper showed a high total transmittance of 91.4% at a wavelength of 600 nm (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>), a value as high as theoretically predicted values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. However, the optically transparent nanofiber paper does not itself have any electrical conductivity; therefore, high electrical conductivity was achieved here in the optically transparent nanofiber paper via the deposition of a silver nanowire thin film (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>).</p><p>Silver nanowires synthesized using the polyol process have diameters in the range 50–100 nm and are surrounded by the insulating polymer PVP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. When these silver nanowires are deposited on transparent substrates, they maintain the high optical transparency of the substrate. However, as-deposited networks of these silver nanowires do not display high conductivity, because the surface PVP prevents electrical contact between the silver nanowires. To increase their conductivity, silver nanowires on transparent substrates should be heated to above 150 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This temperature is too high for commonly used plastic substrates, but such high temperatures do not damage the transparent nanofiber paper. After the silver nanowires were deposited on the nanofiber paper and heated at 150 °C for 30 min (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), the thin layer of silver nanowires exhibited a low sheet resistance of 39 Ω/square and a high optical transmittance of 91.0% at 600 nm (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Mechanical pressing at room temperature can also be used to enhance the conductivity of silver nanowire networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Transparent nanofiber paper is a high-strength material, because it consists of nanofibers that have high mechanical strengths of 1.6–3 GPa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> . The silver-nanowire-coated nanofiber paper was subjected to mechanical pressing to further enhance the conductivity of the silver nanowire networks (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). In our previous study, silver nanowires deposited on PET films or glass substrates were exposed to pressures greater than 10 MPa to obtain low sheet resistances of less than 50 Ω/square<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Here, exposure to just 2 MPa yielded a low sheet resistance of 43 Ω/square in the thin layer of silver nanowires, with a high optical transmittance of 92.8% (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Because of the high thermal and mechanical durability of the cellulose nanofiber paper, these transparent and conductive nanofiber papers exhibited sheet resistance and optical transmittance values as good as those of ITO glass.</p><p>These two types of transparent and conductive nanofiber paper were fabricated using the following steps: making the transparent nanofiber paper; depositing the silver nanowire suspensions; and performing post treatments consisting of heating or mechanical pressing (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). As an alternative to these time- and labor-intensive processes, we also developed a simple procedure that did not require any post treatment (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>). First, silver nanowire suspensions were deposited on the silicon wafer drying plate. Next, cellulose nanofiber dispersions were dropped on the dried silver nanowire layer. These samples were dried and the transparent nanofiber paper was obtained by peeling the sample off the plate. As mentioned above, the as-deposited silver nanowire layer did not have a high conductivity. When a cellulose nanofiber/water dispersion (99.3 wt% water, 0.7 wt% nanofibers) was dried, the final volume of the dispersion was less than 1% of the original volume (after the water had evaporated). During the drying process, the drop dimensions decreased only in thickness; the spreading area was maintained. This anisotropic shrinkage had a mechanical pressing effect, thus increasing the number of electrical contacts between the silver nanowires, as Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. has also suggested<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. As a result, the obtained silver nanowire layer displayed a maximum transmittance of 94.4% at a wavelength of 600 nm (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>) and a minimum sheet resistance of 17 Ω/square. As a result, the transparent nanofiber paper had an electrical conductivity that was as high as that of ITO glass, without any loss in the high optical transparency (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p>Polymer solutions could also be dropped on the silver nanowire networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. When a PVA solution was dropped on the silver nanowires, the obtained film showed high optical transparency and high electrical conductivity. However, because the PVA solution penetrated between the silver nanowires (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>), the transparent and conductive PVA film had a high sheet resistance of 297 Ω/square at 95% transmittance. In contrast, when cellulose nanofiber dispersions were cast on the silver nanowires, the silver nanowires remained on the surface of the cellulose nanofiber networks (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Because the cellulose nanofibers were more than several dozen micrometers in length, they could not penetrate between the silver nanowires, which defined cavities with dimensions smaller than a few micrometers. As a result, the transparent and conductive cellulose nanofiber paper exhibited a low sheet resistance of 148 Ω/square, less than half of the sheet resistance of the transparent and conductive PVA film (297 Ω/square) at a transmittance of 95%.</p><p>The dropped transparent and conductive nanofiber paper exhibited high electrical durability in repeated folding tests (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2c</xref>). Because the silver nanowires were surrounded by hydrophilic PVP, there was a low adhesion strength between the silver nanowires and the hydrophobic polymer substrates. When a hydrophobic PET film with silver nanowire layers was folded four times, the conductivity was lost, because of the removal of the silver nanowire layer from the PET film. However, the silver nanowire layers on the hydrophilic PVA film maintained their conductivity after five folding cycles, as a result of the good affinity between the PVA substrate and the hydrophilic PVP. Notably, the silver nanowire layers on the transparent nanofiber paper maintained their high conductivity even after twenty folding cycles. The high electrical durability of the nanofiber paper did not result only from the high affinity between the PVP on the silver nanowires and the cellulosic nanofiber paper. Careful observations of the conductive nanofiber paper showed that the silver nanowires were entangled in the cellulose nanofibers (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). Therefore, the high adhesion strength against folding was enhanced by the dual advantages of the hydrophilic affinity between the PVP and the cellulose and the entanglement between the silver nanowires and the cellulose nanofibers.</p><p>This procedure produced not only high electrical durability, but also transparent conductive patterns. When the silver nanowire inks were printed on a drying plate and then the peeling off of the nanofiber paper (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref>), transparent and conductive patterns were fabricated on the nanofiber paper without the use of any etching processes. The transparent silver nanowire patterns on the nanofiber paper could be used to illuminate LED lights, as a result of their high electrical conductivity (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>). The LED lights could still be illuminated under folding and after recovery to the original flat form, because of the high foldability of the devices (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Operation of light-emitting diodes using foldable transparent and conductive silver nanowire patterns on transparent nanofiber paper (left: before folding, center: under folding, right: after recovery to the original shape).

We fabricated organic solar cells based on ITO glass with an active layer of P3HT/PCBM, their short current density was 7.89 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and their power conversion efficiency was 3.1% (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). In the paper solar cells, we used the transparent nanofiber paper instead of glass and silver nanowires instead of ITO electrodes. In previous studies of paper solar cells, the measured power conversion efficiency was less than one-tenth, or half, than that of ITO-based solar cells, even when the same active solar layer was used<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Our transparent conductive nanofiber paper had optical transparency and electrical conductivity values as high as those of ITO glass, as mentioned above. In our study, the nanofiber paper consisted of native cellulose fibers, which have high chemical durability. Therefore, they maintained their high optical transparency and high electrical conductivity after coating with acid PEDOT:PSS and P3HT/PCBM chlorobenzene solutions. Moreover, the conductive nanofiber paper did not have dimensional change such as wrinkle and shrinkage during a coating process, since it was laminated on glass substrate using a double-sided tape. As a result, our paper solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency of 3.2%, as high as that of ITO-based solar cells and a short current density of 9.58 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>). Moreover, we found that the nanofiber paper solar cells exhibited power conversion under folding and after folding. The nanofiber solar cells could therefore supply electric power everywhere, while (and after) being carried in a pocket or bag (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we reported optically transparent conductive paper produced using cellulose nanofibers and silver nanowires. The optical transparency and electrical conductivity of the optically transparent conductive paper were as high as those of ITO glass. Paper solar cells were fabricated using the transparent conductive paper; these paper solar cells exhibited a high power conversion efficiency of 3.2%, equal to that of ITO glass-based solar cells. Because of the high affinity and high degree of entanglement between the cellulose nanofibers and the silver nanowires, the nanofiber paper maintained its high conductivity—and the paper solar cells still generated electrical power—under folding and after folding. Moreover, transparent conductive patterns were successfully formed on the nanofiber paper via the printing of silver nanowires. We believe that this highly transparent conductive nanofiber paper will play an important role in future portable electronics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Nogi, M. <italic>et al</italic>.
