Thus, novel photocatalysts should be developed, which could store part of their photoactivity in “memory” under illumination and then be active from this “memory” after the illumination is turned off for an extended period of time. Here a novel composite photocatalyst of SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle-decorated Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanocubes is developed. Their large conduction band potential difference and the inner electrostatic field formed in the <italic>p</italic>-<italic>n</italic> heterojunction provide a strong driving force for photogenerated electrons to move from Cu<sub>2</sub>O to SnO<sub>2</sub> under visible light illumination, which could then be released to react with O<sub>2</sub> in dark to produce H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for its post-illumination activity. This work demonstrates that the selection of decoration components for photocatalysts with the post-illumination photocatalytic “memory” could be largely expanded to semiconductors with conduction band potentials less positive than the two-electron reduction potential of O<sub>2</sub>.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>16</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep20878.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>19</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Supplementary information</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep20878" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep20878</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Over the past a few decades, semiconductor-based photocatalysts have been widely explored for both solar energy conversion and environmental applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. It is generally recognized that various reactive oxygen species (ROSs) could be produced by photocatalysts <italic>in situ</italic> under proper illumination to disinfect microorganisms and degrade organic pollutants at ambient temperature and pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Most of these photocatalysts only functioned under illumination because their production of ROSs relied on continuous illumination to generate electron-hole pairs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, many potential applications require the continuous activity in the dark for an extended period of time.

Thus, if a photocatalyst could store part of its photoactivity in “memory” under visible light illumination and then be active from this “memory” after the illumination is turned off for an extended period of time, it could provide continuous solar-powered disinfection during daytime and at night to save lives with a high efficiency and relatively low cost/energy consumption.</p><p id="Par3">Recently, an interesting post-illumination photocatalytic “memory” effect was found in several photocatalytic material systems, which could be active in the dark after the illumination was switched off<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. For single-crystalline Se nanorods<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and semimetal Bi nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, a few charge carriers were found to remain at their surfaces and participate in the <sup>•</sup>OH production for their activity after the cease of illumination, and their activity in the dark could last no longer than 0.5 h due to the very limited charge carrier amount. For TiON/PdO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, Cu<sub>2</sub>O-NS/TiO<sub>2</sub>-NI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, and I-TiO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, however, photogenerated electrons could transfer from the light absorber component to the decoration component, be trapped, and then be released to react with O<sub>2</sub> in the environment to produce <sup>•</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> when the light illumination was turned off. <sup>•</sup>O<sub>2</sub><sup>−</sup> could subsequently react with H<sub>2</sub>O to produce <sup>•</sup>OH. Due to the gradual release of trapped photogenerated electrons, their activity in dark could last for more than 10 h, which is desirable for the construction of continuous solar-powered photocatalytic disinfection/degradation systems effective for both daytime and at night.</p><p id="Par4">It is generally believed that the redox ability of photogenerated electrons and holes highly relied on the conduction and valence band potentials of the photocatalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.

Their relatively more negative conduction band potentials also lowered the potential difference between their conduction bands and that of the light absorber components. Thus, it would be interesting to examine if a decoration component with the conduction band potential less positive than the two-electron reduction potential of O<sub>2</sub> (0.68 V vs NHE) could be effective to generate activity from the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the dark, which could not only largely expand the the selection of potential decoration components but also increase the conduction band potential difference to enhance the driving force for the photogenerated electrons to be injected from the light absorber component’s conduction band to that of the decoration component for their better transfer, trapping and subsequent release.</p><p id="Par6">As an <italic>n</italic>-type, wide band gap semiconductor with interesting chemical, physical and mechanical properties, tin dioxide (SnO<sub>2</sub>) had been extensively studied for applications in gas sensors, dye-based solar cells, transparent conducting electrodes, and catalyst supports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.

Thus, it could have the potential to serve as the decoration component in a composite photocatalyst system to trap the photogenerated electrons injected from the light absorber component, and release them in the dark by the reaction with O<sub>2</sub> to produce active H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to possess the post-illumination photocatalytic “memory” effect. In this work, we designed a novel Cu<sub>2</sub>O/SnO<sub>2</sub> composite photocatalyst composed of Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanocubes decorated with SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (Cu<sub>2</sub>O/SnO<sub>2</sub>), in which Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanocubes served as the main light absorption component for a good visible light absorption capability while SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles formed <italic>p</italic>-<italic>n</italic> heterojunctions of good contact with Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanocubes to serve as the decoration component. The large potential difference (~1.5 eV) between the conduction bands of Cu<sub>2</sub>O and SnO<sub>2</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, combined with the inner electrostatic field ξ formed in the <italic>p</italic>-<italic>n</italic> heterojunction, provided a strong driving force for the photogenerated electrons to move from Cu<sub>2</sub>O to SnO<sub>2</sub> through the heterojunction, which resulted in the enhanced photocatalytic performance under visible light illumination from better charge-carrier separation. The post-illumination photocatalytic “memory” effect was observed as expected for this composite Cu<sub>2</sub>O/SnO<sub>2</sub> photocatalyst, and the working mechanism was verified as the production of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by the release of trapped photogenerated electrons from SnO<sub>2</sub> to react with O<sub>2</sub> in the dark.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>The formation and morphology of SnO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticle-decorated Cu<sub>2</sub>O nanocubes</title><p id="Par7">The electron-hole pair recombination could be largely reduced in single crystal photocatalysts because they have much fewer defects compared with their polycrystalline counterparts, where the electron-hole pair recombination tends to occur<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a</xref> shows the TEM image of the as-prepared Cu<sub>2</sub>O sample and the insert in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref> shows the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern.

With high efficiency and relatively low cost/energy consumption, photocatalysts with the post-illumination photocatalytic “memory” effect could have the potential for a broad range of environmental applications which require the continuous activity in the dark for an extended period of time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Chemicals and materials</title><p id="Par23">Copper(II) chloride dihydrate (CuCl<sub>2</sub>•2H<sub>2</sub>O, 99%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., Shanghai, P.
