Those with fat malabsorption disorders malabsorb vitamin D and thus must rely on cutaneous production of vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is generated secondary to exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation (whether from the sun or from an artificial source). Light emitting diodes (LEDs) have been developed to emit ultraviolet radiation. Little is known about the efficiency of UVB emitting LEDs tuned to different wavelengths for producing vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in human skin. Ampoules containing 7-dehydrocholesterol were exposed to a LED that emitted a peak wavelength at 293, 295, 298 or 305 nm to determine their efficiency to produce previtamin D<sub>3</sub>. The 293 nm LED was best suited for evaluating its effectiveness for producing vitamin D in human skin due to the shorter exposure time. This LED was found to be 2.4 times more efficient in producing vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in human skin than the sun in less than 1/60<sup>th</sup> the time. This has significant health implications for medical device development in the future that can be used for providing vitamin D supplementation to patients with fat malabsorption syndromes as well as patients with other metabolic abnormalities including patients with chronic kidney disease.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>23</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_11362.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The beneficial role of ultraviolet radiation on bone health began in 1919 when Huldschinsky reported that children who were exposed to a mercury arc lamp showed significant radiologic improvement of their rickets several months later. He noted that exposure to one forearm of a child with rickets displayed the same radiologic improvements in the other arm not exposed to the mercury arc lamp<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. He concluded that something was produced in the skin that entered the circulation causing widespread improvements in bone mineralization in children with rickets. The connection with sunlight was made when Hess <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> exposed rachitic children to the sun in New York City from half an hour to several hours and reported significant improvements in their rickets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">It is now recognized that during exposure to sunlight, ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation between 290–315 nm penetrates into the skin and is absorbed by 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. This results in the cleavage of the bond between C9 and C10 to form <italic>cis-cis</italic> previtamin D<sub>3</sub>. The action spectrum for the production of previtamin D<sub>3</sub> revealed that the most efficient wavelengths were 298 ± 2 nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Once formed, previtamin D<sub>3</sub> is thermodynamically unstable, and the triene system rearranges into a more thermodynamically stable form, vitamin D<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The phospholipid bilayer of the keratinocyte cell membrane in human skin plays a major role in this process by maintaining the previtamin D<sub>3</sub> in a thermodynamically unstable conformer that causes it to rapidly isomerize to vitamin D<sub>3</sub><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> production in human skin depends on several factors. The size of the area exposed to UV radiation is directly proportional to the amount of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> produced; the larger the area exposed, the more vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is produced. For example, sunbathing in a swimsuit can produce an amount of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> similar to ingesting ~ 20,000 IU of vitamin D<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.

We found that the 293 nm LED, provided by Rayvio, was best suited for human trials due to a more than 50% shorter exposure time to produce the same amount of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> as the other LEDs. This LED was also found to be 2.4 and 2.5 times more efficient in producing vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in Type II and Type III human skin respectively compared to being exposed to the same amount of energy from the sun in a much shorter time. For example the suberythemal exposure of the skin type II to 0.75 MED from the 293 LED produced 2.3 IUs cm<sup>2</sup> (5.63 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>) in one half minute compared to a less than half the amount (0.9 IUs; 2.35 ng/cm<sup>2</sup>) vitamin D<sub>3</sub> when the same skin sample was exposed to the sun for more than 60 times longer time (32.15 min). Assuming an average adult body surface area 1.7 m<sup>2</sup> 
                        <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, a 0.75 MED exposure of the whole body to the 293 nm LED would generate 39,100 IUs. The Institute of Medicine recommends that for most children and adults their requirement is 600 IUs of vitamin D a day. This would translate into exposing 260 cm<sup>2</sup> (40.3 in<sup>2</sup>) of the skin surface to the 293 nm LED for approximately one half minute. This is compared to generating 15,300 IUs exposed to 0.75 M ED of sunlight. To generate 600 IUs of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> would require 666 cm<sup>2</sup> (103 in<sup>2</sup>) of the skin surface to be exposed to approximately 30 minutes of sunlight.</p><p id="Par20">Vitamin D production in human skin following sun exposure depends on the position of the sun in the sky, or the zenith angle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The amount of UV radiation reaching the earth’s surface increases when the zenith angle decreases. Moreover, the zenith angle depends on the latitude, season, and time of the day<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. As a result, the optimal times for vitamin D production in human skin is in the summer between the hours of 10 AM-3PM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However because time of day, season, latitude, altitude, and weather conditions can all influence the cutaneous production of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> it is difficult to obtain an adequate amount of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> from sun exposure without some guidance. Furthermore it is often unrealistic to be outdoors between 10 AM and 3 PM because of working schedules. Therefore, LEDs would offer an alternative efficient way of providing the user with a defined suberythemal amount of UVB radiation for producing their vitamin D requirement. These LEDs can also be developed for treating and preventing recurrent vitamin D deficiency in patients who are unable to absorb vitamin D through their gastrointestinal tract due to fat malabsorption syndromes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Another use could be in patients with chronic kidney disease. It was observed that patients with end-stage chronic kidney disease who were exposed to UVB radiation were able to improve their vitamin D status as well as increase their blood levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> and decrease their parathyroid hormone levels thereby improving their calcium and bone metabolism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. In addition, these patients required less erythropoietin to maintain their blood hematocrit and had significant improvement in their cardiovascular status<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">However, prolonged exposure to UV radiation from the sun increases the risk for non-melanoma skin cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. This occurs mainly due to DNA damage from wavelengths that are absorbed by DNA that lead to the formation of DNA damage products including cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Masuma <italic>et al</italic>. studied CPD formation after exposing rat pheochromocytoma cell line, PC 12 cells, to different UV wavelengths (250 nm–310 nm). They found that CPD formation to be highest after 250 nm exposure and lowest after 310 nm exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Thus, the longer the wavelength, the lesser the DNA damage. Furthermore, Felton <italic>et al</italic>. reported that suberythemal exposure to simulated sunlight in the UK was effective in raising blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (a measure of vitamin D status) while at the same time demonstrating enhanced DNA repair mechanisms that minimized DNA damage from the exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> suggesting that humans have adapted to sensible sun exposure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Although the 305 nm would have been thought to be the most desired due to its lower energy, because of the marked decrease in quantum efficiency, there was a more than 10 fold decrease in the production of previtamin D<sub>3</sub> compared to the other LEDs. It would likely require 10 times more 305 nm photons to generate the same amount of previtamin D<sub>3</sub> as the 293 nm LED. Therefore another advantage of the 293 nm LED may be reduced risk of skin damage when compared to exposure to sunlight or the 305 nm LED.</p><p id="Par22">LEDs can be manufactured with any desired wavelength that has a narrow range. It is possible to have an LED with a wavelength that can maximally produce vitamin D<sub>3</sub> more efficiently than sunlight. These LEDs can be used for different functions including vitamin D<sub>3</sub> production for patients with malabsorption syndromes. The LED can also be incorporated into wearable gadget devices to provide individuals with their daily vitamin D<sub>3</sub> requirement. Moreover, LEDs can be used for vitamin D<sub>3</sub> for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It has been showed that UVB exposure was superior to oral supplements in elevating serum levels of 25(OH)D in patients with CKD<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par23">The optimal range of LEDs emitting UVB radiation for vitamin D production was found to be between 293 and 298 nm. The 293 nm LED was found to be 2.4 times more efficient in converting 7-DHC to previtamin D<sub>3</sub> in human skin than the sun, thus improving its safety profile.
