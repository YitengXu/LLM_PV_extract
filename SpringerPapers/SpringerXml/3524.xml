The results of X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that the B atoms were successfully doped into the ZnO lattice, the incorporation of B led to an increase in the lattice constant of ZnO and a change in its internal stress. The growth mechanism of pure ZnO nanorods and B-doped ZnO sheet-spheres was specifically investigated. The as-prepared BZO/PET<bold>–</bold>ITO heterojunction possessed obvious rectification properties and its positive turn-on voltage was 0.4 V. The carrier transport mechanisms involved three models such as hot carrier tunneling theory, tunneling recombination, and series-resistance effect were explored. The BZO/PET<bold>–</bold>ITO nanostructures were more effective than pure ZnO to degrade the RY 15, and the degradation rate reached 41.45%. The decomposition process with BZO nanostructure followed first-order reaction kinetics. The photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy revealed that the B-doping could promote the separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, which was beneficial to enhance the photocatalytic activity. The photocurrent density of B-doped and pure ZnO/PET<bold>–</bold>ITO were 0.055 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and 0.016 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The photocatalytic mechanism of the sample was analyzed by the energy band theory.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>7223</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>13</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep42615.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>14</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Zinc oxide (ZnO), as a direct wide band gap II-VI semiconductor and a prominent member of the family of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) films, has been extensively investigated, which possesses excellent characteristics with a band gap of 3.37 eV at room temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, high optical transmittance, and outstanding short-wavelength luminescence. Also, the thermal ionization energy of ZnO is 26 meV, and its exciton binding energy (60 MeV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> is more than twice that of GaN (25 MeV), so it can realize efficient exciton-stimulated emission at room temperature, and has a diverse range of applications in devices such as blue-violet detectors, thin-film solar cells, and transparent thin film transistors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Intrinsic ZnO, belongs to a polar semiconductor, presents n-type conductivity and contains many intrinsic defects. At present, the electrical and optical performances of ZnO can be greatly improved by doping impurity elements into the crystal lattice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, which contributes to increase the electron concentration in the conduction band of ZnO, as well as improves its transparency and stability in the visible-near-infrared region. Abduev <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> detailedly investigated the effect of B-doping on the electrical properties of Ga-doped ZnO thin films, and found that the resistivity of B-doped GZO thin films decreased contrast to the sample of the un-doped boron. Tsay <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> reported the influence of B-doping concentration on the electrical and optical properties of ZnO thin films, in which the Hall mobility and electron concentration of the 1% B-doped ZnO thin film achieved 17.9 cm<sup>2</sup>/V·s and 1.2 × 10<sup>15</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>, respectively. The potential applications of B-doped ZnO (BZO) for using in diluted magnetic semiconductors and the transparent electrode of thin-film solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> have been widely concerned. ZnO is also a photocatalytic material, which can generate a photoelectron-hole pair under ultraviolet (UV) light at wavelengths below 387 nm and shows a good photocatalytic degradation in an acid or alkaline medium. Therefore, ZnO displays great promise as a high-activity photocatalyst<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">At present, most of the practical TCO films are usually prepared on a hard substrate, e.g., a glass substrate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> or a silicon wafer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. A conductive film prepared on a flexible substrate can not only retain the photoelectric properties of the deposited film, but also has advantages such as high flexion, low weight, and durability. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a semi-crystalline thermoplastic polymer possessing both high transmittance in the visible light range and outstanding heat resistance (200 °C) relative to other polymers, so it can be used as an effective flexible substrate material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, due to the rough surface of PET, and larger thermal expansion coefficient than ZnO, greatly hinder the growth of ZnO on PET. ITO (tin-doped indium oxide) film not only has a high transmittance and conductivity, but also can perform the function of a buffer layer to prevent the infiltration of water vapor and oxygen, as well as reduce the residual stress and structural defects in the film. Furthermore, ITO layer as a photo-generated electron collecting layer can enhance photocatalytic activity, and affect electron transport the same as MgO buffer layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, the properties of ITO films are unstable when it is immersed in a wide range of aggressive aqueous solutions and its performance are easily affected by the pH of the solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Besides, ITO-coated PET substrate requires low temperature processing. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust the growth parameters reasonably during the experiment process, to meet the needs of the growth of B-ZnO or pure ZnO nanomaterials and keep the properties stability of PET<bold>–</bold>ITO substrate.

Next, using a small ion-sputtering apparatus, a thin seed layer of ZnO was sputtered onto the surface of the as-treated PET<bold>–</bold>ITO substrate with the size of 2 cm × 1 cm to reduce the lattice mismatch between ZnO and the substrate. Among that, the surface resistivity of PET<bold>–</bold>ITO flexible substrate is 30 Ω/sq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, which is lower than that of the pure PET (60 Ω/sq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>), but higher than that of ITO substrate (14 Ω/sq<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>). Process parameters were as follows: sputtering time, 5 min; sputtering current, 6–8 mA; vacuum pressure, 0.1 mbar. With that, the PET<bold>–</bold>ITO coated with the seed layer was dipped into the as-obtained aqueous solution and sealed by means of plastic wrap. Finally, the device was transferred to an electric oven and heated at a constant temperature of 90 °C for 5 h, so as to develop the BZO nanostructure. After cooling to room temperature (defined as 20–25 °C), the product was gradually washed with distilled water and then dried naturally in air.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Characterization of the products</title><p id="Par6">The morphology of the prepared samples was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JEOL, JSM-6700F) with an accelerating voltage of 20 kV.

By comparing the XRD peaks in the illustration, the marked diffraction peaks are all characteristic peaks of ZnO, except for the two diffraction peaks at 47° and 54.6° that are attributed to the PET<bold>–</bold>ITO substrate. The peak positions of the pure and B-doped ZnO samples are in conformity with the JCPDS card standard (No. 89–1397), verifying the hexagonal wurtzite structure of the products. Differences in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> between the diffraction peaks show that the feature peak of the BZO nanostructure slightly shifts toward the low-angle direction comparing to that of the un-doped ZnO. However, the peak of ZnO grown on the PET<bold>–</bold>ITO substrate moves in a large angle direction in contrast to the ZnO powder without any substrate.

The diffraction intensity of <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1d</xref> is obviously smaller than that of <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>, and it is speculated that the B-doping deteriorated the crystallinity of ZnO to a certain extent.

It is generally believed that there are three potential mechanisms about B atoms doped into the ZnO crystal lattice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. One is to occupy the octahedral interstice. This is due to the fact that in the crystal structure of ZnO, O<sup>2−</sup> ions are arranged in accordance with the hexagonal close-packed, Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions are interspersed into a tetrahedral interstice formed by half of the O<sup>2−</sup> ions, while the octahedral interstice is produced by six O<sup>2−</sup> ions or six Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions in close packing. The eight faces of the octahedral interstice are triangles, consisting of six sides and two bottoms rotated 60° relative to each other. Since all of the octahedral voids are empty, in n-type ZnO with higher Fermi levels, as-generated octahedral interstices are most likely to be occupied<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In addition, the remaining two mechanisms are O or Zn atoms replaced by B, respectively. There is no doubt that the radius of B<sup>3+</sup> (0.02 nm) is smaller than that of O<sup>2−</sup> (0.14 nm) and Zn<sup>2+</sup> (0.074 nm). If the O or Zn atoms are replaced by B, the crystal plane spacing will shrink, and result in the diffraction peaks shifting to higher angle, which is inconsistent with the experimental results according to Bragg’s equation. Consequently, the B atoms are likely to occupy in the octahedral interstices.</p><p id="Par12">The XPS survey spectrum of the B-doped ZnO sheet-spheres indicates the existence of the Zn, O, and B elements, as shown clearly in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>. In addition, the weaker C 1 s peak at 284.87 eV is also detected, which might be caused by the fact that the sample surface adsorbed very little CO<sub>2</sub> in the air<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The binding energy peak of B 1 s shown in the inset of <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref> is located at 191.97 eV, meaning that the doping B atoms are in the trivalent state (B<sup>3+</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The atomic concentration of B in ZnO is calculated to be 8.69 at.% using element peak area and sensitivity factor. The peak at 531.27 eV corresponds to the binding energy of O 1s, may be ascribed to the characteristic peak of O<sup>2−</sup> in wurtzite ZnO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>.

Consequently, the diffusion flow is larger than the drift current. Electrons (holes) pass through the barrier region into the p- (n-) region, to initiate the accumulation of electrons (holes) and a concentration gradient at the boundary of the region. As a result, the electrons (holes) reflect as non-equilibrium minority carriers of p- (n-) region, diffuse from the boundary of the p- (n-) region to the inner region and form an electron (hole) diffusion current. It is justly because of the non-equilibrium minority carrier’s electrical injection theory that leads to the generation of forward current. The fitting of the I–V curve of the BZO/PET–ITO heterojunction diode at forward bias is described in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, which presents three diverse fitting equations with different forward voltage area. In <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, the relational expression between current and voltage (I = 0.52 V + 0.0037) is calculated in the range of 0 &lt; V &lt; 0.24, which can be regarded as obeying Ohm’s Law (I ∝ V). It is due to the concentration of electric injected minority carriers initially being relatively small, lower than that of the hot carrier; meanwhile, the hot carrier tunneling mechanism plays a leading role in the current transport principle. When the bias voltage increases to the range of 0.24 &lt; V &lt; 1.6, the I–V equation follows an exponential path (I ∝ e<sup>1.107 V</sup>), as shown in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>. Two materials with different lattice constants are closely combined together to form a heterojunction, which gives rise to the issue of lattice mismatch and the introduction of multiple interface states at the contact surface. Thus, the relation under the circumstances can be explained by the tunnel recombination model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. For the third area (1.6 &lt; V &lt; 2), the I–V equation follows a linear relationship (I ∝ V) again, but the slope (8.58) is much larger than that of the fitted regression line in <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, and this relation is possibly attributed to the series resistance effect. When the applied positive voltage is larger, the as-formed Schottky contact will assume a part of the voltage drop, which cause the following conclusions: Forward bias is composed of three sections, characterized by the voltage drop of the diffusion region V<sub>1</sub>, the potential drop of the barrier region V<sub>2</sub>, and a resistance voltage drop V<sub>3</sub>. Therefore, compared to the exponential relationship (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6b</xref>), the value of V<sub>2</sub> will be reduced and the corresponding forward current is slowly increased to approach linear growth.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The fitting of I–V curve of the heterojunction diode with a forward bias.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2017_Article_BFsrep42615_Fig6_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par19">When the backward voltage is applied, the electric field in the barrier region is enhanced due to the electric field direction generated by the reverse voltage in the barrier region which consistent with a built-in electric field. Therefore, the drift motion is strengthened, as a result, the drift flux is larger than the diffusion flow, further causes the hole (electron) in the boundary of the n- (p-) region to be driven to the p- (n-) region by the strong electric field in the barrier region to form a hole-diffusion current (electron diffusion current) under reverse bias. The minority carrier extraction leads to the reverse current. The reverse leakage current is unsaturated in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, which may arise from the following two reasons: (i) Since the band gap of ZnO is relatively wide and its intrinsic carrier concentration is small, the value of the net electricity generated in the barrier region is much larger than that of the reverse diffusion current, demonstrate that the net current of the barrier region plays a dominate role in the reverse current. Due to the width of barrier zone is broadened with increasing reverse bias voltage, the net current of barrier region will be unsaturated and slowly increased. Consequently, leading to an unsaturated state of the countercurrent during the whole process of reverse-loading voltage.
