A CdCl<sub>2</sub> activation treatment increases this to up to 22%. Studies have shown that stacking faults (SFs) are removed and the grain boundaries (GBs) are decorated with chlorine. Thus, SF removal and device efficiency are strongly correlated but whether this is direct or indirect has not been established. Here we explain the passivation responsible for the increase in efficiency but also crucially elucidate the associated SF removal mechanism. The effect of chlorine on a model system containing a SF and two GBs is investigated using density functional theory. The proposed SF removal mechanisms are feasible at the 400 <sup>∘</sup>C treatment temperature. It is concluded that the efficiency increase is due to electronic effects in the GBs while SF removal is a by-product of the saturation of the GB with chlorine but is a key signal that sufficient chlorine is present for passivation to occur.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Stacking fault removal and improvement in CdTe solar efficiency is known to be correlated, yet the nature of the relationship is not well-established.

generated by photovoltaic modules is an important renewable source of power. The impact of solar electricity generation increases as device efficiencies improve and costs reduce. Although modules based on silicon absorbers dominate the current market, second-generation modules based on cadmium telluride (CdTe) are the most commercially successful thin film technology with over 25 GW already installed. Recent advances in thin film CdTe devices, notably the inclusion of selenium as an alloy at the front of the cell, has led to a sharp increase in module efficiency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, despite the impressive advances made, the conversion efficiency of thin film CdTe solar has the potential for further significant improvement because performance is still well short of the Shockley-Queisser theoretical limit, due mainly to the Voltage deficit. Further enhancement in device efficiency depends on an improved understanding of how these polycrystalline materials work and in particular how the detailed microstructure affects the electrical performance.</p><p id="Par4">As-deposited thin film CdTe solar cells have a poor conversion efficiency typically &lt;5% unless deposited at unusually high temperatures. Here, we show a cross-sectional image of an as-deposited device using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a. The CdTe absorber was deposited by close spaced sublimation (CSS). A notable feature of this image is the high density of stacking faults that appear as parallel lines the grain marked ‘A’<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The stacking faults terminate at grain boundaries on either side of the grain and can be seen both in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and in the high-resolution TEM image of Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>TEM/EDX/NanoSIMS images of Cl-treated CdTe.</title><p><bold>a</bold> TEM image of activated CdTe showing grain boundary/interior structures. <bold>b</bold> Same region as in <bold>a</bold> with EDX mapping post-treatment CdTe with Cl shown in red; the Cl concentration is high in the grain boundaries compared to bulk. <bold>c</bold> Low-resolution TEM image of treated CdTe with EDX mapping of Cl atoms shown to have heavily segregated to the grain boundaries and interfaces. <bold>d</bold><sup>35</sup>Cl<sup>−</sup> NanoSIMS signal distribution on the back surface of the CdTe absorber showing Cl segregation at grain boundaries after CdCl<sub>2</sub> activation.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2021_25063_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Low-resolution cross-sectional TEM of a CdTe layer.</title><p>A TEM image of a cross-section of thin film photovoltaic device after a partial activation treatment with cadmium chloride.

In this process, CdCl<sub>2</sub> is deposited on the surface of the device held at a high temperature typically 400–430 °C for about 20 min. This process is used universally in research laboratories and in CdTe solar module manufacturing. During the process, chlorine rapidly diffuses along the grain boundaries and accumulates both there and at the device junction. The traditional n type buffer layer has been cadmium sulphide (CdS) and in this material the chlorine also diffuses along CdS grain boundaries and then accumulates along the interface with the transparent conductor (Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO)) as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c. It is not observed to penetrate the FTO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The CdS buffer layer in recently improved devices has been replaced with wide-band-gap metal-oxides such as magnesium-doped zinc oxide (MZO) to reduce optical absorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The chlorine does not decorate the MZO grain boundaries to the same extent and the chlorine accumulates mainly at the interface with the CdSeTe absorber. Although the chlorine has been observed in the grain interiors, it is mostly tightly bound to the CdSeTe or CdTe grain boundaries as shown in the TEM/EDX/NanoSIMS image in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b–d. This tight segregation has been confirmed in computational work which showed that both interstitial and substitutional chlorine atoms were 2 and 1 eV more stable at the boundaries, respectively, than in the bulk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">The chlorine activation process causes a number of changes to the microstructure and improves the electrical performance. However, recrystallisation is minimal and little grain growth is observed following CdCl<sub>2</sub> activation on CdTe deposited with high-temperature deposition processes such as CSS, which is typically conducted at &gt;500 °C compared to the lower temperature CdCl<sub>2</sub> process of 400–450 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">A previous study had been carried out to distinguish the effects of temperature and chlorine on the CdTe microstructure, which showed that while some reduction in the stacking fault density could be achieved with annealing only; the presence of chlorine was required for their complete and concerted elimination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par8">Further and conclusive evidence was obtained in another study in which previously CdCl<sub>2</sub> activated cells were annealed at temperatures above that used in the CdCl<sub>2</sub> treatment, i.e. &gt;420 °C. TEM images showed that the stacking faults terminating at grain boundaries were restored and corresponding EDX maps showed that the chlorine had been removed from the grain boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. This proved a direct link between the presence of stacking faults and the presence of chlorine in the grain boundaries.</p><p id="Par9">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows cross-sectional TEM images of a CdTe layer, which has undergone partial CdCl<sub>2</sub> treatment. Stacking faults can be seen as parallel lines running throughout the grain interior. Adjacent grains appear to be in two distinct states of stacking fault removal; either a high density of stacking fault layers can be seen or the grain is clean of these planar defects. These images suggest a stacking fault removal mechanism throughout a grain interior starting at adjacent grain boundaries where there is a local build up of chlorine. This implies that this build up of chlorine at an adjacent grain boundary is key to the removal of stacking faults in each individual grain where the resultant atomic structure can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b after the high-temperature chlorine treatment.</p><p id="Par10">The atomic scale mechanisms responsible for grain boundary passivation and stacking fault removal caused by the cadmium chloride treatment are still poorly understood. A DFT study of the electrical properties of stacking faults in CdTe showed that a range of intrinsic and extrinsic stacking fault arrangements are possible and that the high energy types, such as the polytype fault, would act as hole traps<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. However high-resolution TEM experiments have shown that the stacking faults in as-deposited CdTe are predominantly tetrahedral faults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> which DFT calculations have shown to be electrically benign<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> confirming that the removal of stacking faults is not directly responsible for the efficiency increase.</p><p id="Par11">The most common tetrahedral fault occurring in CdTe is termed an intrinsic tetrahedral stacking fault<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. A schematic for this type of fault is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. This fault is usually described as having two adjacent structure reflections and results in a local wurtzite structure in the otherwise zinc-blende lattice. It has been estimated from TEM images that 48% of layers in as-deposited CdTe have an intrinsic tetrahedral stacking fault structure with the majority of these terminating at grain boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Intrinsic tetrahedral stacking fault.</title><p><bold>a</bold> HRTEM image showing an Intrinsic Tetrahedral stacking fault<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. <bold>b</bold> Schematic of this type of fault. Cd: Blue, Te: Red.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2021_25063_Fig4_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par12">The removal of such stacking faults during the chlorine treatment does not contribute to the efficiency increase of the cell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Polytype stacking faults are shown to be detrimental to cell performance but these are not likely to form in significant numbers, due to having ≃30 times the defect energy compared to other stacking fault types<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. With few observations of polytype faults<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, the stacking fault removal process via the chlorine treatment is likely to be a mechanical by-product of a separate effect caused by the introduction of chlorine, which improves the efficiency.</p><p id="Par13">It has recently been shown that grain boundaries in as-deposited CdTe create cross-boundary Te–Te interactions, which cause electronic defects in these regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. These defects can increase electronic recombination causing the low efficiency of the as-deposited cell. This work also showed that if a single chlorine atom were to be present at either interstitial or substitutional sites in an isolated grain boundary structure both would result in defect passivation. If the same were true when many chlorine atoms were present, this would explain the efficiency increase of the CdTe solar cells after the chlorine treatment.</p><p id="Par14">In this paper, we report on a detailed investigation into the relationship between conversion efficiency, grain boundary passivation with chlorine and the removal of planar defects. This work is a step change because it considers the effect of chlorine saturation in a model system consisting of a stacking fault terminating at two grain boundaries.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><p id="Par15">The model system consists of two intrinsic tetrahedral stacking faults between two Σ3 (112) grain boundaries, types commonly observed in TEM studies, one having a Cd- and the other having a Te-core. Before the addition of chlorine, 154 Cd and Te atoms were arranged in a system approximately 4.57 × 62.08 × 18.72 Å with periodic boundary conditions applied in all directions. The system length was methodically increased to 62.08 Å when the defect formation energy of a chlorine defect plateaued in the centre to give a bulk-like environment. The 4.57 Å thickness means effectively 1 atomic layer. Detailed studies of chlorine segregation to the grain boundaries can be found elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.

Large reconstructions have occurred in both cores compared to the clean structures. The grain interiors remain chlorine-free and bulk-like but exhibit the same slight tilting seen with stacking fault removal without chlorine. It is worth pointing out that because of the periodic boundaries, the structure shown consists of two stacking faults, one between the grain boundary structures and one that wraps around through the periodic boundaries, these are both highlighted in the black rectangles of Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a.</p><p id="Par24">Different states along the pathway are also shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>.

The result of the first of these movements can be seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>c. The stacking fault has only been removed in the region indicated by the rectangle but remains in the rest of the grain interior. Remarkably, this structure is similar to one that has been imaged experimentally by Chen Li et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> finding that mid-grain dislocations create a mid-grain stacking fault terminating at Cd/Te dislocations. However, they were not able to elucidate the whole removal mechanism from this image alone nor do they have information on the saturation of chlorine that triggers this removal mechanism. In our example, the role of the Te dislocation is played by the Te-core grain boundary and a Cd dislocation has been created within the grain, indicated by the blue circle.</p><p id="Par26">Subsequent barriers from image 15 to image 25 represent the cascading removal of the stacking fault via Te diffusing along the stacking fault layer.

Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>d shows the result of this cascading Te mechanism, each transition having a small ≃0.4 eV energy barrier. When the cascade reaches the middle of the grain interior the system energy plateaus.

This occurs through a Te cascade mechanism that is triggered when the grain boundaries are saturated by chlorine. The process is demonstrated experimentally through high-resolution electron microscopy and nanoSIMS images, which clearly show the grain boundaries decorated with chlorine after the stacking fault removal. It is further shown that the grain boundaries saturated by both interstitial and substitutional chlorine remove defects in the band gap. Therefore concluding that the stacking fault removal is a by-product of the chlorine treatment and that the improved cell efficiency observed after the treatment is due to electronic defect suppression in the grain boundaries, solving the mystery of why and how chlorine is so effective in improving the CdTe cell efficiency. The removal of stacking faults is a useful but indirect, indicator that chlorine in the grain boundary has reached a sufficient concentration to passivate otherwise harmful defects. The fact that cell efficiency is always poor when stacking faults are present, means that the SF removal is a key signal that there is sufficient chlorine in the grain boundaries for passivation to occur.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par36">To keep the structures size to a minimum for NEB and minimisation operations, only a single CdTe unit thickness is used for the cell depth.
