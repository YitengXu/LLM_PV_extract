The decentralized power system has been applied and interconnected to the system and accounting to the renewable energy mix, energy storage and distribution. A decentralized hybrid renewable energy system can be of much help in providing a deficit of power between energy generation and demand where a single renewable energy system is not sustainable and reliable. The aim of this study was to characterize the biomass, perform the biomethane potential test of the biomass, select suitable bio-digester using multi-criteria decision analysis, carry out simulation-modelling of the solar-anaerobic digestion system in achieving energy self-efficiency with the development of the dynamic models that of climatic condition, social-economic and technology feasible. The performance of the system was designed and optimised to get maximum output power and mitigation of the environment at a lower cost. The performance was analysed based on present cost, locally availability, environmentally friendly, cost of energy on the local tariffs, load satisfaction, fuel consumption savings, operation and maintenance cost, human and technology capital and pollutants saving rates. The results showed major energy consummation from the solar-biodigester system, technology solutions that maximize energy efficiency and reduce the heat loss in the AD process. Waste to energy (WtE) technology coupled with the solar system could be viewed as key to sustainable, affordable and clean electricity generation.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bioenergy</kwd><kwd>Bio-digester</kwd><kwd>Biomass</kwd><kwd>Decentralized</kwd><kwd>Integration</kwd><kwd>Solar energy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Johannesburg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/10668_2023_Article_3322.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Environment</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Sustainable Development</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Management</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Environmental Economics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Ecology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Economic Growth</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Economic Geology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Earth and Environmental Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par111">The energy consumption globally is experiencing a drastic increase in developing and developed countries due to industrialization and technological development with population growth. The disruption in the industry 4.0 is heavily dependent on the energy through the conventional sources that are not renewable and the emissions that have direct negative impacts on the climate change and environment through the greenhouse gases (GHG), carbon, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide and unburnt hydrocarbon emissions. These gases contribute to global warming by increasing the temperature to above 3–6 °C of the pre-industrial levels (Anthony Njuguna Matheri et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>; Njuguna Matheri et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>; Rezzouk &amp; Mellit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>). The United Nation Climate Change Conference (COP25), sustainable development goals-SDGs (ensuring reliable, affordable and sustainable energy for the people) and COP26 are the fundamental climate action initiatives addressing the need to move towards fully renewable, sustainable and low-cost energy system. Air, ice, land and water pollution are seeing a higher reduction across the globe and particularly China’s Industrial heartlands and Europe with crackdown of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Natural wildlife is returning home and adoption of the sustainable business processes, fintech, blockchain, artificial intelligence, hybrid of working from home and office taking shape due to COVID-19 disruption. This is initiated with low number of planes, cars, heavy and lower commercial vehicle, the heavy polluting industries in operations due to government regulations to curb COVID-19 spreading and thus less pollution. COVID-19 cleanses, purify and transfigure us all (Mother Earth is healing). The decline in pollution is attributed by the economic slowdown and travel restriction. The other incline is due to reduced use of fossil fuels, reduction in tourism numbers and masses at the streets. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the satellite image of the massive decline in pollution over (a) Italy and (b) China over the amid ‘Corona Virus’ outbreak and quarantine (NASA Earth Observatory).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Satellite Image of the massive decline in pollution over <bold>a</bold> Italy and <bold>b</bold> China over the amid Corona Virus outbreak and quarantine (NASA Earth Observatory)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10668_2023_3322_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par112">The deployment of the disruptive renewable energy mix (wind, solar, fuel cells, hydrogen, bioenergy) decreases the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions where the pollution of the water and air continues to grow. The global initiative discourages the use of fossil fuel and adaptation to the smart climate-resilient and fully sustainable energy systems (Aghahosseini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2019</xref>). The projected increase of population is more challenging in developing countries with limited supplies and distribution that is affordable and reliable. Mostly, developing countries depends on the natural resources and traditional biomass fuel for cooking that have high GHG emission. Adaptations of the alternative energy sources (renewable energies—RE) are more promising and serve as a substitute to fossil fuel (Aghahosseini et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par113">Africa may have abundant energy resources but the continent is the home to least connected to the grid (electrification). The Sub-Sahara sunshine is said to be having enough energy to power the whole of Europe 7000 times over. The solar panel seems to be the solution as the panels reflect less heat into space reducing regional climate change and enhance increase rainfall. The concentrated solar power is much efficient in a dry environment, hot places but the steam generator needs much water and thus the need to integrate the energy, food and water nexus. Improvement of solar technology will lead to cheaper energy production that is efficient and sustainable. Solar panels would give Africa a solar superpower and turning it to be the global energy hub that solves geopolitics and enhance the realization of the industry 4.0.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Bioenergy-anaerobic digestion</title><p id="Par114">Biomasses from natural resources such as charcoal, firewood and crops are still a source of energy in many emerging economies and developing countries. Modern technologies are heavy burden to natural resources and this overburden the environment that lead to the pollutions from the emission of the GHGs (Neto et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>). The rapid increase in the waste generation demand for a waste management system that provides cheap and sustainable innovative treatment solutions and technologies. Reliable integrated waste management (IWM) database provides all-inclusive resources on the evaluation of the waste management. Key knowledge of the biomass source, composition and end-to-end use is of necessity in life cycle assessment (LCA) of the IWM. Sustainable environmental management has six concepts; <italic>rethink-repair-refuse-reduce-reuse-recycle</italic> that lead to circularity of the zero waste<italic>.</italic> The waste hierarchy is incorporated in the waste-policy where the reduction of waste, reuse, recycle of the material and recovery is implemented. This answer the holistic question of; <italic>reduce:</italic> can the use of material be reduced?, <italic>refuse:</italic> are there materials a designer would not use?, <italic>repair:</italic> can the product be repaired instead of thrown away?, <italic>recycle:</italic> can materials be used that are easy to recycle when the product is finished with?. Sustainability thrive the dimensions through transparency transaction and analytics applications for entire life cycle. Application of the intelligent enterprise and accurate measure of the data driven environmental, social and governance (ESG) analytics is the first step to reduction of the organization footprint.</p><p id="Par115">Adoption of waste to energy technology gives a pathway of an effective harnessing of the energy from biomasses and thus reduction of the GHG emission. The revised technologies include anaerobic digestion, fermentation, combustion, gasification, pyrolysis, liquefaction and incineration. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is a process where biogas/biomethane is formed by the break-down of organic fraction of the biomass using microbes. The composition of the biogas includes biomethane (60%), carbon dioxide (30%) with traces of the hydrogen sulphide, ammonia, carbon monoxide, oxygen and moisture content. Biogas can be stored in form of compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquid petroleum gas (LPG). A large number of companies are manufacturing biogas generators where others are for hybridization purposes. The parameters that affect the production of the biogas production include temperature, pH, organic loading rate (OLR), nature of nutrients, carbon–nitrogen (C/N) ratio, moisture content (MC), total solids (TS), volatile solids (VS), size of the digester, type of the digester, retention time, biomass pre-treatment, agitation, particle size, microbial balance, fatty acids, inhibitors (i.e. fatty acids, ammonia, toxic compounds) etc. Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the degradation stages of the <italic>AD</italic> process. The four pathways of the anaerobic digestion are; disintegration (inert particulate and soluble), hydrolysis (facultative anaerobic bacteria), acidogenesis (acidogenic bacteria), acetogenesis (acetogenic bacteria) and methanogenesis (methanogenic bacteria) (Anthony Matheri et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>; Njuguna Matheri et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>; Njuguna Matheri et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2018</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Degradation step of the anaerobic digestion process (Anthony Njuguna Matheri et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2016</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10668_2023_3322_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par116">Bio-digestion is a clean and environmentally friendly innovative technology that will help improve the rural (remote) areas and informal settlements in the developing countries. Anaerobic digestion (AD) is sustainable, reduce organic waste disposal and generate RE. The digestate can be used as organic fertilizer that helps improve the soil nutrients and characteristics (Gaballah et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hybrid energy system (HES)</title><p id="Par117">The decentralized energy system is suitable for the alternative power generation and is closer to the consumers. This overcome transmission losses that are inherently increased with the power transmission cables (PTC). When this power generation uses cheap, sustainable, renewable energies, there is a higher possibility to make locally potential resources that increase the rate of employment and income (Neto et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>). Decentralized integrated or HRES can help provide a deficit of electricity between generation and demand for energy where single RE system is not reliable in the region. This will fulfils the COP25, proposed COP26 and United Nation sustainable development goals. The evolution of hybrid energy system (HES) consists of the power converter, photovoltaic (PV) modules, battery banks and a bio-digester. On the solar systems: PV modules is a direct current (DC) generator that consists of a variable number of photo-voltaic array cells connected electrically. The battery serves as a reservoir of the required load while the converter is the system used to convert AC power from DC. Among the hybrid system, the hybrid solar-bioenergy system is regarded as satisfactory based on economics, human capacity, locally available, technology transfer, thermodynamics and environmental evaluation. The local biomass and solar radiation resources utilization improve the usage of the renewable energy system and solving climate change mitigation. The life cycle assessment (LCA) is widely used to evaluate strategic planning, environmental impacts, eco-labelling programs and marketing. Life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) determine cost-effective option among different competing alternatives to own, purchase, maintain, operate, dispose and process. The life cycle energy assessment (LCEA) indicate that solar cells manufacturing requires more energy in generation than cost recovered by solar cells (Ali et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>). The hybrid system (battery/PV/fuel cells/hydrogen/wind/grid/biogas) minimizes life-cycle cost, dump energy of remote areas and eliminate carbon emissions (Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>). The concentrated solar power (CSP) in industry 4.0 is a proven technology system for energy generation at small, medium and large scale system (Khalid et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2017</xref>). This is enhanced by rethinking sustainable business process across circular value chain with sustainable intelligent enterprise that reduce carbon footprint.</p><p id="Par118">To improve the quality of power and reliability of the systems, the energy storage, renewable energy technologies and backup systems are much needed. Stacking layers of the solar panels (compound II-V semi-conductor) increase energy efficiency by 50%. Control of air pollution (climate change) because of the restrict movement of people and vehicle have seen increase production of energy worldwide. RE resources exist on geographical areas that is wide. The rapid deployment of energy efficiency (EE) and RE results in climate change mitigation, energy security and economic benefits. Two or three power generation can increase sustainability, efficiency and reliability. Current commercially viable HRES include wind- diesel, PV- battery, PV- battery-wind, wind battery, PV- diesel, and lastly, the combination of PV- wind- diesel-battery systems (Bhandari et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>). The higher the RE shares value in the market of the energy mix, the higher the flexibility needed for alternative back up for fossil fuel in ensuring power and heat availability on demanded (Blanchet et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par119">A portable onsite waste solution (online waste solution) with an integrated system: the hybrid solar system and anaerobic digestion (AD) is a hybrid system that could reduce or eliminate electricity cost and even provide profit. This can serve as a solution to the integrated waste solution and power production in informal settlement, rural and remote location where getting reliable three-phase electricity supply is expensive and disruptive. Electricity production and distribution in developing countries usually come with higher flatulating tariffs with policies that changes over nights (political instability) together with lack of the intelligent network infrastructure.</p><p id="Par120">Life cycle stages of PV involve the sourcing and production of raw material, manufacturing of modules, processing, balance of systems (BOS) components, installation of the system, decommissioning, the primary use of the systems, disposal and recycling (Ali et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>).

Individual low voltage on solar cell calls for the multiple cells to linked on the array (photovoltaics models or solar panels). The type and technical parameters of the measuring instruments are reviewed by (Kang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2018</xref>). In the LCA of the HES, the policy-makers and stakeholders can obtain an understanding that is comprehensive to the system that is practically feasible and well-engineered (Zhang et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par122">This study aimed to introduce a concept of solar-anaerobic digestion system in achieving energy self-efficiency with development of the dynamic models that of climatic condition, social-economic and technology feasible. The deployment of the system determined the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions where the pollution of the water and air continues to grow. Key knowledge of the biomass source, biomass composition (characterization and quantification of biomass), biomethane potential test from different biomasses and end-use is determined and is of necessity in life cycle assessment (LCA) of the integrated waste management, sustainability, circularity and digitality of the ESG assessment and fulfilment of the SDGs. The type of the bio-digester selection was based on multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The design of the solar-anaerobic digester was simulated. Simulation-modelling of the hybrid renewable energy system (energy mix) included solving the problem such as the efficiency of different systems, costing, sizing of the digester, availability of the biomass, energy input and output, optimization of the AD parameters and financial modelling. The rapid deployment of energy efficiency (EE) and RE will result to climate change mitigation, energy security and economic benefits that show visibility of the power generation with increased sustainability, efficiency and reliability The performance of the system was designed and optimised to get a maximum output power and mitigation of the environment at a lower cost. Life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) determined cost-effective option among different competing alternatives to own, purchase, maintain, operate, dispose and process.

The results indicated the properties and characteristics of the feedstock that were of the optimum range and promising for the waste to energy conversion (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>). High TS%, MC% and VS% showed that the feedstocks are easily biodegradable. The amount of moisture content ranging from 60 to 90% influence the AD process (biomass degradability) and biomethane formation. High dilution of the feedstock had a negative impact of the bio-digester design and AD processes. The wetter the substrate, the higher the bio-digester volume and area that took relatively huge level of the produced biomethane. The total solids of the biomass were within the required range as this influenced the performance of the anaerobic digestion and changed the microbial morphology in the digestion system. The use of the bulk substrate reduced the digestion volume as observed by (Anthony Njuguna Matheri et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2021</xref>). High volatile solid of the substrates gave an indication of high conversion of substrate to biomethane. The biodegradability indicated that the biomass was feasible for the anaerobic digestion (biogas/biomethane production). The C/N ratio from CHNS was an important factor in food (nutrients)-microbial balance of the AD process.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Proximate and ultimate characterization of the substrates</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10668_2023_3322_Fig9_HTML.png" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par156">Most substrates had a C/N ratio that was on the optimal range of 15–30, except for the bagasse, sawdust and wood with C/N ratio of 165.81, 230.89, 200.64, respectively<italic>.</italic> Optimum C/N ratio indicated a nutrient balance required to conduct the anaerobic digestion. Animal manure, grass clippings and agriculture waste indicated a good potential for the biomethane production. Higher C/N ratio in substrate required co-digestion with the lower C/N ratio that was below the optimum range. A comprehensive feedstock quantification and characterization was important. This helps in finding optimum conditions or parameters for optimum anaerobic digestion and biogas/biomethane production and in designing of the biodigesters.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Mono and co-anaerobic digestion</title><p id="Par157">Biomethane potential test was determined using AMPTS 11 with different biomass as feedstock (organic fraction of the municipal solid waste (OFMSW), animal waste, agriculture waste, sewage sludge) and recorded in NmlCH4/gVS. The average of the triplicate results was recorded for the batch biomethane potential test. Lower production on lag phase was due to the lower solubility of the substrate and enzymes during the anaerobic digestion processes. High production of biomethane was recorded after 5 days of hydraulic retention time (HRT). The temperature was kept constant at the mesophilic temperature of 37 °C, constant agitation, optimum pH and feeding rate calculated according to the volatile solids of the substrates.

Higher C/N ratio created nutrients imbalance to the microbial due to lower nitrogen of the substrate thus lowering the pH down. High C/N ratio lower biomethane production due to a formation of carboxylic acids that inhibited microbial growth and shift micro-organism environment. Low C/N ratio leads to lower biomethane production due to production of ammonia (high nitrogen in the substrate) with high pH that poison the digestion process. Lower volatile solids substrates recorded lower production because of lower nutrient. Higher volatile solids recorded higher production of the biomethane. Co-digestion of the substates improves the production because of balance of the nutrients, pH optimization, food to microbial balance, regulated C/N ratios, balance VS, TS and MC as observed by (Singh et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2018</xref>). This was observed with the highest production of biomethane with the co-digestion of cow dung, chicken manure and pig manure. Bagasse waste produced lowest biomethane due to difficulty of biomass degradability and higher C/N ratio. Co-digestion reduced the HRT with an increased production rate. Mono digestion was only possible with substrates that had an optimum condition from characterization. Co-digestion was highly recommended to balance the nutrients optimally high level of control. Optimum and constant mesophilic temperature ensured a controlled atmosphere for the digestion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Selection and design of bio-digester</title><p id="Par159">The type of the bio-digester was selected by use of multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA).

The technology was uncomplicated and durable. The hybrid power plant could assist in load shedding/power rationing season. Bio-digester provided cleaner and more affordable sources of energy to traditional or underserviced community. The installation was of the storage capacity of 30 kW, bioenergy of 2.5 kW and solar energy (15 panels) of 5 k with approximately R250000 as initial cost. Biogas production increased by volume because of constant temperature. The PV power generation system achieved a conversion efficiency of 8.1%. The energy savings improved from 60 to 90%. The process saved R5000 per month with energy payback period (EPP) of 3 years. The installation reduced CO<sub>2</sub> emission by 25 t. The models generated an optimal cost solution that met the demand with optimum tariffs, intelligent network infrastructure and advanced policies coupled with political stability. The HRES is relatively a cost-effective solution in areas where the utility grids are expensive and thus suitable for the informal settlements and remote (rural) regions. Integrating distributed generating system in a mini-grid increased the efficient distribution of power and reliability.
