id="Par1">The standard of living of mankind has significantly improved over several decades with significant technological developments and use of available natural resources. As a result, limited natural resources have been consumed at a much faster rate leading to depletion of many of those limited resources. Quality of life on the earth for the future generation has been an issue of global concern due to indiscriminate use and fast depletion of these limited natural resources as an outcome of the so-called modern civilization. This even increased the discrimination between different sections of the human society globally. To save our earth from this impending crisis, the United Nations' (UN) Brundtl and commission defined an inclusive growth called ‘Sustainable Development’. It states to follow the path of development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This has been globally accepted as the ideal path for future development. Though this is a global vision, actions to achieve it may have local contexts too. The UN has defined seventeen ‘<italic>Sustainable Development Goals</italic>’ (SDGs) to follow this path. Most of the countries have decided their own national action plans under these goals.</p><p id="Par2">‘<italic>Affordable and clean energy</italic>’ is considered as a very basic input for sustainable development and is included as the SDG-7. Sustainable utilization of natural resources for energy conversion, supply and utilization and developing new and innovative ways for clean and affordable energy for all is a critical challenge. The link between energy and sustainable development and the integrated interdisciplinary approach towards it are the themes of this special issue.</p><p id="Par3">This special issue includes 10 papers. All of these are revised and extended versions of presented papers in the <italic>International Conference on Energy and Sustainable Development</italic> organized during February 14–15, 2020 at Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India. It was jointly organized by the Mechanical Engineering Department the University and The Institution of Engineers (India) and Tripura Institute of Technology (TIT), Agartala, India. Jadavpur University is a premier state university of West Bengal, India. IEI is a multi-disciplinary professional organization established in 1920 to promote the engineering in India and globally too. Tripura Institute of Technology is a State University of Tripura, India and was a mentee institute of Jadavpur University under the twinning program of the World Bank funded by Government of India program ‘<italic>Technical Education Quality Improvement of Phase III (TEQIP-III)</italic>’. The Mechanical Engineering Department of Jadavpur University received Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA) fund support for this program and TIT received their fund support from TEQIP-III. IEI also financially supported the conference. The conference received wide participation from all over India and abroad. It started with an Industry-Academia Plenary Session with three leading experts from industry/ policy and another three academic experts both from India and abroad. It hosted seven keynote lectures on different aspects of the theme by renowned experts from both Industry and academia of India and abroad. A total of 129 papers were contributed and presented in this conference. Only a few of these contributed papers were selected by an expert panel with members from both India and abroad and were invited to submit an extended and revised version of those submissions. Subsequently those were rigorously peer reviewed and revised according to the journal’s standard procedure to select for this special issue. A brief summary of these works are now appended.</p><p id="Par4">The first article, “<italic>Thermal Management of Nanofluid Filled Porous Cavity Utilized for Solar Heating System</italic>” explores buoyancy-driven free convection in a conventional solar air heating system using numerical simulations. To address these concerns, the current research examines the foundations of fluid flow and heat transfer by simulating a 'H' shape cavity filled with saturated porous media that is heated from the bottom protruded body and cooled from the sides of the top protruded body. Different factors are discovered to have a substantial impact on the heat transfer rate. The study also found that, even in the presence of a porous media, the use of nanofluid provides more heat transmission than air.</p><p id="Par5">Two different fluids were tested for their thermophysical properties in order to assess their suitability as a heat transfer fluid in concentrating solar power plant (CSP) operations as an alternative to Solar Salt<sup>®</sup> in the paper, "<italic>Some Investigations to Enhance the Peak Operating Time of a Concentrating Solar Power Plant with Focus on Heat Transfer Fluids</italic>." The first fluid was Ca (NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>–KNO<sub>3</sub>–NaNO<sub>3</sub> ternary salt combination, while the second was a B2O<sub>3</sub>–SiO<sub>2</sub> oxide mixture. In that investigation, the ternary salt outperformed the Solar Salt<sup>®</sup> in terms of density, corrosivity and melting point. This research also revealed that the oxide mixture's high viscosity makes it unsuitable for use in current-generation CSP facilities, necessitating the development of a new technology.</p><p id="Par6">The paper, "<italic>A comparative study on prismatic and cylindrical lithium-ion batteries based on their performance in high ambient environment</italic>" examines the performance of prismatic and cylindrical Lithium-ion batteries at various discharge rates. To analyze the heat generated in the battery for various discharge rates and to keep the temperature of the cylindrical battery within a required range of 25–60 °C for efficient operation, a numerical analysis was performed. The findings of this study revealed how to increase battery performance by utilizing a passive battery heat management system.</p><p id="Par7">The article, "<italic>Challenges Prevailing in Photovoltaic Electricity in India: A Broad Perspective</italic>" identifies the fundamental challenges/barriers in the procurement of solar power in India, particularly by photovoltaics, and could serve as a useful guide for energy engineers by providing specific guidance on how to procure solar electrical power and other applications in an acceptable manner. Aside from that, the Ministry's initiatives, incentives, and subsidies are highlighted.</p><p id="Par8">The thermodynamic, economic, and environmental impact analysis of a downdraft biomass gasification system was conducted based on experimental data sets with respect to different equivalence ratios for two different feedstocks, namely tree waste and sawdust pellet, in the paper, "<italic>Thermodynamic and Environmental Impact Study of a Stand Alone Biomass Gasifier System for Sustainable and Economically Feasible Power Generation in a Remote Village</italic>." A mathematical model for predicting gas composition has also been created and verified using experimental data. A feasibility assessment of rural electrification was undertaken for a small community, as well as a cost analysis and a separate calculation of the LUCE (levelized unit cost of electricity). Finally, the plant's environmental impact was calculated using a life cycle assessment (LCA) emission matrix with respect to the several potential parameters. According to the findings of the study, biomass gasification is a very ecologically friendly and economically practical method of generating renewable energy for India's rural population in terms of cost and environmental effect.</p><p id="Par9">The paper, "<italic>Water Conservation: An Innovative Approach towards Minimization of Blow-Down for Recirculating Cooling Water System</italic>" describes a concept-based approach to water conservation through blow-down minimization in a recirculating cooling water circuit, as well as brief practical research. Because the idea of side stream softening treatment, or 3ST system, is still being developed and implemented, delivering soft water as a make-up for the system necessitates a bigger quantity of soft water. To address this, the current investigation confirms that with a 3ST unit in situ, even with a 75% drop in BD (i.e. from 0.4 to 0.1 m<sup>3</sup>/hr), the hardness level in circulating water remained significantly lower than the initial figure.</p><p id="Par10">The research, "<italic>Improvement in Energy Efficiency of CPV Module by Way of various Active and Passive Cooling Techniques</italic>" looked at a variety of active and passive cooling techniques for waste heat created by solar cells. This waste heat causes thermal strains and raises the temperature of the solar cell, which has a significant impact on the solar cell's efficiency, power production, and service life. The efficacy of expanded surface, heat pipe, and micro fins are covered in passive cooling, whereas Peltier effect cooling, compressed air, and other factors are covered in active cooling. This research allows researchers to investigate the most efficient cooling system for a proposed Multi-junction tandem (MJT) Concentrated Photovoltaic (CPV) system. The review looks on novel approaches for increasing CPV output. This research also reveals that combining different methods has a considerable impact on lowering operating temperatures and improving overall performance in terms of power production, electrical efficiency, and cell life.</p><p id="Par11">The article, "<italic>Potential of Pumped Hydro Storage as an Electrical Energy Storage in India</italic>" summarizes all technical perspectives on pumped hydroelectricity storage (PHS), as well as the overall PHS situation for India, as well as limits and policies. This study shows that India has properly understood that environmentally friendly electricity generation is the way of the future, and has placed a premium on harnessing its water resources for hydropower. This report also argued that some compromises will be unavoidable when building dams and barrages, and that some policy decisions should be made to harness hydropower, with a focus on PHS because it has some benefits over traditional hydro plants.</p><p id="Par12">The paper, "<italic>Simulated Performance Studies of Thin Film Perovskite Solar Cell</italic>" aimed to develop a lead-based halide perovskite solar cell model by simulating various parameters such as thickness, defect densities of the absorbing layer, doping concentration of HTM (hole transport material), and ETM (electron transport material) layer to optimize the solar cell's efficiency. In conclusion, the layer-by-layer architecture of TiO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub>/CuSCN perovskite solar cell was effectively modelled, simulated, and the results were quantitatively assessed using SCAPS. These simulation findings show that when the thickness of the absorbent layer grows, light absorption increases, and the cell's performance improves.</p><p id="Par13">The work entitled, "<italic>Effect of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles Blended Concentration on Performance, Combustion and Emission Characteristics of CRDI Diesel Engine running on Mahua Methyl Ester Biodiesel</italic>" investigates the effects of iron oxide nanoparticle (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) additives added to a Mahua methyl ester (MME) blend on the emission, combustion, and performance characteristics of a four-stroke, single-cylinder, common The experimental analysis demonstrated that when nanoparticle additions blended biodiesel (i.e., MME20 + IONP80) were used, hazardous pollutants such as smoke (5.38%), HC (6.39%), carbon monoxide (10.24%), and NOx, among others, were decreased to a significant level, and the BTE was improved by 8.8 percent. It is clear from the aforementioned study that IONP has a significant impact in improving engine performance and controlling emissions. In conclusion, when biodiesel and nano additives are combined, the engine's combustion and performance are greatly enhanced, while pollutant emissions are reduced.
