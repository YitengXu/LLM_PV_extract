Silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are a powerful antibacterial material that can kill a wide variety of microorganisms. They are commonly used in water treatment and are incorporated into polyethersulfone (PES) microfiltration membranes. The use of an Ag-PES membrane improved the antibiofouling performance of PES membranes. From the industrial application of nanotechnology, applications of TiO<sub>2</sub>-based nanocoatings that can be used as dust-repellent coatings for solar panels improve their efficiency and reduce the amount of required maintenance. Furthermore, the nanoscale dimension of these particles facilitates their movement in various body parts, resulting in serious diseases such as cancer and organ damage.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), energy demand will continue to rise until 2030. Owing to increasing energy demand, there is a great need to new technology with low energy demand as a potential way to conserve energy. Lithium-ion batteries, light-emitting diode (LED), fuel cells, ultra-capacitor, and solar cell were used to conserve the energy as they improve the efficiency and application period. Nanotechnology is expected to contribute to low-cost and efficient energy generation, transmission, and storage systems in the future. The fabrication of materials and structures with nanoscale can potentially use for producing a newly developed devices with high efficiency, low cost, and low energy demand in many applications such as hydrogen production, solar photovoltaic systems, solar thermal systems, and energy saving technologies (Christian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>; Yianoulis and Giannouli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2008</xref>). As a result, nanotechnology’s application in the field of energy is a hot topic in many scientific fields. The current trend is being hampered by the high cost of production compared to previous technologies. To obtain higher efficiency with low production cost, the priority should be given to nanotechnology in terms of energy. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, piezoelectric, thermoelectric, triboelectric, catalytic, and photovoltaic are the main nanomaterials, which strongly contributed to several energy applications. Inorganic nanoparticles have superior thermal and electrical conductivity, chemical stability, and a wide surface area due to their unique properties.

Many researches are carrying out to develop the electrolyte’s performance and consequently stability of solar cell. It is based on the photoelectrochemical processes. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, the employing electrode is fabricated by depositing a thin layer of oxide semiconducting materials such as TiO<sub>2</sub> (n-type) and NiO (p-type) on a transparent conductive glass plate made of indium tin oxide (ITO). These oxides have a wide band gap in the energy range from 3 to 3.2 eV. Because it is non-toxic, less expensive, and available, TiO<sub>2</sub> is mostly used as a semiconducting layer. The dye is covalently attached to the surface of TiO<sub>2</sub>. Due to the high porosity structure and large surface area of the electrode, a large number of dye molecules are attached to the surface of the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, and thus, the light absorption on the surface of the semiconductor enhances. After laying an ultra-thin coating of TiO<sub>2</sub> on the upper surface, the efficiency of about 18% was determined, it was shown that TiO<sub>2</sub> was by 50% more efficient compared to the same material without coatings (Takabayashi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2004</xref>), and they had synthesized a thin-film electrode made of a polycrystalline Si/doped TiO<sub>2</sub> semiconductor.

Fuel cell technologies have emerged as one of the most promising approaches to various energy resources, as well as to energy sustainability and the environment (Peterson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2010</xref>). In a fuel cell, hydrogen and oxygen combine to form water, which produces electricity and heat. As illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>, this occurs in an environmentally beneficial manner, with no damaging carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions. Despite its many advantages, the fuel cell still has a number of disadvantages, including high cost, operability, and durability difficulties. Nanotechnology can be used to overcome these disadvantages. In practice, nanomaterials can be used in the fuel cell membrane (which is responsible for separating hydrogen into protons and electrons), the contribution of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) to improving the mechanical strength and proton conductivity of polymer electrolyte membranes, as well as catalysts and electrodes. Furthermore, storing huge amounts of hydrogen fuel is either too cumbersome or too expensive. Large amounts of hydrogen can be stored inside nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and carbon nanofibers, which is another key constraint in fuel cells. Carbon nanotube fuel cells, which are regarded the most environmentally acceptable form of energy, are currently being used to store hydrogen. Carbon nanotubes have a layered graphene tubular shape that allows them to store hydrogen efficiently. In reality, hydrogen can be adsorbed by carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by a physic-sorption phenomenon in which hydrogen is trapped in the cylindrical structure of the nanotubes or in the interstitial regions between nanotubes. Consequently, hydrogen has the best energy-to-weight ratio of any fuel and is widely utilized in space vehicles (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>).<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Hydrogen fuel cell (Bishop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42269_2023_984_Fig10_HTML.png" id="MO10"/></fig></p><p id="Par74">Accordingly, the application of CNTs as the catalyst support in hydrogen production appears to be effective and attractive owing to their special structural morphology and characteristics.

Nikitin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref> stated that the hydrogenation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) using atomic hydrogen as the hydrogenation agent depends on the nanotube diameter, and for the diameter values around 2.0 nm.

Girishkumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref> investigated the power density of hydrogen cell based on using single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) support and platinum catalyst.

Some of the experimentally reported hydrogen storage capacities for different CNTs are summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. The variation in data of hydrogen storage capacity in CNT is based on their characteristics.

Solar stills, as generally known, have numerous advantages, including being simple, inexpensive, pollution-free, and requiring less maintenance. However, the freshwater yield of a conventional solar still (CSS) is restricted. As a result, researchers are attempting to improve its efficiency by employing a variety of nanomaterials. The performance of a modified solar still (MSS) can be improved by adding copper oxide nanoparticles to the black paint, for example. As the concentration of nanoparticles increases, the water productivity enhanced. Meanwhile, raising the concentration of nanomaterials increases the rate of heat transmission between the basin water and the still walls. Furthermore, as compared to CSS, using CuO nanoparticles boosts freshwater productivity by around 16% and 25% at weight fraction concentrations of 10% and 40%, respectively, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref> (Kabeel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2017</xref>).<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Layout diagram of conventional solar still and modified solar still with nanoparticles (Kabeel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2017</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/42269_2023_984_Fig13_HTML.png" id="MO13"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Industrial application of nanomaterials</title><p id="Par91">Nanotechnology was applied in many industrial activities and private sectors through the optimization of products for substantially maintaining the energy consumption.</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Dust-repellent coatings with TiO<sub>2</sub>-based nanomolecules</title><p id="Par92">The conventional applications of nano-TiO<sub>2</sub>-modified coatings can be effectively used to control the dirt and dust after exposure of an area to ultraviolet radiation. The system of nanoparticle delivery was developed by a new company (Swift Coat), which can be beneficially used to synthesize coatings with high efficiency in dust repellent for solar panels with less needed maintenance. It is expected that the application of such nanoparticle delivery can be successfully used in preventing solar panels soiling. The accumulation of debris, dust, and dirt on the surface’s panel with increasing time can decrease its efficiency. With more exposure time to these pollutants, the efficiency of solar cells decreases by 30%. This can result in serious problems for consumers and businesses. The installed solar panels on home’s roof could not be easily reachable by a homeowner. A continues loss in the efficiency of panels for months occurs if the homeowners cannot continuously be cleaning the panels. Similar challenges can be faced by businesses with remote solar installations. The costs of labors who clean solar panels can negatively affect. The labor’s costs for cleaning solar panels can significantly cut into the savings the company may have safeguarded by adopting a source of green energy (Newton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2021</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec34"><title>Corrosion protection</title><p id="Par93">Corrosion is regarded as an important issue in the industrial world.

As well known, the application of industrial paints and coatings on panels act as a protected layer against corrosion. Moreover, the life span of metal parts can be extended by after coating it.
