A platinized conductive glass is used as a counter electrode and an electrolyte containing an I<sup>â</sup>/I<sub>3</sub><sup>â</sup> redox couple is used to fill in between the two electrodes.

The light-scattering effect was achieved by the addition of TiO<sub>2</sub> layers. The addition of scattering layers with the TiO<sub>2</sub> large particles ensures adequate light trapping in the device<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, due to an increase in the absorption path length of photons and optical confinement. Ferber et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and Rothenberger et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> confirmed the light-scattering effect using the transport theory and a many-flux model, respectively. Given the scattering abilities of TiO<sub>2</sub> films, it is also important that the TiO<sub>2</sub> electrode have a high surface area, which is responsible for optimal dye loading and effective photocurrent generation. However, to date, a high photo-conversion efficiency for DSSCs has not been reported without the use of a light-scattering layer.</p><p>In the present study, the TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films with artificial pores formed using acetylene-black were prepared to improve the light harvest efficiency of DSSCs without a light scattering layer. The structural and the photovoltaic properties of the DSSCs were compared with TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films without (hereafter referred to as the Normal films) and with different acetylene-black concentrations. The acetylene-black was introduced for a light-scattering role and morphology change of the electrode and for a reduction of residual carbons in the TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Thermal properties of the acetylene-black were characterized using Thermogravimetric/Differential Thermal Analysis (TG/DTA) technique. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1(a)</xref> shows the TG/DTA results of the TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-anode paste including 1.5 wt% acetylene-black. The TG/DTA results were recorded from 30 to 900Â°C at a heating rate of 5Â°C/min. An endothermic peak was observed at 159Â°C and three exothermic peaks were observed at 194, 319 and 604Â°C. The endothermic peak at 159Â°C was attributed to the evaporation of the remaining solvent. The first two exothermic peaks at 194 and 319Â°C may be attributed to the decomposition of the organic materials. The peaks at 604Â°C were attributed to the decomposition of the acetylene-black. The TG/DTA indicated that complete decomposition of acetylene-black occurred at 604Â°C, which resulted in a temperature that was too high for the FTO/glass process. However, DSSC devices using TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-anode pastes with acetylene-black actually were thermally treated at 500Â°C for 30âmin in the present study. In order to decide the real decomposition temperature of the acetylene-black for DSSC cells, TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-anode pastes, including 1.5 wt% acetylene-black, were thermally treated at 350, 400, 450, 500 and 550Â°C for 30âmin and then samples treated at each temperature were measured at a heating rate of 5Â°C/min using TG/DTA. The results are shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1(b) ~ 1(f)</xref>. Samples treated at 350 (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(b)</xref>) and 400Â°C (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 (c)</xref>) for 30âmin showed peaks exhibiting a decomposition of acetylene-black at about 600Â°C. This result suggested that the acetylene-black still remained in the TiO<sub>2</sub>-photo anode films treated at 350 and 400Â°C for 30âmin. On the other hand, samples treated at 450Â°C (see <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(d)</xref>) showed no peak, which indicated the decomposition of acetylene-black and resulted in a complete decomposition of the acetylene-black in samples treated at 450Â°C for 30âmin. That result suggested that the DSSC cells composed of TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films treated at 500Â°C for 30âmin showed a complete removal of the acetylene-black inserted in order to form the artificial pores in the TiO<sub>2</sub> films. In the same manner, for samples treated at 500 (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(e)</xref>) and 550Â°C (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(f)</xref>) for 30âmin, we observed no DTA peaks indicating a decomposition of the acetylene-black. According to these results, the acetylene-black was completely removed from the DSSCs by thermal treatment at 450Â°C for 30âmin.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TG/DTA plots recorded from 30 to 900Â°C at a heating rate of 5Â°C/min using the TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-anode paste including (a) 1.5 wt% acetylene-black.

The results are summarized in <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The specific surface area (a<sub>s,BET</sub>) of the Normal photo-electrode film was 42.364âm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>â1</sup> and that of the sample with 1.5 wt% acetylene-black was 36.382âm<sup>2</sup> g<sup>â1</sup>. Total pore volume of the Normal photo-electrode film was 0.186âcm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>â1</sup> and that of the sample was 0.212âcm<sup>3</sup> g<sup>â1</sup>. The average pore size of the Normal film was 18ânm and that of the sample was 23ânm. The results show that the Normal films exhibited a comparatively smaller pore size than that of acetylene-black TiO<sub>2</sub> films and that acetylene-black TiO<sub>2</sub> films enhanced the light reflection capacities of the TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films. Generally, light is reflected through TiO<sub>2</sub> films when it irradiates into the photo-electrode. If the photo-electrode has strong scattering ability, much more light intensity is reflected back to the inner TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode, which enhances the amount of light absorbed by the dye. The diffused reflectance spectra of the Normal films and 1.5 wt% acetylene-black TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films were measured using a spectrophotometer and are shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3(a)</xref>. The diffused reflectance spectra were measured through the overall thickness of the TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films rather than the surface of the TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films. The acetylene-black TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films exhibited reflection capacities that were approximately 20% higher the Normal films in wavelengths that ranged between 400 and 800ânm. The results indicate that an incident light is reflected several times by the artificial pores in an acetylene-black TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-anode film, which further reinforces the light-harvesting ability of TiO<sub>2</sub>, particularly in the visible range. Thus, artificial pores extend the photo-response into visible spectrum ranges, resulting in an enhancement of light utilization efficiency.

The results clearly indicate that the absorption by adsorbed dyes on the TiO<sub>2</sub> films with different acetylene-black concentrations is larger than the films with the same thickness as the Normal films. Especially, the absorbance of the Normal films abruptly decreased above a wavelength of 550ânm. On the other hand, those of the TiO<sub>2</sub> films with different acetylene-black concentrations were slightly decreased as wavelength increased above 550ânm.

An abrupt decrease in the absorbance with an increase in the wavelength in the Normal films was attributed to an increase in transmittance by a small quantity of pores. On the other hand, an increase in pores in the TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films with different acetylene-black concentrations increased the absorbance of the light in wavelengths that ranged from 350 to 900ânm. The quantitative amount of the adsorbed dye molecules in the Normal films and TiO<sub>2</sub> films with 1.5 wt% acetylene-black was approximately 0.03425 and 0.03869âmmol g<sup>â1</sup>, respectively. Although the specific surface area of the Normal films is larger than that of the 1.5 wt% acetylene-black TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films, an increase of the adsorbed dye molecules in the TiO<sub>2</sub> films including the acetylene-black was attributed to the less carbon contaminations by a removal of the acetylene-black. The residual carbon concentrations in the Normal and acetylene-black TiO<sub>2</sub> films were shown in the later discussion. Lee et al. reported that the more dyes were adsorbed on the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface having less carbon contaminations by the UV-O<sub>3</sub> treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The present results were consistent with those of the TiO<sub>2</sub> films treated with UV-O<sub>3</sub> process.

Compared with the Normal films DSSC, photovoltaic parameters such as short-circuit current density (J<sub>s</sub>) and open-circuit voltage (V<sub>oc</sub>) were enhanced with increasing acetylene-black concentration. However, the solar energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency was at its maximum at an acetylene-black concentration of 1.5 wt% and was decreased above 1.5 wt%. An increase above the critical pore size of TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films at 1.5 wt% induced a decrease in the relative volume of the TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-anode, resulting in a decrease in the total amount of the adsorbed dye. The efficiency and the short-circuit current density of the DSSC sample with an acetylene-black concentration of 1.5 wt% showed enhancements of about 22 and 26%, respectively, compared with the Normal films DSSC. These results showed that the acetylene-black in the TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films played an important role in the enhancement of the photo-conversion efficiency of the DSSCs without a light scattering layer.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>JâV curves of the DSSCs fabricated using the Normal films and the TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films with different concentrations of acetylene-black.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2013_Article_BFsrep01496_Fig4_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The internal resistances of the DSSCs were studied via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the frequency range of 0.1âHzâ100âkHz and with an alternating current amplitude of 10âmV. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5(a)</xref> shows the EIS results at a forward bias of the open-circuit voltage under a light irradiation of 100âmW cm<sup>â2</sup> with the results represented as Nyquist plots.

The impedance plots ordinarily show three semicircles, which were fitted by the equivalent circuit shown in an inset of <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(a)</xref> using the Z-view software. The semicircle at a high frequency was attributed to the counter-electrode charge transfer resistance and Helmholtz capacitance (Rct1 and CPE1) parallel combination (The constant-phase element (CPE1 = (CPE1-T)<sup>â1</sup>(jw)<sup>â(CPE1âP)</sup>) was related to the active surface areas of the counter electrode and the CPE1-P value was related to the porosity of the Pt film). The semicircle observed in the middle frequency was a result of the recombination resistance at the TiO<sub>2</sub>/electrolyte interface and the capacitance of the TiO<sub>2</sub> (Rct2 and CPE2). Finally, the third semicircle observed at a low frequency was due to the impedance of diffusion in the electrolyte, the so-called Warburg element (Ws). The widths of the 1, 2 and 3 arcs (at <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5(a)</xref>) corresponded to Rct1, Rct2 and R<sub>Ws</sub>, respectively.

The TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films with 1.5 wt% acetylene-black showed an increase of about 15% compared with that of the Normal films at a peak wavelength of 530ânm. That result indicates that fewer electrons were trapped in the TiO<sub>2</sub> layer because the residual carbons that served as trap densities were reduced by the insertion of the acetylene-black.</p><p>Reduction of the trap density by incorporation of the acetylene-black into the TiO<sub>2</sub> anode films was further investigated by the intensity-modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS). In the present study, IMVS analysis was only investigated because the electron lifetime in the TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films was closely related to the trap sites such as residual carbons.

On the other hand, the electron lifetimes of the films with 2.0 wt% acetylene-black were decreased, which resulted in similar values for the Normal films. These results were attributed to an increase in the residual carbon quantity. Since the electron recombination takes place via the trap sites at the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface, an insertion of the optimal concentration of acetylene-black removed the trap sites for the generated electrons at the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Electron lifetime from the IMVS results of DSSC cells prepared using the Normal films and the TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films with different acetylene-black concentrations</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films</p></th><th align="center"><p>Normal</p></th><th align="center"><p>0.5 wt%</p></th><th align="center"><p>1.5 wt%</p></th><th align="center"><p>2.0 wt%</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><p><italic>f</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> (Hz) (Frequency)</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.1711</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.1585</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.1468</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.1711</p></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><p>Ï<sub><bold>r</bold></sub> (Electron lifetime, s)</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.93</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.00</p></td><td align="center"><p>1.72</p></td><td align="center"><p>0.93</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>The qualitative analysis of the residual carbon existing in the Normal films and TiO<sub>2</sub> photo-electrode films with acetylene-black after thermal treatment at 500Â°C for 30âmin was examined using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, MultiLab 2000, Thermo).

Each C, H and N decomposed by a complete combustion was collected to analyze the concentration. Compared with the Normal films, samples with an increase in acetylene-black concentration showed a decrease in the residual carbon although the acetylene-black itself includes carbon. The exothermic energy by combustion of the acetylene black contributes for removal of the residual carbon existing already in the Normal films. Therefore, electron lifetime was increased due to a reduction in the trap densities that originated from the residual carbon. A large amount of the dye was adsorbed onto the TiO<sub>2</sub> surface due to less carbon contaminations.
