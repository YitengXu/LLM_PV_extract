</title><p id="Par1">Various high-purity metals endow renewable energy technologies with specific functionalities. These become heavily intertwined in products, complicating end-of-life treatment. To counteract downcycling and resource depletion, maximising both quantities and qualities of materials recovered during production and recycling processes should be prioritised in the pursuit of sustainable circular economy. To do this well requires metallurgical infrastructure systems that maximise resource efficiency.To illustrate the concept, digital twins of two photovoltaic (PV) module technologies were created using process simulation. The models comprise integrated metallurgical systems that produce, among others, cadmium, tellurium, zinc, copper, and silicon, all of which are required for PV modules. System-wide resource efficiency, environmental impacts, and technoeconomic performance were assessed using exergy analysis, life cycle assessment, and cost models, respectively. High-detail simulation of complete life cycles allows for the system-wide effects of various production, recycling, and residue exchange scenarios to be evaluated to maximise overall sustainability and simplify the distribution of impacts in multiple-output production systems. This paper expands on previous studies and demonstrates the key importance of metallurgy in achieving Circular Economy, not only by means of reactors, but via systems and complete supply chains—not only the criticality of elements, but also the criticality of available metallurgical processing and other infrastructure in the supply chain should be addressed. The important role of energy grid compositions, and the resulting location-based variations in supply chain footprints, in maximising energy output per unit of embodied carbon footprint for complete systems is highlighted.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Circular economy</kwd><kwd>Sustainability</kwd><kwd>Process simulation</kwd><kwd>CdTe and Silicon

interactions</title><p id="Par2">Technologies that enable the harnessing of renewable energy contain various metals that facilitate specific functionalities. These include a number of precious and special metals/metalloids, often in miniscule—but essential—quantities. Most of the minor metals are only produced as co-products of their carrier metals (Bleiwas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2010</xref>), thereby drawing all associated carrier metal value chains, including the associated infrastructure, into the life cycle. As demand for some of these metals is on the increase (UNEP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2013</xref>), several of them have been classified as <italic>critical raw materials</italic> (CRMs) because of the combination of their economic importance, supply disruption risk, and the resource intensity associated with their extraction from lower-grade deposits (Frenzel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2017</xref>; Nassar and Fortier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2021</xref>). Not all critical materials are necessarily scarce—in some cases, supply risk can be alleviated by having and keeping the right infrastructure in the right locations. Without the associated critical infrastructure, however, critical materials cannot be produced.</p><p id="Par3">Manufacturing processes cause pure metals and other materials to become heavily intertwined, the degree to which directly impacts the effectiveness of recycling—in terms of quantity and quality—and thus circularity potential. Upon entering the end-of-life stage, devices collected for recycling become complex urban minerals in which no elements are present in pure form. As with the extraction of valuable metals from primary geological minerals, urban mineral beneficiation and extraction processes need to be designed to run at their thermodynamic limits, so optimising resource efficiency and consumption. This complexity has been visualised in the Metal Wheel, which can be found in various publications, e.g. Reuter et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2019</xref>) and Verhoef et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2004</xref>). Negative impacts on sustainability, i.e. the environmental, economy, and society, need to be minimised at the same time, while still increasing economic welfare for the stakeholders operating in the life cycle. Before such optimisation can be performed, all material and energy flows (losses and entropy creation included), and potential environmental, economic, and social impacts need to be quantified for the entire system (Reuter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2019</xref>). Of particular importance is also the location of infrastructure in the supply chain, as it strongly affects sustainability—environmental impacts related to power consumption can change dramatically depending on the combination of fossil- and non-fossil energy sources in the local electricity grid. Production and recycling costs and social impacts can also change significantly between locations. With this information in hand, the potentially many trade-offs in this complex optimisation problem can be identified and quantified.</p><p id="Par4">Good separation of the multitude of intertwined materials, compounds, alloys, and others usually cannot be achieved in only one reactor, but rather in a system of reactors (i.e. a plant) or a system of plants and processes which then form part of the circular economy. It is self-evident that the production and recycling of metals are not only about the technology but how best to manipulate the exchange of materials between different phases in individual reactors, between different reactors, and between systems of reactors (Reuter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2016</xref>; Reuter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2021</xref>). To achieve this, mass and heat transfer between different phases in a reactor, process kinetics and dynamics, chemistry, and thermodynamics need to be understood well. Furthermore, it is about the exchange of information between life cycle stages, e.g. making available recycling data to facilitate design-for-recycling, and financial exchanges to keep the life cycle going. Two PV technologies, cadmium-telluride (CdTe) and monocrystalline Si (mono-Si) PV, will be presented to illustrate these concepts. This paper demonstrates the benefits of simulating these large life cycle systems at the process level, and linking simulations with environmental assessment and cost models, and provides insights on their sustainability and circular economy potential. For the results presented here, the authors expanded the methodologies presented in previous publications, in which the resource consumption (RC), resource efficiency (RE), and environmental impacts of the CdTe (Bartie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>) and mono-Si (Bartie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2021a</xref>) PV module life cycles were assessed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The role of metals in photovoltaics</title><p id="Par5">Dominant PV technologies include first-generation wafer-based crystalline silicon (c-Si) and second-generation CdTe and copper-indium-gallium-diselenide (CIGS) thin-film cells in which several semiconductor and other metal layers are deposited onto sub- or superstrates and laminated into modules with another layer of glass polymer sheet as backing. Between these three technologies, the metals and other elements needed include Ag, Al, Au, B, Cd, Cu, Ga, In, Mg, Mo, Ni, P, Pb, Se, Si, Sn, Te, Ti, Zn, and others in various combinations. Between the CRM lists of the USA and Europe, more than half of these are considered critical (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>; Graedel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2022</xref>). Significant research and development are also underway to further develop tandem modules, which consist of combinations of these and new third-generation technologies that utilise, e.g. Pb-based perovskites to maximise power conversion efficiency (PCE) (Lal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2017</xref>; Mohammad Bagher et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2015</xref>). As the production of tandem modules effectively combines the life cycles of two different PV technologies, the resulting step changes in PCE come with increased life cycle complexity, resource requirements, losses, and impacts. Therefore, it is important to analyse PV life cycles at a detail level that enables the identification and optimisation of relevant sustainability and CE-related hotspots and trade-offs. This is important for the PV industry, to be able to assess resource and recycling requirements in the long run, and to optimise and strategise accordingly (e.g. Haegel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2019</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Process simulation provides a platform for creating digital twins of systems of linked value chains and allows one to capture the detail level often missing from approaches that use aggregated input data (Jacquemin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2012</xref>; Reuter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2016</xref>; Reuter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2015</xref>) and often consider quantity, but not quality (Reuter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2019</xref>). The work discussed in this paper has been realised using the HSC Chemistry (Metso:Outotec <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2021</xref>) process simulation software. The complete supply chains have been mapped to consider all the complex nonlinear combinations and chemistries in a large number of different reactors and systems. Following this approach permits calculating both energy and exergy flows (enthalpy and entropy of all streams) and linking them to power using a common unit, i.e. kW. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the typical stages in a circular life cycle of a PV module with materials and energy also entering from outside the system to keep it functioning. The energy balance is represented by the orange ring, and the inevitable dissipation of exergy along the life cycle by the changing thickness of the red ring. Running the life cycle at its thermodynamic limits would minimise the thinning of this ring and reduce the amounts of external energy and materials that need to enter the system to slow down losses and keep value within the life cycle. Note that the resulting environmental and other impacts are strongly influenced by the location of each part of the complete CE infrastructure. This is discussed in Sects. 3.2.2 and 3.4.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>PV module life cycle stages showing the consumption of external materials and energy, and their dissipation along the life cycle</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13563_2022_313_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par7">High-detail simulations such as these facilitate simultaneous assessments of RC, RE, and potential environmental, social, and economic impacts using up-to-date operational data for existing technologies and relatively straightforward adaptation to create alternative datasets for the exploration of future scenarios. By linking these dimensions, the approach lends itself to design for sustainability and design for circularity by complementing design activities with relevant resource and sustainability information from the outset.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The Cd-Te PV system</title><p id="Par8">The life cycle of a CdTe PV module is presented here as the first example of a system that encompasses several base and minor metal production chains. To manufacture a state-of-the-art CdTe PV cell, the metals needed include, among others, Al, Cd, Cu, Se, Sn, Te, and Zn. In this system, Cd is a co-product of Zn and Pb, while Te and Se are co-products of Cu (Bartie and Reuter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2021</xref>). A schematic diagram of the CdTe module life cycle is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. A thin-film PV module typically consists of a glass substrate onto which several semiconductor, metal contact, and other layers are deposited. Apart from the encapsulant and back glass, all layers contain metals (First Solar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">b</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Physical flows in the CdTe PV module life cycle (Bartie and Reuter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2021</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13563_2022_313_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">As mentioned, Cd, Te, and Se are mainly produced as by-products, and therefore, the life cycle includes the production of their carrier metals, and not just finished semi-conductors. By expanding the foreground system boundaries in this way, resource, environmental, and other hot spots can also be identified within individual processes in metal value chains, opening up more opportunities for improvement in sustainability throughout the value chain. Recycling closes the life cycle loop, albeit only partially due to material and energy inefficiencies and losses, and the creation of entropy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The mono-Si PV system</title><p id="Par10">Silicon PV technologies dominate the PV market and also rely on the availability of various materials. Despite its abundance in the earth’s crust, Si metal itself is considered a critical raw material because of its economic importance and potentially increased supply risk (European Commission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>). Continued research and development over the last decades have resulted in higher cell and module efficiencies and considerable decreases in the amount of solar grade Si (SG-Si) required to generate a Watt of power, reaching 3.6 g/W<sub>DC</sub> in 2019, half of the consumption a decade prior (IEA-PVPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2019</xref>). At the same time, however, PV deployment is growing rapidly, the net effect being an increase in demand from 33 kt in 2015 to 235 kt in 2030 in the European PV industry (Gislev and Grohol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">Opportunities are emerging to compensate, at least partially, for the net growth in demand from secondary resources. End-of-life (EOL) PV module quantities are expected to increase significantly between 2025 and 2030 with cumulative global PV waste quantities forecast to reach eight million tons by 2030 and almost 80 million tonnes by 2050 (IRENA and IEA-PVPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016</xref>). It is clear that design for circularity and sustainability and the development of complementary business models and high-quality recycling processes need to be prioritised.</p><p id="Par12">The objective of recycling is to maximise RE by closing material loops. What cannot be ignored is that losses occur at every step along the way, meaning that these loops can only ever approach closure up to limits determined by life cycle design and the laws of nature. These losses cannot be designed out if they are not identified in the first place. Therefore, while EOL recycling is critically important, losses and inefficiencies need to be identified and minimised throughout the life cycle, in manufacturing processes as well as during product design. A block flow diagram of the mono-Si system analysed is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Physical flows in the mono-Si PERC PV module life cycle system where PERC refers to passivated emitter and rear cell, the current industry-standard Si cell configuration (VDMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2021</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13563_2022_313_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods and approach</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Digital twinning of the systems</title><p id="Par13">To create a steady-state process model of the entire CdTe life cycle system shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, Cu production was modelled as a sulphide flash smelting operation with electric furnace slag cleaning, Peirce Smith converting, and anode furnace refining followed by electrolytic refining to Cu cathode. Te and Se are produced through further treatment of anode slimes, and all Cu scrap is recycled internally. A combination of conventional roast-leach-electrowinning (RLE) and direct Zn smelting was used for Zn production, with Cd recovered from residues generated during RLE purification stages. Lead production was modelled as a direct smelting process with bullion refining through conventional Cu and sulphur drossing, the removal of As, Sn and Sb (and the recovery of Te from recycled semiconductor material) in the Harris process, desilvering in the Parkes process, and Zn removal by vacuum distillation.</p><p id="Par14">The manufacturing and recycling of CdTe solar cells were modelled using process descriptions and data from published literature (e.g. Fthenakis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2004</xref>; Sinha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2012</xref>; Wade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2013</xref>) and product specifications from the largest producer of CdTe PV technology (First Solar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2020b</xref>). Processes were linked through the exchange of compatible residues, so creating a closed loop integrated metallurgical production system that aims to minimise untreated residues and waste, and to maximise the quantities and qualities of products. Detailed descriptions of this model and all included process flowsheets can be found in previous publications (see Abadías-Llamas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>; Bartie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>).

As with the CdTe system, the process units in each of the process blocks were modelled separately and connected to create a model for that process. The processes were then connected to create the life cycle system, and material loops closed as far as possible by means of recycling. In this simulation, metallurgical grade Si (MG-Si) is produced via the carbothermic reduction in quartz with ladle refining for impurity removal. Solar grade Si (SG-Si) is produced with the Siemens process and monocrystalline Si (mono-Si) with the Czochralski method. Diamond wire sawing is used for the cutting of Si wafers, which then proceed to PV cell production. It is assumed that the residue that forms during wire sawing, the so-called kerf residue, is recycled to the SG-Si production process as MG-Si.

These included the ability to predict the life cycle system’s response to changes in wafer thickness and two recycling rates—kerf residue as MG-Si and EOL wafers as SG-Si. By additionally linking simulation results and a bottom-up cost model, the effects of recycling and a potential carbon tax on the PV module minimum sustainable price (MSP) and levelised cost of energy (LCOE) were estimated.</p><p id="Par18">To improve computational efficiency for carrying out parameter studies, which, in this case, involved the simultaneous variation in three independent variables (wafer thickness and the two recycling rates), neural networks were created as surrogate functions that represent the process simulation output. Neural networks allow for generalised nonlinear process modelling without the need to predefine regression equations (Reuter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1992</xref>). To achieve this, the simulation model was run several thousand times using uniformly distributed random combinations of the three independent variables as inputs. Subsequently, a large dataset containing the corresponding simulation results for all relevant dependent variables was created. MATLAB’s neural network tool was used to generate the code that initiated, trained, tested, and validated the networks using this dataset. The neural networks then allowed for the individual and simultaneous effects of EOL and kerf recycling rates, and wafer thickness throughout the system to be evaluated in a fraction of the time it would have required using only the simulation model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Resource consumption and efficiency</title><p id="Par19">The production and recycling of metals and PV modules come at a cost. Resource throughput and efficiency are often quantified separately for material and energy streams using the laws of conservation. These indicators are important but do not capture changes that may have occurred in the utility of these streams (Gößling-Reisemann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>). Applying the second law of thermodynamics using exergy analysis provides a way to track resource quality and its inevitable degradation along life cycles. While mass and energy always balance, exergy does not and this imbalance (i.e. irreversibility) over any process represents its degradation of the thermodynamic quality of materials and energy combined, due to the creation of entropy (refer to Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In the approach presented here, exergy cost—the cumulative irreversibility associated with the product of interest (Szargut <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2007</xref>)—serves as a proxy for resource consumption. Exergy efficiency is taken to represent the thermodynamic resource efficiency of a process. As mentioned, the advantage of exergy as an indicator is that material and energy streams are combined, and all expressed in units of measure for energy (Ayres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Environmental impact</title><p id="Par20">Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the standardised and well-established method for assessing environmental impact (ISO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2006</xref>; ILCD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>) and was used to estimate Global warming potential (GWP) and Acidification potential (AP) for the CdTe system using GaBi LCA software (sphera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2020</xref>).

To produce the CdTe semiconductor, however, Cd is clearly just as important as Te. In this case, mass-based allocation would be more appropriate. Looking at the overall system in which much larger amounts of Cu, Zn, and Pb are produced with Cd and Te for applications other than PV, value-based allocation would probably make more sense as the producer’s objective would be to maximise profit. Because Te is significantly more expensive than all the other metals, a portion of the environmental impact would be allocated to it—in this case an order of magnitude more than with the other allocation factors. Such a small quantity is produced; however, that its impact is virtually negligible relative to that of the system (0.2% based on economic allocation). Similarly, and even though eleven times more Cd than Te leaves the system as a product, its allocated impact is even smaller (less than 0.1% for mass, exergy, and economic allocation). Allocation based on exergy cost gives impacts several orders of magnitude higher for both Cd and Te, but it is unclear how a sensible choice between the allocation factors would be made.

With no recycling, emissions amount to 659 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e/kW<sub>DC</sub> based on the assumptions in our simulation, decreasing by 13% with 95% EOL recycling and an additional 1% by adding 50% kerf recycling. The decreases are mainly due to reductions in Scope 2 emissions—in the system as defined here, EOL recycling bypasses the Siemens process, which is the most energy-intensive process in the life cycle, while kerf recycling only bypasses MG-Si production. An additional 3% decrease in emissions could be achieved by recycling kerf at SG-Si quality, in which case the recyclate would also bypass the Siemens process (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). This analysis highlights and quantifies the effects of recyclate quality on sustainability and the potential benefits innovation and development of high-quality recycling processes could bring, albeit that the potential environmental footprint of such upcycling processes has not been considered here.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>CO2-equivalent emissions per nominal kW of power generated for module production on the German electricity grid (updated from Bartie et al.

There are, of course, other factors at play, such as where material resources are geographically located, production costs at different locations, transport costs, trade regulations, etc. No one conclusion should be viewed in isolation, but rather as part of the overall system that needs to be optimised.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Combined effects of Si wafer thickness and EOL recycling on carbon footprint in the mono-Si system</title><p id="Par39">Over the last decade, improvements in cell and module efficiencies have resulted in a 50% reduction in the amount of Si needed to generate a Watt of power and this trend is expected to continue. The average thickness of the most frequently used Si wafers is currently between 170 and 175 μm, accounting for about 72% of the weight of a standard mono-Si cell (VDMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2021</xref>). This value is expected to decrease to between 150 and 160 μm by 2031 (VDMA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2021</xref>), further reducing the consumption of Si for PV systems. Figure <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref> shows the variation in CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent emissions with EOL and kerf recycling rate for wafer thicknesses of 150 and 175 µm. The reduction from 175 to 150 µm (without recycling) results in a 5% reduction in emissions. However, combined with an EOL recycling rate of 95%, emissions decrease by 15%. Compared to recycling alone (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>), the contribution of a 25 µm reduction in wafer thickness to decreasing carbon footprint is relatively small. This analysis of the effects of wafer thickness highlights one of the advantages of the process simulation approach—the ability to change process parameters and generate new process inventory data to assess the impacts of expected technology developments.<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Variation in CO2 emissions with EOL and kerf recycling rate for wafer thicknesses of 150 and 175 µm (for a PCE of 21.7% and an electricity supply emission factor of 0.558 kgCO2e/kWh (Treyer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2021</xref>); underlying data can be found in the Supporting Information)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13563_2022_313_Fig9_HTML.png" id="MO9"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Technoeconomic assessment and the effects of carbon taxation in the mono-Si system</title><p id="Par40">Figure <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> shows the impacts carbon taxation on MSP and how it is influenced by closed-loop recycling. A carbon tax of $100/tCO<sub>2</sub>e increases MSP by 24% (from $67/m<sup>2</sup> to $83/m<sup>2</sup>) when no closed-loop EOL recycling takes place, and by 20% at a 95% recycling rate. As soon as recycling is introduced, an upwards step change in MSP occurs due to the fixed costs of the recycling process. As recycling rate then increases, MSP decreases but can only break even with the original MSP when the carbon tax is higher than approximately $75/tCO<sub>2</sub>e. Below this level, recycling cannot compensate fully for its cost. At a tax level of $100/tCO<sub>2</sub>e, however, the minimum recycling rate needed to break even is a relatively high 85%. These effects follow the same pattern for the LCOE, but are less significant. A $100/tCO<sub>2</sub>e tax results in a 6.6% increase in LCOE, from 7.81 to 8.33 c/kWh. However, the effects of balance-of-system items such as land, concrete, support structures, and others on the overall carbon footprint have not been included in our LCOE calculations yet. With these included, the effect of carbon tax on LCOE would be larger.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Variation in manufacturing cost with EOL recycling rate at hypothetical carbon tax rates of 0, 50, and 100 $/tCO2e emitted (adapted from Bartie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2021b</xref>; underlying data can be found in the Supporting Information)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13563_2022_313_Fig10_HTML.png" id="MO10"/></fig></p><p id="Par41">Both recycling and carbon taxation aim to reduce environmental impacts and lead to increased cost.

Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> shows the ratio of power generated over the lifetime of a mono-Si PV system and its manufacturing carbon footprint as a function of closed-loop EOL recycling rate for different locations. It is assumed that manufacturing takes place in the country indicated that the PV system has a 30-year lifetime with a 0.5%/year degradation rate and a PCE of 21.7%. The average annual insolation is assumed to be 1,500 kWh/(m<sup>2</sup>.year).<fig id="Fig11"><label>Fig. 11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Ratio of lifetime PV energy generated and its manufacturing carbon footprint as a function of EOL recycling rate (underlying data and electricity supply emission factors can be found in the Supporting Information)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/13563_2022_313_Fig11_HTML.png" id="MO11"/></fig></p><p id="Par43">Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> clearly shows how manufacturing location influences carbon footprint. Moving manufacturing from China or Australia to Germany, for example, would have a positive effect by increasing the ratio of energy generated and CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by more than 30% in the case without recycling. In China and Australia, 71% and 77% of electricity were generated from fossil resources in 2020, respectively (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2022</xref>). Countries like Brazil and Norway, on the other hand, respectively, generated 75% and 98% of their electricity using wind, solar PV, and hydropower in the same year (IEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2022</xref>). To maximise energy output per embodied carbon footprint, it is clear that infrastructure development should occur away from countries still largely dependent on fossil fuels for power generation.</p><p id="Par44">Increased circularity lowers the embodied carbon footprint of PV energy, but this effect is weaker the lower the carbon intensity of the relevant electricity grid. The reason is that the strongest effect of Si recycling is its contribution to avoiding electricity consumption in energy-intensive processes and hence avoiding Scope 2 emissions. The carbon intensity of Norway’s electricity grid is an order of magnitude lower than those of the other countries, and as a result, this life cycle’s Scope 2 emissions are lower than its Scope 1 emissions, the latter constant regardless of location. In this case, the increase in Scope 1 emissions brought about by increased recycling is higher than the simultaneous decrease in Scope 2 emissions (explained in Sect. 3.2.2), resulting in a slightly negative slope for Norway in Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>. To take full advantage of the Si circularity effect, it would make sense to focus on using secondary Si in locations where electricity grids are most carbon-intensive.</p><p id="Par45">These comparisons are based on recently published emission factors for the <italic>generation, supply, and distribution</italic> of electricity from the ecoinvent (version 3.8, 2021) database (Wernet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2016</xref>). It should be noted that these are higher than the carbon intensities of electricity <italic>generation</italic> reported by the European Energy Agency (EEA) and the International Energy Agency (IEA), among others. The EEA reports a carbon intensity of 0.311 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh for Germany (EEA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2021</xref>), for example, compared to the 0.558 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e/kWh from the ecoinvent database (Treyer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2021</xref>). While the former is more recent (2020 vs. 2018), it does not include emissions associated with supply chains and electricity losses during transmission across networks. As a result of the time lag, the values used to generate the results presented here (and used for environmental impact assessments in general) may not fully reflect recent progress in reducing the carbon intensities of electricity consumption.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusions and outlook</title><p id="Par46">This paper discussed the links between the metals and PV industries with specific reference to the CdTe and mono-Si PV life cycles. The approach presented here allows for evaluation of complex systems in terms of resources, environmental impact, technoeconomic performance, and their interactions simultaneously. The use of a physics-based foundation of inventory data on a process simulation platform ensures consistency in assessments of these dimensions, so facilitating rigorous life cycle sustainability assessment. Simulation results identify system configurations that enhance RC and RE and reveal the system-wide effects of changes in these on environmental impact and technoeconomic performance, so quantifying the positive impacts of increased circularity—therefore, CE—on the system’s sustainability. The following conclusions are drawn from the work to date:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par47">Of the minor metals needed for CdTe and other PV module manufacturing, most are co-products of other production systems and many are CRMs. Their availability must be ensured by designing and building the necessary infrastructure without delay. The location of the infrastructure plays a decisive role in life cycle sustainability.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par48">In the CdTe system, an increase in overall RE was achieved by linking the Pb and Cu production subsystems by means of additional metallurgical infrastructure. The increased efficiency, however, resulted in increased environmental impact. Introducing the other dimensions of sustainability (society, economy) as well as other system improvements creates various trade-offs that need to be optimised for overall sustainability and CE.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par49">The analysis of recycling in the mono-Si system, of both the internal kerf residue and EOL wafers, quantified how circularity and the quality of recycled Si influence RE and carbon footprint. Both kerf and EOL wafer recycling increase the potential to generate PV power without additional consumption of the primary mineral resource. At the same time, the overall carbon footprint per module is reduced, and more so when the recyclates are of higher purity. Si recovered from wafers at SG-Si quality bypass the primary production of both MG-Si and SG-Si, resulting in significant reductions in Scope 2 (i.e. power consumption-related) emissions. For Si recovered from kerf at MG-Si quality, this effect is smaller as only the MG-Si production process is bypassed. This highlights the benefits of keeping recycling loops in the life cycle as small as possible and the importance of innovation and investment in recycling infrastructure capable of producing high-purity secondary resources for sustainable CE.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par50">Analysis of the combined effects of recycling and a hypothetical carbon tax in the mono-Si P<xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">V</xref> system showed that increased recycling alone is unlikely to be successful at balancing the increase in MSP caused by such a tax. Recycling itself initially increases cost, which then decreases as recycling rate increases. However, it only breaks even with the original cost at high recycling rates and high taxes. As intended with such a tax, the best remedy would be to avoid emissions in the first place, so increasing sustainability. The follow-on effect on LCOE is smaller due to other costs over and above that of the modules.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par51">As also reported by others, the sensible allocation of environmental impacts to products in multi-output systems remains challenging. The clearest and most efficient solution is to use process simulations that give the real emissions for every process from which impacts can be calculated directly instead of having to distribute overall emissions between products, so avoiding allocation altogether, even for very complex systems. For cases that include EOL treatment, the simulation approach provides the same clarity as recycling is modelled in the foreground system, negating the need for assumptions about what might be occurring in the background system.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par52">While numerous factors are at play, real RC and RE can only be quantified if entropy creation (i.e. exergy dissipation) is also accounted for. This “hidden” dissipative energy flow is usually where costs are incurred and, if not accounted for rigorously, may result in faulty policy and economic models.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par53">This work also suggests that supply chains for PV systems should be positioned in low environmental impact energy infrastructures to ensure that the embodied footprint of the system, including recycling, is as low as possible and enhances the performance of the system as a whole, i.e. to maximise the ratio of energy delivered by the PV system over its lifetime and its embodied carbon emissions.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par54">In summary, the infrastructure needed to enable the circular economy and to power sustainability is as critical as the critical materials it needs to produce from primary and secondary resources. It needs to facilitate the running of the life cycle shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> at its thermodynamic limits—at the highest possible efficiency and lowest possible footprint—within prevailing social and economic constraints. It is envisaged that optimisation frameworks and results from this work would contribute to guiding strategy and policy in the renewable energy arena. Specifically, it also clearly shows quantitatively that the system, including recycling, must be positioned in energy landscapes with the lowest possible impact to ensure that the footprint of the system itself is as low as possible. The presented approach is not limited to the analysis of PV systems and can be applied to any product life cycle.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p><italic>Neill Bartie</italic> involved in conceptualisation, methodology, software, validation, formal analysis, investigation, writing—original draft, visualisation; <italic>Lucero Cobos-Becerra</italic> took part in conceptualisation, validation, investigation, project administration; <italic>Magnus Fröhling</italic> involved in conceptualisation, validation, writing—review &amp; editing, supervision; <italic>Rutger Schlatmann</italic> took part in conceptualisation, methodology, validation, writing—review &amp; editing, supervision; <italic>Markus Reuter</italic> involved in conceptualisation, methodology, software, validation, writing—original draft, review &amp; editing, supervision.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Open Access funding enabled and organized by Projekt DEAL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The underlying data for Figs. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> to <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref> can be found in the Supporting Information.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Code availability</title><p>As mentioned and cited in Sect. 2.1, two simulation models are available online (Heibeck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>; Bartie and Heibeck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflicts of interest/Competing interests</title><p id="Par55">Not applicable.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References
