The HRGO were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), ultra violet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Raman spectroscopy. These novel HRGO exhibited high rate capability with excellent cycling stability as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. The results have shown an excellent electrochemical response in terms of charge/discharge capacity (423 mAh/g at 100 mA/g). The cyclic performance was also exceptional as a high reversible capacity (400 mAh/g at 100 mA/g) was retained for 100 charge/discharge cycles. This fascinating electrochemical performance can be ascribed to their specific porous structure (2–5 nm pores) and high surface area (457 m<sup>2</sup>/g), providing numerous active sites for Li<sup>+</sup> insertion, high electrical conductivity, low charge-transfer resistance across the electrolyte–electrode interface and improved structural stability against the local volume change during Li<sup>+</sup> insertion–extraction. Such electrodes are envisioned to be mass scalable with relatively simple and low-cost fabrication procedures, thereby providing a clear pathway toward commercialization.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep29854.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>30</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep29854" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep29854</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Li-ion battery (LIB) has shown a great potential to fulfil the growing energy demands for hybrid electric vehicle, smart grid applications and portable electronic devices, due to its advantages such as high power and energy density, long cycle life and structure stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The energy density and performance of LIBs are largely determined by the chemical and physical properties of the cathode and anode materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

Graphene has been demonstrated to be a promising anode material for LIBs due to its intriguing physical and chemical properties, such as high electrical conductivity, large specific surface area and mechanical robustness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. However, due to the large surface area and strong van der Waals interaction between sheets, the graphene nanosheets are prone to aggregation after drying to form a paper-like structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. As a result, although the in-plane diffusivity of Li<sup>+</sup>ions in the graphene stack is high, their cross-plane diffusivity is low and the migration of Li<sup>+</sup>ions into and out of the graphene anode may occur predominantly at the edge of the stack. This greatly limits the electrochemical performance, particularly at high C rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p>In a quest to overcome the aforementioned limitations of graphene, the focus of current research is to improve the electrochemical performance of graphene by creating holes into the planar sheet, since the holes can provide a high density of crossplane diffusion channels for Li<sup>+</sup>ions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In particular, the nanopores in HRGO sheets are large enough to function as the ion diffusion shortcuts between different layers of graphene to greatly speed up the ion transport across the entire film and facilitate ion access to the entire surface area, which is not possible with non-holey graphene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Together, these combined features make it possible for HRGO to achieve high volumetric capacitance while retaining high gravimetric capacitance and excellent rate capability.</p><p>For the bulk preparation of graphene, a standard method starts with strong oxidation of natural graphite into graphene oxide (GO) that is dispersible in aqueous solutions as exfoliated monolayer or few-layered sheets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The exfoliated GO sheets may then be chemically or thermally converted into graphene–or more accurately “reduced graphene oxide” (RGO). Recently, there have been a few reports on novel types of graphene structures that feature large pore openings (i.e., holes) on the conjugated carbon surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Compared to conventional defects that often take extensive efforts to observe using high-resolution microscopic techniques<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, the pore openings in these novel holey graphene (HRGO) structures are much larger (ranging from a few to hundreds of nanometres) and are easily identified.</p><p>In this work, we report a conceptually different approach to enhance the power capability of graphene-based electrodes, by introducing holes into graphene sheets using Ag nanoparticles by a facile microwave irradiation method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of microwave irradiated holey graphene (HRGO) electrodes in LIB. The results have shown an excellent electrochemical response in terms of charge/discharge capacity, rate capability and cyclic performance. This method can be extended to rational design of HRGO and its hybrids with new functionalities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental Details</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p>Extra pure graphite powder (&gt;99.5%) was purchased from Merck and hydrazine hydrate (HH, 80%) was obtained from Loba Chemi.

The yellow dispersion of GO gradually changed to a black color indicating the completion of the chemical reduction to RGO. The RGO sheets decorated with Ag nanoparticles were separated using a centrifuge operated at 5000 rpm for 15 min and dried at 60 °C overnight.

Upon cooling, the slurry was centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded. The solid was then repeatedly washed with water in up to ten more redispersion–centrifugation cycles until the supernatant reached neutral (pH ~ 7).

The high intensity peaks in Ag/RGO spectrum is due to the interfacial interaction of AgNPs with the surface oxygen functionalities of RGO<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. The FTIR spectrum of HRGO as shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows that the intensities of the absorption bands, which can be ascribed to carboxyl, hydroxyl and epoxy oxygen groups as in the FTIR spectrum of the Ag/RGO (see inset of <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), are reduced. This indicates that the oxygen containing groups have been effectively reduced and Ag has been removed during the formation of HRGO.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>FTIR spectra of Ag/RGO and HRGO samples.</p><p>Inset shows the zoomed area.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep29854_Fig2_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p><xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows the XRD pattern of the Ag/RGO and HRGO samples in which porous structure and the crystallinity of the HRGO can be further demonstrated. The XRD pattern of the Ag/RGO exhibits characteristic diffraction peaks of Ag and RGO, which is very well matched with the standard JCPDS of Ag<sup>0</sup> (ICDD 04-0783). Intensity of Ag peaks is stronger than that of the RGO peaks which shows that Ag is reside successfully on the surface of the RGO sheets. Interestingly, the XRD pattern of the HRGO exhibits weak (001) reflection, indicating well-aligned sheet-to-sheet structures. As shown in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, the XRD pattern of the HRGO exhibits a strong diffraction peak at diffraction angle of ~25.6 degree and other weak peaks correspond to HRGO, suggesting a porous structure of HRGO formed by the stacking of the sheets<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. No peak related to Ag was observed in the XRD pattern of HRGO, indicating that Ag was successfully removed and created holes. The broad peak width indicates the non-uniformity of these holes, which is consistent with the microstructures of the HRGO building blocks. Despite the holey properties of the starting graphene sample, such as electron mobility, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity and mechanical properties, should be largely preserved. It is these properties of graphene that make it such an attractive material, so the fact that the HRGO samples retain them is very important for their subsequent applications that are dependent upon these properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>XRD patterns of Ag/RGO and HRGO samples.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep29854_Fig3_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p><xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(a)</xref> depicts the TEM image of RGO sheets, in which clear sheet like structure is visible. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4b</xref> show the TEM images of Ag/RGO revealing a sheet like structure on which Ag nanoparticles can be clearly seen. The metallic Ag nanoparticles were well distributed on the RGO surface (see <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) and single Ag nanoparticle on RGO sheet is shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4c</xref>. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4d</xref> shows a TEM image of the HRGO obtained from Ag nanoparticles on RGO sheets via the microwave reaction, followed by refluxing with nitric acid. The holey structure of the graphene sheets can be clearly visualized where RGO sheets consists of holes in the basal planes of graphene. No Ag nanoparticles were visually found by microscopic analysis of the final product of HRGO. In addition, the lack of Ag signals for these samples analyzed using both XPS and XRD confirmed the complete removal of the metal. After nitric acid treatment of Ag/RGO sample in microwave, a significant amount of holes appeared on the surface of RGO sheets as shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4d</xref>. Most holes were associated with at least one Ag nanoparticle which is clear in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4e</xref>. Some holes also appeared as tracks, which were apparently associated with directional motion of the attached Ag nanoparticles. Nevertheless, Ag nanoparticles with larger sizes typically yielded holes of larger diameters (or tracks of larger widths). Each hole or track might not have originated from only one Ag nanoparticle since those from multiple adjacent Ag nanoparticles could merge to form branched tracks or one single hole. Therefore, the above observations clearly indicate that Ag nanoparticles catalysed the oxidation of the graphene carbon atoms that were in contact with them, while the carbons that were not associated with the noble metal nanoparticles remained unaffected in the graphene structure. The holes in these samples penetrated the entire thicknesses of most HRGO nanosheets. The underlying stacks of HRGO sheets were clearly visible through these holes and tracks, which suggest better access for the electrolyte into the entire HRGO structure and hence better lithium-ion transport and intercalation mechanisms. Therefore, the electrolyte can penetrate deep into the HRGO anode not only via the holes and tracks on the film surface but also along the in-plane direction through the large continuous channels that are formed between the expanded HRGO sheets. This could play an important role in facilitating lithium-ion diffusion and intercalation, particularly at high charge/discharge rates.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>TEM images of (<bold>a</bold>) RGO, (<bold>b</bold>) Ag/RGO, (<bold>c</bold>) single Ag nanoparticles on RGO sheet, (<bold>d</bold>) HRGO at low magnification, (<bold>e</bold>) HRGO at high magnification.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep29854_Fig4_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>To study the key role of Ag in the preparation of HRGO, the product RGO was prepared in similar process but without Ag. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> shows the FESEM images of RGO without Ag in which only nanosheets were observed and there is no existence of holes in the sheets of RGO.

Their adsorption–desorption isotherms exhibit a typical IV hysteresis loop (<xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>), which is characteristic of mesopores with different pore sizes. Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) calculations disclose that the pore size distribution is in the range of 2–5 nm (<xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>). A high BET surface area of 457 m<sup>2</sup>/g is observed for the HRGO, which is significantly higher than that of natural graphite (8.5 m<sup>2</sup>/g), pristine graphene (275 m<sup>2</sup>/g) and the pure holey graphene foam (131 m<sup>2</sup>/g) reported in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Because the BET surface area mainly originated from the mesopores and micropores, we further conducted a methylene blue (MB) adsorption investigation to evaluate the macroporous surface area of the HRGO. According to the surface area measurement using methylene blue method, the HRGO has a specific surface area of 945 m<sup>2</sup>/g, which is higher than that of the surface area obtained from BET analysis.<fig id="Fig10"><label>Figure 10</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of the HRGO.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep29854_Fig10_HTML.jpg"/></fig><fig id="Fig11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>BJH pore size distribution plot of HRGO.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep29854_Fig11_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The adsorption of MB has a long history of use as a method of surface area determination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>; it has been adopted widely for solids of a variable nature (oxides, graphite, yeast, activate carbons, etc.)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. It was found that there were relatively large differences between the surface area values obtained by solution Adsorption (S<sub>MB</sub>) and by nitrogen adsorption (S<sub>BET</sub>). The surface are obtained by MB adsorption method is usually higher than that of the nitrogen adsorption BET method. The surface area of HRGO obtained by MB adsorption method was found to be higher than that obtained by nitrogen adsorption BET method. This can be attributed to the swelling property of HRGO. In liquids, HRGO sheets can be separated by penetration of liquid molecules between sheets. This leads to the characteristic swelling of HRGO in certain liquids, particularly in water. Because the individual sheets within the crystal can be separated in the HRGO, not only the external area, but also internal surface area is available. Owing to the penetration of MB cations in aqueous solutions between the sheets of the HRGO, the surface area of HRGO was found to be higher than that of by BET method. The existence of the holes in the HRGO can facilitate the transport of lithium ions in HRGO, allowing a better access of the graphene structure to the electrolyte. This along with the large surface area, which increases the active sites for the lithium ion intercalation, makes us believe that the obtained HRGO can exhibit improved performance as an anode in LIBs.</p><p>In order to evaluate the performance of HRGO sheets, we investigated electrochemical response in terms of Li intercalation and deintercalation. In this work, for the sake of clarity, a typical charge/discharge cycle is defined as (i) a charge cycle; when Li insertion occurs until a lower limit voltage (0.005 V) is reached (ii) a discharge cycle; when Li extraction occurs until a cut-off voltage (3 V) is reached. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure 12</xref> shows the 1st, 2nd and 3rd galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of HRGO sample from 0.005 to 3.0 V at a current density of 100 mA/g. The voltage profiles in <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12</xref> confirm the intercalation of the Li ions into the electrode structure. During first charge cycle, a voltage plateau at around 0.9 V is observed which is briefly maintained until the voltage drops steadily to 0.005 V. The discharge capacity during first cycle is observed at a high value of 423 mAh/g. The irreversible capacity loss observed during the first cycle is mainly attributed to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the surface of the HRGO electrode and/or the reaction of lithium ions with the residual oxygen-containing functional groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. To confirm the role of the holes in the HRGO can facilitate the transport of lithium ions in HRGO, charge/discharge analysis of RGO without holes was performed and compared with the HRGO. It is clear from galvanostatic charge/discharge curves of RGO without holes as shown in <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">Fig. 13</xref> that the discharge capacity of 164 mAh/g for the 1<sup>st</sup> cycle was observed, which is ~2.5 fold less than the discharge capacity of HRGO.

Initially, degradation in the value of cell capacity is observed at 100 mA/g, but stabilizes at a relatively constant value once the material has gone through repeated cycles. At 200 mA/g, the material capacity is 293 mAh/g, while at high current density of 400 mA/g, the capacity was decreased to 85 mAh/g. During the test, the material behavior is very stable with no abnormal drift even at high current densities; in fact, by reducing the current density back to 100 mA/g the cell capacity is completely restored.<fig id="Fig14"><label>Figure 14</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Rate capabilities of the HRGO at various current densities.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep29854_Fig14_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>The results of cyclic performance test are also quite remarkable as shown in <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">Fig. 15</xref>.

Each Nyquist plot is composed of a semicircle in the high-medium frequency region and a linear tail in the low frequency region, which are ascribed to the charge transfer and mass transfer of Li<sup>+</sup>ions, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. The diameter of the semicircle for the 1<sup>st</sup> cycle corresponding to a resistance of 37.4 ohm. However, for the 10<sup>th</sup> cycle, the spectra show a significant increase in the diameter of the semicircle which resulted to the increase in the charge transfer resistance to 57.1 ohm. The charge transfer resistance of the HRGO after 1<sup>st</sup> cycle is only 37.4 ohms, prominently lower than those reported for graphene-based materials (40–70 ohms), indicating the charger transfer and mass transfer of lithium ions was much more conductive. To see the effect of holes on charge transfer, EIS measurements of RGO without holes was performed and charge transfer resistance of both the RGO without holes and HRGO compared. It was observed from nyquist plot of RGO without holes as shown in <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">Fig. 20</xref> that charge transfer resistance is much higher than that of HRGO, which indicates that holes might play key role in the enhanced electrochemical performance. The low charge-transfer resistance of the HRGO can be attributed to its porous structure, which allows improved diffusivity of Li ions in the electrode and a better access for the electrolyte into the HRGO. These results showed that the enhanced electrochemical performance of the HRGO demonstrated above is due to the combined result of its improved Li-ion diffusivity and decreased charge-transfer resistance. The porous structure of HRGO can greatly reduce the effective diffusion distance for the Li ions and buffer against the local volume change during Li insertion–extraction, resulting in greatly improved rate capability and cycling stability. This along with its large surface area, which provides more active sites for Li insertion, greatly increases the performance of the HRGO anode.<fig id="Fig19"><label>Figure 19</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Electrochemical impedance spectra of HRGO from 100 kHz to 1 Hz in the form of Nyquist plots obtained for cells after 1<sup>st</sup> cycle and 10<sup>th</sup> cycle.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep29854_Fig19_HTML.jpg"/></fig><fig id="Fig20"><label>Figure 20</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Electrochemical impedance spectra of RGO without holes from 100 kHz to 1 Hz in the form of Nyquist plots obtained for cells after 1<sup>st</sup> cycle.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep29854_Fig20_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A novel microwave irradiation method combined with Ag nanoparticles deposition on the RGO sheets and then acid treatment procedure has been used for the fabrication of HRGO. XRD, Raman, UV, XPS and morphological characterization confirmed the successful removal of Ag nanoparticles in Ag/RGO product, which then finally resulted to unique HRGO structure. The random stacking of the HRGO leads to the formation of a 3-dimensional porous solid, which can be used as a superior anode material for LIBs. A good electrochemical response in terms of charge/discharge capacity, rate capability, cyclic performance and columbic efficiency was observed. This excellent performance is because of the holey structure of HRGO which provide more active sites for Li insertion, high electrical conductivity, low charge-transfer resistance across the electrolyte– electrode interface, reduced effective diffusion distance for the Li ions and improved structural stability against the local volume change during Li insertion–extraction. In near future, this research will open up a new direction on the potential applications of HRGO with their conductive nature of and their porous structure to be used as advanced electrode materials in energy storage applications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Alsharaeh, E. <italic>et al</italic>.
