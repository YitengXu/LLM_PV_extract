Mini-Panel Neuronal Immaturity in Schizophrenia</title></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>1.1 GABA Signaling in Postmortem Human Brain and Schizophrenia: A Question of Immaturity?</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Joel E. Kleinman<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Lieber Institute for Brain Development, Baltimore, Maryland</title><p id="Par2"><bold>Background:</bold> GABA signaling abnormalities have been reported frequently in postmortem schizophrenia studies. Although the expression in GAD67 expression is probably one of the most replicated findings to date, there have been relatively few studies of this finding with respect to genetic variation or brain development. Similarly, the switch from GABA as an excitatory to inhibitory neurotransmitter in human brain mediated by two genes, NKCC1 and KCC2, has only recently been explored. We have had the opportunity to study both genetic variation and expression in genes in this pathway (GAD1, GAD2, SLC12A2 (NKCC1) and SLC12A5 (KCC2) across human brain development in hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in a large cohort of normals and patients with schizophrenia, bipolar illness and major depression.</p><p id="Par3"><bold>Methods:</bold> We have studied over 238 normal human brains in both DLPFC and hippocampus ranging in age from week 14 in the fetus to 80 years of age, using Illumina microchip arrays, qRT-PCR and RNA Seq. In addition there are 30–76 patients with schizophrenia (depending on the brain region and assay) and 63 patients with affective disorders. Each brain has been genotyped with 650K to 1 million SNP chips from Illumina and screened for neuropathology, toxicology and high quality RNA.</p><p id="Par4"><bold>Results:</bold> First and foremost, there are a number of previously unknown transcripts for each of these genes. Moreover, in every instance there are transcripts that are preferentially expressed in fetal human brain. Second, normal brain development is associated with switching from transcripts that are preferentially expressed in fetal human brain to transcripts that are preferentially expressed postnatally. For example, this is clearly the case with GAD 25 and GAD67, two transcripts expressed by GAD1. Similarly, the switch from GABA being excitatory to inhibitory is mediated by relative ratios that favor NKCC1 prenatally to ones that favor KCC2 postnatally. Moreover, both switches are associated with rs3749034, a SNP in the GAD1 promoter associated with increased risk for schizophrenia (p&lt;.05 for GAD25 and GAD67 and p&lt;.004)). A second SNP in NKCC1, rs3087889, is also associated with increased risk for schizophrenia and a novel transcripts for NKCC1 (p&lt;.03). Moreover, it appears as if there are differences in expression in a number of transcripts for each of these genes especially NKCC1 and KCC2 that confer neuroanatomical and diagnostic specificity with regard to both schizophrenia and affective disorders (p&lt;.05).</p><p id="Par5"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Human brain development in both PFC and hippocampus is characterized by numerous alternative transcripts whose expression switch dramatically both pre- and postnatally. A number of these changes are associated with genetic variation some of which are associated with increased risk for schizophrenia. Lastly, there is neuroanatomical and diagnostic specificity for both schizophrenia and affective disorders arguing against those that think these are one illness.</p><p id="Par6"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> J.

Previously, we reported that mice heterozygous for a null mutation of alpha-CaMKII, a key molecule in synaptic plasticity, have profoundly dysregulated behaviors, including hyper-locomotor activity and a severe working memory deficit, which are endophenotypes of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. We found that almost all the neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG) of these mutant mice fail to mature at molecular, morphological and electrophysiological levels. We named this phenotype ‘immature dentate gyrus (iDG)’.</p><p id="Par8"><bold>Methods:</bold> To identify the additional strains of mutant mice that potentially possess the iDG phenotype, we screened approximately 120 additional lines for behavioral phenotypes similar to the ones seen in alpha-CaMKII heterozygous KO mice. We then analyzed gene expression patterns in the dentate gyrus of the mice showing analogous behavioral phenotypes, as well as more detailed analysis using immunohistochemical, electrophysiological and bioinformatics techniques. We also examined the dentate gyrus of non-mutant mouse models displaying analogous behavioral profiles (including chronic fluoxetine and single-dose pilocarpine administration) for iDG, as well as post-mortem brains from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients.</p><p id="Par9"><bold>Results:</bold> We identified several other strains of mutant mice that have a phenotype strikingly similar to iDG, including forebrain-specific calcineurin knockout mice, mice lacking the transcription factor Schnurri-2 (Shn-2), and mice with a point mutation in the SNAP-25 gene. We also found that chronic fluoxetine treatment or a single pilocarpine administration induced ‘dematuration,’ resulting in an iDG-like phenotype in wild-type mice. Most of the strains of the mice with iDG phenotype have decreased parvalbumin, GAD67 and oligodendrocyte markers. Moreover, gene- and protein expression patterns in the brains of these mice were similar to those found in the post-mortem brains of the patients of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The brains of iDG mice show mild chronic inflammation, distinct from typical acute inflammation, as revealed by bioinformatics analyses. Anti-inflammatory drugs reversed the cellular/molecular iDG phenotype as well as some behavioral abnormalities in a subset of mutant mice. Surprisingly, the iDG phenotype of Shn-2 knockout mice was not observed at two weeks after birth but emerged after weaning, which may correspond to the human developmental period during which schizophrenia appears in early adulthood. Interestingly, iDG-like phenomena was seen in the post-mortem brains of the patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.</p><p id="Par10"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The dentate gyrus is considered to play important role in the regulation of emotion, learning and memory, and the functional disturbance of this region could potentially underlie some symptoms in neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, iDG represents a promising endophenotype of neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and epilepsy. We discuss the potential implication of these findings in elucidating the pathophysiology of those neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><p id="Par11"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> T.

Support from Investigations on Proteoglycan Expression</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sabina Berretta<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec10"><title>McLean Hospital, Belmont, Massachusetts</title><p id="Par12"><bold>Background:</bold> Converging lines of evidence indicate that chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) regulate neuronal differentiation, maturation and migration during development. Their cellular pattern of expression and biochemical characteristics have been shown to change during development according to cell differentiation stages. During late postnatal development, CSPGs organize into specialized extracellular matrix structures, ie perineuronal nets (PNNs), surrounding distinct populations of neurons. PNN formation represents a key stage of neuronal maturation and culminates with the closure of critical periods of development. We have shown that PNNs are markedly reduced in the medial temporal lobe of subjects with schizophrenia (SZ). PNN decreases suggest that the neuronal population predominantly associated with them, ie GABAergic neurons expressing parvalbumin, may not have reached full maturity in this disorder. To test the hypothesis that CSPG abnormalities may be associated with a disruption of neuronal maturation, we investigated CSPG expression in the olfactory epithelium (OE) of subjects with SZ. The OE is a continuously regenerating neural tissue where stem cells differentiate and mature into olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) throughout adult life. Notably, the OE shows neuron lineage abnormalities in subjects with SZ. Among factors potentially contributing to these OE abnormalities, CSPGs represent compelling candidates.</p><p id="Par13"><bold>Methods:</bold> CSPG expression analysis in OE from non-psychiatric control and SZ subjects in postmortem tissue and OE cell lines was performed using combinations of single and multiple antigen immunocytochemistry, ELISA, and computer-assisted microscopy. Cell lines derived from OE biopsies were tested for CSPG expression in differentiating, phenotypically identified, cells <italic>in vitro.</italic></p><p id="Par14"><bold>Results:</bold> ‘Cytoplasmic’ CSPG (c-CSPG) labeling was detected in sustentacular cells and some olfactory receptor neurons (<italic>c-</italic>CSPG+ORNs), while ‘pericellular’ CSPG (p-CSPG) labeling was found in basal cells and some ORNs (<italic>p</italic>-CSPG+ORNs). Dual labeling for CSPG and markers for mature and immature ORNs suggests that <italic>c-</italic>CSPG+ORNs correspond to mature ORNs, and <italic>p</italic>-CSPG+ORNs to immature ORNs. Numerical densities of <italic>c-</italic>CSPG+ORNs were significantly decreased in SZ (p <italic>p</italic>-CSPG+ORNs (110.71% increase) and CSPG+ basal cells (53.71% decrease), did not reach statistical significance, the ratio of <italic>p</italic>-CSPG+ORNs/ CSPG+ basal cells was significantly increased (<italic>p</italic>=0.03) in SZ. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown thus far a pattern of p-CSPG to c-CSPG expression during differentiation that corresponds to CSPG sulfation patterns and core protein transitions.</p><p id="Par15"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results suggest that ORN maturation involves a transition of CSPG distribution from the cell surface to the cytoplasm. This pattern is altered in subjects with SZ. CSPG abnormalities were found to affect prevalently putative mature ORNs and the ratio of immature ORN and basal cells expressing CSPGs. Together with previous results (Arnold <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001) showing no change of mature ORNs in the OE of subjects with SZ, the present findings suggest that decreased densities of mature CSPG-positive ORNs reflect reduced CSPG expression in these cells. This reduction may be due to reduced synthesis and failure of these cells to fully transition to a mature pattern of CSPG expression. Together with findings in medial temporal lobe, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that maturation of distinct neuronal populations may be disturbed in SZ and point to CSPG abnormalities as a contributing factor.</p><p id="Par16"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> S.

Szeszko<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Glen Oaks, New York</title><p id="Par18"><bold>Background:</bold> Intact social cognitive processes are critical for successful social functioning and are considered to be unique and powerful determinants of functional outcome above and beyond neurocognition. Network analysis of structural and functional brain imaging phenotypes has been useful in the identification of brain abnormalities in psychiatric disorders; however, schizophrenia is heterogeneous and results have been inconsistent. We thus examined networks of brain structure and resting state fMRI activity in a subgroup of patients with schizophrenia characterized by strong negative symptom burden and poor social functioning classified as having the ‘deficit syndrome.’</p><p id="Par19"><bold>Methods:</bold> Brain-wide inter-regional correlations in cortical thickness were examined in schizophrenia patients ranked in the top (deficit patients; <italic>N</italic>=14) and bottom (nondeficit patients; <italic>N</italic>=14) quartile of deficit scores and compared to matched healthy volunteers (<italic>n</italic>=14 per group). Networks were derived by thresholding correlation matrices (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 corrected) and node centrality measures were used to identify brain regions that play the most important role in network organization. A subgroup (<italic>N</italic>=27) of patients also completed resting state fMRI exams. We calculated spatial inter-correlations (‘expression scores’) among independent component templates (Biswal <italic>et al</italic>, 2010) and corresponding individual maps were obtained following dual regression analysis.</p><p id="Par20"><bold>Results:</bold> Investigation of the structural neuroimaging data revealed a larger number of strong positive correlations in the network among deficit patients compared to healthy volunteers and nondeficit patients. This pattern yielded an overall network that had an increased density of connections. Investigation of brain-wide correlations revealed frontoparietal and frontotemporal correlations that were stronger in the deficit patients compared to the healthy volunteers and correlations with the cingulate gyrus that were stronger in the deficit group compared to the nondeficit group. Analysis of resting state fMRI measures indicated that among patients ‘deficit score’ correlated significantly (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) with expression scores. Specifically, more severe ‘deficit scores’ were associated with lower expression scores within cortical midline structures including the posterior cingulate, which is responsible for self-integration and a parieto-fontal network encompassing the parietal lobes, inferior frontal gyrus and posterior temporal lobe that partially overlapped regions found to be abnormal in the structural imaging analysis.</p><p id="Par21"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The increase in network density and decrease in resting state fMRI expression scores among patients classified as having the deficit syndrome may reflect decreased specificity and potentially decreased differentiation of brain regions. Many regions of increased centrality and lower resting state fMRI expression in the deficit network are part of the frontoparietal ‘mirror neuron’ system, which is important for emotion experience sharing. The posterior cingulate cortex is part of the cortical midline circuit that comprises the default mode network important for mental state attribution and correlations with this region distinguish deficit from nondeficit patients. Social cognitive processes that are impaired in the deficit form of schizophrenia and these alterations may serve as neurobiological correlates of this disease subtype.</p><p id="Par22"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> P.

However, a subset of patients with schizophrenia (with the ‘deficit’ form of illness) may represent one end of a continuum of neurobiological and social impairment among patients with major psychoses. We sought to compare patients characterized by strong negative symptom burden and poor social function, who have been classified as ‘deficit syndrome’, to nondeficit patients with minimal negative symptom burden and bipolar disorder patients, using a brain network connectivity approach, and relate abnormal brain circuitry to impairment in social function.</p><p id="Par24"><bold>Methods:</bold> Following high resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging, and diffusion tensor imaging, brain-wide inter-regional correlations in cortical thickness were examined in schizophrenia subjects ranked in the top (<italic>n</italic>=18 deficit subjects) and bottom (<italic>n</italic>=18 nondeficit subjects) quartile of deficit scores using the same approach as in the accompanying abstract by Szeszko <italic>et al.</italic> Then, <italic>n</italic>=32 deficit, <italic>n</italic>=32 nondeficit subjects, and <italic>n</italic>=32 healthy controls were combined from the Hillside and Toronto samples. In addition, <italic>n</italic>=32 bipolar subjects were compared to <italic>n</italic>=32 controls using the same network topology methods to investigate cortical thickness networks across the major psychoses. A subset of schizophrenia patients (<italic>n</italic>=22) completed the quality of life scale (QLS). Correlations with altered brain network structure in relation to social and functional outcome measures were examined.</p><p id="Par25"><bold>Results:</bold> Deficit schizophrenia subjects demonstrated a larger number of strong positive correlations among cortical regions compared to individuals with nondeficit schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or healthy controls subjects resulting in a network with increased density of connections. The network in the deficit subjects contained an increased number of highly central nodes such as the supramarginal, superior temporal and inferior frontal gyri (ie, fronto-parietal) that were less prominent in the nondeficit and control networks. In addition, highly central nodes were also found in cortical midline regions, specifically cingulate and parahippocampal gyrus. No network differences were detected between bipolar and matched healthy control groups. The different network structure identified was significant at Bonferroni corrected p value of 0.05. Mean diffusivity of the right arcuate fasciculus, the white matter tract connecting the fronto-parietal circuit was inversely correlated with the QLS interpersonal subscale (<italic>r</italic>=−0.49, <italic>p</italic>=0.02).</p><p id="Par26"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Deficit syndrome subjects demonstrated an increased network density compared to nondeficit subjects, bipolar subjects, and healthy controls, who all demonstrated similar network density. Increased network density in deficit subjects was particularly prominent in fronto-parietal and cortical midline circuitry. Fronto-parietal circuitry in particular has been related to social impairment in autism spectrum disorders. Our findings clearly demonstrate differences in cortical regions comprising fronto-parietal circuitry in deficit patients, who have severe social impairment compared to other patients with major psychoses, who are less socially impaired. We directly related impairment in this circuit to impairment in social function using the QLS. These interregional fronto-parietal and cortical midline alterations may serve as neurobiological correlates of a subgroup of especially socially impaired (deficit) people with schizophrenia. The fronto-parietal circuit should be considered as a useful biomarker and treatment target of impaired social function in people with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.</p><p id="Par27"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> A.

Buchanan<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, Baltimore, Maryland</title><p id="Par28"><bold>Background:</bold> People with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs) are characterized by marked impairments in social function. These impairments severely impact quality of life, and predict relapse, poor illness course, and unemployment. Over the past decade, considerable progress has been made in delineating the social cognitive processes that underlie these impairments. However, much less is known about the neural circuitry that supports these processes. The NIMH RDoC initiative provides a framework for evaluating the neural basis of social cognition. In the context of the RDoC Systems for Social Processes Domain: the Perception and Understanding of Others, the right fronto-parietal network has been hypothesized to subserve ‘lower-level’ social cognitive processes necessary for understanding the actions and basic emotions of others, and the cortical midline circuit, has been hypothesized to subserve ‘higher-level’ processes necessary for understanding the perspective of others (theory of mind). In order to evaluate the hypothesized involvement of the fronto-parietal network in social function impairments, we have conducted diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies in three independent samples to examine this circuit in people with the deficit form of schizophrenia, a form of schizophrenia characterized by impaired social function.</p><p id="Par29"><bold>Methods:</bold> Study 1: Twenty participants with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (deficit: <italic>n</italic>=10 and nondeficit: <italic>n</italic>=10) and 11 healthy subjects participated in this study. Study 2: Thirty-six participants with DSM-IV schizophrenia (deficit: <italic>n</italic>=18 and nondeficit: <italic>n</italic>=18) and 18 healthy subjects participated in this study. Study 3: Fifty-one participants with DSM-IV schizophrenia (deficit: <italic>n</italic>=14 and nondeficit: <italic>n</italic>=37) participated in this study. DTI was used to assess the integrity of the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), the major white matter tract connecting the frontal and parietal lobes.</p><p id="Par30"><bold>Results:</bold> Study 1: There was a significant FA group difference for the right hemisphere SLF (F=3.6 df=2,27; <italic>p</italic>=0.04). The deficit group had lower FA than the healthy control group (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) lower FA compared to the nondeficit group within the right and left SLF, genu of the corpus callosum, splenium of the corpus callosum, posterior cingulate and right and left inferior longitudinal fasciculus.</p><p id="Par31"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The finding of lower FA in the right SLF/arcuate fasciculus in three independent samples is consistent with the hypothesis that disruptions in white matter integrity hypothesized to subserve ‘lower-level’ social cognitive processes play a role in the pathophysiology of the deficit form of schizophrenia.</p><p id="Par32"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> R.

Behavioral deficits observed in autism and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) span at least four distinguishable symptom clusters: physiological and neurological health; arousal, anxiety, and regulatory systems; social interaction and communication; behavioral inflexibility and cognition. Recent identification of copy number variants associated with autism provides the opportunity to model aspects of this disorder in genetically modified mouse models. A challenge, however, is to develop appropriate, objective behavioral measures that are easily adapted to various labs so that results can be compared across laboratory environments and different mouse models.</p><p id="Par35"><bold>Methods:</bold> We have developed a novel, automated, high-resolution video analysis software system that enables us to score large amounts of behavioral data, including activity, sleep/wake states, response to novelty, and social interactions. Using these approaches, we have examined the impact of the hemizygous deletion mutants 16p11.2<sup>del/+</sup> on a B6/129 F1 background. We use recently developed algorithms for the high-throughput analysis of video of home cage behaviors and during behavioral tasks to define objectively and quantitatively the impact of these mutations on a battery of behaviors that measure physiological and neurological health; arousal, anxiety, and regulatory systems; social interaction and communication as well as behavioral inflexibility and cognition in three age groups (before, during, and after puberty).</p><p id="Par36"><bold>Results:</bold> Phenotypic data from the characterization of many lines of genetically modified mice is limited by the use of low-resolution video or infrared beam-break detection systems and by the need to perform labor-intensive manual scoring of the data. We have developed automated approaches to analyze high-resolution video data to characterize a variety of behaviors in mice. We have applied this to genetically modified mice, to models of traumatic brain injury and to models of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. We will describe our phenotyping approach (termed ‘autotyping’) and present our findings on the behavioral impact of the hemizygous deletion in 16p11.2<sup>del/+</sup> mutant mice. Recurrent copy number variation has been linked to a number of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. There is particular interest surrounding the 16p11.2 region because copy number variations have been associated with various disorders. Duplication of this region is associated with autism and schizophrenia, whereas deletion of this region is associated with autism. Mouse models were created carrying deletions of the 16p11.2 region (which corresponds to a region on mouse chromosome 7) have been created (Horev <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011, PNAS). In our initial studies of 16p11.2<sup>del/+</sup> mutant mice, we have observed cognitive deficits consistent with altered extinction and behavior flexibility, consistent with some of the cognitive impairments observed in individuals with autism. Using a systems-level approach with more advanced statistical methods, known as principle component analysis, linear discriminate analysis and support vector machines we are identifying combinations of behavioral features that are altered in this genomic deletion model and defining the relationship between the altered behaviors.</p><p id="Par37"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our video-based analysis of mouse behavior enables us to examine complex behavioral phenotypes and define how specific components of these behaviors are altered in mouse models of neurological, psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. We have used this approach to define the impact of hemizygous deletion of genes in the 16p11.2 region of the human genome in mouse models, identifying alterations in behavioral inflexibility and cognition.</p><p id="Par38"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> T.

First, syndromic disorders including those associated with syndromic ASDs (such as del22q11.2, del22q13, dup7q11.23, and dup17p11.2) associated with congenital malformation syndromes could be distinguished from those with non-syndromic ASD on the basis of the total number of large CNVs and whether the variants are inherited or <italic>de novo</italic>. Second, comparison of CNV data from individuals with dyslexia, ASD, intellectual disability and congenital malformation suggested a strong correlation of total CNV load with the neurological severity of the disorder; individuals having ASD and intellectual disability show increased base pairs of copy number change compared to those having ASD without intellectual disability. Third, comparison of genetic and clinical data from individuals with ASD and severe intellectual disability suggest etiological specificities. For example, a significant association of 1q21.1 duplications with ASD compared to intellectual disability. We also found that as the size of deletions increased, nonverbal IQ significantly decreased, with no impact on the severity of autism features; and as the size of duplications increased, autism severity significantly increased without any impact on nonverbal IQ.

An increasing number of studies, including several from our laboratory, have identified signaling cascades, including the mTORC1 signaling pathway, that couple neurotransmitter and neurotrophin receptors to the translation regulatory machinery during the formation of long-lasting synaptic plasticity and the consolidation of long-term memory. Interestingly, mutations in negative upstream regulators and downstream effectors of mTORC1, including fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) are associated with several types of developmental disability and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).</p><p id="Par50"><bold>Methods:</bold> FXS model mice and eIF4E transgenic (eIF4E Tg) mice were examined for exaggerated protein synthesis and altered translational control. First, we identified the altered translational control mechanisms in the brains of FXS and eIF4E Tg mice. Then we utilized genetic and pharmacological approaches to target the translational control molecules of interest, including eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) and p70 S6 kinase 1 (S6K1).</p><p id="Par51"><bold>Results:</bold> We found that genetic reduction of S6K1 in FXS model mice corrected exaggerated protein synthesis, abnormal synaptic plasticity, and multiple aberrant behaviors. We currently are determining whether treating FXS model mice with an inhibitor of S6K1 can reverse the aforementioned phenotypes. In addition, we have found that compounds that target eIF4F can reverse exaggerated protein synthesis and synaptic dysfunction in eIF4E Tg mice. Moreover, the eIF4F inhibitors reverse ASD-associated behaviors displayed by eIF4E Tg mice, including repetitive behaviors, behavioral inflexibility, and abnormal social behavior. We currently are determining whether the compounds that target eIF4F have similar effects on aberrant behaviors displayed by FXS model mice. In addition, we are determining the localization of the molecular and cellular alterations in the striatum that might explain the repetitive behaviors and behavioral inflexibiltiy of the eIF4E Tg mice.</p><p id="Par52"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our studies strongly suggest that exaggerated protein synthesis in mice triggers synaptic dysfunction and aberrant behaviors that are associated with ASD. These studies have revealed important links between abnormal translational control and synaptic dysfunction, as well as behaviors associated with ASD.

The serotonin 1A (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD in both animal models and human studies. We previously reported higher 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor binding in two cohorts of subjects with MDD during a major depressive episode (MDE) using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [<sup>11</sup>C]WAY-100635. This is a state phenomenon, not trait, as we have demonstrated that the effect persists in subjects who are remitted and off of medication. We have also shown that 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding is also associated with treatment outcome after non-standardized antidepressant treatment. Most recently, we examined whether pre-treatment 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding is associated with treatment outcome following standardized escitalopram treatment in MDD. We also compared 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding between all MDD subjects in this cohort and a sample of healthy controls.</p><p id="Par56"><bold>Methods:</bold> 24 MDD subjects in a current MDE underwent PET scanning with [<sup>11</sup>C]WAY-100635, acquiring a metabolite-corrected arterial input function and free-fraction measurement to estimate 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding (BP<sub>F</sub>=B<sub>max</sub>/K<sub>D</sub>, where B<sub>max</sub>=available receptors and K<sub>D</sub>=dissociation constant). Binding estimates were weighted according to their measurement precision, using standard errors estimated by a bootstrapping algorithm incorporating errors associated with fitting the metabolite curve, input function, and time activity curve (TAC) for each region of interest (ROI).

Across 12 cortical and subcortical regions, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding did not differ between remitters and non-remitters (<italic>p</italic>=0.86). 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> binding was higher in MDD than historical controls across all regions (<italic>p</italic>=0.0003), a triplication of our finding.

Two types of biosignatures are needed to achieve improved outcomes: (1) biosignatures to maximize the selection of optimal treatment for individual patients at beginning of treatment (moderators) and (2) biosignatures to identify indicators of eventual outcomes early in treatment (mediators). Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response for Clinical Care (EMBARC) aims to address both of these points and this approach has great potential to personalize treatment and to begin to characterize the biology of treatment response. The goal of this multi-site study (conducted across 4 sites) is to link a range of imaging, electrophysiological, blood based markers as well as behavioral/cognitive tasks to treatment response. EMBARC is designed to recruit 400 subjects in a two-step placebo-controlled RCT.Understanding the stability of the identified measures in the form of test-retest reliability and comparability across multiple sites of these measures is critical since detection of meditational effects is dependent on the ability to measure differences related to changes early in treatment.</p><p id="Par66"><bold>Methods:</bold> As a first step in conducting EMBARC we have completed a reliability study evaluating the performance of the full range of biomarkers in 40 healthy control subjects. This study was designed to provide reliability information (ie, does a given biomarker or test produce the same result each time it is given if there is no change in the subject) and comparability information (ie, does a given assessment or test produce the same result at each site if given to the same subject) about the measures proposed for the main EMBARC study. Measures include: a comprehensive clinical phenotype; cortical thickness—assessed through structural magnetic resonance imaging MRI); Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess cortical white matter tract integrity; Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to test connectivity and brain activation patterns in response to both emotional conflict and reward-dependent learning tasks; pulsed arterial spin labeling (ASL) to measure regional cerebral blood flow; Electroencephalography (EEG) to assess cortical and subcortical brain activation patterns, using advanced EEG processing techniques, collected at both resting state and via loudness dependency of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP); Behavioral neuropsychological tasks to include reaction time, motor processing speed, cognitive control, working memory, and reward conditioned learning.; DNA, mRNA, and plasma protein samples, before, during and after treatment.</p><p id="Par67"><bold>Results:</bold> Data have been collected from 40 healthy control subjects tested at each of the 4 EMBARC-HC study sites (up to 10/site).

Medication-free patients were assessed at pre-treatment baseline using a battery of computerized behavioral tests of core cognitive and emotional capacities implicated in depression, and randomized to receive sertraline, escitalopram or venlafaxine extended-release for eight weeks. A pattern classification approach was used to predict symptom remission by patient report on the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR16) and by clinician assessment with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD17), as well as real-world functional capacity using the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS). All treatment prediction classifiers controlled for baseline depression severity, age, education, gender and site, and results were verified through cross-validation. Given that the rate of remission in current practice is no more than chance level, we set a criterion of 60% as a clinically meaningful improvement (10%) on existing outcomes.

Symptom remission was predicted with 75% accuracy, and functional capacity status with 73% accuracy. These predictive classifiers significantly differentiated remission rate outcomes between study medications, especially sertraline versus escitalopram or venlafaxine.

Quirk<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec53"><title>University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine, San Juan, Puerto Rico</title><p id="Par81"><bold>Background:</bold> Many OCD patients exhibit compulsive behaviors that they believe protect them (or others) from imminent danger. These compulsions can be viewed as persistent avoidance responses to perceived threats, suggesting deficient fear extinction. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral capsule-ventral striatum (VC/VS) reduces compulsive behaviors in OCD, but little is known about the mechanism. DBS of the ventral striatum (VS) in rats during extinction training can either strengthen or weaken extinction memory, depending on the specific site within the VS. Ventral-VS DBS weakens extinction, whereas dorsal-VS DBS strengthens extinction and induces plasticity in extinction circuits (Rodriguez <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012). The marked differences between VS sites suggest that these regions contain distinct sets of myelinated fibers from cortex that are modulated by DBS.</p><p id="Par82"><bold>Methods:</bold> To test this hypothesis, we injected retrograde tracer WGA into the dorsal-VS or ventral-VS, and measured neuronal labeling in cortical areas using stereological techniques. Acceptable injection sites were analyzed for 4 rats (2 per site). Labeling was assessed in prelimbic (PL), infralimbic (IL), medial orbital (MO), ventrolateral orbital (VLO), and agranular insular (AI) cortices.</p><p id="Par83"><bold>Results:</bold> There was a robust projection from PL through both VS areas, but thee was no difference between sites (dorsal-VS: 46%; ventral-VS: 44%, <italic>p</italic>=0.64).

In contrast, IL and AI projected significantly more through the ventral-VS site than the dorsal-VS site (IL: 20 <italic>vs</italic> 2%; AI: 19 <italic>vs</italic> 3%, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). Thus, MO and VLO are likely to be involved in extinction facilitation by DBS, whereas IL and AI are likely to be involved in extinction impairment.</p><p id="Par84"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Physiological studies have suggested that DBS of VS can reduce activity in OFC neurons, by driving recurrent inhibition though antidromic activation of corticostriatal axons (McCracken and Grace, 2007). Our anatomical findings are consistent with this idea, because IL inhibition impairs extinction (Sierra-Mercado <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010), and IL axons were more abundant in the ventral-VS site. In contrast, fibers from MO and VLO were more abundant in the dorsal-VS site, suggesting that inhibition of these areas would strengthen extinction. We are currently testing this hypothesis. Inhibition of orbitofrontal areas with DBS is consistent with the orbitofrontal hyperactivity seen in OCD (Ursu and Carter, 2009).</p><p id="Par85"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> G.

However, in the small sample tested to date we found that DBS might reduce fear expression during extinction as well as extinction retention, something also seen in rodents undergoing DBS-like stimulation in a fear extinction paradigm.</p><p id="Par94"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> B.

Deep brain stimulation, that targets OFC fibers through the internal capsule (IC) and cingulatomy that targets the cingulate cortex and underlying cingulum bundle, are two neurosurgical therapeutic approaches for treatment resistant OCD. Each of these approaches target different connectivities, involving a different combination of brain regions. Yet both procedures are effective. This raises several questions: Are these 2 cortical regions directly connected; do they have common connections to other cortical areas; and what specific connectivities are involved at each site? Based on monkey tracing experiments we first determined the specific connections between the OFC and dACC, connections with other cortical areas, and the connections that pass through each target. We then tested how accurately we could demonstrate those pathways in the neurosurgically treated-patients.</p><p id="Par96"><bold>Methods:</bold> Tracing methods were used to define the projection pathways between cortical areas and from them through the internal capsule and cingulum bundle in monkeys. We used dMRI merged with structural MRIs and CT scans from DBS or cingulatomy patients. We placed ROI seeds specific to each patient's electrode contacts or lesion to determine the connections of those targets.</p><p id="Par97"><bold>Results:</bold> There are direct connections between the dACC and medial OFC, but not lateral OFC. The cingulum bundle carries cingulate to cingulate fibers; cingulate fibers to other cortical areas; other cortical fibers to cingulate cortex, other cortical fibers to non-cingulate cortex, and subcortical fibers to both cingulate and non-cingulate cortex. We previously showed the organization of OFC and dACC fibers through the IC. Using tractography in patients with DBS electrodes or cingulatomies, we found that several of these pathways could be accurately demonstrated in patients. Cingulatomies target a region of the bundle that carries not only cingulate fibers, but also several connections that do not originate or terminate within the cingulate cortex. In contrast, the internal capsule target for DBS captures a combination of vmPFC, OFC, dACC, and vlPFC fibers ascending and descending fibers, but not direct cortico-cortical axons.</p><p id="Par98"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Based on the monkey studies we could predict which connections from each seed were likely to be accurate and thus involved in these treatments. We demonstrate that these 2 sites have in common thalamic and brainstem cingulate connections, and ascending amygdala fibers. Of particular interest, cingulatomies capture OFC fibers passing to and terminating in the dACC. The IC site captures both OFC and dACC ascending and descending projections. However, long cortico-cortical connections that are interrupted by the lesion, are not directly involved at the DBS sites.</p><p id="Par99"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> S.

Past attempts to explain the physiological and behavioral actions of METH primarily focused on the biogenic amine transporters, in particular the dopamine (DAT) and vesicular monoamine (VMAT) transporters. However, experiments in our laboratory showed METH is also a potent full agonist of TAAR1 <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Gainetdinov<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec66"><title>Italian Institute of Technology, Genova, Italy</title><p id="Par106"><bold>Background:</bold> Structurally related to classical monoaminergic neurotransmitters, trace amines (such as beta-phenylethylamine, tyramine, octopamine and tryptamine) are found at low concentrations in the mammalian brain. Discovery of a group of G protein-coupled receptors, named trace amine associated receptors (TAARs) with some of them being activated by trace amines provided an opportunity to explore their functions. The trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1), which is in part associated with the monoaminergic neuronal circuitry, is the best characterized of the class, though still little is known about its regulation and function. TAAR1 can be activated not only by trace amines but also by a variety of monoaminergic compounds including amphetamines and monoamine metabolites.</p><p id="Par107"><bold>Methods:</bold> By applying various experimental paradigms aimed to model dopaminergic dysregulation in mice lacking TAAR1 and newly developed selective TAAR1 ligands we investigated the role of TAAR1 in modulating dopamine-related functions such as movement control. Furthermore, we investigated the biochemical mechanism of interaction between TAAR1 and D2 dopamine receptors and the role this interaction plays in D2R-related signaling and behaviors. Finally, we applied <italic>in vivo</italic> microdialysis and fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) to investigate neurochemical mechanisms involved.</p><p id="Par108"><bold>Results:</bold> In TAAR1 knockout (KO) mice and by using selective TAAR1 ligands, we observed that TAAR1 generally exerts an inhibitory influence on the locomotion, so TAAR1 agonists inhibit dopamine-dependent locomotor activity, while effects of dopaminergic stimulation is enhanced in TAAR1 knockout mice. In biochemical studies, we observed close functional interaction between TAAR1 and D2 dopamine receptors (D2R). Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor for cAMP in cellular assay, we demonstrated that the D2R antagonists haloperidol, raclopride, and amisulpride were able to enhance selectively a TAAR1-mediated increase of cAMP. Moreover, TAAR1 and D2R were able to form heterodimers when coexpressed in HEK cells, and this direct interaction was disrupted in the presence of haloperidol. In addition, in mice lacking TAAR1, haloperidol-induced striatal c-Fos expression and catalepsy were significantly reduced. A significant modulation of dopamine dynamics following TAAR1 activation was also observed in neurochemical studies.</p><p id="Par109"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data indicate that TAAR1 can affect dopamine neurotransmission via several mechanisms and that this modulatory influence can have important functional consequences <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, these investigations suggest that TAAR1 may represent a novel target for the pharmacology of dopamine-related disorders such as schizophrenia, ADHD and Parkinson's disease.

Amara<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec69"><title>NIMH, Bethesda, Maryland</title><p id="Par111"><bold>Background:</bold> Amphetamine has been used therapeutically to treat attention deficit disorders, narcolepsy, and as an appetite suppressant, but like other psychostimulant drugs it also has substantial potential for abuse. D-amphetamine and a variety of other amphetamine-like compounds are well-established substrates for both plasma membrane and vesicular biogenic amine transporters and are also agonists for trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs). Recent work has begun to provide additional insight into how the actions amphetamines on each of these different targets leads to the activation of cellular signaling pathways and regulates neurotransmitter signaling.</p><p id="Par112"><bold>Methods:</bold> Using real-time monitoring of transporter trafficking in transfected cell lines and in dopamine neurons in the brain we have observed that once amphetamine-like drugs enter dopamine neurons they activate multiple intracellular signaling pathways to trigger changes in the cellular trafficking of the dopamine transporter and other neuronal membrane proteins.</p><p id="Par113"><bold>Results:</bold> Within the cell amphetamines activate the small GTPases, Rho and Rac1 and trigger endocytosis of the dopamine transporter (DAT) by a RhoA- and dynamin-dependent pathway. Amphetamine also appears to increase intracellular cAMP, most likely through activation of an intracellular trace-amine associated receptor, TAAR1. We have observed that the same amphetamine-activated RhoA-dependent mechanism also activates the internalization of EAAT3, a neuronal glutamate transporter present on DA neurons.</p><p id="Par114"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These findings provide a new context in which to consider the actions of amphetamine on dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling and suggest novel drug targets for modulating the actions of amphetamines.</p><p id="Par115"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> S.

Miller<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec72"><title>Harvard Medical School, Southborough, Massachusetts</title><p id="Par116"><bold>Background:</bold> Trace amine associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is activated by a spectrum of biogenic amines, thyronamines and amphetamine-like psychostimulant drugs. Recent studies demonstrate that TAAR1 activation alters dopamine and serotonin neuronal firing rates as well as modulates dopamine transporter, norepinephrine transporter and serotonin transporter kinetic and internalization functions, suggesting that it is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of psychiatric and addictive disorders. Such drugs would function through a distinctively different mechanism than present pharmaceuticals.</p><p id="Par117"><bold>Methods:</bold> Methamphetamine (METH), morphine or ethanol were administered to wild type (WT) and TAAR1 knockout (KO) mice (75% C57J/BL6 × 25% 129S1/Sv mixed background), and assessments were made to determine the role of TAAR1 in modulating the behavioral and reinforcing effects of the different drugs. TAAR1 expression was assessed in rhesus monkey immortalized B lymphoblastoid cell lines as well as in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) <italic>in vitro</italic> and the effects of METH in the presence and absence of the specific TAAR1 antagonist EPPTB on TAAR1 signaling was assessed.</p><p id="Par118"><bold>Results:</bold> TAAR1 KO mice were more sensitive to the behavioral and reinforcing effects of METH and ethanol, but not morphine. TAAR1 KO mice acquired METH-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) earlier than WT mice and retained CPP longer during extinction training. TAAR1 KO mice also showed significantly greater preference for and consumption of ethanol in a two bottle choice paradigm while also showing significantly greater sedative-like effects of acute ethanol manifested as loss of righting observed at a lower dose and for longer time, with similar blood ethanol levels and rates of ethanol clearance. We also observed progressively lower cumulative locomotor activity over 60 minutes in response to increasing doses of ethanol (1.0–2.5 g/kg, i.p.) in TAAR1 KO mice, with no significant difference observed in response to an acute saline challenge between TAAR1 KO and WT mice. TAAR1 was robustly expressed in the immortalized B cells and was inducible upon immune activation in PBMC. TAAR1 stimulation by METH resulted in upregulation/phosphorylation of PKA and PKC, which was blocked by pretreatment with the TAAR1 antagonist EPPTB.</p><p id="Par119"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Paralleling its ability to alter brain monoaminergic tone, TAAR1 is a modulator of the behavioral and reinforcing effects of abused drugs, including METH which directly binds to the receptor as well as ethanol which indirectly alters levels of endogenous TAAR1 agonists (eg, dopamine). TAAR1 expression in immune cells is functionally linked to the PKA and PKC signaling pathways, and METH induces activation of these pathways in immune cells via TAAR1. Accordingly, drugs that target TAAR1 are likely to have a significant therapeutic potential for modifying behavior, reward salience and immunological function in the context of drug addiction and other psychiatric disorders.</p><p id="Par120"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> G.

We analyzed data from over 380 families from the Maritime Bipolar Registry and validated the findings in a similar sample from Sardinia followed by professor Maria del Zompo in Sardinia, Italy.</p><p id="Par125"><bold>Results:</bold> The early course of BD is characterized by non-specific symptoms such as anxiety, later followed by episodes of depression and only in the late teens/early 20 s by hypomanias and manic episodes. At that point the psychiatric diagnoses become more stable. The family data indicate a partial overlap between mood and psychotic disorders. Rather than following the current diagnostic categories, the familial patterns are suggestive of genetic influences in relation to the clinical course (episodic versus chronic) and specific syndromes (the risk of suicide). The risk of co-morbid anxiety and suicide behaviour is elevated especially in individuals with early onset; the age at onset appears to correlate in families. At later age, the clinical picture of BD starts diverging again as a result of additional factors that include quality of mood stabilization, co-morbid physical conditions and/or neurodegenerative processes.</p><p id="Par126"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data support the existence of subtypes of severe mental illness that do not necessarily follow the current diagnostic classification, but are familial and likely correlate with response to specific treatments.

The neuroanatomical changes predisposing for BD need to be differentiated from the typical brain maturation and from changes secondary to the presence of the illness. Identifying the brain structural changes predisposing for BD could aid in early diagnosis. Isolating the neuronal sequellae of BD could yield biological outcome measures for prevention and treatment.</p><p id="Par129"><bold>Methods:</bold> To separate neuroanatomical changes associated with BD into those increasing the risk of the illness and those resulting from it, we acquired MRI scans and prospective clinical data from participants at different stages of BD, including: (1) adolescent/early adult unaffected subjects at genetic risk for BD (<italic>N</italic>=50); (2) adolescent/early adult BD subjects close to the typical age of onset (<italic>N</italic>=36); (3) participants selected for substantial illness burden (minimum 10 years of illness and 5 episodes) and either no lifetime history of Li treatment (non-Li group, <italic>N</italic>=19) or at least 2 years of Li treatment (Li group, <italic>N</italic>=37). We also recruited 99 healthy controls matched to the above mentioned cohorts by age and sex.</p><p id="Par130"><bold>Results:</bold> Relative to controls, both the adolescent/early adult unaffected at risk subjects and BD participants close to the typical age of onset showed increased right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) volume, as well as comparable hippocampal volume and prefrontal N-Acetyl Aspartate (NAA) levels. Among the unaffected HR subjects, enlarged rIFG volume was associated with an increased risk of conversion to psychiatric disorders within 4 years following the MRI scanning (b=1.51, SE b=0.89, hazard ratio=4.5). In contrast, Li naïve patients with substantial illness burden had smaller hippocampal volumes and prefrontal NAA levels than controls, who showed comparable hippocampal volumes and prefrontal NAA levels to the Li treated subjects with substantial illness burden (F<sub>2;102</sub>=4.97, <italic>p</italic>=0.009; F<sub>2,61</sub>=7.23, <italic>p</italic>=0.002, respectively).

Even Li-treated patients with episodes of BD while on Li had hippocampal volumes comparable to healthy controls and significantly larger than the non-Li patients (t=2.62, DF=43, <italic>p</italic>=0.006).</p><p id="Par131"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Certain neuroanatomical changes, such as increased rIFG volume, are unique to unaffected subjects at risk for BD or those early in the course of illness. These changes could help identify who among the offspring of bipolar parents is at a particularly high risk of developing psychiatric disorders. Other brain structural or neurochemical alterations, such as decreased hippocampal volume or reduced prefrontal N-acetyl aspartate are found predominantly in subjects with established illness, but not among unaffected relatives of bipolar parents or participants early in the course of BD. Thus, these abnormalities may reflect the neuroprogressive nature of BD, which may possibly be prevented by treatment.

The Role of Inflammation in the Pathophysiology of Mood, Aggressive and Medical Disorders: A Deadly Combination</title><sec id="Sec86"><title>8.1 Inflammation and Depression: Sleep Disturbance Moderates Induction of Depressed Mood by an Inflammatory Challenge</title><sec id="Sec87"><title>Michael R. Irwin<sup>*</sup></title><p id="Par144">UCLA, Los Angeles, California</p><p id="Par145"><bold>Background:</bold> Proinflammatory cytokines are thought to contribute, in part, to the onset of depressive symptoms, and possibly to the onset and incidence of major depressive disorder. Meta-analytic results have found that depressive disorders are associated with increases in circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL-6), as well as other cellular markers of inflammation. Additionally, elevated levels of systemic inflammation (eg, CRP) are prospectively associated with depression. Recent data also implicate sleep disturbance as an independent prospective risk factor depression. We have found that persistent sleep disturbance prospectively predicts the recurrence of depression in at risk populations such as older adults. However, the mechanisms that link sleep disturbance and depression are not known. Given that even modest amounts of sleep loss activate cellular and genomic markers of inflammation, due in part to activation of cellular inflammatory signaling pathways (eg, NF-kB) especially in women and those with a history of depression, an activation of inflammatory signaling is hypothesized to be one pathway that links sleep disturbance and depression. Here, we examined the effect of proinflammatory cytokine activation on the neural correlates of socially painful experience and associated depressed mood, and the contribution of sleep disturbance in moderating the induction of depressed mood.</p><p id="Par146"><bold>Methods:</bold> Participants were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or low-dose endotoxin, which induces increases in proinflammatorycytokine levels in a safe and physiologically relevant manner. Cytokine levels were repeatedly assessed through hourly blood draws; self-reported and observer-rated depressed mood were assessed regularly as well. Two hours after drug administration, neural activity was recorded as participants completed a task in which they anticipated monetary rewards or underwent a task of social exclusion.</p><p id="Par147"><bold>Results:</bold> Endotoxin led to significant increases (from baseline) in IL-6 and TNF-a levels as well as feelings of depressed mood. Among females, but not males, exposed to endotoxin, increases in IL-6 were associated with increases in social pain-related neural activity (dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula) that mediated the relationship between IL-6 increases and depressed mood increases. Additional analyses focused on neural activity associated with anhedonia, another key symptom of depression. These results demonstrated that subjects exposed to endotoxin, compared with placebo, showed greater increases in self-reported and observer-rated depressed mood over time, as well as significant reductions in ventral striatum activity to monetary reward cues. Moreover, the relationship between exposure to inflammatory challenge and increases in observer-rated depressed mood was mediated by between group differences in ventral striatum activity to anticipated rewards. Finally, reports of sleep disturbance prior to the administration of endotoxin was associated with greater increases in depressed mood.</p><p id="Par148"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data are among the first experimental data to show that increases of proinflammatory cytokine activity are associated with increases in feelings of depressed mood, as well as related neural responding. Social pain-related neural activity, as welll as reward-related neural processes mediate the relationship between inflammation and and depressed mood. The presence of sleep disturbance exaggerates increases of depressed mood in response to an inflammatory challenge. Together, these findings raise the possibility that activation of cellular and genomic markers of inflammation, which we have found in association with sleep disturbance, may have recursive, reciprocal effects on depressed mood, and contribute to the risk of depression or its recurrence in those with persistent sleep disturbance.</p><p id="Par149"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> M.

Human studies suggest similar patterns in which elevations of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and IL-6 are directly associated with hostility, anger, and aggressive tendency.

In healthy overweight middle-aged adults, those with higher levels of depressive symptoms produced more IL-6 in response to a standard laboratory stressor, as well as significantly higher levels of IL-6 both 45 minutes and 2 hours after the stressor. Breast cancer survivors who were randomized to the yoga intervention had significantly lower inflammation compared to the wait-list controls; furthermore, more frequent yoga practice produced larger changes in both inflammation and mood.</p><p id="Par158"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Adverse childhood events are related to continued vulnerability among older adults, enhancing the impact of chronic stressors like dementia family caregiving on inflammation and telomere length. Inflammation triggers T-cell proliferation, one known cause of telomere shortening, and thus heightened stress- and depression-related inflammation may influence mortality through this pathway, among others. These data are important because even modest levels of depressive symptoms can heighten inflammatory responses to stressors. Interventions that diminish stress or depression may also diminish inflammation. Chronic inflammation has been suggested as one key biological mechanism that may fuel declines in physical function leading to frailty, disability, and, ultimately, death.</p><p id="Par159"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> J.

The current study was designed to further explore genetic predictors and targets of response to infliximab.</p><p id="Par161"><bold>Methods:</bold> Differential gene expression was examined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from infliximab responders (<italic>n</italic>=13) versus non-responders (<italic>n</italic>=14) compared to placebo at baseline and 6hr and 24hr and 2 weeks after the first infliximab infusion. Treatment response was defined as 50% reduction in depressive symptoms at any point during the 12-week trial.</p><p id="Par162"><bold>Results:</bold> One-hundred-forty-eight gene transcripts were significantly associated (1.2 fold, adjusted p⩽0.01) with response to infliximab and were distinct from placebo responders. Although there were no differences in infliximab responders and non-responders in body mass index or the presence of manifest metabolic disorders, transcripts predictive of infliximab response were associated with gluconeogenesis and cholesterol transport, and were enriched in a network regulated by hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)4-alpha, a transcription factor involved in gluconeogenesis and cholesterol and lipid homeostasis. Of the 148 transcripts differentially expressed at baseline, 48% were significantly regulated over time in infliximab responders, including genes related to gluconeogenesis and the HNF4-alpha network, indicating that these predictive genes were responsive to inflximab. Responders also demonstrated inhibition of genes related to apoptosis through TNF signaling at 6hr and 24hr after infusion.

The primary medical use is to treat individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), but non-medical use intended for cognitive enhancement in non-ADHD individuals occurs in educational, workplace, athletic and other settings (Smith and Farah, 2010). This is a very controversial topic often addressed in newspapers (Schwarz, New York Times, 2013) and magazines (Stix, Scientific American, 2010) for the general public. A discussion of this controversial topic is proposed for a Study Group. James Swanson will review the trends of overall use of stimulant drugs tracked by prescription records, national supplies, and the Monitoring the Future survey, all of which have information across several decades (Swanson <italic>et al</italic>, 2012). Kathleen Merikangas will present data from the National Comorbidity Survey, which indicates that most adolescents with ADHD are not recognized or treated with stimulants (Merikangas <italic>et al</italic>, 2013). The National Survey of Children's Health has tracked the diagnosis of ADHD and its treatment with stimulant drugs for the past decade (Visser <italic>et al</italic>, 2010), and the most recent findings will be presented by Susanna Visser. William Pelham will summarize the dose-related effects of stimulant drugs on children with ADHD on cognition as well as on symptom-severity in the context of concurrent psychosocial treatment (Strand, Hawk, Bubnik, Shiels, Pelham, and Waxmonsky, 2013). James Waxmonsky will review hypotheses of placebo response and tolerance to the cognitive and behavioral effects of clinical doses of stimulant drugs (Waxmonsky, Waschbusch, Glatt, and Faraone, 2011). Ruben Baler will review the complex mechanisms underlying the effects of stimulant drugs on the brain (Swanson, Baler and Volker, 2011). Marc Lerner will discuss the long-term safety of medical use of stimulant drugs in children (Lerner and Wigal, 2008) and the rules and monitoring of medical use in major league and minor league baseball players. Barbara Sahakian will discuss the neuroethics of the non-medical use of cognitive enhancing drugs that has generated considerable interest and debate and was the topic of a recent book (Illes and Sahakian, 2011). Tim Wigal will discuss differences in medical and non-medical use of stimulant drugs (Swanson, Wigal, and Volow, 2011), especially on college campuses that depend on non-academic factors, such as membership in fraternities, sororities, and athletic teams. The adverse effects of non-medical use of amphetamine may differ than in medical use, and James McCracken will review similarities and differences (Berman, Kuczenski, McCracken and London, 2009). Raul Gonzalez will discuss the cognitive effects of marijuana (Gonzalez <italic>et al</italic>, 2012) and address concurrent use of stimulant drugs.

The ACNP Ethics Committee determined it would be timely to explore the clinical knowledge and scientific evidence base regarding violence and mental illness. This study panel will address the following questions: (1) Are patients being unfairly exploited as straw men in a debate to preserve 2nd amendment freedoms or do safety concerns justify singling out those who have suffered mental illness (who represent 6% of the population with severe disorders at any time and up to 45% with any disorder lifetime)? (2) Do concerns including stigmatization and privacy violation outweigh attempts to identify individuals at risk for gun violence? (3) Is there unwarranted generalizing beyond current scientific data and understanding? In this study group data associating mental illness to risk for violence will be briefly summarized, including neuroscientific perspectives (David Pickar, Emil Coccaro, Dee Higley). Maryland State Senator Brian Frosh, Chair Judicial Proceedings Committee, will summarize his legislative efforts and experience relating to gun control and the mentally ill. Paul Appelbaum, Ken Davis and Jerrold Rosenbaum will provide practical and ethical perspective from academic, hospital and institutional medicine. The ethical considerations drawn from privacy violation, civil liberty restriction and profiling will be central in the discussion. The study group is designed for discussion/debate among the College membership in attendance with speakers briefly highlighting key elements to their topic. The core features of the discussion will then be passed back to the Ethics Committee for their consideration.

A major theme that will link the participants and engage the audience is the concept of <italic>open innovation,</italic> first articulated by Henry Chesbrough at Berkeley. The panel will consider how this concept, used successfully in some industries, could be applied to rejuvenate CNS Drug Development. Highlights from recent approaches for IP sharing will be discussed, with the goal of explicating the barriers, benefits and path to an open innovation environment in CNS Translational Research and Drug Development. Section 2: Experimental Design or Methods Used:We will begin with a brief outline of challenges to CNS translational research sharing and the current climate of drug discovery. This will be followed by discussions from a business and a law academician. The first is an expert on the management of innovation and the use of open innovation in rapid development. The latter will deal directly with how IP sharing can be fostered within a legal framework. The other topics will consist of short examples of how sharing has been facilitated through public/private partnerships including examples from the NIH Extramural or Intramural Neuroscience programs.</p><p id="Par173">Section 3—Summary of Results: Speakers will consist of Husseini Manji (J and J) who will define the ecosystem, describe where new medicines have traditionally come from in the past, and the roles of key members in the evolving ecosystem. Steve Paul, Cornell Medical College, will discuss trends in R and D productivity and then highlight some of the successful and recently initiated public:private partnerships that seek to catalyze innovation in the form of new drugs. Bob Innis, of NIMH-IRP, will discuss the opportunities for leveraging translational research. Phil Phan, of Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, will discuss how open innovation, combined with real options decision models, can accelerate innovation. Frank Pasquale, of the University of Maryland Carey School Of Law, will discuss the factors, with examples such as alltrials.net, that lead to the successful sharing of early stage research in user driven innovator communities. Dean Wong, of Johns Hopkins Medicine, will discuss the challenges for biomarker sharing in an academic setting, while Steve Grant, of the NIH, will describe the efforts by Extramural NIH staff to facilitate data sharing across multiple domains (eg, genetics, brain imaging, phenotype harmonization). Section 4—Conclusion Statement: Open innovation by leveraging a state-of-the-art biomarker exchange and other sharing processes across the biopharmaceutical ecosystem might help to manage the costs of drug discovery, provide a stimulus for start-up companies trying to exploit scientific research at NIH and academia, and link efforts across academia, government and industry around the focused mission of new CNS therapeutics.

The Challenges of Designing and Interpreting Clinical Trials with Depot Antipsychotics</title><sec id="Sec110"><title>W. Wolfgang Fleischhacker<sup>*</sup>, Raymond Sanchez, Srihari Gopal, Maxine X. Patel, Stephan Heres, Keith H. Nuechterlein, Hiroyuki Uchida</title><sec id="Sec111"><title>Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria</title><p id="Par199">This proposal aims to provide a forum to discuss some of the controversies around clinical trials with depots and the challenges of translating research into every day clinical practice. (1) Study design: This is where regulatory requirements and ‘gold standard’ RCTs are difficult to reconcile with every day clinical practice, especially in light of the fact that RCTs with frequent visits and the ensuing care and attention which patients get in such studies are likely to diminish differences between oral and depot antipsychotics. If improved compliance is truly the main advantage of depot over oral antipsychotics, clinical trials, in which indirect compliance enhancing factors, such as the ones inherent in rigorous RCTs (see above) can be controlled for are desirable. Pragmatic randomized trials, could be such an option (discussed by Wolfgang Fleischhacker). (2) Once pertinent studies have been designed the next challenge becomes to run such studies. The enthusiasm with which clinicians will engage in such trials will depend on their general attitude towards depots which, as we know, differs considerably across continents, countries, regions and hospitals. The logistical issues (regulatory requirements, ethics committees, and recruitment challenges) will be reviewed by Ray Sanchez for the US and Sri Gopal for Europe. (3) Maxine Patel will then discuss differences in attitudes towards depot antipsychotics from the perspectives of patients and psychiatrists. In addition, Stephan Heres will review differences in depot utilization across the world and provide potential explanations for them based on the attitudes of prescribers. (4) Keith Nuechterlein will then discuss whether the traditional focus of depot antipsychotic studies on relapse prevention can be usefully broadened to include cognition and work and social functioning based on recent relevant studies. (5) Lastly, Hiroyuki Uchida will provide an overview on neuroimaging data and their potential clinical relevance. As recent imaging studies suggest that depot antipsychotics may differ from their oral counterparts with respect to receptor pharmacology and brain functioning, Hiroyuki Uchida will present pertinent data from PET and SPECT studies. These will also be discussed in light of its potential clinical relevance.</p><p id="Par200"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> W.

Forbes<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec118"><title>University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</title><p id="Par208"><bold>Background:</bold> Disrupted function in neural reward circuitry has been implicated in affective disorders. To understand the emergence of such disorders, it is critical to investigate reward circuitry during adolescence, the developmental period in which affective disorders emerge and reward circuitry continues to develop. Social reward could be particularly salient to adolescents’ affective symptoms because of changes in their social context that involve enhanced value of peer-related rewards. Ecologically valid tasks that capture adolescents’ responses to social rewards could be more effective than standard tasks at assessing individual differences in reward function that are relevant to the development of affective problems.</p><p id="Par209"><bold>Methods:</bold> Participants were 30 adolescents (83% female; mean age 16.35 years; 64% European American, 26% African American, 10% other race) who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a 3T Siemens Trio scanner using a novel paradigm that incorporated personally relevant reward stimuli. Stimuli were 20-second video clips selected from a laboratory-based discussion of intense positive experiences between the participant and his/her closest same-sex friend. Interaction data were coded and selected to represent friends’ displays of positive and neutral affect. Control stimuli were video clips of an unfamiliar same-sex peer displaying positive and neutral affect. Participants completed self-report scales of depression (CES-D; Radloff, 1977) and mania (Eckblad &amp; Chapman, 1986). Imaging data were preprocessed and analyzed in SPM8, and AlphaSim was used to control for Type I error by computing minimum cluster sizes required for a corrected <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 threshold in each region of interest.</p><p id="Par210"><bold>Results:</bold> Whole-brain analyses indicated that while viewing a friend's positive affect relative to an unfamiliar peer's positive affect, adolescents exhibited response in a set of regions implicated in reward function and social processing, including the ventral striatum, medial PFC, orbitofrontal cortex, and precuneus. Regression analyses indicated that manic symptoms were associated with greater response in the insula and precuneus, while depressive symptoms were associated with less response in the striatum, dorsal anterior cingulate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.</p><p id="Par211"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This novel and innovative fMRI social reward paradigm engaged reward and social processing circuitry and was sensitive to individual differences in affective symptoms. Consistent with previous findings, depression was related to disrupted response to reward in the mPFC, which could reflect altered regulation of reward function and poor flexibility in responding to affective stimuli. Mania was associated with increased response in regions implicated in social cognition, which suggests an enhanced engagement with social rewards.</p><p id="Par212"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> E.

Irritability can be defined as a decreased threshold for, and maladaptive responses to, frustration, where frustration is the emotion experienced when goal attainment is blocked. Methods for studying the neural mechanisms of frustration typically involve paradigms in which subjects are unable to attain expected rewards and/or receive unexpected punishments. The relevance of reward circuitry to mechanisms mediating frustration is further supported by longitudinal and familial associations between irritability and depression. Such associations have been demonstrated across development, from preschoolers through adolescence and adulthood.The fMRI paradigm used here is a modification of work in press (Deveney <italic>et al</italic>, Am J Psychiatry. 2013 Jun 4. doi: 10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.12070917). Deveney <italic>et al</italic> used a paradigm in which subjects completed a Posner attentional task with and without rewards. During scanning, youth were frustrated by rigged feedback and lost money that they have won on previous trials. Compared to healthy subjects, chronically irritable youth (ie, severe mood dysregulation, or SMD) showed increased subjective responses to frustration, as well as attentional deficits and decreased amygdala-striatal-parietal activation on frustrating, compared to non-frustrating, trials.</p><p id="Par214"><bold>Methods:</bold> Data will be presented from thirty youth (<italic>N</italic>=15 healthy subjects and 15 SMD) scanned on a modified version of the paradigm in Deveney <italic>et al.</italic> Subjects are scanned during a task which includes trials of the Posner attentional task, first in a condition where they receive rewards on all correct trials, and then in a rigged frustration condition where they are told that they are responding too slowly and lose the previously rewarded money. Jitter is present between trials and between the response and feedback portions of each trial. Data from the frustration condition will be analyzed with a diagnosis (control, MSD) × trial component (response, positive feedback, negative feedback) ANOVA. Data from both the reward and frustration conditions will be analyzed with a diagnosis (control, MSD) × trial component (response, feedback) × condition (reward, frustration) ANOVA. Analyses will include ROIs based on prior work and a whole brain analysis. An exploratory analysis including 10 ADHD subjects will examine neural activation across groups as a function of irritability, treated as a dimensional variable measured with the Affective Reactivity Index.</p><p id="Par215"><bold>Results:</bold> These are pending. Based on prior work, we anticipate that, compared to healthy subjects, SMD will report increased frustration during the frustration condition, and show increased reaction time only on invalid trials during the frustration condition. Further, we anticipate amygdala-striatal-parietal deactivation during frustration trials in SMD <italic>vs</italic> healthy subjects, and an association between irritability and amygdala-striatal-parietal deactivation across diagnoses.</p><p id="Par216"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Chronic irritability is associated with increased subjective response to a frustrating task, and decreased attentional control and amygdala-striatal-parietal deactivation during frustration. Frustrating paradigms can be challenging (indeed frustrating!) to design and implement successfully in youth, but represent a promising approach to studying the neural mechanisms mediating irritability in youth.</p><p id="Par217"><bold>Unique Data</bold>.

Intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) may be a useful behavioral procedure for discriminating both DA-mediated abuse-related and 5-HT-mediated abuse-limiting drug effects in a single procedure. Based on the <italic>in vitro</italic> selectivity to promote release or block reuptake of DA/NE versus 5-HT, we predicted that methcathinone and MDPV would display the greatest efficacy to produce an abuse-related facilitation of ICSS, whereas methylone and mephedrone would produce mixed effects that would include both DA-mediated facilitation of low ICSS rates and 5-HT-mediated depression of higher ICSS rates.</p><p id="Par237"><bold>Methods:</bold> Male Sprague-Dawley rats with surgically-implanted electrodes targeting the medial forebrain bundle responded for multiple frequencies of brain stimulation and were tested in two phases. First, dose-effect curves for methcathinone (0.1–1.0 mg/kg), MDPV (0.32–3.2 mg/kg), methylone (1.0–10 mg/kg) and mephedrone (1.0–10 mg/kg) were determined. Second, time courses were determined for effects produced by the highest dose of each compound.</p><p id="Par238"><bold>Results:</bold> Methcathinone produced dose- and time-dependent facilitation of ICSS. MDPV, methylone and mephedrone produced dose- and time-dependent increases in low ICSS rates maintained by low brain stimulation frequencies, but also produced abuse-limiting depression of high ICSS rates maintained by high brain stimulation frequencies. Efficacies to facilitate ICSS were methcathinone ⩾MDPV ⩾ methylone &gt;mephedrone.

Common constituents of bath salts, including 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) and 4-methylmethcathinone (mephedrone), have been rendered illegal in the US as a means to prohibit sale and use. Unfortunately, new cathinone analogs are now being marketed as legal alternatives to MDPV and mephedrone. The purpose of the present study was to examine the interaction of these newly-emerging cathinones with transporters for dopamine (i.e., DAT) and 5-HT (i.e., SERT).</p><p id="Par242"><bold>Methods:</bold> Specific drugs were selected for evaluation based on forensic data from the Drug Enforcement Administration. Derivatives of MDPV included á-pyrrolidinovalerophenone (á-PVP) while derivatives of mephedrone included 4-methylethcathinone (4-MEC). <italic>In vitro</italic> assays were carried out in rat brain synaptosomes to assess drug-induced effects on transporter-mediated uptake and release. <italic>In vivo</italic> microdialysis was carried out in n. accumbens of conscious rats to assess drug-induced changes in extracellular dopamine and serotonin.</p><p id="Par243"><bold>Results:</bold> MDPV and á-PVP displayed low nM potency as DAT blockers, but had no effects on release. Mephedrone was a non-selective transporter substrate with potent releasing ability at DAT (EC<sub>50</sub>=38 nM) and SERT (EC<sub>50</sub>=98 nM). 4-MEC had unusual properties, blocking uptake at DAT (IC<sub>50</sub>=546 nM) while evoking release at SERT (EC<sub>50</sub>=123 nM). 4-Methylpyrrolidinopentiophenone (4-MePPP) was devoid of releasing activity but blocked uptake at DAT (IC<sub>50</sub>=248 nM). Microdialysis studies showed that MDPV (0.1–0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) selectively increases extracellular dopamine, whereas mephedrone (0.3–1 mg/kg, i.v.) elevates dopamine and 5-HT. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies with other cathinones are in progress.</p><p id="Par244"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Each of the cathinone derivatives examined displays a unique profile of <italic>in vitro</italic> transporter activity.

AHI1 encodes Jouberin (Jbn) which is highly expressed in mammals throughout the developing brain and has been localized to the primary cilium, a highly conserved organelle central to the regulation of cellular signaling pathways. Studies by our group and others have demonstrated association of AHI1 with schizophrenia and autism.

It is now clear that a number of diseases involve disruption of ciliary structure or function, and in which dysfunction of primary cilia is likely fundamental to etiology. Many of these ‘ciliopathies’ include neurological and behavioral signs or symptoms. This suggests the possibility that ciliary dysfunction may be of etiologic significance to major neuropsychiatric disorders or their treatment. Several observations made in the lab support this general hypothesis, and have motivated efforts to understand the functional significance of primary cilia to neural function. My presentation will briefly review these observations and then will discuss recent work investigating the cellular basis of dopamine receptor localization to cilia and the functional significance of ciliary receptor localization to G protein-mediated signaling.</p><p id="Par259"><bold>Methods:</bold> We have used RNA interference to achieve targeted knockdown of the expression of genes implicated in major neuropsychiatric diseases. We have used fixed and live cell imaging methods to examine receptor localization and dynaicms in cultured neurons relative to cilia. We have developed cilia-targeted signaling biosensors to investigate location of receptor signaling events and thedownstream mediators cyclic AMP relative to cilia.</p><p id="Par260"><bold>Results:</bold> We find that a significant fraction of genes associated with major neuropsychiatric disrupt cilia when knocked down in cell culture, and that a number of the protein products of these genes localize in or near cilia. We have shown that D1 and D2 dopamine receptors present in cilia represent a diffusionally isolated population that is capable of G protein-linked stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. We have observed that cAMP produced by activation of ciliary D1 receptors is not constrained to cilia and can access the peripheral cytoplasm on a similar time scale as the acute signaling response. We have found a discrete signaling function of ciliary receptor localization to cilia, as well as of exclusion of receptors from cilia, which suggests a form of combinatiorial control of integrated cellular GPCR signaling.</p><p id="Par261"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Primary cilia are likely to represent a major site of signal integration in neurons, mediate signaling specificity at the level of closely related GPCRs, and have intriguing disease implications for neurology and psychiatry.</p><p id="Par262"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> M.

Ferland<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec150"><title>Albany Medical College, Albany, New York</title><p id="Par263"><bold>Background:</bold> While neurons have elaborate dendrites and spines, they also have a newly re-appreciated organelle called the primary cilium (PC). However, little is known regarding the function of PC, particularly as it relates to its role on neurons. Enriched receptor and protein expression and an isolated subcellular compartment make PC a unique organelle for receiving and transducing extracellular signals. The recent identification of a subset of GPCRs present at PC implicates the importance of PC in GPCR signaling. However, it is unclear whether GPCRs at PC and at the cell body have the same ability for efficiently initiating signaling and activating downstream events. In addition, another function for PC on neurons and glia may be in monitoring local osmolarity shifts, particularly given that brain cells are constantly undergoing fluctuations in osmolytes. Since regulation of osmolarity in the brain is critical for normal function, PC may be a focused center for osmolarity sensing that when dysregulated could lead to a variety of pathophysiological brain conditions. In this talk, I will present evidence that AHI1 is required for the proper localization of one of the known neuronal PC-enriched GPCRs, MchR1 to PC, that much of the MchR1 signaling is occurring on PC (and not the cell body), and that MchR1 undergoes an orchestrated trafficking pattern upon ligand application that does not occur in Ahi1 knockout neurons. Lastly, I will show evidence that PC may be serving as a critical osmolarity sensor for neurons that depends on the presence of Ahi1.</p><p id="Par264"><bold>Methods:</bold> Mice with targeted deletions of <italic>Ahi1</italic> and wildtype littermate control mice were used. Most experiments utilized neuronal cultures from embryonic day 18.5 brains from wildtype and <italic>Ahi1</italic> knockout animals, in which the following were examined: (1) MchR1 trafficking (via immunolabeling), (2) MchR1 signaling (through calcium imaging and cAMP assays), and (3) quantification of PC number and morphology on neurons. To examine osmolarity sensing of neuronal PC, neuronal cultures from embryonic day 19 rat embryos were used. Changes in neuronal osmolarity were accomplished by increasing the extracellular concentration of osmolytes in the media followed principally by immunolabeling and Western blot experiments (using antibodies to Ahi1 and ciliary proteins). In addition, removal of PC from neurons using chloral hydrate was used to assess the effects of PC on the ability of neurons to sense changes in extracellular osmolarity.</p><p id="Par265"><bold>Results:</bold> Targeted deletion of <italic>Ahi1</italic> results in a dramatic reduction of MchR1 localization at neuronal PC. Given normal expression and surface targeting of MchR1, the decreased ciliary MchR1 distribution in <italic>Ahi1</italic> knockout neurons is likely a result of defective ciliary membrane protein trafficking. Dynamic redistribution of MchR1 at PC upon ligand stimulation implicates a critical role for PC in MchR1 signaling. Strikingly, <italic>Ahi1</italic> knockout neurons with normal MchR1 plasma membrane expression, but lacking MchR1 expression on PC, have reduced signaling upon ligand stimulation as indicated by an inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production. For osmolarity, we identified a novel and unknown hyperosmotic-induced structure that was localized with Ahi1. Both the actin polymerization inhibitor, latrunculin, and the loss of Hap1, one of the main interactors with Ahi1, resulted in an inability to observe the Ahi1-positive structure under hyperosmotic conditions. Moreover, loss of neuronal PC using chloral hydrate eliminated the formation of these hyperosmotic-induced Ahi1-positive structures.</p><p id="Par266"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study suggests a critical role for PC as a requisite site for GPCR localization and ligand reception in order to activate downstream signaling. In addition, our work begins to shed light on how the neuronal PC may help neurons sense and signal osmolarity fluctuations both in the normal and diseased brain.</p><p id="Par267"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> R.

In studies that date to the late 1980's, it was hypothesized that the ability of novel schizophrenia therapeutics to attenuate the schizophrenia-like symptoms produced by the NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist, ketamine, might provide this type of experimental medicine assay. Subsequently, as similarities between the effects of ketamine on neural systems and network dysregulation in schizophrenia became more clear, it was hypothesized that the ability of drugs developed for schizophrenia to attenuate ketamine effects on circuit activity related to cognition or symptoms might be reflective of aspects of its therapeutic potential for schizophrenia. The purpose of this presentation is to present our experience using ketamine to study the effects of mGluR agonist/PAMs, as a case study of insights that might emerge from this experimental medicine strategy.</p><p id="Par282"><bold>Methods:</bold> Two studies are reviewed. We will briefly present a previously published study which evaluated the dose-related (placebo, 100 mg, 400 mg) effects of the mGluR2 agonist, LY354740 on the cognitive and behavioral response to ketamine (0.26 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.65 mg/kg administered over 100 minutes).We will also present the preliminary analyses of an unpublished within-subjects study in healthy subjects of the dose-related (placebo, 50 mg, 180 mg) of the mGluR2 PAM, AZD8529, on the effects of ketamine (bolus of 0.23 mg/kg, followed by 0.58 mg/kg/hr). Each test day was preceded by the oral administraiton of the mGluR2 PAM/placebo 12 hours prior to testing. Test days involved the blinded intravenous infusion of saline and then ketamine in a fixed order while in the Siemens Tim Trio 3T magnet. Imaging took place while subjects received saline/ketamine infusions and during rest (visual fixation) and while they performed a spatial working memory task. A previous study from our group (Driesen <italic>et al.</italic> Biol Psychiatry 2008) showed that schizophrenia patients showed impaired PFC activation while performing this task.</p><p id="Par283"><bold>Results:</bold> In the initial study, LY354740 produced a significant dose-related attenuation of ketamine-related impairments in working memory. There was also a trend to reduce positive symptoms produced by ketamine.In the second study, AZD8529 did not attenuate the ketamine-related impariment in spatial working memory-related PFC activation or reduce psychotic symptoms produced by ketamine. However, ketamine produced asynchrony in the activation of DLPFC and BA 10 that was associated with the severity of ketamine-induced symptoms. Preliminary analyses suggest that AZD8529 normalized the synchrony between these regions and eliminated the statistical association between synchrony and symptoms.</p><p id="Par284"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data suggest that mGluR2 agonoists or PAMs might be able to reduce some behavioral and circuit effects of ketamine in healthy human subjects.

Understanding the role of glutamate in schizophrenia may provide a new direction for the development of innovative and hopefully more effective drug therapies for schizophrenia. Pomaglumetad methionil (LY2140023 monohydrate) is a potent and highly selective agonist for the metabotropic glutamate mGluR2 and mGluR3 receptors.We present results of a clinical development program assessing the efficacy of pomaglumetad methionil in reducing psychopathology either as a monotherapy in patients with an acute psychotic exacerbation or as an add-on therapy in patients with prominent negative symptoms. Negative findings from these studies have dampened hope that a glutamate-based therapy for schizophrenia will be forthcoming in the near future, although a new strategic reconceptualization may be evolving.</p><p id="Par287"><bold>Methods:</bold> The efficacy and safety results of 5 acute monotherapy trials, 3 long-term safety trials, and a sub-acute add-on trial will be summarized. Post-hoc data analyses at either an individual study level or integrated across trials will be presented to determine whether disease-state (duration of illness; previous antipsychotic drug treatment) or disease-trait (non-Hispanic white patients with schizophrenia carrying T-alleles for the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs7330461 in the serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A) compared with A/A homozygotes) may influence response to pomaglumetad.</p><p id="Par288"><bold>Results:</bold> In acute monotherapy trials, the primary outcome PANSS-Total did not demonstrate efficacy for pomaglumetad at doses of 10 mg to 80 mg BID as compared to placebo. Add-on of pomaglumetad (10 mg-40 mg BID) to previous atypical antipsychotic drugs for the treatment of prominent negative symptoms in partially remitted patients did not demonstrate efficacy versus add-on placebo as assessed by the NSA-16. Pomaglumetad was generally well-tolerated across all trials and demonstrated a low association for weight gain and DAD2-mediated adverse events. The incidence of seizures was found to be comparable to currently available antipsychotic drugs. Post-hoc analyses suggested that a subgroup of patients may demonstrate response to pomaglumetad.</p><p id="Par289"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Pomaglumetad methionil treatment did not demonstrate efficacy in the <italic>a priori</italic> specified populations studied.

Fudge<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec166"><title>University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York</title><p id="Par292"><bold>Background:</bold> Older models of brain organization have emphasized a point-to-point approach, with nodal connections between specific cortical and subcortical regions. Newer models examining whole-brain function show that multiple cortical regions are ‘co-activated’ with subcortical structures. The tendency of a particular set of afferent inputs to be activated varies by individual, correlating with strength of the putative connection (Saygin, SM 2012). The amygdala is a complex structure with multiple roles in emotional responding, and its activation to specific stimuli varies enormously across individuals.</p><p id="Par293"><bold>Methods:</bold> To understand the organization of multiple afferent and efferent connections through the amygdala, we used a bidirectional tracer approach in nonhuman primates. We explored the anatomy of connections from both the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex (OMPFC) and insula, two key inputs based on previous work in nonhuman primate. We then analyzed the impact of corticoamygdala organization on the topography of amygdalostriatal outputs within and across animals.</p><p id="Par294"><bold>Results:</bold> Cortical subregions in both the OMPFC and insula combined to send a layered set of hierarchical connections across different amygdala subregions. Surprisingly, combinations of OMPFC and insula inputs to specific amygdala regions also predicted the organization of outputs in the next limb of the circuit to the striatum. Rather than a point-to-point schema, cortical inputs to the amygdala (1) are organized according to cytoarchitectural features <italic>across</italic> lobes, and (2) are integrated to form an increasingly complex set of inputs from the ventral to dorsal amygdala. In sum, a primitive circuit emanates from the most undifferentiated regions of both insula and OMPFC, influencing all amygdala outputs. Layered upon this in slightly more dorsal regions are projections from slightly more differentiated insula and OMFPC subregions. Finally, relatively differentiated regions of the OMPFC and insula add projections to the most dorsal amygdala, reflecting high levels of information processing in this region. Amygdala-striatal outputs follow suit, with ventral amygdala regions that receive only ‘primitive’ inputs targeting a restricted region of the dorsomedial shell, while more dorsal amygdala regions that receive all three inputs (‘primitive’, ‘intermediate’, and ‘developed’) project broadly from the ventral striatum to more dorsolateral regions of the striatum</p><p id="Par295"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This organization elucidated shows a complex cortical modulation of amygdala function based on cortical architecture, with implications for (1) functional anatomy of the amygdala, and (2) the breadth and complexity of amygdalostriatal outputs.</p><p id="Par296"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> J.

Ventral straital function, which is thought to generate a teaching signal involved in the selection of advantageous behavioral repertoires, is under control of eCBs and; therefore, may contribute to the ability of eCBs to not only strengthen responses leading to the procurement of reward but also those leading to the reduction of harm. We previously demonstrated that disrupting eCB signaling uniformly decreases dopaminergic encoding of reward-predictive cues and reward directed behavior.</p><p id="Par298"><bold>Methods:</bold> Here, we investigate whether eCBs also modulate dopaminergic encoding of cues predicting either the avoidance of punishment or aversive outcomes. We first used fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to investigate whether disrupting eCB signaling alters dopaminergic encoding of cues predicting the avoidance of punishment during behavior maintained in a signaled shock avoidance procedure. In this task, a stimulus light was presented as a warning signal for 2-s prior to the delivery of recurring foot shocks. During this 2 s warning period, a response lever was extended into the testing chamber which, if pressed, produced a 20 s safety period signaled by a tone. Animals could initiate an avoidance response by pressing the lever within the 2 s warning period, entirely preventing shock. Alternately, once shocks commenced, animals could initiate an escape response by pressing the lever during this punishment period, terminating shock.</p><p id="Par299"><bold>Results:</bold> Disrupting eCB signaling by treating animals with rimonabant (0.3–1 mg/kg IV) dose-dependently decreased concentrations of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens that were time-locked to the warning signal while simultaneously weakening shock avoidance behavior, effectively shifting the behavioral outcome from avoidance to escape. We next assessed the effects of disrupting eCB signaling on dopaminergic encoding of cues predicting aversive outcomes using a fear-conditioning model. As previously reported, rimonabant treated rats were resistant to the extinction of fear memories induced by a fear-associated cue when presentations occurred 24hr after conditioning. Impaired fear memory extinction was accompanied by diminished dopaminergic encoding of the fear-associated cue in the nucleus accumbens. In vehicle treated rats we observed a decrease in accumbal dopamine release events during presentation of the fear-associated cue, an effect that was attenuated by rimonabant pretreatment (0.3 mg/kg IV).</p><p id="Par300"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Together these data suggest that eCBs might modify distinct behavioral responses related to aversive stimuli by modulating conditioned mesolimbic dopamine release events.

Computational neuroscience has argued that the detection of a mismatch between expected and observed outcomes within the ventral striatum (i.e., ‘prediction errors’), is a critical precursor to the formation of new learned associations. Here we combine a translational model of anxiety with a cognitive neuroimaging paradigm to test whether anxiety can alter prediction error processing.</p><p id="Par308"><bold>Methods:</bold> 24 subjects underwent threat of unpredictable foot shock whilst completing a simple task designed to elicit matched appetitive (happy face) and aversive (fear face) prediction errors.

In neuroimaging studies of human cognitive abilities, brain activation patterns that include distributed regions that are strongly interactive in response to experimental task demands are of particular interest. Covariance modeling of fMRI data can capture these patterns of task-related functional activity and provide regional targets for TMS, which can then be further individualized by choosing the peak activity in the target region on an individual basis. The specific form of covariance modeling we use is called the Ordinal Trends model (OrT), which uses a guided PCA approach which expects a range of individual variability in brain imaging data, and makes use of it in a within-subject model that identifies networks that exhibit sustained activity across graduated changes in task parameters (such as increasing memory load). Such an approach produces cortical regions likely to be highly sensitive to TMS modulation, an approach we demonstrate in a series of experiments in which working memory is enhanced using TMS.</p><p id="Par314"><bold>Methods:</bold> In a first set of experiments, fMRI data from 18 healthy young adults recorded while they performed a delayed-match-to-sample (DMS) letter working memory task before and after two days of total sleep deprivation (SD) were analyzed using OrT. A second group of 15 healthy young adults participated in a TMS session after two days of SD. TMS was applied at three cortical locations determined by the covariance modeling of the fMRI data in the first group. Another 27 healthy adults participated in a third study in which rTMS was applied over four sessions during the two day SD period. In a second set of experiments, the fMRI data of 44 healthy elderly adults and 60 young adults performing the DMS task were analyzed using OrT. Three rTMS target regions based on this analysis were used on 20 healthy elderly adults and 20 young adults over three TMS sessions. Individual peak activity in each target region were chosen for TMS targets.</p><p id="Par315"><bold>Results:</bold> In the first set of experiments, a cortical network was found that was both significantly activated by the DMS task and whose activation decreased across SD. rTMS applied to cortical sites within that network partially remediated the effects of SD on the DMS task, and the degree of fMRI network deactivation due to SD was significantly coupled with improvement caused by the rTMS. rTMS applied to an occipital node of the network over multiple sessions during SD resulted in complete remediation of the effects of SD in the DMS task in sleep deprived subjects 18 hours after the last TMS session. In the second set of experiments, fMRI networks were found whose activation levels were significantly correlated with individual reaction time (RT) in both elderly and young groups. Three nodes of these networks (in left premotor and occipital cortex and SMA) were used as targets. Significant target × TMS (active <italic>vs</italic> sham) effects were found for both RT and accuracy of DMS performance, with TMS to occipital cortex significantly facilitating RT, and TMS to premotor cortex disrupting performance, more strongly so in the elderly group.</p><p id="Par316"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Covariance modeling of fMRI data using OrT uncovered cortical networks related to working memory performance in the context of SD and of aging, and the use of TMS targeting these networks enhanced performance. The use of covariance-modeled brain imaging and TMS are strongly complementary, with the former providing a sophisticated method of choosing TMS targets using both group and individual information, and use of the latter helping to causally validate interpretation of network function.</p><p id="Par317"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> B.

Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS) targets cortical oscillations that play a fundamental role in cognition and exhibit deficits in patients with psychiatric illness. Elucidating how tACS interacts with cortical network dynamics is crucial for the rational design of individualized brain stimulation for therapeutic purposes. Here, we present our interdisciplinary research that combines computer simulations and <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiology in ferrets.</p><p id="Par319"><bold>Methods:</bold> For the computer simulations, two large-scale cortical model networks were connected by long-range projections that exhibited realistic propagation delays (up to 50 msec). tACS was simulated by application of an equivalent weak somatic current injection. Weak electric fields were applied to deeply anesthetized ferrets (1% isoflurane). Multiunit spiking activity was recorded with laminar probes that spanned all cortical layers. Spectral analysis of multiunit firing was used to evaluate frequency-specific enhancement of network activity. Statistical significance was determined with the Wilcoxon rank sum test.</p><p id="Par320"><bold>Results:</bold> In the computer simulations (<italic>N</italic>=100), we found that tACS enhances ongoing cortical oscillations preferentially at the endogenous oscillation frequency (0.65 versus 0.24 normalized enhancement, p&lt;0.05). In further agreement with presence of resonance dynamics, we found that (1) increasing the stimulation amplitude broadened the range of frequencies at which the network was entrained and that (2) entrainment also occurred at the first harmonic frequency. The interconnected cortical networks exhibited spontaneous metastable behavior that was characterized by spontaneous transitions between three qualitatively distinct network states (0.135±0.0134 Hz transition frequency, mean±s.e.m.). Not only did simulated tACS preferentially switch the networks to the fully synchronized state (transition probability: 86.89% with stimulation versus 43.22% without stimulation) but also did these enhancing effects outlast the stimulation (0.995 correlation in oscillation power enhancement between during and after stimulation). Therefore, our model predicts that tACS modulates cortical network dynamics by switching multistable networks between different cortical states.</p><p id="Par321">Our ferret experiments (N=2, 450 trials/condition) allowed the assessment of tACS on complex, convoluted cortex with invasive electrophysiology. In agreement with our modeling data, we found that weak sine-wave electric fields enhanced network oscillations in a frequency specific way (enhancement ratios: 1.20, 1.14, 1.11, 1.15, 1.17, for stimulation frequencies 0.5 to 2.5 Hz, all p&lt;0.00001,). Superficial network sites showed the strongest enhancement of the ongoing oscillation. The enhancement of the ongoing oscillations was mediated by preferential multiunit firing at the depolarizing phase of the applied electric field.</p><p id="Par322"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We used an interdisciplinary approach to demonstrate that resonance dynamics mediate the mechanistic underpinnings of how tACS modulates cortical oscillations. The resulting understanding of the interaction dynamics between applied stimulation and endogenous brain activity provides an important basis for the subsequent rational design of non-invasive brain stimulation that targets individual, patient-specific deficits in cortical network dynamics.</p><p id="Par323"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> F.

Peterchev<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec185"><title>Duke University, Durham, North Carolina</title><p id="Par324"><bold>Background:</bold> Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is highly effective for the treatment of depression but is associated with cognitive side effects. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has no significant side effects but is less effective than ECT. ECT is delivered with high, fixed current amplitude that results in excessively strong direct stimulation of most of the brain, potentially contributing to side effects. rTMS is delivered with bidirectional sinusoidal pulses that may be suboptimal for neuromodulation. Two studies illustrate how device development, computational modeling, and biophysically-motivated dosing paradigms could inform improvements of ECT and rTMS technique.</p><p id="Par325"><bold>Methods:</bold> Study 1: The change of motor cortex excitability resulting from 1 Hz rTMS with 4 different pulse shapes was characterized in 12 healthy human subjects. The pulse shapes included a conventional bidirectional, cosine pulse and 3 rectangular pulses generated with an in-house-built controllable pulse parameter TMS (cTMS) device: bidirectional or unidirectional in either posterior–anterior (PA) or anterior–posterior (AP) induced current direction. Excitability changes were quantified with TMS motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Study 2: Motor threshold (MT) and seizure threshold (ST) were titrated in anesthetized <italic>macaca mulatta</italic> by stepping the current amplitude with bilateral (BL), right unilateral (RUL), bifrontal (BF), and frontomedial (FM) ECT electrode configurations. Seven subjects received BL and RUL stimulation and 4 of them received BF and FM stimulation. The electric field induced by the four electrode configurations was simulated in MRI-based computational head models of the 4 subjects who received all types of ECT. The electric field distribution and the individual MT and ST were used to estimate the directly stimulated brain volume for seizure induction.</p><p id="Par326"><bold>Results:</bold> Study 1: The 4 rTMS pulse shapes caused differing degrees of change in cortical excitability (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Two rTMS pulse shapes generated significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) reduction in excitability (MEP amplitude reduction by 16% and 9% for unidirectional PA pulse and bidirectional rectangular pulse, respectively). The unidirectional AP pulse produced a nonsignificant MEP reduction by 7%. The conventional bidirectional cosine pulse produced a negligible MEP increase of 1.6%. Study 2: The mean percentage stimulated brain volume at individualized current amplitude ranged from 63% for BL ECT to 25% for RUL ECT. ST and MT were highly correlated for BL, RUL, and FM ECT (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> ⩾0.80, <italic>p</italic>⩽0.02), and had a correlation trend for BF ECT (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.51, <italic>p</italic>=0.29). The coefficient of variation of ST among the subjects was as high as 0.42. The simulated ratio of electrode current to right motor cortex electric field magnitude correlated strongly with the measured ST for RUL ECT (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>=0.98, <italic>p</italic>=0.008).</p><p id="Par327"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Study 1 showed that the effectiveness of rTMS can be enhanced substantially by using unidirectional, rectangular pulses with a specific current direction generated by a novel cTMS device. This could inform the study of unidirectional pulses to enhance therapeutic rTMS effectiveness. Study 2 demonstrated that generalized seizures can be induced with current amplitudes that produce more focal stimulation than conventional currents. Focality can be enhanced further via the electrode configuration. More focal stimulation could be explored as a means of lowering side effects. ECT stimulus amplitude should be individualized, since there is a wide spread of ST values across subjects. Both MT and the individual electric field model are strong predictors of ST and should be evaluated as safer alternatives to empirical ST titration for dose individualization.</p><p id="Par328"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> A.

Moreover, tDCS dose may be optimized on a subject specific basis.

Langer<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec191"><title>Euthymia Ltd., Tel Aviv, Israel</title><p id="Par336"><bold>Background:</bold> Before the discovery of presynaptic autoreceptors, the traditional view was that neurons communicate only in an anterograde direction: from the nerve terminal to the postsynaptic receptor. The characterization of the physiological role of presynaptic autoreceptors represented a new concept in neurotransmission, as information now was shown to be transferred also from the synaptic cleft to the presynaptic neuron, subserving an autoregulatory function in neurochemical transmission. Work during the last four decades showed that autoreceptors, initially discovered on NE neurons were also present for other neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, acethylcholine, glutamate, and GABA. Autoreceptors were shown to correspond to different receptor subtypes than the corresponding postsynaptic receptors, generating novel insights into the mechanism of action of drugs used in the treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases.</p><p id="Par337"><bold>Methods:</bold> The calcium-dependent, electrically-evoked release of NE, dopamine and serotonin was studied in different areas of the rat brain, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental conditions. The effects of agonists and antagonists of release-modulating autoreceptors were determined in the presence and in the absence of drugs which selectively inhibit the neuronal uptake of NE, or of serotonin. Statistical evaluation was made by Student t-test.</p><p id="Par338"><bold>Results:</bold> Selective antagonists of autoreceptors enhance transmitter release during nerve stimulation, while the agonists reduce the stimulation-evoked release of the transmitter. Partial agonists, like aripiprazole, have a mixed effect on dopamine release which is concentration-dependent. When neuronal uptake of NE, dopamine or 5-HT is inhibited by drugs, autoreceptor antagonists were shown to possess increased efficacy in enhancing the release of NE, dopamine or 5-HT when compared to their effects when neuronal uptake was operational. In addition to the autoreceptor-mediated control of neurotransmission, presynaptic release-modulating heteroreceptors are present on nerve terminals from noradrenergic, serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons. Release-modulatig heteroreceptors respond to mediators other than the neuron's own transmitter. The presynaptic autoreceptors on noradrenergic neurons correspond to the alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists like idazoxan and mirtazapine were shown to enhance release of both NE and dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex. Several atypical antipsychotics possess potent alpha-2 adrenoceptor blocking properties. In the dopaminergic system, pharmacological differences exist between the D-2S presynaptic autoreceptor and the D-2 L postsynaptic receptor as demonstrated with the irreversible antagonist of postsynaptic dopamine receptors: (-)-N-(2-chloroethyl)norapomorphine.The presynaptic autoreceptor on serotonergic nerve terminals correspond to the 5-HT 1D subtype.</p><p id="Par339"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Antagonism of central alpha-2 adrenoceptors by drugs like mirtazapine, and several atypical antipsychotics enhance noradrenergic neurotransmission by blocking the negative feedback mechanism mediated by presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoceptors. These drugs also increase the release of dopamine in the medial prefrontal cortex, activating postsynaptic D-1 receptors. Presynaptic autoreceptors for NE, and dopamine are more sensitive to the effects of agonists and antagonists when compared to the corresponding postsynaptic receptor.</p><p id="Par340"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> S.

Preclinical data propose that enhanced catecholamine output and facilitated NMDA-receptor mediated transmission in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) may partly explain this effect. Recent data suggest however that the rapid and potent antidepressant effects of ketamine and scopolamine are critically dependent on AMPA receptor-mediated transmission in the mPFC.</p><p id="Par347"><bold>Methods:</bold> We used <italic>in vitro</italic> intracellular single electrode voltage clamp recordings to study the effects of low nanomolar concentrations of olanzapine or asenapine, alone or in combination with fluoxetine and escitalopram, respectively, on both NMDA and AMPA induced currents in pyramidal neurons in the mPFC in rats.

Validation of biomarkers and development of biosignatures for psychotic illnesses may be compromised because the gold standard is clinical diagnoses, which often trump biological observations. A solution is to develop neuroscience-based classifications of psychoses. Psychosis subgroups defined by biomarker, not phenomenological, characteristics may yield molecular, systems, and pharmacological signatures that more accurately predict etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment response than do phenomenological diagnoses.</p><p id="Par358"><bold>Methods:</bold> The B-SNIP1 biomarker panel was used to generate variables that distinguished any psychotic disorder from healthy persons. For this analysis stage, measures at the neurocognitive level of analysis were selected (more classical endophenotypes), and individual dependent variables were screened for yielding the largest effect sizes for differentiating between psychosis (any of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disoder with psychosis) and healthy groups. Multiple dependent variables survived this analysis from neuropsychological (BACS), visual attentional and inhibition (prosaccade latency, antisaccade performance, stop signal task), and neural auditory processing (paired stimuli and oddball tasks) paradigms. Data reduction procedures reduced these multiple measures to a set of 10 core characteristics. We then statistically estimated the number of subgroups that efficiently summarized and optimized clustering of the core characteristics among psychosis cases independent of clinical diagnosis (3 subgroups). We then used k-means clustering followed by canonical discriminant analyses among psychosis cases to optimally differetiate the 3 psychosis subgroups (what we here call Biotypes). Comparisons were made between separations of psychosis biotypes versus clinical diagnostic groups (schizophrenia, schizopaffective disorder, bipolar disorder with psychosis) on the 10 core characteristics.</p><p id="Par359"><bold>Results:</bold> The core characteristics could be summarized as capturing (i) efficiency of neurocognitive functioning and (ii) sensorimotor regulation. Biotypes were separated in cartesian space by 3–3.5 standard deviation units. Clinical diagnoses were distributed across the three biotypes, so group separations on the core characteristics were all considerably larger for biotypes than for clinical diagnoses. Biotype-1 had severe neurocognitive dysfunction (poor BACS, poor inhibition, low ERP amplitudes, poor auditory suppression, sluggish neuromotor responding); 60% of this group had schizophrenia but 35% had manic psychosis. Biotype-2 had high intrinsic neural activity, moderate neurocognitive dysfunction, and relatively normal auditory ERP amplitudes (but poor signal-to-noise ratios given high intrinsic activities); 45% of this group had schizophrenia and 45% had manic psychosis. Biotype-3 had the most normal biomarker profile but still had moderatly poor antisaccade performance (1.2 SD units worse than normal) combined with faster than normal saccadic reaction times; 60% of this group had a manic psychosis but 30% had schizophrenia.</p><p id="Par360"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This B-SNIP1 result demonstrates that meaningful groups of psychosis cases can be generated with homogeneous phenotypic characteristics independent of DSM diagnoses. Considering hereogeneity within the psychosis illness class as a targer rather than a source of unwelcome variance may be useful for understanding unique and shared etio-pathophysiologies within this diagnostic domain.</p><p id="Par361"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> B.

Phenotypes included a comprehensive cognitive assessment, evoked electrophysiological responses, oculomotor pursuit, regional brain volume, resting EEG and resting fMRI characteristics.</p><p id="Par368"><bold>Methods:</bold> We examined the phenotypic differences across categories (Brain structure and function, resting state fMRI data, resting state EEG data, cognition, evoked potential and oculomotor data) as they relate to DSM categories and dimensionally to schizobipolar scale (SBS), a quantitative measure of the schizophrenia- bipolar spectrum dimension, We also examined these phenotypes between probands, their first degree relatives and healthy controls.</p><p id="Par369"><bold>Results:</bold> We observed an extensive overlap in phenotypic characteristics (such as abnormalities in gray matter volumes, cognitive performance, saccadic eye movements, and errors on antisaccade tests) across DSM psychosis categories, generally with schizophrenia patients showing the most prominent alterations, followed by schizoaffective and psychotic bipolar disorder. Effect sizes were moderate to large between probands and controls (eg Cognition composite scores, Cohen's d 1- 1.8; antiscaccade errors 1.3- 2.5; P300 amplitudes 0.3−0.7; cortical thichmess 0.17-0.8). Similar, but smaller alterations were were also seen in first degree relatives. Several of the phenotypes were abnormal (albeit to a smaller degree) in first degree relatives, and showed moderate to large heritability across several biomarkers (.eg 3–0.8 for cortical thickness).Few robust differences were seen between DSM categories either in probands or in relatives.</p><p id="Par370"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These observations suggest that neurobiological dimensions may cut across categories of psychosis spectrum disorders as currently defined using symptom presentations.

Tamminga<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec213"><title>UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas</title><p id="Par372"><bold>Background:</bold> Phenomenologically-derived categories of psychoses have indistinct biological boundaries. Genetic, electrophysiological, cognitive and oculomotor measures along with structural and functional imaging assessments have all failed individually to provide replicable signatures for diagnoses of psychotic disorders. Meanwhile, basic neuroscience and biomarkers for human neural function have burgeoned. The RDoCs system lays out a system to approach disease classification from normal systems neuroscience. The tools and stage of research are ripe for biologically-based classification. BSNIP1 used a dense battery of phenotypic markers to generate distinct biologically-based clusters within psychosis (‘Biotypes’). After creating the novel phenotypic structures, we applied additional measures of brain structure and function, psychosocial performance and family characteristics for validation. An immediate goal is to generate a system that will be useful in genetic and pharmacological research to increase the precision of target-driven research.</p><p id="Par373"><bold>Methods:</bold> The BSNIP1 network recruited and phenotyped 933 probands and over 1000 of their relatives along with 459 healthy controls. The human volunteers were extensively and similarly phenotyped. Individual phenotype data from all sites were quantified and analyzed within a single expert laboratory. Basic well-accepted psychosis phenotypes were selected as the biotype-defining biomarkers. Additional phenotypes and clinical characteristics were identified as external validators of the biotypes, including brain volume by VBM, psychosocial characteristics (Birchwood SFS) and family phenotypic characteristics.</p><p id="Par374"><bold>Results:</bold> Structural brain characteristics of the three biotypes using VBM analyses show distinct biotype anatomies. Biotype3 shows only a minimal level of neocortical grey matter volume reduction, mainly apparent in the cingulate cortex and amygdala. Biotype2 shows moderated grey matter reduction localized mainly to limbic cortex, prominent throughout cingulate and hippocampus. By contrast, Biotype1 showed extensive grey matter volume reduction apparent throughout all of cerebral cortex. Relatives of Biotype had no structural difference from normal; Biotype2 relatives showed subtle volume reductions primarily in limbic-hippocampal regions, whereas Biotype1 relatives had volume reductions, albeit subtle, throughout neocortex. Focusing on proband outcome, psychosocial function was the most normal in Biotype3, moderately disturbed in Biotype2 and worst in Biotype1 [131.3(25.0); 123.0(24.0); 116.8(23.4), respectively], paralleling the structural brain changes and cognitive impairment. Relatives of Biotypes1 &amp; 2 show 14.5% and 13.6% spectrum personality disorder, while those of Biotype 3 have only 3.3%. Demographic and clinical characteristics of biotypes will be reviewed.</p><p id="Par375"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The goal of generating categories of brain diseases which are based on biological characteristic is widely shared in order to further the goal of genetics and molecular target discovery in psychotic illness. The BSNIP Biotypes are rational products of a dense biomarker characterization within a large psychosis cohort. The validating constructs shown here make the biotypes themselves stronger constructs, and signal a further need for validation with genetic and pharmacological outcomes.</p><p id="Par376"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> C.

Neuroactive Steroids and Oxysterols as Endogenous Modulators of GABA and Glutamate Receptors: Basic Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications</bold></p></sec><sec id="Sec214"><title>23.1 GABAergic Neurosteroids as Novel Targets for Therapeutic Drug Development in Psychiatry</title></sec></sec><sec id="Sec215"><title>Charles Zorumski<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec216"><title>Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri</title><p id="Par379"><bold>Background:</bold> Considerable evidence implicates neural circuit dysfunction in the pathophysiology of psychiatric illnesses, including mood, anxiety and stress-related disorders. This work highlights a key role for imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory transmission within neural systems underlying emotion, motivation and cognition. Endogenous 5-alpha-reduced neurosteroids synthesized in the brain from cholesterol, and related synthetic neuroactive steroids are potent and effective modulators of GABA-A receptors that underlie fast phasic synaptic inhibition as well as more persistent tonic inhibition. Importantly, chronic stress often associated with neuropsychiatric illnesses appears to down regulate endogenous GABAergic neurosteroids contributing to neural circuit dysfunction. This suggests a mechanistic role for neurosteroids in stress-related disorders and renders these steroids potentially important targets for therapeutic drug development in a range of illnesses.</p><p id="Par380"><bold>Methods:</bold> Recent studies indicate that excitatory glutamatergic neurons rather than inhibitory interneurons or glia are predominant sites of neurosteroid production under basal conditions in the brain, suggesting that locally-generated neurosteroids are positioned to influence information flow in brain circuits in a paracrine or autocrine fashion. Other studies highlight complex interactions of neurosteroids with specific sites on GABA-A receptors located within receptor membrane spanning regions, and the role of the neuronal plasma membrane in the access of neurosteroids to their sites of action. Our studies use electrophysiological, molecular and cellular imaging methods in combination with medicinal chemistry to study effects of neurosteroids on GABA-A receptors in the hippocampus.</p><p id="Par381"><bold>Results:</bold> Because of their high lipophilicity, neuroactive steroids readily accumulate in plasma membrane and intracellular pools that influence their effectiveness and time course of action at GABA-A receptors. These observations have important implications for drug design and support the notion that lipid solubility is a significant consideration in functional receptor modulation. These studies challenge traditional views about the mechanisms by which neurosteroids modulate ion channel function. In the case of highly lipophilic steroids, high aqueous potency does not readily translate into high affinity at sites of action within lipid environments where neurosteroids accumulate at concentrations that are up to several orders of magnitude greater than in aqueous environments. Additionally, neurosteroid effects on GABA-A receptors may involve unique interactions with receptor surfaces within lipid domains rather than standard lock-and-key interactions with specific amino acid residues.</p><p id="Par382"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This presentation highlights recent developments in understanding molecular and physiological mechanisms contributing to the effects of endogenous neurosteroids and synthetic neuroactive steroids on GABA-A receptors, with emphasis on how these mechanisms influence the development of novel agents to treat stress-related neuropsychiatric illnesses.</p><p id="Par383"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> C.

NMDARs have also beenimplicated in the pathophysiology of various neuropsychiatric disorders includingschizophrenia, depression, Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. Drugs that augmentNMDAR activity may be effective antipsychotics; especially in improving negativeand cognitive symptoms. NMDARs are regulated by various natural substances,including the co-agonists glutamate, glycine and D-serine. Neuroactive steroidsdirectly and rapidly modulate ligand-gated ion channels such as NMDAR andGABA-AR to enhance excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission. Pregnenolonesulfate (PS) a purported neurosteroid synthesized in brain has also been shownto be an effective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of NMDARs and improvesmemory in various animal models. However, PS is a relatively weak NMDAR PAM andits presence in brain is controversial. These findings prompted a highthroughput chemical screen by Madau and colleagues to identify othersteroid-like NMDAR PAMs which revealed that several oxysterol derivatives(oxygenated cholesterol metabolites) were potent and selective NMDAR PAMs.Given the structural similarity between these compounds and natural oxysterolswe screened a series of natural oxysterols and discovered that the brain-specificoxysterol 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24(S)-HC) (the major brain cholesterolmetabolite) is a potent NMDAR PAM.</p><p id="Par385"><bold>Methods:</bold> We used whole cell patch clamp electrophysiologyof primary mouse hippocampal neurons to screen a series of natural oxysterolsto detect any that might modulate NMDARs. We also used hippocampal slices tomeasure LTP a form of synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory inorder to test the effects of both natural and synthetic oxysterols on synapticplasticity. Finally, we employed medicinal chemistry to discover syntheticdrug-like oxysterol derivatives and tested them in both electrophysiologicaland behavioral assays.</p><p id="Par386"><bold>Results:</bold> We have shown that the major brain-derivedoxysterol 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24(S)-HC) is a very potent and selectivepositive allosteric modulator of NMDARs. At submicromolar concentrations24(S)-HC potentiates NMDAR-mediated EPSCs in mouse hippocampal neurons butfails to affect AMPAR or GABA-AR-mediated responses. In hippocampal slices,24(S)-HC enhances the ability of subthreshold stimuli to induce LTP, a form ofsynaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory. Finally, we have shown thattwo synthetic drug-like derivatives of 24(S)-HC which potently enhanceNMDAR-mediated EPSCs and LTP, reverse memory impairment induced by a NMDARantagonist in mice. Thus, 24(S)-HC may function as an endogenous modulator ofNMDARs acting at a novel oxysterol modulatory site that represents a target fortherapeutic drug development.</p><p id="Par387"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Neuroactive oxysterols represent a novel classof NMDAR modulators. The major cholesterol metabolite in brain 24(S)-HC mayfunction as an endogenous NMDAR modulator subserving roles in NMDAR-mediatedsynaptic plasticity and thus may play a role in the pathophysiology of variousneuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.Importantly, the privileged oxysterol site associated with NMDAR appears to bea good target for drug discovery.</p><p id="Par388"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> S.

They are enriched in brain and demonstrate pleiotropic actions highly relevant to CNS conditions, including neuroprotective effects, learning and memory enhancement, anti-inflammatory actions, neurotrophic effects, and neurogenesis-promoting actions in rodent models. In addition, neurosteroids are altered and appear dysregulated in patients with schizophrenia and PTSD. Restoring equilibrium in neurosteroid pathways by targeting these molecules directly may thus represent a logical pharmacological intervention strategy. Pregnenolone sulfate positively modulates NMDA receptors and could potentially ameliorate NMDA receptor hypofunction in schizophrenia. Allopregnanolone enhances GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor responses, demonstrates anxiolytic effects, and modulates the HPA axis, thus exhibiting actions relevant to the neurobiology and therapeutics of PTSD.

Folic acid is also believed to play a critical role in brain development, supplying one-carbon moieties for such vital transmethylation reactions as DNA synthesis, gene expression regulation, and neurotransmitter metabolism. Using a large, prospective observational database, we have examined the relationship between prenatal nutritional supplements and childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorders. Specifically, we were interested in whether periconceptional folic acid supplements influenced the subsequent risk of severe language delay and autism spectrum disorders.</p><p id="Par402"><bold>Methods:</bold> The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa) recruited 108,841 pregnant women between 1999 and 2008 for self-report questionnaires, biological samples, and prospective followup. Maternal questionnaires administered around week 18 of gestation obtained detailed information about mothers’ supplement intake before conception and early in pregnancy. Of note, no foods were fortified with folic acid in Norway during the enrollment period; thus, synthetic supplements and ordinary dietary folate were the only sources of folate intake. Among offspring of this cohort, cases of autism spectrum disorder were identified though questionnaire screening at ages 36 months, 5 years, and 7 years; by professional and parental referrals; and by linkages to the Norwegian Patient Registry. A total of 38,954 children born before 2008 were also assessed for severe language delay at age 3 using a language grammar rating scale.</p><p id="Par403"><bold>Results:</bold> Compared to children whose mothers took no folic acid supplements from 4 weeks before to 8 weeks after conception, children whose mothers did take periconceptional folic acid supplements exhibited approximately half the rate of severe language delay (OR 0.55, 95% CI, 0.35–0.86), and comparable reductions in autism risk (OR 0.61, 95% CI, 0.41–0.90).

Several clinical trials involving patients with chronic schizophrenia suggest a modest benefit from folate supplementation. Greater potential benefit, including the possibility of prevention, may be realized through earlier intervention with folate. Mandatory folate fortification of grain products was implemented by the US government by 1998, which doubled mean blood folate levels among women of child-bearing age. Here, we determined whether this intervention was associated with altered cortical development, as detected by cortical thickness changes in children who gestated over the course of the folate fortification roll-out period.</p><p id="Par407"><bold>Methods:</bold> Using a large repository of clinical and MRI data (the Partners Research Patient Data Registry) we identified 386 children who gestated during and after the roll-out of grain folate fortification and who underwent clinical brain MRI scans at 9 to 13 years of age at Massachusetts General Hospital. After reviewing radiology reports and MRI images, we included 44 children with high resolution T1 scans that were read as clinically normal, and for whom no motion or other artifact was detected.

The current findings, although limited by the use of a clinically heterogenous cohort, suggest that population-wide folate fortification efforts influence an MRI phenotype that is relevant to schizophrenia susceptibility.

This talk willpresent an overview of findings that led up to the current research onpericonceptional folic acid and neurodevelopmental disorders. The subsequent talks will then focus oncurrent specific findings in depth.</p><p id="Par412"><bold>Methods:</bold> A series of studies based on the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944–1945 and the Chinese Famine of 1959–1961 examined the relationship between famine and subsequent risk for schizophrenia among individuals who gestated under these conditions. These results are presented in the context of translational work that points to potential genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, as well as ongoing prospective studies.</p><p id="Par413"><bold>Results:</bold> The offspring of mothers exposed to periconceptional famine- approximately one month before to 8 weeks after the start of pregnancy- had an increased risk of schizophrenia. This concordance was found despite substantial differences in the context and nature of these two famines and the results are in many ways complementary, as each setting had advantages and disadvantages for examining this question. In the Dutch Famine, the increase in schizophrenia was largely coincident with an increase in neural tube defects, which are known to be related to folate deficiency, and to be largely preventable by maternal intake of folic acid supplements from about one month before to 4 weeks after conception. Folate plays a key role in the ‘one carbon pathway’, in processes that may be relevant to early origins of neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia, for example, in DNA synthesis and repair, and in the epigenetic process of methylation. Genetic variants (eg MTHFR677TT) that influence folate metabolism have been associated with schizophrenia as well as with other neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism.</p><p id="Par414"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Thus far, it has not been possible to examine directly whether periconceptional folic acid supplements have a role in schizophrenia prevention. This is primarily because it is unethical to initiate randomized clinical trials of these supplements in high income countries, where they are recommended for all women of reproductive age, and because such trials would need a very long term follow-up. Investigators have therefore turned to: (i) large observational prospective pregnancy cohorts that collect data on both periconceptional supplements and neurodevelopmental outcomes. These are currently able to examine the relation of periconceptional folic acid supplements to neurodevelopmental disorders in children, and will later be able to examine their relation to schizophrenia, ii) research designs that can help to refute or confirm results from these prospective studies using specialized designs such as sibling studies and ‘Mendelian randomization’ iii) randomized controlled trials of periconceptional folic acid in low-income countries done within clearly recognized ethical guidelines, and iv) studies of potential mechanisms in both human and animal work, for example, epigenetic pathways.</p><p id="Par415"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> E.

Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation represent a critical link at the interface between genetic and environmental factors. Recent next-generation sequencing efforts have now given us access to the whole human DNA methylome at base resolution, revealing striking differences in the epigenomic landscapes. In brief, these studies have confirmed that the human genome is highly methylated (&gt;70% methylation) except for CpG island promoters that are strongly depleted for DNA methylation. However, large-scale partially methylated domains (PMDs, 70% average methylation). Since environmental exposures can impact the human methylome by reducing the supply of methyl donors and preconception levels of methyl-donor nutrients such as folate are protective for autism, neural tube defects, and schizophrenia, we are investigating global levels of DNA methylation by whole genome approaches.</p><p id="Par417"><bold>Methods:</bold> Using bisulfite conversion followed by high-throughput sequencing (MethylC-seq), we developed a novel hidden Markov model (HMM) to computationally map the genomic locations of PMDs in human IMR90 fibroblasts, SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, and human placenta. To examine a protective effect of prenatal vitamin use on DNA methylation in a prospective epidemiological study, mothers in the MARBLES (Markers of Autism Risk in Babies: Learning Early Signs) study who have at least one child with ASD, and who became pregnant with another child were included. LINE-1 methylation was measured in DNA extracted from maternal whole blood samples collected at first and second trimester and the child's cord blood using bisulfite conversion and pyrosequencing (averaged across 4 CpG sites).</p><p id="Par418"><bold>Results:</bold> We found that genomic regions marked by cell line specific PMDs contain genes that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, with PMDs being a mark of repressed transcription. Genes contained within neuronal highly methylated domains (N-HMDs) were significantly enriched for calcium signaling, synaptic transmission and neuron differentiation functions. Autism candidate genes were significantly enriched within N-HMD regions and include genes such as <italic>CHRNA7, GABRB3, CNTNAP2, EN2, NLGN3, HTR2A, RELN, GRIK3, KCNN3</italic>, and <italic>NRXN1</italic>. Mothers of children who met criteria for ASD on the ADOS were significantly less likely to have taken a prenatal vitamin before or during the first month of pregnancy. Taking a prenatal vitamin during this time was associated with significantly higher LINE-1 DNA methylation in the mother's second trimester blood. Prenatal vitamin use was also protective for ASD in the prospective MARBLES study, similar to the protective effect previously seen in the case-control CHARGE study.</p><p id="Par419"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results suggest that large-scale methylation domain maps could be relevant to interpreting and directing future investigations into genetic and epigenetic etiologies of autism. Preliminary findings from the MARBLES study of autism risk suggest that taking prenatal vitamins before and during the first month of pregnancy could reduce risk for autism symptoms and impact maternal methyl donors that saturate the human methylome in early development.</p><p id="Par420"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> J.

Current conceptions about schizophrenia suggest that despite the disease's heterogeneous causes, a crucial common pathway involves dysfunction of dopamine (DA) networks. One schizophrenia candidate gene encodes the protein kinase Akt, which is regulated <italic>via</italic> phosphorylation in response to hormones (eg insulin), growth factors, and neurotransmitter receptors. The data we have generated illuminate a molecular link between the recognized association of Akt signaling with brain disorders and feeding dysfunctions, including obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM).</p><p id="Par423"><bold>Methods:</bold> Recently, we have developed a new model using germ-line altered mice that we believe lends novel insight into pathogenesis. We used conditional gene targeting in mice to dramatically impair neuronal phosphorylation of Akt at Serine 473 which controls Akt signaling specifically in monoaminergic neurons.</p><p id="Par424"><bold>Results:</bold> Our molecular model linking brain dysfunction to diabetes relies on the observation that insulin, a key glucoregulatory hormone in the periphery, has a pivotal homeostatic role in the brain. We and others have shown that neuronal insulin action, <italic>via</italic> signaling pathways involving Akt, regulates key elements in monoamine homeostasis, including the trafficking and function of the DA transporter as well as norepinephrine transporter. We have shown that impaired Akt function, due to either insulin deficiency (type 1, T1DM) or neuronal insulin resistance (T2DM), results in impaired central DA homeostasis and contributes to hyperphagia. We propose that this DA dysfunction also contributes directly to the monoaminergic impairment associated with mental health disorders that are highly co-morbid with diabetes.</p><p id="Par425"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We show that dysregulated brain monoamine homeostasis leads to disordered feeding.</p><p id="Par426"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> A.

Correll</title><sec id="Sec244"><title>The Zucker Hillside Hospital, Glen Oaks, New York</title><p id="Par427"><bold>Background:</bold> Antipsychotics are being used increasingly in children and adolescents for the treatment of psychotic and non-psychotic disorders. Antipsychotic-related weight gain has attracted considerable attention, especially in the vulnerable pediatric population. However, life-shortening effects are related to perturbations in lipid and, especially, in glucose metabolism. The focus of this presentation is on the acute and chronic effects of antipsychotics on glucose metabolism, including insulin resistance, prediabetes and diabetes in youth.</p><p id="Par428"><bold>Methods:</bold> First, data from the ongoing Second-generation Antipsychotic Treatment Indications, Effectiveness and Tolerability in Youth (SATIETY) study were collected as part of a prospective inception cohort study of 272 antipsychotic-naïve youth. At baseline, week one, 4, 8, 12 and three-monthly thereafter, body weight, waist circumference, and fasting assessments of blood glucose and lipid parameters were obtained. Primary outcome for these analyses was insulin resistance, measured as the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA). Data were compared in youth with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (29.8%) and those with mood spectrum disorders (26.7%) or aggressive spectrum disorders (43.5%). Moderators and mediators of insulin resistance were analyzed. Second, in a Danish nationwide, retrospective longitudinal register linkage case control study, all 36,141 psychiatrically ill youth children and adolescents exposed to antipsychotics over a ten-year period were compared retrospectively with non-antipsychotic users with at least one psychiatric diagnosis on the time to onset of diabetes. Schizophrenia-spectrum diagnosis was assessed as a potential moderator of diabetes risk.</p><p id="Par429"><bold>Results:</bold> In the prospectively assessed antipsychotic youth (mean age: 13.9 years) body weight increased after a mean of 10.8 weeks by 19.0 (95% CI:16.4, 21.5) lbs =15.2 (13.2, 17.2)% with olanzapine (<italic>N</italic>=45), 13.5 (10.9, 16.0) lbs=10.4 (8.5, 12.3)% with quetiapine (<italic>N</italic>=36), 11.9 (10.7, 13.1) bs=10.4 (9.4, 11.3)% with risperidone (<italic>N</italic>=135), and 9.9 (8.2, 11.5) lbs=8.1 (7.0, 9.5)% with aripiprazole (<italic>N</italic>=41). Weight gain &gt;7% occurred in 84.4% (<italic>n</italic>=38) of patients on olanzapine, 64.4% (<italic>n</italic>=87) on risperidone, 58.4% (<italic>n</italic>=24) on aripiprazole, and 55.6% (<italic>n</italic>=20) on quetiapine. Increasing insulin resistance, measured as HOMA, was not significantly associated with sex, age, race, diagnostic group or leptin:fat mass ratio at baseline. HOMA change was significantly associated with various measures of body weight increase, being the most associated with fat mass change (<italic>p</italic>=0.0001). Individually, only olanzapine was associated with significant HOMA increase at 3 months, with glucose increase being mediated by olanzapine dose &gt;10 mg/day (p&lt;0.001).</p><p id="Par430"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Antipsychotics are associated with a relevant risk for insulin resistance and diabetes development. Not all antipsychotics carry the same risk and both the indication for antipsychotic use and the specific antipsychotic prescribed require careful consideration. Moreover, proactive monitoring, risk factor identification, and the development of novel treatments for the amelioration and, ideally, prevention of glucose metabolism perturbations in antipsychotic treated youth and adults are urgently needed.</p><p id="Par431"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> C.

Baker<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec257"><title>University of California, San Diego, California</title><p id="Par448"><bold>Background:</bold> Observational studies largely support an association of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with increased peripheral inflammation. Given the cross-sectional nature of the evidence, it is not known whether the observed association is due to PTSD-induced changes promoting inflammation (as sometimes postulated) or to inflammation predisposing to PTSD. Based on prospectively and longitudinally collected data from a military cohort, our aim was to determine whether plasma concentration of the inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (CRP), predicts future PTSD symptoms.</p><p id="Par449"><bold>Methods:</bold> These data were collected as part of the Marine Resiliency Study (MRS), a prospective field study of ∼2,600 war zone-deployed Marines. PTSD symptomatology and various physiological and psychological phenotypes were measured pre-deployment and three and six months following a seven month deployment. Subjects were male infantry Marines imminently deploying to a war-zone, of whom PTSD symptomatology, assessed using the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) was available from 1,861 (72.8%) and 1,609 subjects (63.0%) at three and six months following deployment, respectively. In addition to collection of relevant physiological co-variates, eg waist circumference, height, weight, baseline high-sensitive CRP plasma levels were measured on these Marines by using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, ALPCO Diagnostics, Salem, NH) at all three time points.</p><p id="Par450"><bold>Results:</bold> We determined the effects of baseline plasma CRP concentration on post-deployment CAPS using Zero-inflated negative binomial regression. This approach is designed for distributions which have an excess of zeros in addition to being positively skewed. Adjusting for baseline CAPS, trauma exposure, and other relevant covariates, we found baseline plasma CRP to be a highly significant overall predictor of post-deployment CAPS (<italic>p</italic>=0.002): each 10-fold increment in CRP concentration was associated with an odds ratio of non-zero outcome (presence <italic>vs</italic> absence of any PTSD symptoms) of 1.51 (95% CI, 1.15–1.97; <italic>p</italic>=0.003) and a fold-increase in outcome when non-zero (extent of symptoms when present) of 1.062 (95% CI, 0.99–1.14; <italic>p</italic>=0.086).</p><p id="Par451"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A marker of peripheral inflammation, plasma CRP concentration may help predict risk of PTSD symptom emergence.</p><p id="Par452"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> D.

However, the relationship between posttraumatic stress symptoms and inflammation remains poorly understood. It is possible that exaggerated threat sensitivity and avoidance could promote inflammation through effects on biological stress responses and health behaviors.</p><p id="Par454"><bold>Methods:</bold> Our sample included 735 Veterans Affairs outpatients (35% with current full /partial PTSD) who participated in the Mind Your Heart Study (mean age=58±11; 94% male). The Clinician Administered PTSD Scale was used for diagnosing PTSD and assessing threat sensitivity and avoidance. High sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count and fibrinogen were used as indices of inflammation. We first ran models adjusting for age, sex, race, kidney function and socioeconomic status, and then added health behavior factors including body mass index, smoking, sleep quality, alcohol use and physical activity.</p><p id="Par455"><bold>Results:</bold> Patients with current PTSD had elevated CRP (<italic>p</italic>=0.04) and WBC (<italic>p</italic>=0.03) but not fibrinogen (<italic>p</italic>=0.12).

Plasma levels of testosterone can increase during stressful events and may be elevated in combat-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). While the knowledge on functioning of the HPA-axis has been well understood in PTSD, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) system has received much less attention. We assessed several neurohormones in a longitudinal cohort study in soldiers prior to deployment to a combat zone. In earlier analyses we found high GR number, high GILZ mRNA expression, low FKBP5 mRNA expression, high sensitivity of T-cells for regulation by dexamethasone to predict development of PTSD as well as correlation of GR with amygdala reactivity after combat.</p><p id="Par459"><bold>Methods:</bold> We recruited 1032 servicemen prior to deployment and collected blood prior to deployment to a combat zone. They also participated in psychological assessment (eg depressive symptoms, temperament and character, fatigue). They were followed up for 2 additional time points post deployment (1 month and 6 months post deployment) in which blood was assessed in combination with the same psychological assessment.</p><p id="Par460"><bold>Results:</bold> Mean concentration of testosterone in the sample was 18.7 nmol/l (SD 6.2 nmol/l). PTSD symptoms occurred in approx 5 % of the sample, depressive and fatigue symptoms were higher. We analyzed testosterone in plasma at these three time points and correlated these to the developmental trajectory of PTSD symptoms. We found significant correlations between testosteron and ‘novelty seeking’, and negative correlation between ‘coöperativeness and testosteron both before as after deployment. High testosterone correlated with stressful experiences during deployment.</p><p id="Par461"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> A typical repsonse to anticipating imminent combat showed lowered excretion of testosterone suggesting that men responded to the potential threat of these situations with an inhibition of testosterone secretion. In this dataset comparison of plasma testosterone levels at the three different time points may indicate alterations in testosterone levels after combat as an acute stress response of the HPG axis, in contrast to an adaptation of the HPG-axis under chronic psychological stress. As has been found in earlier studies we also reporeted that novelty seeking correlated with testosteron, a correlation that was stable before as well as after combat.</p><p id="Par462"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> E.

However, the molecular events behind the statistical interaction remained elusive. Here we show a potential common mechanism of how environmental factors, moderated by genetic predisposition, influence long-term epigenetic states that lead to psychiatric disorders.</p><p id="Par465"><bold>Methods:</bold> In the framework of the Grady Trauma Project, we collect data on early life trauma exposure in an inner city, low socioeconomic and highly traumatized population. We investigate the interaction of simple nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulating gene FKBP5 in interaction with early trauma. We further elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind this GxE using pyrosequencing of bisulfite converted DNA to determine DNA methylation changes in and around glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in FKBP5. The functional impact of common, less common and rare variants in FKBP5 is determined by luciferase reporter assays. We further use chromatin conformation capture (3C) assays to show the impact of the functional variant in FKBP5 on the three-dimensional structure of the gene locus.</p><p id="Par466"><bold>Results:</bold><italic>FKBP5</italic> rs1360780 interact with child abuse exposure on the development of current PTSD symptoms in adulthood. Risk allele carriers exhibit a significant demethylation of CpGs around GREs in intron 7 of FKBP5 whereas carriers of the protective genotype retain a stable epigenetic profile. Chromatin Conformation Capture (3C) experiments revealed a directional three-dimensional (3D) structure of the FKBP5 locus with strong interaction of intron 7 and intron 2 with the transcription start site in risk allele carriers but without interaction of intron 2 in carriers of the protective genotype. The physical 3D property of the FKBP5 locus will be further described by chromatin conformation capture seq (4C) experiments. In addition to common variants in FKBP5 interacting with childhood abuse we identified less common and rare variants in and around GREs in the promoter, intron 2, intron 5 and 7 by targeted resequencing of the FKBP5 locus. The identified variants further alter the responsiveness of FKBP5 to glucocorticoids either enhancing or repressing the enhancer properties of the GREs tested in luciferase reporter assays. We present the effect of these variants on risk for PTSD in our large clinical cohort. In a multipotent human hippocampal progenitor cell line we show that GR-activation by dexamethasone leads to a stable DNA demethylation in FKBP5 when the cells are treated in the proliferation and differentiation phase. In contrast, treatment after differentiation does not result in a demethylation highlighting the presence of vulnerable developmental phases.</p><p id="Par467"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the first example of an allele-specific, childhood trauma-dependent epigenetic mechanism that lead to a stable epigenetic memory of early trauma moderated by genetic predisposition and an increased risk for PTSD in adulthood.

The brain mechanisms that underlie this sensitivity and enduring sense of threat are not yet understood, and may lie at the core of the pathophysiological mechanisms that perpetuate fear responses and cause or sustain this disorder. We had hypothesized that deficits in processing of contextual information are at the core of these symptoms and performed functional neuroimaging studies in PTSD subjects as well as translational studies in animal model of PTSD, to identify brain regions and molecular mechanisms involved in contextual processing deficits.</p><p id="Par470"><bold>Methods:</bold> Experiments involving fear conditioning, extinction, renewal and reinstatement had been performed in 3T fMRI scanner in 28 OIF/OEF veterans (PTSD subjects and combat controls), over two consecutive days.Fear conditioning, extinction and renewal had been performed in Single Prolong Stress (validated rodent model of PTSD) exposed animals and control groups.

Here we will describe aspects of this research focused on the interrogation of post-mortem tissue in PTSD cases/controls and selected brain areas; the posterior cingulate cortex (pCC) and the medial orbital frontal cortex (mOFC). Whole genome DNA methylation patterns of PTSD and control post-mortem tissue were surveyed using methyl-CpG binding domain-based capture sequencing (MBDCap-Seq). MBDCap-seq libraries were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2000.</p><p id="Par476"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 25 genes were differentially methylated in the pCC, 4 hypermethylated in PTSD cases.

In the mOFC, the glutamate receptor, ionotropic, AMPA 2 (GRIA2) and the lysine (K)-specific demethylase 6B (KDM6B) were identified as two of the top genes hypermethylated in PTSD cases (fold changes of 3.39 and 4.53 respectively). In a subsequent study, we ran the Illumina Human Methylation450 array in DNA samples from the mOFC in 8 PTSD cases and 8 controls and identified additional genes and CpG sites uniquely methylated in PTSD. Interestingly, we identified several additional genes that were hyper- or hypomethylated in PTSD cases that have previously been linked with dementia including ephrin A5 (EFNA5) a protein that regulates growth cone survival. Additional studies will be described using pre-clinical models to examine the specific effect of stress, shown to result in fear conditioning, on changes in DNA methylation in the pCC and mOFC.</p><p id="Par477"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is one of the first reports using NextGen sequencing and microarray strategies to identify novel genes and DNA methylation patterns associated with PTSD in post-mortem tissue.

Other phenotype measurements included in the data collection were the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) as our primary child abuse measure, and current substance abuse.GWAS All DNA for genotyping was quantified by gel electrophoresis using Quantity One (BioRad, Hercules, CA) and then normalized to 400 ng. Using the Illumina Human Omni1-Quad BeadChip (Illumina Inc.), SNP genotyping was performed according to instructions by the manufacturer. Data was analyzed with PLINK.Neuroimaging Eight fearful and eight neutral (4 male and 4 female) faces were selected from the stimulus set of Ekman and Friesen. Faces were presented in a random order for 500 ms with a 500 ms presentation of a fixation cross separating each face stimulus. Brain imaging data were acquired on a Siemens 3.0-Tesla Magnetom Trio TIM whole-body MR scanner. Structural images were acquired using a gradient-echo, T1-weighted pulse sequence (TR=2600 ms, TE=3.02 ms; 1 mm × 1 mm × 1 mm voxel size).Statistics Statistics were performed with IBM SPSS Statistics 19.0. Detection of outliers was performed, and when necessary, removed from analyses. Repeated measures of ANOVA or Student's ttest (two-tailed) for independent samples were tested with Bonferroni Post-hoc analysis. The results are presented as mean ± or + standard error of the mean (SEM) and statistical significance was set at P &lt; 0.05.</p><p id="Par481"><bold>Results:</bold> Using a mouse model of dysregulated fear, we found altered amygdala expression of the <italic>Oprl1</italic> gene (Opioid receptor-like 1, encoding the amygdala nociceptin/NOP/orphanin FQ receptor) )(p&lt;0.05). <italic>Oprl1</italic> is found in mice in the central amygdala (CeA) whereas its expression in other amygdala regions is relatively low.

Geyer<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec280"><title>University of California, San Diego, California</title><p id="Par485"><bold>Background:</bold> Animal models are essentialfor drug discovery and development in psychiatry. Over the past 3 decades, the ‘modeling’ of complex psychiatric and addiction disorders has shifted from ill-conceived attempts to recapitulate complete diagnostic syndromes to focus instead on specific dimensions of psychopathology. Given that rodents cannot talk (at least to us), animal studies must rely on measuring non-verbal phenomena. These phenomena in turn need to be demonstrable and measurable in humans and linked to parallel measures in the relevant patient population. Presumably, such measures are closer to biological and genetic substrates and more likely to be predictable from animal to human experiments. Fortunately, specific constructs of relevance to psychiatric and addictive disorders can be assessed using cross-species measures in non-verbal tasks.</p><p id="Par486"><bold>Methods:</bold> Measures of locomotor and exploratory behavior in rodents have been used for decades to assess arousal and curiosity and define stimulants and depressants. Rodent versions of the Behavioral Pattern Monitor (BPM) have identified empirical profiles that discriminate among a variety of stimulant drugs of abuse in keeping with their disparate mechanisms of action. To extend this paradigm across species, a human BPM (hBPM) was developed to assess exploratory behavior in psychiatric and drug-abusing populations. The hBPM is an office-size room containing furniture, but no chair, and an assortment of interesting objects to engender exploration. The subject is tracked by an overhead camera and movements are monitored by accelerometers for a 15-min session. No specific instructions are provided other than to ‘wait in here’. The same subjects are also tested in an Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to assess risky behavior. Ongoing studies in the hBPM are examining methamphetamine (METH) abusers with and without comorbid HIV infection.</p><p id="Par487"><bold>Results:</bold> In the hBPM on the locked inpatient Psychiatry Unit, manic BD patients exhibit a specific phenotypic profile that differs from other clinical groups and is characterized by increased distance-covering activity, increased specific exploration, and reduced spatial d. In the hBPM in the outpatient Psychiatry Unit, preliminary results from subjects with HIV infection and comorbid history for METH abuse revealed some increases in motor activity and exploratory interactions with objects. In this comorbid group, object interactions were correlated with increased measures of risky behavior in the IGT.</p><p id="Par488"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These findings support the use of the BPM as a reverse-translational paradigm to investigate phenomena relevant to addiction and other psychiatric populations in both humans and rodents. The subtle abnormalities seen in subjects comorbid for HIV and METH abuse are being used to validate related animal models which can support studies of underlying neurobiological mechanisms and, potentially, novel treatments. For example, the hBPM profile exhibited by acutely ill manic patients has been used to assess the validity of genetic and pharmacological models of mania and its treatment. Similarly, the interaction of METH and HIV is being assessed in mutant mice expressing HIV-related proteins, with and without exposure to a METH binge regimen. The further development of cross-species models is critically important, given the recent concerns that preclinical animal models have not been adequately predictive of Phase III clinical trials. The alternative strategy recommended here is to design parallel animal and human paradigms to test putative treatments across species. These human experimental medicine measures must in turn be selected to be predictive of efficacy in larger trials in the relevant patient populations.</p><p id="Par489"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> M.

David Jentsch<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec283"><title>University of California Los Angeles, California</title><p id="Par490"><bold>Background:</bold> Over the past 10 years, it has become increasingly clear that the neural substrates required for the effortful suppression of contextually-inappropriate reward-seeking behaviors are impaired in behavioral addictions. Moreover, several influential conceptual models now recognize these impairments as crucial to the loss of control over drug-seeking and -taking that characterizes substance dependence. That said, much remains unclear about the relationship between inhibitory control deficits and addictions. Whether these deficits anticipate addiction or are a consequence of it is an open question, and the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to impaired control are generally underexplored.</p><p id="Par491"><bold>Methods:</bold> Stimulant drug-naive and -experienced non-human primates have been studied using translational laboratory measures of inhibitory control (eg, reversal learning), temperament and spontaneous motor behaviors, as well as with non-invasive MR- and PET-based neuroimaging. Inbred mouse strains have been used in genome-wide linkage and association analyses to detect genetic influences on inhibitory control, as well as the causal influence of these genetically-influenced behavioral phenotypes on sensitivity to drug reinforcement (measured with operant self-administration procedures).</p><p id="Par492"><bold>Results:</bold> Our studies in stimulant drug-naive non-human primates have indicated that individual differences in inhibitory control abilities relate strongly to brain dopamine D2-like receptor availability; monkeys with naturally-occurring low levels of brain dopamine D2 receptors exhibit the most difficulty with suppressing inappropriate responses. Once experience with methamphetamine is commenced, brain dopamine D2 receptors decline and structural hypertrophy of the putamen occurs as a consequence of the drug, and this translates into escalating impairments in self control. Studies in inbred mice reveal the same relationship; strains with genetically determined low dopamine D2 receptor levels exhibit poorer inhibitory control and greater sensitivity to the reinforcing effects of cocaine. Variation in candidate genes (syn3, nt5dc3, rgnef) have been linked and associated with these phenotypes.</p><p id="Par493"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Problems with inhibitory control and addictions appear to exist in a bidirectional relationship with one another. Genetically influenced low dopamine D2 receptor availability leads to problems with self control and to enhanced susceptibility for drug-reinforced behaviors. Additionally, experience with the pharmacological actions of the drug further suppresses D2 signaling and impairs inhibitory control. These data suggest that intervening to counteract these molecular and behavioral adaptations will be useful in enabling effective suppression of drug-seeking and -taking behaviors.</p><p id="Par494"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> J.

Miczek<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec286"><title>Tufts University, Medford, Massachusetts</title><p id="Par495"><bold>Background:</bold> Extra-hypothalamic CRF, its receptor subtypes and binding protein modulate aminergic activity. Several of the CRF1 receptor populations in dorsal raphe nucleus, ventral tegmental area and locus coeruleus and at limbic and cortical terminals of the aminergic projections are sites for reducing escalated intake of alcohol and other drugs of abuse. The current studies investigate (1) the critical characteristics of social stress that engender escalated drug intake, (2) the CRF receptor subtype-specific interventions that putatively prevent and reverse the stress-induced escalation of drug seeking and taking.</p><p id="Par496"><bold>Methods:</bold> Intermittent episodes of social stress were studied in mice or rats that confronted an aggressive resident opponent for 5 min in 24–72 h intervals. <italic>in vivo</italic> Microdialysis of samples from the prefrontal cortex and n. accumbens shell were assayed for biogenic amines, acids and peptides, Microinjections of CRF R1 antagonists were performed via permanent cannulae into the VTA, n. accumbens or medial prefrontal cortex. The experimental design consisted of comparing socially stressed with non-stressed control animals. Within the socially stressed animals the actively coping animals were differentiated from the passively coping ones as defined by response latencies and durations. Alcohol consumption was studied in a binge model of drinking-in-the-dark as well as in a dependence-inducing model of intermittent access to 20% ethanol. Cocaine self-administration was implemented using intravenous catheters and protocols that comprised the acquisition, maintenance, abstinence and reinstatement phases. In addition, animals were studied during a 24-h continuous access binge.</p><p id="Par497"><bold>Results:</bold> 1. Brief episodes of social defeat stress induce behavioral sensitization in mice and rats. 2.Continuous social defeat stress engendered salient features of depressive-like behavior such as reduced body weight gain, anhedonia-like impaired saccharine preference and exploration, disrupted estrous cyclicity in females; (3) Intravenous cocaine self-administration was escalated in intermittently stressed mice and rats, at low doses during the maintenance phase and during the 24-h binge, whereas continuous subordination stress suppressed cocaine taking. (4) Intermittent access, like social stress, escalated alcohol consumption leading to dependence. (5) Microinjection of CRF R1, but not CRF R2 antagonists into the VTA prior to each defeat episode prevented the subsequent sensitized motor activity, escalated cocaine self-administration during the 24-h binge, and phasic DA release in the n. accumbens shell. (6) CRF R1 antagonists in the VTA selectively prevented escalated alcohol drinking without affecting concurrent water intake.</p><p id="Par498"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The selectivity of CRF R1 antagonist action on preventing and reversing escalated alcohol and cocaine taking identifies this receptor subtype as important target for intervention. In addition to the behavioral selectivity, the data point to receptor selectivity and anatomical selectivity for the modulation of dopaminergic activity in projections from the VTA. The precise interaction between CRF R1 and DA cellular activity awaits further characterization. Also, the differences between actively and passively stress-coping individuals appear to be linked to differential neuroadaptations as evidenced by BDNF and DA activity.</p><p id="Par499"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> K.

While human studies often exploit the ability of people to report subjective evaluations, animal studies obviously cannot, and rely upon interpretation of behavioural endpoints, and often use measures of drug self-administration. Importantly, in human studies, self-administration measures of reward value do not always correlate with subjective reports of liking, indicating that these measures do not reflect a single (or perhaps even a related) phenomenon. Furthermore, human self-administration studies differ markedly from animal self-administration studies, so that linking animal and human research is problematic. For this reason, we have sought to develop methods that are not only superficially similar in humans and animal studies (face validity) but which are, to at least some extent homologous across the species. Conditioned reinforcement represents a relatively discrete and psychologically well-characterized behavior, with a well established neurobiology in rodents, it would seem to be an excellent candidate for translational work between animals and humans. Indeed, similar approaches have already been applied in human imaging studies, revealing the involvement of the same brain circuitry, so that there appears to be an emerging argument for homology between the rodent and the human phenomenon, and thus for a useful candidate for comparative studies between rodents and humans.</p><p id="Par501"><bold>Methods:</bold> In the mouse, animals were trained to associate a tone cue with delivery of a food pellet into a receptacle. Following training over 6 sessions, two levers are inserted into the chamber, activation of one lever leading to presentation of the tone cue, while the other has no effect. In our human studies, the CS was an abstract picture presented on a video display, and predicted gain of money. An alternative stimulus did not predict reward. Following ca. 100 trials, individuals were introduced to a test session in which one button press gave rise to the conditioned cue presentation, while an alternative gave rise to the unpaired stimulus. These approaches were used to study pharmacological effects, and genetic associations with conditioned reward.</p><p id="Par502"><bold>Results:</bold> In both mouse and human studies, subjects worked to obtain a cue that was previously associated with reward (food or money, respectively). In the mouse, the ability of psychostimulants to facilitate such responding for a conditioned reinforcer was markedly influenced by manipulations of GABAergic systems within the accumbens. Preliminary data also indicate psychostimulant effects on performance of humans that resemble the rodent data.</p><p id="Par503"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> By studying homologous behaviours in rodents and humans, it may be possible to make more reliable predictions regarding human performance from animal studies.</p><p id="Par504"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> D.

While these changes are thought to contribute to the enduring vulnerability to relapse that characterizes addiction, different classes of addictive drug produce opposite forms of synaptic plasticity. For example, while heroin leaves the prefrontal to accumbens synapses in a state of long-term depression, cocaine produces long-term potentiation (LTP). Thus, it seems unlikely that these baseline drug-induced changes in synaptic strength mediate the vulnerability to relapse that is shared by all the drugs of abuse. The research to be presented shows that synaptic plasticity associated with the actual relapse event itself is shared between cocaine, nicotine and heroin, posing a causal cellular mechanism and shared molecular targets for treating relapse.</p><p id="Par507"><bold>Methods:</bold> Rats were trained to self-administer cocaine, nicotine or heroin for 2 weeks, and after 2 weeks of extinction training were presented with a light/tone drug-associated cue that reinstates lever pressing. Rats were sacrificed at different times after initiating reinstatement, and one of 3 measurements was made in the accumbens (1) dentritic spine morphology, (2) AMPA and NMDA currents, or (3) Western blotting for various glutamate associated proteins.</p><p id="Par508"><bold>Results:</bold> Across nicotine, cocaine and heroin trained animals a number of common adaptations were identified, notably during the first 15–45 min of relapse induced by a drug-associated cue, glutamate synapses in the accumbens underwent LTP as measured by an increase in dendritic spine diameter and the AMPA:NMDA ratio. These changes paralleled and were positively correlated with the intensity of the behavioral response, and depended on activity in the prefrontal cortex. It was noticed that after withdrawal from the self-administration of all 3 drugs, the nucleus accumbens harbored a marked down-regulation in glial glutamate uptake via GLT1. It was hypothesized that the reduced glutamate elimination promotes spillover from glutamatergic synapses during cue-induced drug seeking, and that this mediates both the rapid LTP-like changes and behavioral reinstatement. To test this hypothesis, GLT1 was restored by administering N-acetylcysteine. N-acetylcysteine prevented reinstatement induced by cues after all three drugs, and in the experiments conducted to date has also consistently inhibited the measures of LTP.</p><p id="Par509"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data demonstrate that rats trained to self-administer 3 distinct classes of addictive drug, cocaine, heroin and nicotine, all share in common reduction in glutamate transport via GLT1 in the nucleus accumbens. The reduced elimination of synaptically release glutamate produces a spillover of glutamate into the extrasynaptic space that is associated with rapid, transient LTP-like changes in synaptic physiology and morphology in the accumbens. Importantly, when GLT1 protein and function was restored with N-acetylcysteine, cue-induced reinstatement to all three addictive drugs was prevented, as were the reinstatement associated LTP-like increases in dendritic spine head diameter and the AMPA:NMDA ratio. These data describe a shared mechanism of relapse between different classes of addictive drug, providing a new model for developing treatments for individuals who abuse multiple drugs.</p><p id="Par510"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> P.

In rat models of drug relapse and craving, cue-induced drug craving progressively increases after withdrawal from cocaine and other abused drugs, a phenomenon termed ‘incubation of drug craving’. Incubation of cocaine craving is partially mediated by delayed time-dependent drug-induced accumulation of GluA2-lacking, calcium permeable AMPAreceptors (CP-AMPARs) in nucleus accumbens (NAc), a brain region critical for cocaine reward and relapse. The molecular triggering events and the specific glutamatergic projection to NAc that are involved in this form of long-lasting cocaine-induced synaptic plasticity are unknown. We and others previously reported that, in the NAc, non-contingent exposure to cocaine causes the formation of silent excitatory synapses, potentially immature synapses that express stable NMDA receptors with AMPA receptors either absent or highly labile. Abundant in the newborn brain, silent synapses are formed during early developmental stages and subsequently ‘mature’ into fully functional synapses by recruiting AMPA receptors. The functional significance of cocaine-induced formation of silent synapses in the NAc in animal models of drug reward and relapse is unknown, but it has been hypothesized that generation and subsequent unsilencing of silent synapses may be a critical cellular process through which exposure to cocaine re-develops/re-organizes the related brain circuit to produce long-lasting addiction-related behaviors. Here, we studied the role of cocaine-induced formation of silent synapses in the basolateral amygdala (BLA)-to-NAc and prefrontal cortex (PFC)-to-NAc glutamatergic projection in the incubation of cocaine craving.</p><p id="Par512"><bold>Methods:</bold> We employed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> optogenetic approach combined with slice electrophysiology and operant behavioral tests (cocaine self-administration) to examine the role of two critical pathways, BLA-to-NAc and PFC-to-NAc afferents in cue-induced incubation of cocaine craving.</p><p id="Par513"><bold>Results:</bold> Following cocaine self-administration, silent excitatory synapses are detected in these two projections. Our subsequent results suggest that these cocaine-generated silent synapses mature into fully functional synapses by recruiting calcium-permeable AMPA receptors. Furthermore, optogenetic reversal of the maturation of silent synapses within the BLA-to-NAc projection reverses incubation of cocaine craving, whereas reversal of the maturation of silent synapses within the PFC-to-NAc projection promotes cocaine craving.</p><p id="Par514"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Silent synapses play a critical role in synaptic and circuitry development. Our results suggest that the potential silent synapse-based circuitry re-organization play a differential roles in cocaine craving; reorganization of the BLA-to-NAc projection contribute to, whereas reorganization of PFC-to-NAc compromise, incubation of cocaine craving.</p><p id="Par515"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> Y.

Wolf<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec299"><title>Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, North Chicago, Illinois</title><p id="Par516"><bold>Background:</bold> Long after achieving abstinence, cocaine addicts remain vulnerable to cue-induced craving leading to relapse. Thus, a pharmacological treatment to reduce cue-induced craving could prolong abstinence. In a rodent model of addiction, rats show a progressive intensification (‘incubation’) of cue-induced craving after withdrawal from extended access cocaine self-administration. We showed previously that high conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs) accumulate at synapses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) during prolonged withdrawal and mediate the expression of ‘incubated’ craving. Then, using slice recordings, we showed that mGluR1 stimulation produces a postsynaptically expressed form of synaptic depression in the NAc of ‘incubated rats’ that is mediated by CP-AMPAR removal from synapses. The goal of the present study was to determine if systemic treatment with an mGluR1 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) would remove CP-AMPARs from NAc synapses and thus reduce cue-induced cocaine craving.</p><p id="Par517"><bold>Methods:</bold> Rats self-administered cocaine or saline (6 h/d for 10 d). To assess craving, cue-induced seeking tests were conducted on withdrawal day (WD) 45 or greater. During the test, nose-poking in the active hole (previously associated with cocaine and cue delivery) now delivers only the cue. Thus, responding provides a measure of cue-induced craving. Some rats were killed at different times after the test, and slices were prepared for patch clamp recordings. Levels of CP-AMPAR transmission were assessed based on the rectification index and sensitivity to naspm. Biotinylation and co-IP studies evaluated mGluR1 surface expression and association with Homer proteins.</p><p id="Par518"><bold>Results:</bold> First, we showed that intra-NAc infusions of the group I agonist DHPG or an mGluR1 PAM attenuated the expression of incubated cue-induced cocaine seeking. Next, in behavioral studies followed by patch-clamp recordings, we showed that systemic administration of an mGluR1 PAM also reduced seeking, an effect accompanied by removal of CP-AMPARs from NAc synapses. This protective effect persisted for ∼1 day. These findings led us to hypothesize that mGluR1 normally exerts inhibitory tone on CP-AMPAR levels in the NAc and that loss of mGluR1 tone during withdrawal enables CP-AMPAR accumulation. Based on the time-course of CP-AMPAR accumulation during withdrawal, we selected 3 time-points for study: WD14 (before any change), WD25 (when CP-AMPARs are beginning to increase) and WD48 (when CP-AMPARs are stably expressed). While saline and cocaine groups did not differ on WD14, the cocaine group exhibited decreased mGluR1 surface expression on WD25 and WD48, suggesting that persistently decreased mGluR1 surface expression contributes to CP-AMPAR accumulation. Homer protein levels and mGluR1-Homer interactions were not altered. Restoring mGluR1 tone during this critical period (WD15-33), by administering repeated mGluR1 PAM injections, blocked CP-AMPAR accumulation and the incubation of cue-induced cocaine seeking, effects which persisted 2–3 days after the last PAM injection.</p><p id="Par519"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Acutely stimulating mGluR1, after incubation has occurred, reduces CP-AMPAR transmission and prevents expression of incubated cocaine craving. Furthermore, repeated mGluR1 PAM injections during a critical period of withdrawal oppose the decrease in surface mGluR1 that normally occurs, thereby maintaining mGluR1-mediated inhibitory control over CP-AMPAR accumulation. Thus, mGluR1 PAMs could be used by recovering addicts to control cue-induced craving and prolong abstinence. This has major translational significance as no treatment is presently available that can provide such protection.</p><p id="Par520"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> M.

Grace<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec302"><title>Dopamine Neurophysiology, Schizophrenia, Translational Research, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</title><p id="Par521"><bold>Background:</bold> Amphetamine administration is known to produce a rewarding, positive affective state in subjects that take the drug, presumably through its ability to elicit dopamine release. However, following 18 hours withdrawal from amphetamine, subjects often report a negative affect, which causes the subject to take additional drug to offset this condition. This is consistent with the opponent process theory, in which the drug-induced positive state leads to a homeostatic, long-lasting down-regulation of the same system upon withdrawal. A similar condition also exists following acute restraint stress, in which the dopamine neuron activation observed 2 hours after restraint is replaced by a substantial down-regulation of dopamine neuron firing 24 hours later; an effect that is mediated via the amygdala. We tested whether ketamine, a novel rapidly-acting antidepressant, could reverse this amphetamine-driven attenuated dopaminergic state.</p><p id="Par522"><bold>Methods:</bold> Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given 2.0 mg/kg amphetamine, and 18 hours later were anesthetized with choral hydrate and dopamine neurons were recorded by passing an electrode through the ventral tegmentum in a 9-track pattern and counting active dopamine neurons. Dopamine neuron population activity (i.e., number of neurons firing per electrode track), firing rate and firing pattern were assessed. A subgroup of rats was administered 5.0 mg/kg ketamine prior to recording.</p><p id="Par523"><bold>Results:</bold> 18 hours post-amphetamine, there was a greater than 50% reduction in dopamine neuron population activity in the ventral tegmental area, with no change in average firing rate or pattern. When the amphetamine-treated rats were injected with ketamine immediately before recording, dopamine neuron activity was restored to baseline levels.</p><p id="Par524"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The dopamine system is regulated in opposite manners depending on the state of the organism. Conditions that result in reward or sensitization produce an increase in dopamine system activity. However, following withdrawal of these treatments, there is an extended, time-dependent compensatory down-regulation of dopamine neuron firing. Specifically, a decrease in the number of dopamine neurons firing would limit the amplitude of phasic responses to stimuli. Such a down-regulation would lead to an attenuated response of the dopamine system to rewarding or activating stimuli; this resultant negative affective state could then drive additional drug taking to offset these consequences. Ketamine administration appears to reverse this attenuated state, and therefore may prove beneficial in circumventing the cycle of drug taking/withdrawal/readministration that leads to abuse.</p><p id="Par525"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> A.

On the following day, rats received an injection of vehicle or JDTic, a KOR antagonist with long-lasting effects (&gt;14 d) in rodents. In subsequent test sessions, rats received ICV infusions of CRF (0.25, 0.5 or 1 μg) or aCSF and were tested 1 hr later. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed in mice using the acoustic startle reflex following CRF infusion or footshock. Mice were matched into groups with equivalent baseline startle and given an injection of the KOR antagonist JDTic or vehicle prior to testing. In the test session, mice received either an ICV infusion of CRF (1 μg) or ascending footshock amplitudes each followed by a startle test. Mutant KOR mice were subjected to the same behavioral protocols without administration of JDTic. Data were analyzed by ANOVAs and <italic>post hoc</italic> tests.</p><p id="Par530"><bold>Results:</bold> CRF produced dose-dependent decreases in correct responses and increases in omission errors in the 5CSRTT and JDTic attenuated these effects. In mice, blockade of KORs by JDTic attenuated CRF and footshock induced increases in startle. In comparison, constitutive KOR knockout (KO) mice had similar levels of potentiated startle compared to controls and JDTic did not have an effect on startle in these KOs. Conditional KOs in which KORs were ablated only in dopamine transporter (DAT) expressing neurons had significantly lower levels of footshock-induced potentiation, but similar levels of CRF-enhanced startle compared to controls.</p><p id="Par531"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data suggest KOR antagonists may prevent stress effects that can degrade performance and contribute to the development of psychiatric illnesses such as anxiety and PTSD. Interestingly, constitutive KOR KO mice show equivalent levels of CRF and footshock-potentiated startle compared to wild type littermates, whereas KOR deletion restricted to DAT expressing neurons was sufficient to reduce footshock effects. Lack of JDTic effects in the constitutive mutants indicates that the actions of KOR antagonists are due to on-target effects. This pattern of results suggests compensatory adaptations in KOR function occurring during development may account for the dissociation between JDTic-treated and constitutive KOR KO mice. Further, KOR function in regions outside dopamine neurons likely plays an important role in regulating CRF effects on startle. Overall, these data provide additional evidence that disruption of KOR function reduces stress-induced behaviors and support the idea that a general ability for disruption of KOR function to reduce the effects of stress underlies the beneficial effects of KOR antagonists in a diverse range of disease models.</p><p id="Par532"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> A.

Koob<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec309"><title>The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California</title><p id="Par533"><bold>Background:</bold> Drug addiction has been defined as a chronically relapsing disorder characterized by (1) compulsion to seek and take the drug, (2) loss of control in limiting intake, and (3) emergence of a negative emotional state (eg, dysphoria, anxiety, irritability), reflecting a motivational withdrawal syndrome, when access to the drug is prevented (defined here as dependence). The compulsivity associated with drugs of abuse has been hypothesized to derive from several mechanisms, one of which involves increased drug seeking that results from negative reinforcement. Multiple mechanisms can be envisioned to explain the role of kappa systems in the compulsivity associated with addiction, including interactions with the dopamine system (a within-system neuroadaptation where dynorphin drives decreases in dopamine function) and interactions with other brain stress systems (between-system neuroadaptation where dynorphin activates or is activated by corticotropin-releasing factor). Under this framework, the emergence of a negative emotional state with the development of dependence provides the aversive stimulus to drive drug seeking to remove the negative emotional state (negative reinforcement).</p><p id="Par534"><bold>Methods:</bold> Animal models of excessive drug taking associated with extended access have been developed where animals increase drug seeking with extended access/exposure. Here, animals are allowed access to intravenous self-administration of drugs for either 1 h per day (short access group) or 6–21 h per day (long access groups).</p><p id="Par535"><bold>Results:</bold> Long, 6 h access to cocaine and methamphetamine, 12 h access to heroin, and 21 h access to nicotine results in an increase in responding over days, whereas short access produces no escalation in intake. Blockade of kappa opioid receptors can block the escalation in intake of cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and nicotine. Evidence to date suggests that one site for these actions is the shell of the nucleus accumbens, but other data suggest a role for the central nucleus of the amygdala.</p><p id="Par536"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> One viable hypothesis to explain these results is that nucleus accumbens dynorphin mediates the dysphoric-like effects of drug withdrawal, and the central nucleus of the amygdala mediates the anxiety-like effects of drug withdrawal. Preliminary evidence also suggests that once the kappa system is engaged, the neuroadaptations persist and may be resistant to kappa antagonists. Thus, the dynorphin-kappa opioid system may be a key component of the transition to dependence, and different brain areas may be responsible for the multiple effects of activation of the dynorphin/kappa opioid system in the compulsivity associated with addiction.</p><p id="Par537"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> G.

The ê-opioid receptor (KOR) is the primary target for the endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin (DYN) and KORs within nuclei comprising the central extended amygdala, prefrontal cortex (PFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) participate in the complex integration of information related to different behavioral domains such as decision-making and negative affect. Recent evidence has indicated that the DYN / KOR system in the PFC and OFC of humans and animals is dysregulated in alcohol dependence in a manner that could contribute to maladaptive behavioral regulation. The primary purpose of these studies was to assess the involvement of KORs in the development of impulsive- or withdrawal / KOR agonist stress-induced negative affective-like phenotypes as assessed by measurement of response inhibition, intolerance to delay or 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) following central KOR agonist exposure or during alcohol dependence-induced acute withdrawal, with both conditions being challenged by the KOR antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (norBNI).</p><p id="Par539"><bold>Methods:</bold> Separate groups of male Wistar rats were trained in the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) and delay discounting (DD) paradigms. The impact of the centrally-administered KOR agonist U50,488 on performance in the SSRT and DD paradigms was assessed using a within-subject dosing design and the effects of norBNI on the pro-impulsive effects of U50,488 was determined. Lastly, withdrawal / KOR agonist stress-induced negative affective-like behavior was assessed via measurement of 22-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations during acute withdrawal in alcohol-dependent animals following norBNI infusion or following U50,488 infusion with or without norBNI pre-exposure in alcohol-naïve animals.</p><p id="Par540"><bold>Results:</bold> The results showed a dissociable effect of KOR agonists on impulsive phenotypes related to response inhibition or intolerance to delay with selective effects in the SSRT that were not confounded by locomotor effects of U50,488 or a lack of motivation to engage in the task. Importantly, the pro-impulsive effects of U50,488 infusion were rescued by pretreatment with norBNI. Acute withdrawal-induced 22-kHz USVs were dose-dependently reduced by norBNI and U50,488-induced increases in 22-kHZ USVs were rescued by norBNI.</p><p id="Par541"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> When ‘mimicking’ alcohol dependence and withdrawal via central KOR agonist infusions, for the first time the DYN / KOR system was implicated as a mediator of impulsive responding, selectively related to response inhibition, in a norBNI-reversible manner. These results identify novel canonical targets involving the DYN / KOR system for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders involving impulse control, the increased impulsivity observed in substance use disorders and withdrawal stress-induced negative affect.</p><p id="Par542"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> B.

NEWMEDS brings together scientists from academic institutions with nearly all major biopharmaceutical companies. One focus of he project has been to develop standardised paradigms, acquisition and analysis techniques to apply brain imaging, especially fMRI and PET imaging to drug development.</p><p id="Par545"><bold>Methods:</bold> We investigated human and rodent fMRI methods usable for drug discovery. In humans (Plichta <italic>et al.</italic> 2012, Neuroimage) we assessed both within-subject and group-level reliability of a combined three-task fMRI battery targeting three systems of wide applicability in clinical and cognitive neuroscience: an emotional (face matching), a motivational (monetary reward anticipation) and a cognitive (n-back working memory) task. FMRI reliability was quantified using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) applied at three different levels ranging from a global to a localized and fine spatial scale: (1) reliability of group-level activation maps over the whole brain and within targeted regions of interest (ROIs); (2) within-subject reliability of ROI-mean amplitudes and (3) within-subject reliability of individual voxels in the target ROIs. In rodents, we developed resting state fMRI methods and assessed effects of the drug, haloperidol (Gass <italic>et al.</italic> ENP 2013). Sprague-Dawley rats received either haloperidol (1 mg/kg, s.c.) or the same volume of saline a week apart. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired 20 min after injection. Connectivity analyses were performed using two complementary approaches: correlation analysis between 44 atlas-derived regions of interest, and seed-based connectivity mapping.</p><p id="Par546"><bold>Results:</bold> In humans, eeliability of group level activation was excellent for all three tasks with ICCs of 0.89–0.98 at the whole brain level and 0.66–0.97 within target ROIs. Within-subject reliability of ROI-mean amplitudes across sessions was fair to good for the reward task (ICCs=0.56–0.62) and, dependent on the particular ROI, also fair-to-good for the n-back task(ICCs=0.44–0.57) but lower for the faces task (ICC=-0.02–0.16). In rodents, presence of haloperidol led to reduced correlation between the substantia nigra and several brain regions, notably the cingulate and prefrontal cortices, posterodorsal hippocampus, ventral pallidum, and motor cortex. Haloperidol induced focal changes in functional connectivity were found to be the most strongly associated with ascending dopamine projections. These included reduced connectivity between the midbrain and the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, possibly relating to its therapeutic action, and decreased coupling between substantia nigra and motor areas, which may reflect dyskinetic effects.</p><p id="Par547"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In humans, the newly developed task battery was well suited to between-subject designs, including imaging genetics. When specific recommendations are followed, the n-back and reward task are also suited for within-subject designs, including pharmaco-fMRI. In rodents, be showed the feasibility of connectivity functional imaging data data for further characterizing the functional circuits modulated by antipsychotics that could be targeted by innovative drug treatments.</p><p id="Par548"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> A.

Barch<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec319"><title>Washington University, Saint Louis, Missouri</title><p id="Par549"><bold>Background:</bold> Over the past decade there has been a growing awareness of the disabling effects of impaired cognition in schizophrenia. At the same time, cognitive neuroscience has seen an explosion of technical advances and new knowledge regarding the neural basis of cognition. The Cognitive Neuroscience Research To Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia initiative conducted a series of conferences to develop a consensus on the constructs and paradigms from cognitive neuroscience that are ripe for translation, with a number of research efforts ongoing designed to achieve the goals outlined by CNTRICs. This presentation will overview of the results the Cognitive Neuroscience Task Reliability &amp; Clinical Applications (CNTRACs) Consortium. CNTRaCs developed measures of Goal Maintenance (Dot Probe Expectancy Task; DPX), Episodic Memory (Relational and Item Specific Encoding Task; RISE), Visual Integration (Jittered Orientation Visual Integration Task: JOVI), and Gain Control (Contrast-Contrast Effect Task; CCE). We present information on the development and validation of these new tools, data on sensitivity to the cognitive impairments in schizophrenia, relationships to functional outcome and symptoms, test-retest reliability and comparison to MATRICs measures.</p><p id="Par550"><bold>Methods:</bold> The CNTRaCs Consortium conducted two large-scale studies across five sites. Study 1 included 138 participants with schizophrenia and 136 healthy demographically matched controls, and compared multiple versions of each of the four tasks to examine optimal detection of group differences, interpretability as a specific construct, length and tolerability, and relationships to functional status and symptoms. Study 2 included 103 participants with schizophrenia and 132 healthy demographically matched controls, and examined test-retest reliability and practice effects across 3 timepoints (baseline, day 7, day 21), relationships to functional status and symptoms, and comparison to the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test and BACS Symbol Coding subtests of the MATRICS battery.</p><p id="Par551"><bold>Results:</bold> In Study 1, the DPX and the RISE elicited large effect sizes for detecting cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, the JOVI detected moderate effect size deficits, with all three tasks providing data that showed excellent interpretability in terms of the constructs of interest. The CCE revealed a small effect size deficit, and performance appeared to be confounded by time on tasks effects, making it difficult to interpret the results as reflecting gain control deficits. In schizophrenia, performance on the DPX and the RISE were correlated with performance on the UPSA-B as a proxy measure of function, and performance on the DPX was correlated with informant ratings of functional status and negative symptoms. In Study 2, the DPX and the RISE once again elicited large effect size cognitive deficits, and the JOVI a moderate effect size. The DPX and the JOVI showed some improvement from baseline to day 7, but no further practice effects from day 7 to day 21. The RISE did not show practice effects. The DPX showed good test-rest reliability (ICC=0.77), the RISE measures showed moderate reliability (ICCs 0.55 to 0.62), and the JOVI measures good to moderate reliability (ICCs 0.56 and 0.73 for threshold and accuracy). The CNTRaCS and MATRICS were both related to proxy measure of function. When controlling for shared variance with the MATRICs, the DPX and RISE continued to identify cognitive impairments in schizophrenia and the DPX continued to correlate with function.</p><p id="Par552"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results provide evidence of the validity, reliability and utility of these new neuroscience based measures of Goal Maintenance (DPX), Relational Encoding and Retrieval (RiSE) and Visual Integration (JOVI).</p><p id="Par553"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> D.

Furthermore, we investigated the functional consequences of methylation differences in humans and chimpanzees by integrating data on gene expression generated using next-generation sequencing methods, and found a strong relationship between differential methylation and gene expression.

Among these were 33 loci selectively methylated in neuronal but not non-neuronal chromatin from children and adults, including TSS at DPP10 (2q14.1), CNTN4 and CHL1 (3p26.3), and other neuropsychiatric susceptibility genes. Regulatory sequences at DPP10 and additional loci carried a strong footprint of hominid adaptation, including elevated nucleotide substitution rates and regulatory motifs absent in other primates, with evidence for selective pressures during more recent evolution and adaptive fixations in modern populations.

Ancestral experience is a rich source of information for future generations. Model systems are important to further our understanding of such intergenerational transmission including that of trauma and its sequelae.

McCullumsmith<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec342"><title>University of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama</title><p id="Par588"><bold>Background:</bold> Glutamate transporters remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft, facilitating excitatory neurotransmission by maintaining extrasynaptic glutamate levels. Captured glutamate may be converted to glutamine and cycled back to the presynaptic terminal, where it is converted back into glutamate. One of the transporters, excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) is expressed at high levels adjacent to synapses. Since the capture efficiency of EAAT2 is estimated to be about 50%, this transporter may act like a sponge, limiting glutamate spillover from perisynaptic regions to the extracellular space. We hypothesize that abnormalities of glutamate synapses extend to the glutamate transporters, and that there are changes in the activity, localization, and cellular distribution of these molecules in schizophrenia.</p><p id="Par589"><bold>Methods:</bold> We used electron microscopy, immunoisolation, immunofluorescence, mass spectroscopy, Western blot analysis and subcellular fractionation to investigate the cellular and subcellular localization of glutamate transporters in the human frontal cortex. We used [3H]-glutamate to assess glutamate reuptake in synaptosomal membranes isolated from postmortem brain. We used two cohorts of subjects; an older cohort from the Bronx VA brain bank (18 pairs of subjects), and a younger cohort from the Alabama Brain Collection (10 pairs of subjects).</p><p id="Par590"><bold>Results:</bold> We found alterations in the spatial distribution of EAAT2, suggesting that EAAT2 is not properly localized to perisynaptic regions in schizophrenia. We also found an increase in the expression of the EAAT2 splice variant EAAT2B in a biochemically purified fraction containing cytosolic proteins and extrasynaptic membranes in subjects with schizophrenia. EAAT2B mRNA expression is selectively increased in neurons, and decreased in astrocytes. We also confirmed that EAAT2 interacts with hexokinase, Na+/K+ ATPase, and aconitase in human brain. We found changes in aconitase levels in a mitochondria enriched fraction, and a shift in hexokinase 1 expression from mitochondria to the cytosol. Finally, we found an increase in Na+ dependent glutamate reuptake in a mixed synaptosomal preparation containing astrocytiic and presynaptic markers, in samples with an overall decrease in EAAT2 expression.</p><p id="Par591"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our data support the hypothesis that the cellular and subcellular distribution of EAAT2 is abnormal in schizophrenia. As EAAT2 faciltates the glutamate/glutamine cycle, changes in the activity or localization of this molecule would disrupt the cycle, leading to inefficient recovery of glutamate for presynaptic release. Our data also suggest that coupling of EAAT2 to glycolytic enzymes and mitochondria is disrupted. EAAT2 co-transports Na+ and K+ with their gradients, and the Na+/K+ ATPase maintains these gradients in the face of high throughput glutamate transport. Tight coupling to mitochondria provides ATP for this process. Finally, we found an increase in Na+ dependent glutamate reuptake; in the context of decreased total EAAT2 expression, these data suggest a compensatory increase in reuptake capacity by other transporter isoforms, including the neuronal transporter EAAT3, and the EAAT2 splice variant found in neurons, EAAT2B. Taken together, our data argue for an increase in cycling glutamate, with altered localization of EAAT2 and a global increase in reuptake capacity.</p><p id="Par592"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> R.

We used a novel, very short echo time proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) sequence to investigate glutamate, glutamine, the major metabolite of synaptic glutamate, and glutamine/glutamate ratio in schizophrenia (SZ) at 3T. The glutamine/glutamate ratio may reflect glutamate-glutamine neurotransmitter cycling. Reproducibility of this technique was first assessed. We also report GABA levels that are not contaminated by macromolecule signal to provide a comprehensive picture of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter function. Since previous reports suggest glutamatergic and GABA measures may vary with SZ illness duration we investigated younger and older groups. The relationships between glutamatergic and GABA measures, psychiatric symptom severity, mismatch negativity (MMN) thought to reflect glutamate NMDAR function, and cognition were examined.</p><p id="Par594"><bold>Methods:</bold> Fifty subjects participated in this study [SZ: younger (<italic>n</italic>=13) and older (<italic>n</italic>=12)] and age matched HC (<italic>n</italic>=25). MR scanning was conducted on a 3T Siemens Tim Trio. For detection of glutamate and glutamine, spectra were acquired using phase rotation STEAM: TR/TM/TE = 2000/10/6.5-ms, VOI ~ 24cm<sup>3</sup>, NEX=128, 2500-Hz spectral width, 2048 complex points, and Δφ1 = 135°, Δφ2 = 22.5°, Δφ3 = 112.5°, and ΔφADC = 0°. For detection of GABA, spectra were acquired from the same voxel using macromolecule suppressed MEGA-PRESS: TR/TE=2000/68 ms, 14 ms editing pulses applied at 1.9 and 1.5 ppm, and 256 averages. Spectra were quantified with LCModel and GANNET. Working memory, processing speed, and ERP MMN were assessed.</p><p id="Par595"><bold>Results:</bold> Test-retest of glutamate and glutamine was excellent (Mean CVs: Glu=2.3%, Gln=9.3%). We observed lower glutamate (<italic>p</italic>=0.027) and GABA (<italic>p</italic>=0.05) and a trend for higher glutamine/glutamate ratio (<italic>p</italic>=0.06) in the older SZ group only. GABA was negatively related to glutamine (<italic>p</italic>=0.002) and glutamine/glutamate (<italic>p</italic>=0.008) in both groups suggesting a homeostatic balance between excitatory and inhibitory activity. Glutamate, glutamine, glutamine/glutamate levels were not related to positive or negative symptom severity. However, strong associations were found between glutamine/glutamate ratio and MMN amplitude (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001).

Our results suggest MRS measures of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter function, obatined by optimized spectroscopic methods, are associated with specific brain functions linked to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We found that illness course may affect glutamatergic and GABA measures since they were altered in older subjects with SZ. Glutamine/glutamate ratio is also altered in the older SZ group. The strong association between the glutamine/glutamate ratio and MMN suggests that glutamine/glutamate may be a good marker of glutamatergic function.</p><p id="Par597"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> L.

Lahti<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec348"><title>University of Alabama, Birmingham, Alabama</title><p id="Par598"><bold>Background:</bold> The glutamate (Glu) hypothesis of schizophrenia proposes that blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors on ã-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory neurons results in excess Glu release leading to excitotoxicity (Olney &amp; Farber, 1995). Consistent with this model, recent proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) studies have reported higher glutamate + glutamine (Glx) levels in unmedicated or drug-naïve patients with schizophrenia (SZ). While MRS studies have focused on Glx and <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), a metabolite also found abnormal in SZ, separately less attention has been paid to the relationship between them. We compared Glx levels and the correlation of Glx and NAA in three cohorts of patients: (1) in medicated SZ (Kraguljac <italic>et al</italic>, 2012), (2) in unmedicated SZ, and (3) in unmedicated SZ evaluated longitudinally during treatment.</p><p id="Par599"><bold>Methods:</bold> Using 1H-MRS we compared: (1) stable, medicated SZ (<italic>n</italic>=50) and matched controls (<italic>n</italic>=48); (2) unmedicated SZ (<italic>n</italic>=27) and matched controls (<italic>n</italic>=27); (3) unmedicated SZ (<italic>n</italic>=20) scanned unmedicated, and after 1 and 6 weeks of treatment. Voxels were placed in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hippocampus. Spectra were acquired using the point resolved spectroscopy sequence (PRESS; TR/TE=2000/80 ms) and analyzed using jMRUI.</p><p id="Par600"><bold>Results:</bold> (1) In medicated SZ, relative to controls, there were no significant differences in Glx/Cr in either voxel. In the hippocampus, NAA and Glx ratios were significantly correlated in controls (<italic>r</italic>= 0.40, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01), but not in schizophrenia (<italic>r</italic>=−0.06; <italic>p</italic>=0.71) (z= 2.22, <italic>p</italic>=0.02). (2) In unmedicated SZ, relative to controls, Glx/Cr was significantly elevated in hippocampus (<italic>p</italic>=0.04).

Post-hoc paired-samples t-tests revealed trends towards decrease in Glx/Cr [paired t(19)=1.56, <italic>p</italic>=0.14] and increase in NAA/Cr [paired t(19)= 1.88, <italic>p</italic>=0.08] in the hippocampus. In the ACC, the correlation between Glx and NAA was not significant when patients were unmedicated (<italic>r</italic>(18)=0.28, <italic>p</italic>=0.24); however, these metabolites were significantly positively correlated after one week (<italic>r</italic>(18)=0.69, <italic>p</italic>=0.001) and 6 weeks (<italic>r</italic>(18)=0.55, <italic>p</italic>=0.01) of treatment.

However, in unmedicated patients Glx was elevated in the hippocampus. These findings are consistent with (1) reports of higher Glx in unmedicated or drug naïve patients (Kegeles <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012; de la Fuente- Sandoval <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011 ; (2) report of no difference or decreased Glx in medicated patients (Marsman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011; Rowland <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012). While studies of healthy controls have consistently reported a positive correlation between Glx and NAA, we found the correlation to be absent in unmedicated patients in both hippocampus and ACC. In ACC, the correlation appears to strengthen with treatment. In hippocampus, the correlation is absent whether or not patients are medicated. Because NAA and Glx are linked through the tricarboxylic acid and the glutamate-glutamine cycles, the lack of correlation between these metabolites suggest possible underlying pathologies of these cycles. We identified two forms of glutamatergic abnormalities in SZ: (1) elevated Glx in unmedicated SZ and (2) absence of correlation between Glx and NAA in both unmedicated and medicated SZ. These abnormalities might contribute to a progressive negative effect on brain structure and function.</p><p id="Par602"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> A.

The Met allele of the rs6265 SNP of the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene has been shown to increase neural reactivity to emotional stimuli in the amygdala and other areas involved in emotion processing and to impair extinction learning in both mice and humans. We have shown that patients with BPD lack amygdala habituation to repeated emotional pictures. In the present study we expand and refine our prior finding by using an imaging genetics framework to investigate the genetic underpinnings of this neural deficit. Specifically, we aimed to test the impact of BDNF rs6265 SNP genotypes on amygdala reactivity to repeated emotional pictures in BPD patients compared to healthy and psychiatric controls.</p><p id="Par617"><bold>Methods:</bold> Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was employed in 3 groups: unmedicated BPD (<italic>n</italic>=19) and schizotypal personality disorder (SPD, <italic>n</italic>=18) patients and healthy control subjects (<italic>n</italic>=20) during a task involving viewing unpleasant, neutral, and pleasant pictures each presented twice within their respective trial block/run.

This condition is characterized by several symptoms including hypervigilance, avoidance behaviours, intrusive memories and emotional dissociation. It is also linked with medial prefrontal cortex dysfunction and impaired extinction recall. Current PTSD treatments typically only produce partial improvement. Hence, there is a need for preclinical research to develop novel therapeutic approaches. Animal studies have indicated that fear memories can be weakened by pharmacologically blocking reconsolidation (memory restabilization after retrieval) or by extinction learning (learning that a danger signal is safe). Evidence suggests, that among other physiological alterations, there is increased noradrenergic activity in PTSD patients. Consequently, drugs that specifically target this system and are safe for human can be of clinical interest. Here, we investigated the efficacy of an á2-adrenoreceptor agonist, to block memory reconsolidation in an animal model of intrusive and persistent traumatic memories. We also extended our research by examining the dynamics of extinction retention in this model.</p><p id="Par627"><bold>Methods:</bold> Using an auditory fear conditioning paradigm in rats, we tested the efficacy of clonidine to weaken fear memory retention when administered systemically after fear memory retrieval, evaluating dosage, number of treatments and specificity in reconsolidation blockade. Additionally, using a similar paradigm, conditioned rats were extinguished with repeated non-reinforced presentations of a tone. Extinction retention was tested 1, 4, 8, or 24 hours after extinction learning.</p><p id="Par628"><bold>Results:</bold> We found that post-retrieval administration of clonidine disrupted fear-related memories in a dose-dependent manner and that two treatments were sufficient to obtain maximal memory impairment. Furthermore, we determined that this effect is long-lasting and specific to reconsolidation processes. In extinction, short retention intervals (1 and 4 h test) resulted in greater fear recovery compared to the longer retention intervals. Expression of extinction may be impeded by endocrine and physiological changes that occur as a result of the aversive experience of extinction training. Although blocking adrenergic transmission has been used to prevent fear in rats and humans, the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol was unable to prevent fear recovery.</p><p id="Par629"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results demonstrate that systemic administration of clonidine following retrieval is efficient to persistently disrupt fear memory retention through reconsolidation blockade. This provides preclinical parameters for future therapeutic strategies to be developed using reconsolidation blockade. In addition, results from the extinction study suggest that there is impaired recall of extinction at short retention intervals following extinction learning. We can use this paradigm to test how processing of extinguished cues by the medial prefrontal cortex may be impaired in PTSD. Identifying the mechanisms involved in this behavioural dysregulation may reveal additional pharmacological approaches to facilitate extinction-based therapies.</p><p id="Par630"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> K.

Drug addiction is considered a disorder of neuroplasticity, but little is currently known about the role for microRNAs in addiction. Circulating microRNAs in plasma are stable and may serve as useful biomarkers of various disease states, including neuropsychiatric disorders. Nevertheles, their usefulness as biomarkers for addiction has not been explored. We explored the role for microRNAs in regulating compulsive-like responding for cocaine in rats and mice. In addition, we also explored the potential utility for plasma microRNAs as biomarkers of addiction with diagnostic and prognostic value.</p><p id="Par648"><bold>Methods:</bold> Compulsive-like repsonding for cocaine was induced in rats by permitting them extended (6 h) daily access to intravenous cocaine self-administration. Control rats were permitted either restricted (1 h) daily access to the drug, or remained cocaine naive throughout. Expression profiling of microRNAs in the striatum of rats demonstrating compulsive-like responding for cocaine was assessed using microarrays. Individual microRNAs whose expression was dysregulated in the brains of these rats was verified by real-time PCR. MicroRNAs were overexpressed in the striatum of rats using lentivurus vectors. MciroRNAs were also overexpressed using a transgenic overexpression approach in mice. Conversely, microRNA funciton was disrupted in striatum using antisense oligonucleotides or by using lentivirus vectors to express ‘sponge’ inhibitors.</p><p id="Par649"><bold>Results:</bold> We found that two microRNAs, miR-212 and miR-132, were upregulated in the striatum of rats demonstrating compjlsive-like cocaine responding. Overexpression of miR-212 in striatum profoundly decreased the motivational value of cocaine in rats, but only in those with extended daily access to the drug. Conversely, disruption of miR-212 signaling in striatum increased cocaine intake in rats. We found that miR-212 controls cocaine intake through at least two mechanisms in striatum: first, it increases the activity of the transcription factor CREB; second, it knocks down expression of the transcriptiona repressor MeCP2. In contrast to the effects of miR-212 overexpression, we found that miR-132 overexpression increased the motivational porperties of cocaine. Currently, we investigating the mechanisms by which miR-132 regulates cocaine intake. Finally, we assessed microRNA expression profiles in the blood samples of human treatment-seeking drug addicts at the time of their admission to a treatment facillity in West Palm Beach, and at the end of their treatment 4 weeks later. We identified unique plasma expression patterns of microRNAs in those with substance abuse disorders compared with control samples collected from the local community.</p><p id="Par650"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> MicroRNAs in striatum play a key role in regulating sensitivity to the motivational properties of cocaine and in driving the development of compulsive-like cocaine intake. MicroRNAs may also serve as useful biomarkers for addiction in human drug addicts with diagnostic and prognostic value.</p><p id="Par651"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> P.

Furthermore, the only available small PET study on dopamine synthesis capacity in nicotine-dependent subjects demonstrated an increase in [18F]FDOPA uptake in the striatum in smokers. It is completely unexplored, however, whether reward processing and dopamine metabolism change after smoking cessation. The aim of the present study was to examine dopamine metabolism, neural correlates of reward anticipation and cue reactivity in non-smokers and nicotine-dependent smokers before and three months after smoking cessation in a combined [18F]FDOPA/fMRI paradigm.</p><p id="Par654"><bold>Methods:</bold> 30 male nicotine dependent subjects and 15 healthy control never-smokers (matched for age, cognition, education) were included. The control group underwent a single [18F]FDOPA-PET scan (124 min data acquisition after bolus injection). One half of the patient-group underwent a first scan in withdrawal (&gt;5 hours without smoking), the remaining subjects were scanned under continued smoking conditions. Subsequently, all patients participated in a smoking cessation program consisting of six psychotherapeutic interventions. 16/30 patients were able to remain abstinent for at least three months. This group participated in a second imaging session. All subjects underwent arterial blood sampling during the scanning procedure for obtaining activity input curves and [18F]FDOPA/[18F]OMFD ratios. The reversible inlet/outlet model was applied in order to obtain the net blood/brain clearance (dopamine synthesis capacity, K), the loss of fluorinated metabolites (dopaminergic turn-over, kloss), and the total distribution volume (storage capacity, VD). In addition, all subjects performed two paradigms on a 1.5 T MR scanner: Monetary and social reward anticipation were investigated using the Monetary and Social Incentive Delay task. The second paradigm examined cue reactivity by presenting blocks of smoking-related, neutral or sexually arousing pictures. fMRI data were analyzed with SPM.</p><p id="Par655"><bold>Results:</bold> Previous findings of a positive correlation between dopamine synthesis capacity and cognitive performance could be replicated (TMT-B <italic>vs</italic> VD in ventral caudate: <italic>r</italic>=−0.631, <italic>p</italic>=0.016). In continuously smoking patients, dopamine synthesis capacity was strongly and significantly blunted in particular in the right (-16%, <italic>p</italic>=0.045) and left ventral caudate (-16%, <italic>p</italic>=0.050). kloss was reduced on a trend-level. Three months abstinence normalized all presynaptic dopaminergic parameters in every region. Patients in acute withdrawal demonstrated a tendency toward reduced K and kloss. During both monetary and social reward anticipation smokers showed weaker activity of the NAcc compared to non-smokers. However, in response to smoking-associated pictures stronger neural responses were found in the caudate nucleus. No effect of smoking cessation could be detected.</p><p id="Par656"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Contrary to previous findings, our PET data indicate that smoking is associated with reduced dopamine synthesis capacity and turnover rather than elevations. The complete normalization after 3 months of abstinence was unexpected and does not claim an inefficient dopamine system to be a strong trait towards nicotine dependence. Our fMRI data implies that striatal activation during anticipation of non-smoking rewards is decreased in smokers while reactivity is increased for smoking-associated pictures. The findings further suggest that neural activation during reward processing is not affected by smoking cessation. Thus, while neurochemical markers of nicotine dependence are normalized, functional activation in cue-related paradigms are not.</p><p id="Par657"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> G.

We have previously shown that the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is markedly reduced in smokers and ex-smokers. In this follow-up study we will evaluate the significance of these findings.

D’Souza<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec389"><title>University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California</title><p id="Par668"><bold>Background:</bold> Nicotine is the main ingredient in tobacco that leads to continued tobacco smoking. The reinforcing effects of nicotine are partially mediated by dopaminergic neurons originating in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and projecting to cortical and limbic nuclei including the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Nicotine increases the activity of dopaminergic neurons by binding directly to nicotinic cholinergic receptors (nAChRs) located on dopaminergic neurons and indirectly by increasing glutamate transmission by binding to nAChRs located on glutamatergic afferents regulating the activity of mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons. Using a combination of behavioral, neurochemical, pharmacological and anatomical techniques we investigated glutamate, acetylcholine and dopamine interactions in nicotine-seeking behavior.</p><p id="Par669"><bold>Methods:</bold> First, the effects of blockade of nicotine-induced increases in glutamate transmission on intravenous nicotine self-administration and cue-induced reinstatement of nicotine seeking were evaluated. In addition, <italic>in vivo</italic> microdialysis was used to determine the effects of blockade of glutamate transmission on nicotine-induced increases in dopamine in the NAcc shell. Finally, the effects of direct injections of glutamate receptor antagonists in mesolimbic brain sites, such as the NAcc and the VTA, on nicotine seeking were investigated.</p><p id="Par670"><bold>Results:</bold> Systemic, intra-NAcc shell and intra-VTA administration of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGlu2/3) agonist LY379268 attenuated nicotine self-administration. In addition, systemic LY379268 administration attenuated cue-induced reinstatement of nicotine seeking. Interestingly, <italic>in vivo</italic> microdialysis studies indicated that LY379268 pretreatment blocked nicotine-induced increases in NAcc shell dopamine in nicotine-experienced rats only in the presence of a nicotine-associated context. In addition systemic, intra-NAcc shell and intra-VTA administration of the mGlu5 receptor antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP) attenuated nicotine self-administration. Finally, systemic and intra-VTA administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist LY235959 attenuated nicotine self-administration. Interestingly, LY235959 administration in the NAcc shell and core increased nicotine self-administration and cue-induced reinstatement of nicotine seeking, respectively.</p><p id="Par671"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Overall blockade of glutamatergic neurotransmission either via activation of the predominantly presynaptic mGlu2/3 receptors or blockade of postsynaptic NMDA and mGlu5 receptors, attenuated nicotine seeking. The <italic>in vivo</italic> microdialysis data demonstrate that mGlu2/3 receptors negatively modulate the combined effects of nicotine and nicotine-associated contexts/cues on NAcc dopamine. Moreover, the data suggest that mGlu2/3 and mGlu5 receptors in the NAcc shell and the VTA play an important role in regulating the reinforcing effects of nicotine. The increase in nicotine self-administration and cue-induced nicotine seeking after injections in the NAcc shell and core is intriguing and suggests an inhibitory role of NMDA-mediated glutamatergic transmission in these two regions on nicotine seeking. Finally, the opposite effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist in the NAcc shell compared to the VTA on nicotine self-administration suggests that the NMDA receptors play a differential role in nicotine seeking in these two mesolimbic brain sites. Taken together, the data highlight a complex interaction of nicotinic receptor activation by exogenously administered nicotine with glutamatergic and dopaminergic transmission in mesolimbic brain sites.</p><p id="Par672"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> M.

However, few studies to date have explored the impact of regular cannabis use on white matter structure, with no previous studies examining its impact on axonal connectivity. I will describe recent neuroimaging work conducted in Australia, where we aimed to examine axonal fibre pathways across the brain for evidence of microstructural alterations associated with long-term cannabis use and to test whether age of regular cannabis use was associated with severity of any microstructural change.</p><p id="Par697"><bold>Methods:</bold> Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (42 gradient directions) and brain connectivity mapping techniques were performed in 59 cannabis users with longstanding histories of heavy use and 33 matched controls.

Filbey<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec408"><title>Center for BrainHealth, School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences, Dallas, Texas</title><p id="Par701"><bold>Background:</bold> Addiction models such as the opponent process theory and somatic marker hypothesis have suggested that drug-seeking behavior is due to a ‘hyper-sensitive’ reward system that is out of balance with a ‘hypo-responsive’ control system. These models imply a failure of the frontal control system to keep responses to salient rewards in check. While these systems have been well described, how communication or functional connectivity within and between these systems changes as a result of chronic marijuana use has yet to be determined.</p><p id="Par702"><bold>Methods:</bold> Here, we describe three studies that examined functional connectivity in these networks as a result of chronic marijuana use. First, we examined functional connectivity within the reward-motivation network using an fMRI cue-elicited craving paradigm in 38 SCID-dependent (DEP) and 33 non-dependent (N-DEP) chronic marijuana users. Second, we looked at the inhibitory control network using an fMRI Stop-Signal task to determine inhibitory control network connectivity in 44 DEP and 30 N-DEP chronic marijuana users. Third, we looked at functional connectivity during resting state fMRI (fcMRI) in the salience (SN) and executive control networks (CEN), in addition to the default mode network (DMN), between chronic marijuana users (<italic>N</italic>=51) and non-using controls (<italic>N</italic>=53).</p><p id="Par703"><bold>Results:</bold> Using psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis on BOLD response to marijuana cues (<italic>vs</italic> control cues), DEP had greater connectivity between the nucleus accumbens (NAc; seed region) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG), and, insula relative to N-DEP (cluster-corrected p&lt;.05, z=2.3). Of note, regional activations via general linear modeling did not differ between the groups suggesting that that degree of functional alteration within the reward-motivation network is associated with degree of severity of use. Similar to the results during cue-elicited craving, there was no significant difference in regional activation between DEP and N-DEP in any of the inhibitory control networks. However, the PPI analysis showed that during successful response inhibition, DEP had greater connectivity between right frontal control network (seed region) and substantia nigra/sub-thalamic nucleus (STN) network compared to N-DEP (SVC, FWE-corrected p&lt;.05). Multiple regression analyses on the PPI maps showed modulatory effects of age of onset and quantity of marijuana use in N-DEP, but not DEP. Taken together, these findings suggest that functional connectivity between frontal control and substantia nigra/STN networks during response inhibition is sensitive to the effects of degree of severity unlike behavioral task performance and regional activation in inhibitory control networks. Further, modulators of this connectivity, such as onset and quantity of marijuana use, show attenuated effects with progression to dependence. Lastly, the fcMRI findings showed no significant difference among the nodes of DMN (p=0.94) and SN (p=0.82) connectivity between the marijuana users and the controls. However, the functional synchrony among CEN nodes was significantly lower in marijuana users compared to controls (p=0.005). Further, the CEN regions showed significantly negative association with the Impulsive Sensation Seeking Scale (ImpSS) suggesting that greater impulsivity was associated with decreased coupling of CEN regions.</p><p id="Par704"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our findings suggest that chronic marijuana use impacts functional connectivity in reward and control networks. Moreover, alterations in connectivity are modulated by severity of marijuana use such that clinical dependence is associated with greater connectivity in both reward and control networks. To conclude, differences in connectivity may be used as a diagnostic metric that could inform therapeutic outcomes in cannabis use disorders.</p><p id="Par705"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> F.

However, there is limited information regarding the extent to which these brain-based effects represent acute or chronic brain changes, are associated with risk factors for marijuana use, or are the result of marijuana exposure. We examined the effects of MJ on the development of frontal lobe systems in MJ-smoking adolescents compared to healthy non-using adolescents by applying a complementary set of magnetic resonance imaging techniques to further characterize MJ-related brain changes.</p><p id="Par707"><bold>Methods:</bold> Thirty-nine (39) adolescents with marijuana use (MJ aged 18.0±2.2 years), and 38 healthy controls (HC aged 18.0±0.9) completed an MR imaging protocol which included sMRI, rsFMRI, and task induced BOLD fMRI on a 3T MRI system. A subset of participants also completed proton MRS in order to measure GABA concentration in the anterior cingulate. Cortical reconstruction and volumetric segmentation was performed to obtain brain volumes utilizing the Freesurfer image analysis suite. Functional MRI data were analyzed using general linear model and the SPM5 software package in Matlab. GABA-edited MEGAPRESS proton MRS methods were used to determine GABA concentration. Participants also completed diagnostic interviews and behavioral ratings.</p><p id="Par708"><bold>Results:</bold> MJ using adolescents showed decreased orbitofrontal volume and decreased cortical thickness in bilateral insula and superior frontal coritces compared with HC. Activation measures during a finger-tapping task indicated that MJ users produced significantly less BOLD activation in the cingulate and cerebullum than HC. Furthermore, we found that age of onset of MJ use was significantly correlated with the structural measures of orbitofrontal volume and prefrontal cortical thickness, while the fMRI activation of the cingulate cortex appeared to be associated with chronic MJ exposure. We also found a 22% reduction in GABA within the cingulate of adolescent MJ users, which showed a moderate association with MJ exposure (<italic>r</italic>=−0.43, <italic>p</italic>=0.10) When MJ users were divided by total lifetime MJ smokes, MJ users with greater than 1250 lifetime smokes had smaller left rostral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) volumes (<italic>p</italic>=0.01), and smaller right and left (<italic>p</italic>=0.01) posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) volumes. Heavy smokers showed positive correlations between left rostral ACC (<italic>r</italic>=0.44, <italic>p</italic>=0.06) and age of onset and a negative correlation between total lifetime MJ use and left PCC (<italic>r</italic>=−0.47, <italic>p</italic>=0.04).</p><p id="Par709"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The finding of a significant association between reduced frontal regional brain volumes and age of onset of MJ use is consistent with the hypothesis that development of brain regions may be related to the initiation of marijuana use or that early initiation may lead to reduced volumes. Frontal brain changes may be most pronounced in adolescents with heavy MJ use patterns. The negative correlations between lifetime MJ use and BOLD signal suggest that MJ use results in functional alterations of cingulo-cerebellar circuits in the developing brain. Reduced cingulate GABA concentration may reflect a neurotoxic effect of MJ use, as a trend toward a negative relationship was evident with lifetime MJ exposure. Overall these imaging results appear to support both neurodevelopmental factors and neurotoxic effects associated with heavy MJ use in adolescents.</p><p id="Par710"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> D.

Volkow<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec414"><title>NIDA, Rockville, Maryland</title><p id="Par711"><bold>Background:</bold> Marijuana is the most frequently abused illicit substance yet it is not understood if its abuse is associated with similar changes in brain dopamine (DA) function as reported for other addictions (ie cocaine, alcohol). Notably, DA function has been linked to willingness to expend effort for rewards, and heavy marijuana users are anecdotally characterized by motivational deficits, where this may result from decreased dynamic dopamine functioning. Specifically, imaging studies of drug abusers have reported decreases in striatal DA D2 receptor (D2R) availability associated with reduced activity in fontal regions and reduced DA increases when challenged with a stimulant drug. Here we evaluate whether marijuana abusers show similar disruptions in dynamic DA responsiveness.</p><p id="Par712"><bold>Methods:</bold> Forty participants (<italic>20 marijuana abusers and 20 controls</italic>) were scanned with positron emission tomography (PET) and [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride to assess D2 receptor availability before and after methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg iv), which is a stimulant drug that increases DA by blocking DA transporters; and with [<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro- deoxyglucose to assess brain glucose metabolism (marker of brain function) before and after methylphenidate (MP). In parallel we measured MP's behavioral and cardiovascular effects.</p><p id="Par713"><bold>Results:</bold> Baseline striatal D2 receptor availability did not differ between controls and marijuana abusers, and MP significantly increased DA (measured as reduction's in [<sup>11</sup>C]raclopride specific binding) to the same extent in both groups. In contrast, MP effects in regional brain glucose metabolism were significantly attenuated in marijuana abusers when compared to controls. Similarly MP's behavioral and cardiovascular effects were markedly attenuated in the marijuana abusers.</p><p id="Par714"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Though marijuana abusers showed normal tonic striatal D2R availability and normal DA increases with MP, their regional brain metabolic and behavioral responses to the DA increases were markedly attenuated. These suggest that marijuana abuse may be associated with a dampened neuronal reactivity to DA stimulation. Future research can relate individual differences in blunted dynamic DA responsiveness to measures of motivation and life function.</p><p id="Par715"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> N.

However, the mechanisms of how glucocorticoids and BDNF influence maladaptive actions are not well understood. We have previously shown that genetic disruption of glucocorticoid signaling in the hypothalamus resulted in disinhibition of the HPA axis, upregulation of hypothalamic levels of BDNF and increased CRH expression. Our present studies show there is a close relationship between BDNF signaling and the actions of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand-activated transcription factor through post-transcriptional modifications by phosphorylation.</p><p id="Par718"><bold>Methods:</bold> Mass spectrometry analysis of the glucocorticoid receptor isolated from cortical neurons treated with BDNF revealed new phosphorylation sites. To test the significance of these events, we have examined the impact of BDNF signaling on glucocorticoid function using gene expression microarray and real time quantitative PCR in primary rat cortical neurons stimulated with the selective GR agonist dexamethasone (Dex) and BDNF, alone or in combination.</p><p id="Par719"><bold>Results:</bold> We found that BDNF treatment induces the phosphorylation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) at serine 155 (S155) and serine 287 (S287). Expression of a non-phosphorylatable alanine double mutant (S155A/S287A) impaired the induction of a subset of BDNF and Dex regulated genes. Moreover, BDNF-induced GR phosphorylation increased GR occupancy and cofactor recruitment at the promoters of selective genes. Therefore, BDNF signaling acts to specify and amplify GR-mediated transcription by a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism.</p><p id="Par720"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The interactions between BDNF and glucocorticoids include specific phosphorylation of GR by BDNF. We have identified several new serine phosphorylation sites in GR, which result in an amplification of transcriptional responses by BDNF signaling.</p><p id="Par721"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> M.

BDNF is regulated at multiple levels, which likely contribute to its ability to exert such a wide range of functions. Production of multiple transcripts represents an additional level of regulation: the rodent <italic>Bdnf</italic> gene produces more than 20 different transcripts, which are composed of a 5′ untranslated region (UTR) exon spliced to a common coding exon, which uses either of two alternative 3′ UTRs. Upstream of each 5′UTR are unique promoters, which are not only sensitive to different signaling cascades, but also exhibit divergent transcription kinetics. Previous work has investigated activation of individual promoters, showing that which <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcripts are produced in response to a given stimulus depends on the nature of the stimulus and the cell signaling pathways that are activated. Additional studies have documented expression patterns of individual <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcripts in different brain regions and across neurodevelopment. Collectively, the transcripts encoding the 5′ exons I, II, IV and VI represent ∼95% of the total <italic>Bdnf</italic> mRNA produced in both the rodent and human brain. While it is clear that existence of unique promoters allows for precise temporal and stimulus-specific regulation of BDNF production, the functional consequences of multiple transcripts encoding the same protein is not well understood.</p><p id="Par723"><bold>Methods:</bold> In order to assess the <italic>in vivo</italic> consequence of selective loss of <italic>Bdnf</italic> variants we recently developed and validated four transgenic mouse lines in which transcription from <italic>BDNF</italic> promoters I, II, IV and VI, (BDNF-e1, BDNF-e2, BDNF-e4 and BDNF-e6, respectively) is selectively disrupted. To engineer these lines, we inserted an enhanced green fluorescence (eGFP)-STOP cassette directly upstream of the splice donor site at the end of the respective 5′UTR. In order to determine whether individual splice variants differentially contribute to functions attributed to BDNF-TrkB signaling, we used a combination of cellular and molecular biology, neurophysiology and animal behavior to assess selected brain and behavioral functions attributed to BDNF-TrkB signaling in these animals.</p><p id="Par724"><bold>Results:</bold> We elucidated differential phenotypes between knock-out lines on several brain and behavioral functions that have previously been attributed to BDNF-TrkB signaling.

In particular, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been posited to be a candidate due to its roles in neuronal survival and plasticity. In the CNS, these functional effects are mediated through TrkB receptor tyrosine kinases. It has been less well–established whether BDNF-dependent TrkB signaling in the CNS relies on additional modulatory proteins in order to elicit optimal responses in brain circuits. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), a well-established co-receptor for Trk receptor modulation is p75<sup>NTR</sup>, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family. However, p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptor expression is restricted in the adult CNS. Identification of additional modulatory components of the TrkB receptor complex in the CNS would provide compelling insights not only into the basic regulatory mechanisms of BDNF-dependent signaling, but also inform efforts to optimize these signaling pathways for therapeutic benefit, for example, by providing novel targets for drug development. Our preliminary studies indicate that a specific Slitrk—Slitrk5, binds to TrkB and sorts TrkB receptors in neurons preferentially to the endocytic recycling pathway. With these new results, we postulate that a nopvel cell surface neuronal protein, Slitrk5, is a modulatory component of the TrkB receptor complex and mediates TrkB signaling and trafficking and subsequent biological responses.</p><p id="Par728"><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed analyses of BDNF dependent TrkB signaling and trafficking in cultured neurons obtained from Slitrk5 knock-out mice.</p><p id="Par729"><bold>Results:</bold> We have deteromined that Slitrk5 interacts with with TrkB receptors through the extracellular TrkB leucine rich repeat (LRR) domain and modifies subsequent BDNF-dependent signaling, and identifies a new type of interaction with TrkB via its extracellular domain, which has not been shown previously, and provide a potential long-sought role for its LRR domain. We have also found that this protein-protein interaction is important for subsequent endocytic trafficking and signaling from this TrkB receptor complex.</p><p id="Par730"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> While extensive information regarding neurotrophin-dependent signaling has been established, less is known of how signaling diversity is generated for the predominant CNS neurotrophin, BDNF. Our preliminary studies provide compelling evidence that a neuron-specific cell surface protein, Slitrk5, is capable of regulating BDNF generated signaling cascades. The ability to regulate BDNF-dependent survival and plasticity related signaling suggests Slitrk5 may be a valid target for drug development for enhancing region specific trophic responses.</p><p id="Par731"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> F.

Typical examples include gene expression data, meta-analyses of linkage scans, published candidate gene studies, disease-specific biochemical pathways, and genome-wide association studies. Integrating all these existing data has huge potential to increase the likelihood of identifying genes that affect susceptibility to psychiatric conditions and better understand the underlying disease mechanisms.</p><p id="Par739"><bold>Methods:</bold> Traditional data analysis techniques cannot be used to integrate the results from all these studies as they require that data are obtained from the same subjects. Investigators therefore often resort to looking for simple concordance between results from different studies for the same target (‘cis’). Concordance can be compelling when found. However, such an approach does not take full advantage of the data and cannot shed light on the underlying disease mechanisms as it does not consider biological relations between genes (‘trans’). We propose a novel data integration strategy that allows data integration in statistically optimal fashion. As our method can perform independent tests of biological relationships across all available datasets, disease mechanisms can be studied in very large samples.</p><p id="Par740"><bold>Results:</bold> To illustrate our approach we present results of a proof of concept study where we integrated a variety of data sources such as gene expression data, candidate genes from the literature, and linkage data, into a meta-analysis of genomewide association studies of schizophrenia.

Such psychiatric disorders are complex, resulting from the interplay of potentially hundreds (or thousands) of genetic loci and environmental factors. Genetic and environmental perturbations induce changes in the molecular interactions of cellular pathways whose collective effect may become clear through the organized structure of multiscale biological networks.</p><p id="Par749"><bold>Methods:</bold> We have developed a novel systems approach to study psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia that models the global molecular, functional, and structural changes in the affected brain that in turn can lead us to the root causes of the disease. To characterize the molecular, cellular, and physiological systems associated with psychiatric disorders, I will discuss the analysis on schizophrenia and addiction-related phenotypes using novel human data generated across multiple data modalities, including DNA variation, RNA sequencing, functional and structural imaging, and high-content clinical characterizations. By integrating these diverse data collected across multiple cohorts comprised of many hundreds of individuals, I will describe the construction of gene regulatory networks, functional and structural MRI based networks, high-content phenotypic networks, in addition to the integration of these network models. Because DNA variation was systematically assessed across all cohorts, it provides a common set of perturbations that can be leveraged to not only infer causal relationships among different molecular and higher order traits, but that can help link networks at different scales (eg, molecular and imaging) across cohorts.</p><p id="Par750"><bold>Results:</bold> Through this integrative network-based approach, I will present a rank-ordering of the resulting network structures for relevance to different psychiatric disorders, highlighting both known and novel biological pathways involved in disease pathogenesis and progression.

I will furtherdemonstrate that our approach can offer novel insights for drug discovery programs aimed at treating psychiatric disorders by screening our disease-associated networks against molecular signatures induced by marketed and novel compounds across a number of cell-bases systems, including those derived from stem cells isolated from patients with psychiatric disorders.</p><p id="Par751"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We cannot hope to understand complex human diseases such as schizophrenia by focusing on single dimensions such as DNA, RNA, or imaging data, even if those single dimensions of data are generated on many thousands of individuals. Instead, we must integrate the diversity of data that inform on different disease conditions using advanced mathematical algorithms to construct predictive models of disease as I will demonstrate here for schizophrenia.

Many individuals report that they are reluctant to quit smoking because they are afraid to gain weight, and subsets of smokers, including teenage girls, report that they initiate smoking to control their weight. Nicotine, the primary psychoactive substance in tobacco, stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), and this is required for the ability of nicotine to decrease food intake in mice. Acetylcholine is the endogenous neurotransmitter that activated nAChRs, but its effects on food intake are not well understood.</p><p id="Par760"><bold>Methods:</bold> We identified the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits expressed in ARC using semi-quantitative PCR. We have also used viral-mediated delivery of fluorescent tracers and anatomical techniques to identify the source of cholinergic input to the ARC. Finally, we are using optogenetic methods to identify the functional consequences of regulating acetylcholine signaling in the ARC on food intake.</p><p id="Par761"><bold>Results:</bold> We have already identified beta 4 subunit containing nAChRs on POMC neurons in the ARC, and that stimulation of beta 4 nAChRs can decrease food intake acutely, and decrease body weight chronically; however, the partner subunits for beta 4 have not yet been identified. RT-PCR has identified a large number of subunits, including the alpha 3, alpha 4, alpha 6, alpha 7, beta 2 and beta 4 subunits, that are expressed in the ARC. Neither the alpha 2 nor the alpha 5 subunit can be detected in ARC homogenates. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization studies will help identify the subunits expressed specifically in POMC neurons. Immunocytochemistry for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT, a marker of cholinergic neurons), examination of GFP expression in ChAT-GFP mice and visulalization of channelrhodopsin in ChAT-Cre mice have all shown that there are no cholinergic cell bodies in the ARC in C57BL6/J mice. This is contrary to one published study suggesting that there are ChAT-positive neurons in the rat ARC. Instead, it appears that brain stem cholinergic nuclei project to the ARC. We are currently using transgenic mice expressing channel rhodopsin in cholinergic neurons or viral delivery of channel rhodopsin to subsets of cholinergic neurons in ChAT-Cre mice to determine the role of acetylcholine in the ARC on food intake.</p><p id="Par762"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Molecular genetic studies have shown that nAChRs containing the beta 4 subunit are essential for the ability of nicotine to decrease food intake in mice. Further, nAChRs on POMC neurons in the ARC, and stimulation of MC4 receptors in the paraventricular nucleus are essential for these appetite-suppressing effects. Despite these pharmacological effects of nicotine, the role of acetylcholine signaling in the ARC on food intake is not known. These studies show that a large number of nAChR subunits are available to transduce the effects of acetylcholine in ARC, and that local neurons within the ARC are not responsible for cholinergic innervation of these nAChRs. The ability to stimulate cholinergic terminals in ARC selectively using optogenetic techniques will be essential to understanding how acetylcholine regulates this circuit, and will help identify the physiological role for this neurotransmitter in regulation of appetite.</p><p id="Par763"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> M.

Stuber<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec447"><title>University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina</title><p id="Par764"><bold>Background:</bold> Binge eating is one of the most prevalent types of eating disorders. Therefore, experiments aimed to determine the causal relationship between discrete neural circuit elements and maladaptive feeding behaviors are clearly warranted. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), a component of the extended amygdala, is a key integrator of diverse motivational states through its interactions and connectivity with various synaptic targets in anatomically distinct brain regions. We previously demonstrated that BNST-GABAergic neuron projections targeting the ventral tegmental area modulate reward- and anxiety-related behaviors. However, the function of the BNST is not limited to these discrete motivational processes, as it may also play a vital role in other motivated states such as feeding behavior, via inhibitory projections to the lateral hypothalamus (LH). Gross neuroanatomical manipulations have demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the LH elicits robust feeding responses, while direct infusions of GABA and glutamate agonists suppress and promote feeding respectively. While these studies demonstrated that the LH is an important neuroanatomical substrate for controlling feeding, the precise connectivity and function of genetically distinct LH neurons has not been systematically dissected. In addition, the specific presynaptic inputs to functionally distinct LH neurons and their role in engaging motivated feeding behaviors are completely unknown.</p><p id="Par765"><bold>Methods:</bold> Here, we used excitatory and inhibitory optogenetic methods to selectively activate and suppress BNST-GABAergic fibers that innervate the LH in order to assess the behavioral sufficiency and necessity of this pathway for regulating feeding in vgat-ires-cre mice. In addition, we performed functional neurocircuit mapping experiments to determine the functional connectivity between BNST GABAergic inputs and genetically defined postsynaptic neurons in the LH.</p><p id="Par766"><bold>Results:</bold> Photostimulation of BNST-GABAergic terminals within the LH produced robust feeding behavior in satiated mice, while photoinhibition of this projection suppressed feeding in hungry mice. In addition, direct optogenetic activation of postsynaptic GABAergic LH neurons also produced robust feeding, while stimulation of the glutamatergic neurons in the LH suppressed feeding in hungry mice and was associated with aversive-like behavioral phenotypes. Ongoing experiments detailing the precise synaptic connectivity between BNST GABAergic inputs and postsynaptic LH neurons will also be presented.</p><p id="Par767"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data suggest that inhibitory BNST-GABAergic projections likely attenuate the activity of distinct LH neurons to facilitate feeding and may help to explain how disruption of specific circuit interactions can lead to the misrepresentation of hunger and thus promote excessive caloric intake.</p><p id="Par768"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> G.

Potenza<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec450"><title>Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut</title><p id="Par769"><bold>Background:</bold> There currently exists debate regarding the extent to which obesity might be considered within an addiction framework. To best address the obesity epidemic, an improved understanding is needed of the relationships between metabolic measures implicated in obesity (eg, insulin resistance) and constructs linked to addictions (eg, food craving). Further, binge-eating disorder (BED), an eating disorder with greater prevalence than anorexia or bulimia nervosa, has been hypothesized to be particularly closely linked to addictions, yet few brain imaging studies have examined similarities and differences between obese people with and without BED.</p><p id="Par770"><bold>Methods:</bold> Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to study lean and obese people in a guided-imagery task involving three different cues (favorite-food, stress and neutral-relaxing). Laboratory measures of fasting plasma glucose and insulin were obtained to calculate a homeostatic measure of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) to relate to subjective and fMRI responses. Additional fMRI measures (Stroop Color-Word Interference Task and Monetary Incentive Delay Task (MIDT)) were obtained in obese people with and without BED and in lean people.</p><p id="Par771"><bold>Results:</bold> Obese but not lean people showed increased activation of striatal, insular and hypothalamic brain regions in response to favorite-food and stress cues. In obese but not lean people, HOMA-IR measures correlated with corticolimbic striatal brain activations during the favorite-food and stress conditions. HOMA-IR measures correlated with favorite-food-cue-induced food craving in obese but not lean people, and thalamic activations mediated this relationship. When examining subjects of similar body mass indices (BMIs), tobacco smokers as compared to non-smokers showed relatively diminished corticolimbic striatal brain activations to favorite food cues. Obese people with BED (as compared to obese people of similar BMIs without BED and lean comparison subjects) showed relatively diminished activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and insula during Stroop performance, with vmPFC and IFG activation in the BED group correlating inversely with dietary restraint scores. During MIDT performance, obese people with BED as compared to obese people without BED showed relatively diminished activation of the ventral striatum during reward anticipation and vmPFC and insula during reward outcome, similar to findings in alcohol dependence and pathological gambling. Amongst the group with BED, relatively diminished activation of the ventral striatum during reward anticipation and mPFC during reward outcome was associated with poorer treatment outcome.</p><p id="Par772"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Findings indicate similarities between BED and addictions and suggest that hypoactivation of corticolimbic striatal regions during cognitive control and reward processing may link to poorer impulse control, representing possible treatment targets in BED. The relationships between metabolic measures, brain activations and food craving in obese but not lean people suggest a particularly strong link between metabolic measures and food-related motivations in obesity, suggesting novel targets for medication development. The tobacco-related findings suggest a mechanism for tobacco's influence on appetite and strategies for managing food consumption during smoking cessation.</p><p id="Par773"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> M.

Impulsivity, which is defined as a predisposition toward rapid unplanned reactions to stimuli without regard to negative consequences, is a factor in the multifaceted determinants that underlie the etiology of BED and its pathogenesis. Our <italic>central hypothesis</italic> is that imbalanced serotonin (5-HT) signaling through the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R predicts inherent impulsivity which enhances the extent of binge eating on sweet-fat food.</p><p id="Par775"><bold>Methods:</bold> Two assays were established to explore this hypothesis: (1) rats were identified as high (HI) or low impulsive action (LI) phenotypes in the 1-choice serial reaction time (1-CSRT) task in which performance was reinforced with sweet-fat pellets (17% kcal by sucrose/45% kcal fat), and (2) the propensity for binge eating was assessed upon 2-hr access to sweet-fat chow. Pharmacological and genetic manipulations were employed to evaluate the role of 5-HT function in these behaviors.</p><p id="Par776"><bold>Results:</bold> The upper and lower 25% of rats, respectively, were identified as high impulsive (HI) or low impulsive (LI) phenotypes based on premature responses in the 1-CSRT task. Levels of impulsive action positively correlated with the ratio of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R to 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R protein in the medial prefrontal cortex, <italic>suggesting a potentially-causal role for a 5-HT2AR:5-HT2CR imbalance in this phenotype</italic>. HI rats consumed significantly more kcal during the 2-hr binge <italic>vs</italic> LI rats, <italic>experimentally linking the propensity for impulsive action to the magnitude of binge eating</italic>. The combination of a subthreshold dose of a selective 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R antagonist <italic>plus</italic> a selective 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R agonist synergistically transformed HI rats to LI rats, <italic>suggesting that a perturbed 5-HT2AR:5-HT2CR balance may contribute to these behaviors.</italic></p><p id="Par777"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data support the hypothesis that an imbalance in 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R:5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R homeostasis may be an antecedent to high trait impulsivity which then promotes binge eating behavior. This innovative contribution is the first step in a continuum of research that could lead to the targeted development of pharmacological strategies to restore serotonergic homeostasis and minimize deleterious behaviors that promote BED.</p><p id="Par778"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> K.

Ahmari<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec457"><title>Columbia University, New York, New York</title><p id="Par780"><bold>Background:</bold> Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic, severe mental illness that affects 2–3% of people worldwide, yet the pathophysiology remains unclear. Though multiple lines of evidence indicate that dysregulation within cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits is correlated with OCD, causation cannot be tested in humans.</p><p id="Par781"><bold>Methods:</bold> We used optogenetic technology in mice to simulate CSTC hyperactivation observed in OCD patients. Mice were injected with AAV-channelrhodopsin-EYFP in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and implanted with fiberoptics in ventromedial striatum (VMS). 473 nm 10 Hz stimulation of OFC-VMS projections yielded light-evoked field responses. 5 minutes of stimulation was performed daily for 5 consecutive days; behavioral measures included grooming and open field. Data was analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVAs and post-hoc tests. <italic>In vivo</italic> electrophysiology was performed to examine electrophysiologic correlates of behavioral responses.</p><p id="Par782"><bold>Results:</bold> Repeated hyperactivation of OFC-VMS projections over 5 days induced repetitive grooming, a mouse behavior linked to OCD (p&lt;0.05). Increased grooming persisted for 2 weeks after cessation of stimulation (p&lt;0.03), and was reversed by chronic fluoxetine. Development of persistent grooming was correlated with increased evoked activity at OFC-VMS synapses (p&lt;0.02), which was also reversed by chronic fluoxetine. No differences were observed in anxiety or prepulse inhibition.</p><p id="Par783"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This is the first evidence that repeated hyperactivation of cortico-striatal projections directly generates OCD-like behaviors. Furthermore, repetitive grooming, once established, persists without further direct circuit hyperactivation, but is resolved using a treatment regimen effective in reducing OCD symptoms. Finally, plasticity at OFC-VMS synapses correlates with the observed behavioral change.

Evidence suggests an important role for the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Of particular interest are PFC projections to dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), the major source of serotonin to the forebrain, and lateral habenula (LHb), a structure recently implicated in negative reward processing and a novel target for deep brain stimulation in depression. We describe a combined projection-specific optogenetic and electrophysiological approach to investigating these circuits in behaving rats, and report on both acute and long-lasting changes in depression-related behaviors and circuit properties.</p><p id="Par786"><bold>Methods:</bold> We employ both high-speed neurophysiological readout and optical control to probe circuit properties of the depressed brain. High-speed readout is carried out with <italic>in vivo</italic> tetrode recordings. High-speed control is implemented by optogenetics, with single-component microbial opsins delivered by viral vectors to targeted circuit elements.</p><p id="Par787"><bold>Results:</bold> When DRN-projecting mPFC axons were illuminated, rats showed an acute antidepressant-like phenotype in the forced swim test (FST) (p&lt;0.01, Wilcoxon signed-rank).

Single mPFC neurons encoded depression-related behavioral changes during the FST.</p><p id="Par788"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Fast optical and neurophysiological methods were used to probe aspects of circuit function in both acute and long-lasting depression-related behavioral states.

An important open problem is to connect these pharmacology results with the known firing patterns of midbrain dopamine neurons.</p><p id="Par791"><bold>Methods:</bold> TH-cre mice expressing either cre-dependent ChR2 or eYFP in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra were trained in an association/set-shifting task. Mice were assayed on the extent to which stimulating prefrontal TH-positive fibers affected their ability to maintain a reward association, as well as to perform extradimensional and intradimensional attentional shifts.</p><p id="Par792"><bold>Results:</bold> Mice were stimulated with one of three stimulation patterns: control (no light), tonic (regular repeated flashes) or phasic (bursts of light flashes). During extradimensional and intradimensional shifts, tonically stimulated mice expressing ChR2 showed profound perseveration, selecting the previous cue in 87% of trials. This perseveration persisted even in the absence of the reward. Phasically stimulated mice showed the opposite behavior; they lost any previous association and were unable to form new associations above chance levels.</p><p id="Par793"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results suggest that DA fibers from the VTA act as a potential gatekeeper in the PFC, either locking in the mouse's current strategy or releasing it to allow for behavioral flexibility.</p><p id="Par794"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> V.

We have previously linked SWM deficits in <italic>Df(16)A</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice to deficits in long-range functional connectivity between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the hippocampus (HPC) (Sigurdsson <italic>et al.</italic>, <italic>Nature</italic>, 2010); however, the molecular and circuit level mechanisms underlying these deficits are unclear. Mice with a haploinsufficiency of <italic>Dgcr8</italic> (<italic>Dgcr8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup>), a gene within the microdeletion region involved in microRNA biogenesis, also have SWM deficits, suggesting that this line might be a useful tool with which to explore these mechanisms. Here we use these <italic>Dgcr8</italic> haploinsufficient mice to examine the molecular and circuit basis for impaired hippocampal-prefrontal functional connectivity in the 22q11 microdeletion model.</p><p id="Par796"><bold>Methods:</bold> Neural recordings were obtained from <italic>Dgcr8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup><italic>, 22q11</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup>, and wildtype littermates implanted with microelectrodes in the ventral HPC (vHPC), dorsal HPC and mPFC under baseline conditions and during performance of a T-maze delayed non-match-to-sample test of SWM. Single units from the mPFC, as well as local field potentials from all three brain regions, were analyzed for synchrony between and within each region using custom-written MATLAB software. To manipulate vHPC terminals, we used an additional cohort of wildtype animals injected with an adeno-associated virus carrying the optogenetic silencer enhanced Arch3.0 or a control virus carrying mCherry, both under the control of the CaMKII promotor. Virus was injected into the vHPC, and optical fibers were implanted overyling the mPFC, both bilaterally. These mice were trained in the t-maze task, and performance was assayed during interleaved light-on and light-off trials.</p><p id="Par797"><bold>Results:</bold> First, we measured functional connectivity within the HPC and between the HPC sites and the mPFC. While <italic>22q11</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice had a general phenotype of decreased functional connectivity across all three recording sites, <italic>Dgcr8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice had a specific deficit in the vHPC-mPFC pathway. Both theta-frequency coherence and phase-locking of mPFC cells to the vHPC theta oscillation were decreased in <italic>Dgcr8</italic><sup><italic>+/−</italic></sup> mice. Moreover, vHPC-mPFC coherence at baseline predicted how long each animal took to learn the task. Next, to determine whether disrupting vHPC-mPFC connectivity is sufficient to disrupt SWM, we utilized an optogenetic approach to inhibit synaptic transmission at vHPC axon terminals in the mPFC. Optogenetic silencing of vHPC terminals in the mPFC decreased mPFC multiunit responses to electrical stimulation of the vHPC <italic>in vivo</italic>, proving the efficacy of the manipulation. Finally, in behaving animals, illumination of the vHPC terminals with light impaired SWM performance only in the active virus group.</p><p id="Par798"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results demonstrate the necessity of vHPC-mPFC transmission in normal SWM performance, and suggest a central role for this circuit in the behavioral and physiological impairments associated with the 22q11.2 microdeletion.

Over 700 individuals registered as contributors, and either completed at least one Protocol Builder, or at least one Indication Finder, or expressed interest in doing so in the near future. A clinical study protocol, posted on TLS website, was designed by the community of approximately 70 MS patients and around 30 clinical researchers, practicing neurologists, and key opinion leaders in MS. As a result of this curated open source approach the design is highly innovative: 1. Only first and last visit will be traditional site visits; all data in the 12 months between 1st and last visit will be collected from patients remotely with the use of variety of telemonitoring devices, and digital (virtual visits), 2. Primary efficacy endpoint of the study is disability as measured by average change in composite functional score on the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MFSC); this score is considered an optimal reflection of disease progress; telemonitoring makes it possible to administer easily. 3. The protocol, submitted to the FDA as part of IND was accepted with ‘the study may proceed’ letter, and no changes were requested by the agency. In December of 2012 TLS has received FDA clearance to proceed with a Phase 2 lisinopril MS trial—the first-ever that relies on crowdsourcing and telemonitoring.</p><p id="Par814"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> New scientific knowledge accessed through a combination of open innovation and key opinion leaders input will improve clinical study protocol design issues and identify promising new indications for repositioning.

The MRC supports and advances medical research in three main ways: by providing research grants and career awards to scientists in UK universities and hospitals, by funding research centres in partnership with universities, and through its own research facilities. The partnership provided academic researchers with unprecedented access to a high quality collection of clinical and pre-clinical AstraZeneca compounds, which had been deprioritised. Researchers were able to use these for studies that investigated mechanisms of human disease and the development of potential therapeutic interventions. The MRC has invested Ł7 M in a world leading, award winning open innovation collaboration with AstraZeneca.</p><p id="Par817"><bold>Methods</bold>: The initiative was launched in December 2011, and funding decisions announced in October 2012. The pool of assets included compounds that had completed Phase 1 where evidence of target engagement, pharmacological activity <italic>in vivo</italic> and appropriate toxicity profile was available, and candidate drug compounds which had completed Phase 2a/2b and had been halted for efficacy/portfolio reasons within AstraZenenca. A two-stage process was used to identify projects that were feasible, did not duplicate existing studies, and did not directly contribute to AstraZeneca's own development programmes. At outline stage, targets of all the compounds were made available to researchers together with sufficient information to allow assessment of the utility of these prior to submission of an outline proposal. At this stage researcher's IP was protected through a CDA between MRC and AstraZeneca. Following the outline stage, AstraZeneca researchers became full co-applicants on the proposal and provided researchers with more information on the compounds once individual CDAs were signed. The rights to IP generated using the compounds varied between projects but were similar to those currently used in academically-led research. AstraZeneca retained rights over the chemical composition of the compounds, and any new research findings will be owned by the academic institution with AstraZeneca having first right to negotiate.</p><p id="Par818"><bold>Results</bold>: 15 research projects were awarded funding. A broad range of projects studying common diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer and lung disease through to rarer conditions such as motor neurone disease and muscular dystrophies. Eight of the projects involve clinical trials of potential new therapies, and seven focus on earlier work in laboratory and animal models.</p><p id="Par819"><bold>Conclusions</bold>: This initiative was transformational in stimulating relationships between academia and industry. It served to support MRC's Translational Research Strategy and provided AstraZeneca the opportunity to engage with a larger section of the academic community across a range of disease areas that may have fallen outside of its core focus.</p><p id="Par820"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> C.

Szumlinski<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec483"><title>University of California, Santa Barbara, California</title><p id="Par822"><bold>Background:</bold> Anomalies in prefrontal cortex (PFC) function are posited to underpin difficulties in learning to suppress drug-seeking behavior during abstinence, which may underpin the ‘incubation of drug craving’ purported to occur in both laboratory animals and humans during protracted drug withdrawal. A history of extensive cocaine self-administration dysregulates PFC extracellular glutamate in laboratory animals, suggesting deficits in glutamate signaling within this region might underpin the intensification of drug-seeking during protracted withdrawal. As Group1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) regulate drug-related learning, we hypothesized that cocaine-induced reductions in Group1 mGluR function within the PFC might impair behavioral suppression during cocaine abstinence to promote drug-seeking.</p><p id="Par823"><bold>Methods:</bold> We first assayed the short- and long-term consequences of extended access to intravenous cocaine (6 hrs/day; 0.25 mg/infusion for 10 days) upon the expression of Group1 mGluRs within the major ventral and dorsal PFC subdivisions by immunoblotting at 3 versus 30 days withdrawal. We then employed neuropharmacological approaches to examine the effects of mimicking (using selective mGluR1 and/or mGluR5 antagonists) or ‘reversing’ (using an mGluR1/5 agonist) cocaine-induced changes in Group1 mGluR function within the ventromedial aspect of the PFC (vmPFC) for cocaine-seeking behavior during withdrawal. Follow-up studies examined for cocaine-elicited changes in down-stream regulators of Group1 mGluR function (eg, Homer proteins, PKCs, ERK, PI3K/AKT) and, when appropriate, assayed also their relevance for cocaine-seeking behavior.</p><p id="Par824"><bold>Results:</bold> Following protracted withdrawal, cocaine-experienced animals exhibited a time-dependent intensification of cue-induced cocaine-seeking behavior and an impaired extinction of this behavior. These behavioral phenomena were associated with a time-dependent reduction in mGluR1/5 expression, as well as an imbalance in Homer2 versus Homer1 expression, during protracted withdrawal and both of these protien changes were inversely related to the activational state of ERK, AKT and PKC epsilon within this region. Pharmacological manipulations of vmPFC mGluR1/5 produced no immediate effects upon cue-induced cocaine-seeking behavior, but produced residual effects on a subsequent test for cocaine-seeking. At 3 days withdrawal, cocaine-experienced rats infused intra-vmPFC with mGluR1/5 inhibitors, either before or after an initial test for cocaine-seeking, persisted in their cocaine-seeking akin to cocaine-experienced rats in protracted withdrawal. Conversely, cocaine-experienced rats infused with an mGluR1/5 agonist before the initial test for cocaine-seeking at 30 days withdrawal exhibited a facilitation of extinction learning. In contrast, virus-mediated reversal of the cocaine-induced imbalance in Homer1 versus 2 expression failed to alter cocaine-seeking behavior in the absence of cocaine, but prevented cocaine-primed reinstatement of cocaine-seeking. Peptide inhibitor-mediated inhibition of PKCepsilon translocation failed to alter cocaine-seeking.</p><p id="Par825"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data indicate that cue-elicited deficits in vmPFC Group1 mGluRs mediate resistance to extinction during protracted withdrawal from a history of extensive cocaine self-administration. Moreover, these data indicate that while cocaine-elicited imbalances in vmPFC expression of different Homer isoforms do not contribute to learning to suppress drug-seeking behavior during cocaine abstinence, they are critical for the reinstatement of that drug-seeking behavior by cocaine. If relevant to humans, these data pose pharmacological stimulation of mGluR1/5 as a potential approach to facilitate learned suppression of drug-seeking behavior which may aid drug abstinence and protect against relapse.</p><p id="Par826"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> K.

This reinstatement is attenuated by inhibition of glutamate or dopamine transmission in nucleus accumbens shell, but not core (Bossert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006, 2007). Here, we examined the role of ventral mPFC, a brain area that projects to accumbens shell, in this reinstatement. We first studied the role of ventral mPFC by using Fos immunohistochemistry, reversible inactivation with muscimol+baclofen, and a novel ‘Daun02 inactivation method’ (Bossert <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011). We then used an anatomical asymmetrical disconnection procedure to examine the interaction between glutamatergic projections from ventral mPFC to accumbens shell and local dopamine D<sub>1</sub> postsynaptic receptors in this reinstatement.

Applying Animal and Human Models of Risk Avoidance and Impulsivity to Understanding Eating Disorders</title><sec id="Sec494"><title>46.1 A Translational Assessment of Reward-based Learning in Adolescents with Bulimia Nervosa</title><sec id="Sec495"><title>Rachel Marsh<sup>*</sup></title><p id="Par844">Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York</p><p id="Par845"><bold>Background:</bold> Bulimia Nervosa (BN) is characterized by recurrent binge-eating episodes that are associated with a loss of control, followed by self-induced vomiting or another compensatory behavior to avoid weight gain. Our previous findings from women and adolescents with BN suggest that self-regulatory processes are impaired due to their failure to engage frontostriatal circuits appropriately that may be due, in part, to reductions of local volumes on the surface of ventrolateral prefrontal cortices (VPFC) in the BN compared to control participants. VPFC disturbances may also affect reward processing within mesocorticolimbic circuits in BN, thereby decreasing the rewarding relief that normally results from eating and further driving urges to binge-eat. We probed the functioning of these circuits in adolescents with BN using an fMRI paradigm analogous to a task used to define the neural basis of spatial learning in rodents (Packard <italic>et al</italic>, 1989; 1991), tailored to a virtual reality (VR) environment.</p><p id="Par846"><bold>Methods:</bold> We compared BOLD response in 22 adolescents with BN and 20 age-matched controls (Mean age, SD: BN 16.7, 1.6; HC 15.8, 2.1; <italic>p</italic>=0.15) while they used an MRI-compatible joystick to navigate an 8-arm radial maze surrounded by extra-maze cues (eg, mountains, trees, sunset) with rewards ($) hidden at the end of the maze arms. In the learning condition, all maze arms contained a reward and participants had to learn to use the cues to navigate and find rewards (revisits were scored as errors). In the control condition, the same spatial cues were interchanged randomly among the same locations at the end of each attempt, thereby destroying any possibility spatial learning. Participants were rewarded randomly at the same frequency as in the learning condition, but without regard to their actual performance. The control condition thus shared all salient features with the learning condition (i.e., visual stimuli, motor demands, cognitive effort, and reward/punishment frequencies). We assessed group differences in task performance and fMRI signal associated with searching the maze and reward feedback (reward or no reward), reporting voxels with a posterior probability of &gt;98.75% (analogous to <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0125) and a cluster filter ⩾25.</p><p id="Par847"><bold>Results:</bold> Both groups demonstrated spatial learning on the task and both activated temporoparietal and occipital areas when searching the maze. Group differences were detected in mescorticolimbic circuits: whereas control adolescents activated hippocampus when searching in the active condition, BN adolescents instead activated bilateral ventral and dorsal striatum, medial PFC, amygdala, and hippocampus during the control condition, when using the cues for navigation (i.e., spatial learning) was disabled. Group differences associated with reward feedback were also detected in medial temporal lobe and striatum, such that BN, but not control, adolescents activated amygdala and hippocampus during reward, and the ventral striatum during no reward, in the control condition.</p><p id="Par848"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Adolescents with BN activated mesocorticolimbic circuits when searching the maze and receiving unexpected rewards when learning was attempted but rendered impossible due to the randomization of spatial cues in the control condition. These findings suggest alterations in the dopaminergic mesolimbic system early in the course of BN, perhaps pointing to a target for early intervention that can be tested in parallel animal and human studies with this translational paradigm. Together with findings of deficient frontostriatal functioning in BN, these data suggest that both oversensitivity to reward and deficient self-regulation likely contribute to impulsivity in BN.</p><p id="Par849"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> R.

While studies of clinical populations that display deficits in risk-based decision-making and pharmacological findings from clinical and animal studies have strongly implicated a role of dopamine in risk-based decision-making, direct evidence of the links between different dopamine receptor subtypes, impulsive temperament, and neural function during risk-based decision-making has been lacking.</p><p id="Par851"><bold>Methods:</bold> Following prior observations of negative correlations between D2-like receptor BPnd and measures of impulsiveness, Study 1 used PET to assess D1-like binding in 20 healthy volunteers who gave self-reports on the Dickman Impulsivity Inventory and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. In Study 2, 60 healthy volunteers were tested using the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) during fMRI. In the BART, participants can pump a virtual balloon to increase potential monetary reward or cash out to receive accumulated reward; each pump presents greater risk and potential reward (represented by pump number).

In addition, exploratory voxelwise analysis provided preliminary evidence of positive associations between D1-like BPnd in the orbitofrontal cortex and impulsivity, as measured by the Dickman scales. In Study 2, losses were followed by fewer risky choices than wins; and during risk-taking after a loss, amygdala and hippocampal activation exhibited greater modulation by pump number than after a cash-out event. Striatal D2-like BPnd was positively related to modulation of ventral striatal activation by pump number when participants decided to cash out and negatively to the number of pumps in the subsequent trial, but inversely related to modulation of prefrontal cortical activation by pump number when participants took risk, and to overall earnings.</p><p id="Par853"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Study 1 provides the first concrete evidence for an inhibitory function of midbrain D1-like receptors in behavioral impulsiveness in humans, and suggests an opposing function of D1-like receptors in the orbitofrontal cortex. Interventions that influence signaling through dopamine D1 receptors, therefore, may impact neuropsychiatric disorders that feature impulsive behavior.

They tend to be ahendonic, inhibited, over-concerned with planning and consequences, and overly sensitive to risk and uncertainty. AN have elevated harm avoidance (HA), a construct with elements of anxiety, inhibition, and inflexibility, that is present pre-morbidly in childhood and persist after recovery, and which associated with altered dopamine D2/D3 receptor activity in the dorsal caudate, part of executive frontal-striatal neural circuitry. Altered eating in AN may be a consequence of dysregulated reward processing and/or awareness of homeostatic needs, perhaps related to a bias of the executive neural system to be overly sensitive to risk and thus inhibit incentive motivational drives subserved by the limbic system. We used fMRI to determine if AN have altered limbic and executive neural function in relationship to the incentive motivational aspect of money.</p><p id="Par856"><bold>Methods:</bold> We used a region of interest analysis based on known functional distinctions. Study 1 compared 10 ill adolescent AN to 12 matched controls to assess neural response to negative and positive monetary feedback (Delgado 2000). Study 2 compared 19 recovered adult AN to 15 matched controls, after fasting and after being fed, to examine the effects of hunger and satiety on neural correlates of time discounting while subjects made a series of choices between monetary reward options that varied by delay to delivery (McClure 2004).</p><p id="Par857"><bold>Results:</bold> Study 1) Consistent with the literature, controls tended to show a stronger BOLD response to positive compared to negative (eg wins vs losses) feedback in limbic and executive striatal and cingulate regions. While ill adolescent AN showed a normal response to wins and losses in limbic regions, they had a significantly stronger BOLD response to negative feedback compared to positive feedback in executive and motor striatal and cingulate regions, and was also related to measures of perseveration. Study 2) A significant group by satiety interaction was detected in the delayed discounting paradigm. Controls showed greater response when fasted, compared to being fed for the beta response (the value placed on immediate outcomes) in the anterior ventral striatum , and for the delta response (which reflects a more consistent weighting of time periods) in executive frontal , cingulate , and striatal regions. In contrast, recovered AN had the opposite response in these regions: they exhibited a greater BOLD response in the fed condition relative to the fasting condition. For both studies, corrections for multiple comparisons used false discovery rate (FDR) control at q=0.1; all p's &lt;.05.</p><p id="Par858"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Study 1: ill AN participants exhibited an abnormal pattern, with an exaggerated response to losses compared to wins in posterior executive and sensorimotor striatal regions. Individuals with AN tend to be overly responsive to negative feedback such as criticism or making mistakes. These findings may reflect the neural processes responsible for a bias for AN to be more sensitive to risk than reward, and have difficulty with set-shifting. Most people are uncomfortable when hungry and describe pleasure when eating, whereas those with AN tend to be anxious when eating, and feel better when starving. Study 2: the contrast between controls and AN showed they had opposite responses after being fed or fasting. AN had diminished responses in limbic regions to immediate reward when fasting and increased activation of executive circuits after eating. In summary, these studies further support the possibility that AN individuals have reduced reward and enhanced activity of executive circuitry that may contribute to anxious and inhibited behaviors.</p><p id="Par859"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> W.

To model risky decision making behavior in animals, we have developed a task in which rats are given discrete choices between a small ‘safe’ food reward and a large food reward associated with varying degrees of risk of punishment. Rats are sensitive to the degree of risk of punishment, choosing the large reward when the risk of punishment is low, and switching to the small but safe reward as the risk of punishment increases. However, there is considerable and stable variability among individuals’ performance in this task, such that rats can be reliably classified according to their degree of risk taking.

Forced abstinence (28 consecutive days) were then imposed, with at least 4 months of open-access to ethanol between each abstinence.</p><p id="Par868"><bold>Results:</bold> There are wide spread individual differences in the daily intake of ethanol across the 12 months of 22 hr/day access, with 35% of the population defined as heavy drinkers. In these heavy drinkers, imposing abstinence resulted in signs of dependence. Repeated abstinence did not affect the average, but lowered the variance, of daily ethanol intakes. Examination of daily drinking patterns reveal consistently rapid intakes of high does of ethanol early in the session followed by nearly continuous drinking of smaller doses of ethanol throughout the rest of the session, including in the dark phase. Examination of endocrine status shows a dose-related decline in cortisol over the year of drinking, with a loss of diurnal rhythm and very high rebound during the abstinence periods. During the chronic open-access to ethanol, a relatively mild stressor of being removed from the housing cage led to a significant increase in ACTH, but not cortisol, in heavy compared to non-heavy drinkers.</p><p id="Par869"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This monkey model of SIP induction and then ‘open-access’ to ethanol reveal key individual differences in the risk for future heavy drinking. Heavy drinkers were more likely to: rapidly drink intoxicating amount of ethanol during the SIP induction; show signs of physical dependence; show disruptions in the HPA axis; have an exaggerated HPA response to mild stress; and to develop a stereotypic pattern of ethanol self-administration after forced abstinence. Collectively, the data highlight the value of this monkey model for disentangling mechanisms that underlie the co-morbidity of heavy alcohol consumption and adverse stress response.</p><p id="Par870"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> K.

Becker<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec511"><title>Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina</title><p id="Par871"><bold>Background:</bold> The interaction between stress and ethanol drinking behavior is complex and mechanisms underlying this interaction in the context of dependence are not well understood. We have employed a mouse model of ethanol dependence and relapse drinking to examine mechanisms by which stress associated with chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal experience promote/mediate escalation of voluntary ethanol drinking. Ethanol dependence is known to alter brain reward and stress pathways, and adaptations in corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) within cortical-basal ganglia-limbic-HPA circuitry have been implicated in stress responsiveness and ethanol self-administration. This presentation will first describe behavioral adaptations in the model, and then data on the role of CRF in mediating/contributing to (a) escalation of ethanol drinking in dependent mice; (b) altered behavioral responsiveness to stress challenge; and (c) the ability of stress to modulate ethanol consumption in dependent compared to nondependent mice.</p><p id="Par872"><bold>Methods:</bold> Adult C57BL/6J mice were trained to drink 15% (v/v) ethanol using a limited access (2 hr/day) 2-bottle choice paradigm. Once stable baseline intake was established, mice received several weekly cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure (EtOH group) or air exposure (CTL group) in inhalation chambers (16 hr/day × 4 days) alternated by 5-day limited access drinking test cycles. Behavioral responsiveness to a 10-min inescapable forced swim test (FST) was assessed in separate groups of EtOH and CTL mice 3 or 7 days after the final inhalation treatment. In a separate study, EtOH and CTL mice were exposed to FST 4 hr prior to drinking test sessions to examine effects of stress on drinking in the CIE model. In another study, the effect of administering the CRF1R antagonist MTIP (5–40 mg/kg, ip.) on drinking was examined in EtOH and CTL groups after escalation of drinking was established.</p><p id="Par873"><bold>Results:</bold> Repeated cycles of CIE exposure produced significant escalation of voluntary ethanol drinking in EtOH mice relative to their baseline level as well as intake in nondependent CTL mice that remained relatively stable over the all test cycles. Further, EtOH mice exhibited a faster rate of intake during drinking sessions, which produced a 2–3 fold increase in blood ethanol levels and significantly elevated brain ethanol concentrations that persisted beyond the 2-hr drinking session. EtOH mice also exhibited significantly less immobility than CTL mice when the 10-min FST exposure was given at 3 or 7 days into withdrawal. A similar effect was observed following CRF infusion (50–200 ng, icv.) in CTL mice, suggesting that the CIE effect of altering FST responsiveness may be mediated by increased CRF activity. FST treatment given during each drinking test cycle produced significantly greater escalation of drinking in dependent (EtOH) mice with little effect on drinking in nondependent (CTL) mice. Finally, MTIP reduced drinking in a dose-related manner in EtOH mice, with the highest dose effective in both EtOH and CTL groups.</p><p id="Par874"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results indicate that repeated cycles of CIE exposure produce escalation of ethanol drinking, altered behavioral response to a stress (FST) challenge, and FST stress experience uniquely interacts with CIE exposure to further augment ethanol self-administration. Further, CIE-induced alterations in CRF activity appear to underlie these effects. Escalated drinking is responsive to CRF1R antagonist treatment, and CIE exposure compromises behavioral response to FST stress, an effect mimicked by exogenous CRF administration. On-going studies are measuring CRF peptide levels (ELISA) and Crf1R and Crf2R mRNA levels (qPCR) in various key structures within reward and stress circuitry in relation to drinking associated with the CIE ± FST stress model. Collectively, these results implicate adaptations in CRF activity in mediating/contributing to escalation of drinking and altered stress responsiveness associated with dependence.</p><p id="Par875"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> H.

While a great deal of attention has been focused on the ‘limbic’ circuitry that includes the Nucleus accumbens, recent studies suggest that the associative circuitry including dorsomedial striatum (DMS) in mice and the caudate nucleus in monkeys, and the sensorimotor striatum including the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) in mice and putamen nucleus in monkeys, also have roles in the neural actions of drugs of abuse.</p><p id="Par877"><bold>Methods:</bold> We have examined effects of chronic ethanol exposure on neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission in the DMS and DLS using brain slice electrophysiological recordings in 3 animal models: 1) Mice given chronic intermittent ethanol (EtOH) vapor exposure for 4 weeks; 2) Mice consuming EtOH under a Drinking in the Dark (DID) schedule for 6 weeks; and 3) Monkeys consuming EtOH on a 22 hr per day schedule for 1–3 years.</p><p id="Par878"><bold>Results:</bold> The excitability of striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) in the DLS and putamen is increased in slices from chronic EtOH-exposed mice and monkeys, as measured by increased action potential firing in response to postsynaptic current injection. The frequency of glutamatergic miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) is increased in both caudate and putamen nuclei from monkeys that consumed EtOH, and dendritic spine numbers are increased in putamen, but not caudate, of monkeys that consumed EtOH for 3 years. The increased mEPSC frequency may thus reflect increased numbers of glutamatergic synapses, at least in putamen. No changes in mEPSC frequency or amplitude were observed in mice given EtOH exposure with either procedure. The frequency of GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) was decreased in DLS and putamen SPNs in all of the alcohol exposure models. The mIPSC frequency correlated especially well with indices of alcohol intake in the monkey models. Chronic EtOH-induced decreases in mIPSC frequency were observed in mouse DMS, but increases were observed in monkey caudate nucleus. These findings indicate that a presynaptic decrease in GABAergic transmission in sensorimotor striatum arises relatively early in the course of chronic EtOH exposure and can persist for years. This synaptic alteration does not depend on voluntary consumption as is it observed with exposure by either vapor or consumption.</p><p id="Par879"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The overall pattern of findings in our chronic EtOH exposure models indicates that SPNs in striatum are disinhibited and show greater excitability, with a later developing increase in glutamatergic drive. Effects in associative striatum are more mixed. The net effect of these neurophysiological changes would be to facilitate throughput in the sensorimotor circuitry, perhaps facilitating habitual alcohol seeking and intake.</p><p id="Par880"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> D.

Jones<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec517"><title>Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston Salem, North Carolina</title><p id="Par881"><bold>Background:</bold> Ethanol has complex effects on the dopamine system when given acutely, with both excitatory and inhibitory aspects leading to an overall modest enhancement of dopamine signaling. Repeated exposure to ethanol and withdrawal attenuates both the set-point of dopamine system function and the response to ethanol challenge. We have examined dopamine dynamics in two animal models of chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal, a mouse model of chronic intermittent ethanol vapor exposure and a monkey model of chronic excessive drinking. Ethanol has been shown to interact with both reward and stress pathways, and ethanol dependence-induced drinking escalation has been linked to increased activity of the kappa opioid receptor system, which is activated by stress. Alterations in nucleus accumbens dopamine parameters such as release, uptake, autoreceptor activity, ethanol-induced elevations in dopamine levels and release activity evoked by tonic vs phasic stimulations will be described. In addition, the sensitivity of kappa opioid receptors to activation by the agonist U50,488 in the nucleus accumbens will also be described.</p><p id="Par882"><bold>Methods:</bold> Adult C57BL/6J mice received several weekly cycles of chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) vapor exposure (EtOH group) or air exposure (CTL group) in inhalation chambers (16 hr/day × 4 days). Adult monkeys had free access to an ethanol solution for more than 12 months following an induction procedure. All monkey experiments took place in the laboratory of Dr. Kathleen Grant at Oregon Health Sciences University. For microdialysis experiments, surgeries were conducted 2 days prior to starting the EtOH vapor exposure regimen. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (20 mg/kg, ip) and xylazine (100 mg/kg, ip)and guide cannulae for probes were implanted above the NAc. Following the final 16 h vapor exposure, microdialysis probes were inserted into the NAc and aCSF was infused at a rate of 1.0 ìL/min with at least a two hour period of equilibration prior to the start of the experiment. Samples were collected at 20-min intervals and analyzed by HPLC-EC. For voltammetry experiments, mice or monkeys were sacrificed and brains were sectioned into 400 ìm-thick coronal slices which were transferred to a submersion recording chamber perfused at 1 ml/min at 32 °C with oxygenated aCSF. A carbon fiber microelectrode (approximately 150 ìM length, 7 ìM radius) and a bipolar stimulating electrode were placed into the NAc core and dopamine was evoked by single electrical pulses applied every 5 min. Cumulative dose-response curves were obtained for drugs. To determine kinetic parameters, dopamine signals were modeled using Michaelis–Menten kinetics, as a balance between release and uptake (Wightman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1988). All voltammetry data were collected and modeled using Demon Voltammetry and Analysis software.</p><p id="Par883"><bold>Results:</bold> After chronic exposure to ethanol, either via vapor inhalation in mice over repeated cycles of exposure and withdrawal, or 12–18 months of free access to ethanol drinking in monkeys, there were several changes in dopamine function that were similar or identical across the two species. First, the maximal rate of dopamine uptake, or Vmax, was greater in ethanol-exposed animals. This would be expected to decrease extracellular levels of dopamine. In addition, presynaptic D2-type presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors, which provide feedback inhibition of dopamine release, were found to be supersensitive after ethanol exposure in both species. This would also be expected to reduce extracellular dopamine levels. The activity of kappa opioid receptors, which inhibit presynaptic dopamine release, was found to be increased in mouse brain, with monkey experiments ongoing. Acute ethanol challenges produced decreases rather than increases in extracellular dopamine in mice, potentially through a supersensitive dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor mechanism. Finally, the levels of electrically evoked dopamine release were found to be lower in the monkey model of excessive drinking, but unchanged in the mouse ethanol exposure model.</p><p id="Par884"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These findings indicate that there are many similarities between the neurobiological consequences of chronic, intermittent ethanol exposure across species, specifically mouse and monkey models. All of the adaptations documented in these models are aimed at reducing extracellular dopamine levels, and augmenting the effects of stress on the dopamine system, such that during withdrawal both mice and monkeys would be expected to be experiencing a hypodopaminergic state with supersensitivity to stress through increased sensitivity to kappa opioid receptor activity.</p><p id="Par885"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> S.

Graham<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec521"><title>EMD Serono Research &amp; Development Institute, Billerica, Massachusetts</title><p id="Par887"><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease that is characterized by an inflammatory process resulting in demyelination and axonal injury. Current treatments, acting primarily at the level of the peripheral immune system, effectively reduce the number and frequency of relapses in the relapsing-remitting form of MS (RRMS), but do not delay the progression of symptoms and accumulation of neurological disability in secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). There is currently a poor understanding of SPMS and no effective treatment. Novel therapies that cross the blood brain barrier to target neuroinflammation and reverse or halt neurodegeneration would bring tremendous benefit to MS patients. A key hurdle in the development of such therapies is the availability of readouts to monitor CNS activity. In order to address these challenges, we established a unique animal model of inflammation-driven neurodegeneration that mimics several clinical and pathological features of MS. Utilizing this model we specifically evaluated the use of preclinical translational endpoints such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) to longitudinally monitor disease progression.</p><p id="Par888"><bold>Methods:</bold> Female rats were immunized with full length myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) at Day 0 and assessed daily by monitoring neurological score (gait, paralysis, etc) for the remainder of the study. Roughly 40 days post-induction (dpi) animals were euthanized and the level of spinal cord and brain inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage determined by histology. In a second cohort of animals, disease progression was monitored longitudinally using MRI techniques including T1-weighted, T2-weighted and magnetization transfer (MT). In addition, the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) was measured using OCT at select time points during disease progression.</p><p id="Par889"><bold>Results:</bold> Immunization with MOG protein in rats induced significant neurological symptoms including abnormal gait and limb paralysis (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 as compared to controls) as well as increased inflammation (326% as compared to controls normalized at 100%; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), a reduction in myelin (54% vs 100%; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) and axonal damage (30% vs 100%, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05) in the spinal cord. Significant inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage were also present in the cerebellum, a finding unique to this model. In the cervical spinal cord, MRI T2-weighted (T2-W) and MT images correlated with neurological disability, reflecting the underlying inflammation and demyelination occurring during the disease course. Neuroinflammation within the cerebellum developed dynamically with approximately 50% of animals having lesions by the 1st relapse and more than 80% developing lesions by 39 dpi (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 as compared to control animals). In addition, total lesion load in the cerebellum showed a steady increase during the chronic phase of the disease, likely reflecting increased neurodegeneration. Finally, the extensive neuroinflammation in the optic nerve evident via histology at the end of the study was first detected by MRI in 80% or rats during the first relapse. Similarly, in a separate cohort of DA rats, OCT revealed a decrease in RNFL thickness as the disease progressed.</p><p id="Par890"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data indicate that the clinical disease course in DA rats mimics several aspects of the neurological and pathological symptoms present in MS including significant neuroinflammation and ultimately neurodegeneration. They also demonstrate the potential of using translational readouts such as MRI and OCT in preclinical model systems. Such technologies will enhance efficacy testing and may ultimately improve the probability of success in developing novel CNS therapeutics.</p><p id="Par891"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> D.

While it is clear that this is an activity-dependent process, the precise molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated. Work from our laboratory has demonstrated a surprising new role for glia and molecules traditionally associated with innate immune system function. We found that complement cascade proteins, in elimination and refinement of CNS synapses;however themechanism by which complement mediates synapse removal hasvremained elusive. The primary role of thecomplement cascade in the innate immune system is to opsonize or tag unwantedcells or debris for removal by phagocytic macrophages via specific complementreceptors.Our recent studies support a model in which ‘weaker’ or less active synapses in the developing brain are similarly tagged by complement and then eliminated by microglia, the primary phagocytic immune cells in CNS and the only resident brain cell to express complement receptor 3 (CR3/cd11b)</p><p id="Par893"><bold>Methods:</bold> Using high resolution imaging and assessment of mice deficient in complement-related proteins, we provide evidence that microglia activelyparticipate in synaptic pruning by phagocytosing developing synapse. Specifically. we used immuno-electron micropscopy and several superresolution Imaging techniques (SIM, Array Tomography) to assess microglia-synapse interaction and synaptic engulfment. In addtion, we used immunohisyological approaches to determine the expression and localization of complement (C1q, C3) and other immune-related molecules at developing CNS synapses.</p><p id="Par894"><bold>Results:</bold> In this study, we demonstrate that microglia are critical mediators of synaptic pruning in the normal, developing brain. Furthermore, we have identified an underlying cellular-based mechanism of complement-dependent synapse elimination: CR3/C3-dependent engulfment by microglia. Here we show that: 1) Specialized postnatal microglia engulf RGC presynaptic terminals undergoing active synaptic remodeling. 2) Engulfment of inputs is regulated by neuronal activity such that microglia selectively phagocytose ‘weaker’ RGC inputs. 3) Engulfment of RGC inputs by microglia is dependent upon complement cascade component C3, which is present at high levels during this precise time in the developing dLGN. 4) The receptor for C3, CR3, is specifically expressed by microglia in the P5 dLGN and is also necessary for microglia-mediated engulfment of excess RGC inputs.5) Genetic (CR3 KO or C3 KO) or pharmacological (minocycline) perturbations that disrupt microglia-mediated engulfment of RGC inputs result in deficits in structural remodeling and pruning of synaptic inputs. 6) Defects in synaptic circuitry are sustained into adulthood in CR3 and C3 KO mice. In addition, our preliminary experiments reveal defects in microglia phenotype and interactions with synapses in two mouse models of autism</p><p id="Par895"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results identify a new role for microglia in the healthy, developing brain and identify complement-dependent phagocytosis of synapses by microglia as a novel mechanism by which inappropriate synaptic connections are physically eliminated.Our data offer new insight into mechanisms underlying synaptic pruning in the developing CNS, provide a novel role for microglia in the healthy brain, and provide possible important mechanistic insight into synaptic pathology associated with developmental and degenerative CNS disease.</p><p id="Par896"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> B.

After exposure to RSDS some animals termed susceptible show a spectrum of depression-like behavior, whereas resilient animals behave more akin to controls.</p><p id="Par898"><bold>Methods:</bold> Blood was sampled from mice throughout the entire social defeat stress and IL-6 levels were measured. In a separate group of animals, peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated before RSDS and stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to examine the pre-stress IL-6 response. To test the functional relevance of the peripheral immune response to stress <italic>in vivo</italic>, we ablated the peripheral immune system of naïve mice using irradiation. We then replaced it by transplanting bone marrow from a susceptible mouse following 10 days of social defeat stress that exhibited a strong IL-6 response to LPS stimulation, or a control mouse with little or no IL-6 response to LPS challenge. We then exposed bone marrow recipient mice to a sub-threshold micro-defeat and tested for depression and anxiety-associated behavior. Additionally we transplanted bone marrow from IL-6 knockout mice into naïve mice and exposed them to 10 days of RSDS to examine whether IL-6 was necessary to induce depression-associated behavior.</p><p id="Par899"><bold>Results:</bold> A time-course analysis of peripheral IL-6 indicated that susceptible mice exhibit heightened IL-6 levels following their first defeat, which remain elevated 48 hours after the end of RSDS. Pre-stress LPS stimulation of PBMCs taken from animals that went on to show depression-associated behavior following RSDS, exhibited greater release of IL-6. Bone marrow transplants revealed a functional role for the peripheral immune system in the development of susceptibility to social defeat stress. Transplants from susceptible mice induced social avoidance following a sub-threshold microdefeat in naïve recipient animals, while transplantation of bone marrow from an IL-6 knockout mouse promoted resilience to RSDS.</p><p id="Par900"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We report that there are individual differences in the IL-6 response to stress. Animals that develop a susceptible phenotype following RSDS exhibit exaggerated release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. Furthermore, LPS stimulation of IL-6 can be used to predict which animals will display social avoidance following RSDS. Functionally, replacement of the bone marrow can be used to induce or block a depression-like phenotype depending upon the cytokine profile of the donor.

A rapidly growing literature has examined the clinical course of help-seeking individuals with prodromal presentation and gauged conversion rates to schizophrenia. Overall, the inclusion of brain-behavior measures has added to the prediction of clinical course. There is no population- based study with comprehensive assessment of psychosis spectrum clinical features, neurocognition and structural and functional neuroimaging. The goal of the present study was to examine prospectively a sample of youths who have endorsed psychotic symptoms and evaluate neurocognitive functioning compared to healthy people balanced sociodemographically.

In the twin cohort study, the most remarkable findings relate to the very high prevalence of hypomanic syndromes before age 26 (approx. 18&amp;% of the cohort, with five symptoms for several days) and the commonality of brief psychotic symptoms (approx. 8%). Further, sleep-wake cycle phenotypes are predicted by shared genetic characteristics and are associated with the ‘atypical’ as distinct from more classical ‘anxious depression’ illness-type. The relationships between early adolescent phenotypes and later phenotypes are being explored, with provisional support for the concept that differentiates atypical from typical depression phenotypes being sustained across this developmental period</p><p id="Par916"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These clinical and epidemiological studies provide unique data concerning the relationships between childhood risk phenotypes, the onset and course of depression and other major mood and psychotic disorders and their neurobiological correlates.

Although results vary depending on the condition of interest, work has generally demonstrated that youth affected with physical conditions are at greater risk for mental health problems relative to youth without such conditions. However, the majority of prior work that has examined associations between physical and mental health conditions has employed fairly small sample sizes, focused on one or a limited number of physical and/or mental health problems, or aggregated many heterogeneous physical conditions together in analyses, and/or failed to control for additional mental health and physical conditions, as well as the severity of physical conditions, in estimates of association.This report presents the first comprehensive assessment of comorbidity of the full range of classes of mental disorders with clinically diagnosed medical condition in a large and ethnically diverse sample of U.S. youth.</p><p id="Par919"><bold>Methods:</bold> The sample includes 9,014 youth ages 8–21 years selected at random after stratification by sex, age and ethnicity from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia genomics registry who participated in the University of Pennsylvania Neurodevelopmental Genomics Study. Children were assessed directly by clinically trained interviewers and ancillary information was obtained from a parent or caretaker.</p><p id="Par920"><bold>Results:</bold> Findings indicate that emotional and behavioral symptoms and disorders, particularly ADHD and behavior disorders, are more common in large pediatric samples than in the general population of youth in the U.S. Youth with medical conditions had a 3-fold increased risk of any psychiatric disorder, and severity of the condition also elevated the risk of psychiatric conditions. Findings revealed both specific patterns of associations between specific classes of mental disorders, as well as general associations between medical conditions that involve the CNS and ADHD and behavior disorders. For example, gastrointestinal (OR<sub>I</sub>=1.32, 95%CI=1.13–1.56) and autoimmune/inflammation diseases OR =1.23, 95%CI=1.03–1.46) were significantly associated with mood disorders but not with other mental disorders. By contrast, youth with neurologic/CNS diseases were significantly more likely to experience mood disorders (OR=1.32, 95% CI=1.13 – 1.54), ADHD (OR=1.35, 95% CI=1.17–1.55) and behavior disorders (OR=1.37, 95% CI=1.22–1.55) than those without these conditions. Likewise, developmental disorders were also associated with ADHD, behavior disorders and mood disorders. Birth anomalies were specifically associated with anxiety disorders (OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.09–1.46).</p><p id="Par921"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These findings have important implications for potential etiologic links between medical and psychiatric disorders. Recent findings regarding CNS-gut interactions suggest potential mechanisms for the links between gastrointestinal disorders and inflammatory conditions with mood disorders. Likewise, there is growing evidence for CNS insults and neurodevelopmental anomalies that may predispose to behavior disorders and ADHD. Finally, the results highlight the importance of comprehensive evaluation of mental disorders in pediatric services.</p><p id="Par922"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> K.

The presentation varies widely among children with ASD and within the same child over time. The study of this heterogeneity has presented significant problems when describing the developmental trajectories of the disorder. The objective of this presentation is to illustrate two different approaches to the study of heterogeneous developmental trajectories as a way of understanding the complex interplay of phenotypes over time.</p><p id="Par924"><bold>Methods:</bold> Multi-method and multi-informant instruments were used to characterize key developmental phenotypes over 4 time points, roughly 6 months apart. The phenotypes studied include language, socialization skills, adaptive functioning and a composite measure of autistic symptoms. Two different approaches were taken to study change over time; one, assumed that developmental trajectories were heterogeneous and the other that trajectories were homogeneous but phenotypes might might interact over time. Phenotypes of autistic symptoms and adaptive functioning were analyzed using semi-parametric group based trajectory analysis. Structural equation modeling allowing for reciprocal interaction was used to study the influence of language and social skills over time.</p><p id="Par925"><bold>Results:</bold> Adaptive functioning and autistic symptoms showed markedly heterogeneous developmental trajectories with differing predictor and outcome associations. There was little developmental ‘yoking’ of these phenotypes. In contrast, there was remarkable reciprocal interaction between socialization and language over time with social skills having a greater influence on language than vice versa.</p><p id="Par926"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data illustrate that for ASD, different developmental phenotypes show different developmental trajectories in the preschool period. Phenotypes interact much like risk and protective factors. The study of developmental trajectories provides a rich opportunity to study change over time and appreciate the heterogeneity of these disorders both within and between children.</p><p id="Par927"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> P.

Building a More Predictive Mouse: Humanized Mouse Models for Neuropsychiatric Disorders</title></sec><sec id="Sec545"><title>50.1 Development and Characterization of Mice Humanzied for the COMTval158met Polymorphism</title><sec id="Sec546"><title>Victoria Risbrough<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec547"><title>University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California</title><p id="Par929"><bold>Background:</bold> The COMTval158met polymorphism has been one of the most well studied single nucleotide polymorphisms in neuropsychiatry. This polymorphism is a valine (Val)-tomethionine(Met) substitution in the coding sequence for catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) and results in a 40% reduction in COMT enzyme activity in the Met/Met carriers. It has been associated with risk for schizophrenia, OCD, ADHD, PTSD and other disorders, however many of these associations have failed to replicate. COMTval158met has also been shown to modulate many cognitive functions in healthy subjects and patient populations, as well as differential treatment response. Because of the difficulty in isolating the effect of one mutation in genetically heterogonous human populations, animal models can be of great utility to dissect the causal relationship between a given gene mutation and function. Mouse COMT however has differential enzyme activity than human COMT, thus is not an ideal control. Thus we created the first ‘humanized’ COMTval158 mouse line, which carries only either the human Val or Met version of the gene knocked into the mouse COMT locus. This ‘humanized’ mouse model will allow direct comparison of the two human alleles on brain development, function, and behavior.</p><p id="Par930"><bold>Methods:</bold> Here we will present the initial characterization of the COMTval158met mouse line. Based on the reported differences in human Met and Val carriers across COMT enzymatic efficacy, cortical volume, working memory, fear processes, sensorimotor gating, and novelty seeking, we examined these functions using homologous measures across mice homozygous for the COMTval or COMTmet alleles. We examined (1) cortical COMT enzyme efficacy and cortical thickness, (2) spatial working memory via spontaneous alternation, (3) fear processes via Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction of the freezing response, as well as (4) sensorimotor gating and exploratory behavior.</p><p id="Par931"><bold>Results:</bold> As has been shown in human cortical tissue, COMT enzyme assay on cortical tissue showed that mice homozygous for COMTval exhibited a 30% reduction in enzyme efficacy compared to mice homozygous for COMTmet. COMTval mice exhibited increased cortical thickness compared to COMTmet mice, potentially mimicking reports of increased grey matter and cortical thickness in human COMTval carriers. COMTval158met had a sex specific effect on sensorimotor gating, with male COMTval mice exhibiting lower prepulse inhibition compared to COMTmet mice, similar to human studies. Conversely, female COMTval mice, however, exhibited higher PPI than female COMTmet mice. COMTmet mice also exhibited small increases in exploratory behavior compared to COMTval mice. The COMTval carriers of both sexes exhibited robust reductions in spatial working memory compared to COMTmet carriers. Previous studies in humans show that tolcapone, a COMT inhibitor, has genotype specific effects on working memory. Our studies in COMTval158met mice mimicked these findings, with Tolcapone reversing the COMTval working memory deficits while attenuating working memory in COMTmet mice. Finally, COMTmet mice exhibited reduced contextual fear but increased cued fear and reduced extinction recall, which may mimic the fear processing deficits described in human COMTmet carriers.</p><p id="Par932"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data indicate that the COMTval158mouse line may mimic many of the specific phenotypes reported across human COMTval158met genotypes in a number of behavioral domains relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders, including sensorimotor gating, working memory, and fear processes. These mice may thus be a useful model for understanding the developmental effects of the COMT158met mutation on cortical morphology and function, its modulation of behaviors relevant to neuropsychiatric symptoms, and most importantly, how these two alleles may modulate treatment response.</p><p id="Par933"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> V.

Molecular studies identified the disruption of the DISC1 (disrupted-in-schizophrenia) gene by chromosome translocation at chromosome 1q42. Our previous studies, however, found that the translocation also disrupted another gene, Boymaw, on chromosome 11. After translocation, two fusion genes were generated between the DISC1 and Boymaw genes.</p><p id="Par935"><bold>Methods:</bold> Expression of full-length DISC1, truncated DISC1, DISC1-Boymaw, and Boymaw-DISC1 proteins were examined in different cell lines. To assess their functions on broad cellular activities, MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) reduction assays were performed. RNA expression and proteomic analyses were also conducted. Humanized DISC1-Boymaw mice were generated to mimic the chromosome translocation in the Scottish family. Molecular and behavioral analyses were also conducted in humanized DISC1-Boymaw mice.</p><p id="Par936"><bold>Results:</bold> Expression of the DISC1-Boymaw fusion gene reduces both intracellular NADH oxidoreductase activities as well as synthesis of ribosomal RNA in both <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture and humanized mouse brains.

Behavioral analyses revealed abnormal information processing of acoustic startle, exaggerated responses to NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, as well as depressive-like behaviors in the humanized mice.</p><p id="Par937"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our studies suggest that the DISC1-Boymaw fusion gene is a causal gene mutation in the pathogenesis of major psychiatric disorders in the Scottish DISC1 family. We hypothesize that decreased rRNA synthesis, resulting from expression of the DISC1-Boymaw fusion gene, may reduce protein translation of genes critical in NMDA and GABA neurotransmissions as well as synaptogenesis in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and major depression.</p><p id="Par938"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> X.

Hahn<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec553"><title>Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee</title><p id="Par939"><bold>Background:</bold> Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has long been suspected to involve alterations in CNS dopamine (DA) signaling. Human genetic studies have demonstrated association of primary diagnoses and/or treatment response with 3′ noncoding variation in the DA transporter (DAT) gene and changes in DAT levels have been reported via PET methods in unmedicated subjects with an ADHD diagnosis. Additionally, the most common medications used to treat ADHD, amphetamine (AMPH) and methylphenidate, are DAT targeting psychostimulants. Our lab has discovered multiple instances of rare coding variants that impact DAT trafficking and/or function when expressed <italic>in vitro</italic> (Mazei <italic>et al</italic>, 2009; Sakrikar <italic>et al</italic>, 2012). One of these variants, DAT A559V, demonstrates a striking spontaneous efflux phenotype, similar to the effect of amphetamine to produce non-vesicular, DAT-mediated DA efflux, and is not responsive to AMPH to trigger DA release. These studies predict that the subjects bearing the DAT A559V variant may exhibit a spontaneous leak of DA at synapses that could trigger hyperactivity and depresses the dynamic range needed for high-fidelity DA signaling related to cue saliency. To assess the <italic>in vivo</italic> impact of the DAT A559V mutation, we have generated transgenic, knock-in (KI) mice where the A559V variant is expressed by the endogenous <italic>Slc6a3</italic> locus.</p><p id="Par940"><bold>Methods:</bold> DAT A559V mice were generated by homologous recombination in 129S6 and then bred to wild-type C57BL/6J mice to produce germ-line transmission. Heterozygous offspring were intercrossed to yield all three genotypes (homozygous WT DAT, heterozygous DAT A559V and homozygous DAT A559V on a 129S6/C57BL/6J background). Owing to the bias in diagnoses toward boys vs girls with ADHD, and due to our identification of the DAT A559V variant in two male siblings, we focused our studies on analysis of male, adolescent (6–8) week old males. Animals were housed on a reverse (12:12) light cycle to allow for analysis of animals during their active period. Behavioral, biochemical and pharmacological studies were performed under an animal protocol approved by the Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and use Committee (IACUC). All behavioral tests were performed in the Vanderbilt Laboratory for Neurobehavior Core Facility, operated by the Vanderbilt Brain Institute.</p><p id="Par941"><bold>Results:</bold> DAT A559V heterozygous breeders produced offspring at expected Mendelian ratios, with the exception that male (but not female) animals exhibited a significant underrepresentation of heterozygous and homozygous animals. Biochemical analyses of brain samples revealed no significant differences in DA or DOPAC levels in any brain region, nor were DAT, tyrosine hydroxylase or the density of D1 and D2 DA receptors altered. The three genotypes did not differ in baseline physical characteristics and sensorimotor responses as assessed in the Irwin screen. Heterozygous and homozygous animals exhibited no differences from WT animals in spontaneous locomotion in the Open Field Test (OFT) nor were differences detected in center <italic>vs</italic> surround analyses of time spent in different areas of the chamber. However, we detected a significant, gene-dose dependent impact on motor reactivity in response to experimenter approach, assessed as the speed of movement away from a hand entry into the cage detected by automated video recordings. Although animals were not hyperactive in the OFT, the heterozygous and homozygous DAT A559V mice demonstrated a significantly blunted response to i.p. Injections of AMPH. To explore the basis for the blunted AMPH behavioral phenotype, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> DA release studies using superfused, acute striatal slices. These studies revealed that both the heterozygous and homozygous DAT A559V mice exhibit reduced K+ as well as AMPH evoked release of DA. Consistent with a chronic state of DA efflux, we found total insensitivity of DA release to stimulation of presynaptic D2 receptors by the D2 agonist quinpirole. Consistent with these <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, microdialysis of the striatum demonstrated a marked elevation of basal DA levels in homozygous DAT A559V KI mice relative to littermate controls and a significantly blunted (10% of control) ability of i.p. AMPH to produce DA release.</p><p id="Par942"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Studies with the DAT A559V mice reveal that the variant imposes a basal elevation in extracellular DA that is consistent with a constitutive, spontaneous DA efflux. Similarly, our studies reveal a loss of AMPH responsiveness in these animals, both neurochemically and behaviorally, and the presence of a context-dependent hyperactivity. These studies, the first to derive from a construct-valid model of ADHD-associated genetic variation in DA signaling pathways, demonstrate <italic>in vivo</italic> phenotypes that argue for a significant opportunity in using the DAT A559V model to elucidate molecular, cellular and circuit level plasticities induced by perturbed DA signaling in ADHD.</p><p id="Par943"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> M.

In contrast to mouse models of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) ablation, the regulation and dynamics of 5-HT neurotransmission is preserved yet overall blunted in the Tph2KI mice. Thus, the Tph2KI mouse may offer a more translational model system for the study of 5-HT deficiency, since complete lack of 5-HT is not known to occur in humans. 5-HT deficiency is associated with suicidality, borderline personality disorder and impulsive aggression in humans.</p><p id="Par945"><bold>Methods:</bold> Tph2KI mice were generated by homologous recombination and breed via heterozygous crosses. Extracellular 5-HT levels were quantified by microdialysis. Dyadic-testing aggression, tail suspension, light-dark box emergence, novelty suppressed feeding and marble burying were executed using standard protocols. Affiliative behaviors were assessed by co-housing two unfamiliar male mice in a novel environment and scoring the trajectory of agonistic and antagonistic interactions.</p><p id="Par946"><bold>Results:</bold> The Tph2KI mice presents with ‘depression-like’ behaviors, impaired affiliative behaviors and increased aggression. The Tph2KI mice recapitulate with high fidelity the biochemical anomalies previously assumed to be ‘biomarkers’ of central 5-HT deficiency, thereby confirming the <italic>bona fides</italic> of these measures, which have been employed in clinical research for decades. Further, the effect of chronic selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment on extracellular 5-HT is severely blunted, indicating that the Tph2KI mice may represent a model of SSRI treatment-resistance. Commensurately, behavioral (eg novelty suppressed feeding, marble burying) and neurogenic (eg dentate gyrus neuron proliferation) responses to chronic SSRI treatment are abolished or blunted in the Tph2KI mice.</p><p id="Par947"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our investigations exemplify the advantage of animal models where the deficit in question closely parallels that occurring in humans. The Tph2KI mouse is an excellent tool for the study of 5-HT deficiency, and seemingly also for the study of SSRI treatment-resistance. The latter aspect is key since SSRI treatment-resistant depression, -anxiety and -OCD are large, serious and expensive health care problems. To characterize the impact of naturalistic 5-HT deficiency on antidepressant responses, we will in future studies examine the effects of SSRIs and non-5-HTergic antidepressants in the Tph2KI mice, looking at complementary behavioral, biochemical and gene regulation outcomes. This, in turn, may yield information of the neurobiology of antidepressant treatment-resistance, a poorly studied area.</p><p id="Par948"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> J.

These observations parallel our finding of decreased FC between the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in response to incongruent trials relative to congruent trials during performance of a cognitive Stroop task. We also observed that abnormal performance in response inhibition tasks, semantic organization, and dysexecutive behavior predicted poor response to SSRIs. Biological indices of these functions, i.e. microstructural (DTI) abnormalities in white matter connecting cognitive control structures and abnormal resting functional connectivity within the cognitive control network, predicted poor response to SSRIs while connectivity within the default mode network was unrelated to treatment response. In our non-demented, non-MCI depressed subjects, apathy was associated with impaired performance in the Iowa Gambling Task, which assesses the ability to maximize earnings by selecting low-risk, low-reward responses over high-risk, high-reward responses and presumably reflects ventromedial PFC function. Apathetic depressed patients had lower resting FC of the nucleus accumbens with the amygdala, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and thalamus and increased FC with the dmPFC, the superior frontal cortex, and the insula than non-apathetic patients. Moreover, apathetic patients had lower FC of the dACC with dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices and higher FC with the insula and the OFC than non-apathetic patients. Persistence of apathy, following SSRI treatment, was significantly correlated with smaller posterior subgenual cingulate gray matter volume and lower uncinate fasciculus white matter integrity. These structural abnormalities may interfere with prefrontal-limbic communication needed for motivated behavior and impede adequate treatment response of apathy.</p><p id="Par953"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Behavioral, structural and functional abnormalities of the cognitive control network distinguish depressed older patients from normal controls and are associated with poor treatment response of depressive symptoms and apathy.</p><p id="Par954"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> G.

Thus, over a 2 year period, BDNF levels decreased in the elderly cohort—but not in remitted patients who did not already have nor develop MCI.</p><p id="Par968"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In both the inflammatory cytokine-exposed cohort and the elderly cohort, low BDNF at baseline was most notably associated with current cognitive deficits. In prior work, we have observed that the Met/Val allele for BDNF is specifically associated with a subset of cognitively related depression symptoms during IFN therapy. In both cohorts (one exposed to an exogenous inflammatory cytokine, the other to natural aging) BDNF decreases over time – although not in older remitted MDD subjects who remain without cognitive problems.

There are also reports that subsets of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) display gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities, including increased intestinal permeability and altered composition of GI microbiota. To explore the potential connections between GI problems and the brain and behavior, we use a mouse model of an ASD risk factor, maternal immune activation (MIA). We also tested the efficacy of probiotic treatment in MIA offspring that display the cardinal ASD behaviors and neuropathology.</p><p id="Par972"><bold>Methods:</bold> Pregnant mice are injected with the immune-activating dsRNA poly(I:C) or saline on E12.5.

A growing body of evidence suggests that aberrant immunologic systems underlie the pathophysiologic characteristics of ASD. However, to our knowledge, no information is available on the patterns of distribution of microglial activation in the brain in ASD.

One hypothesis explaining the fever response in ASD suggests that elevated maternal stress during pregnancy increases cortisol release resulting in a developmental maturational hypofunctioning of the locus coeruleus norepinephrine system (LC--NE). Another hypothesis suggests that maternal immune activation during pregnancy results in inflammation in the neonate which may be associated with developmental and behavioral abnormailities. We examined these observations and tested these hypotheses with three sets of clinical studies to determine whether improvement with fever in ASD is 1) a direct effect of increased temperature, 2) a result of activating a hypofunctioning LC-NE system, or 3) a result of modulating an overactive immune-inflammatory system via altering the microbiome.</p><p id="Par987"><bold>Methods:</bold> Study 1: Fifteen children with ASD had clinical measures (Social Responsivenes Scale (SRS), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale (CGI-I), pupillary biomarkers, and gene expression profiles collected during a hot tub study which compared responses during separate days at 102 degrees vs 98 degrees Farenheight. Study 2: Thirty four high functioning adults with ASD participated in a 12 week randomized parallel design trial of the NE reuptake inhibitor milnacipran vs placebo with outcome measures of attention, executive function, and motor inhibition.Study 3: Ten high functioning adults with ASD participated in a randomized crossover trial of 12 weeks of the helminth trichura suis ova (TSO) vs 12 weeks of placebo, with a 4 week washout period in between active phases.

Pupillometry and gene expression measures were associated in part with clinical change.Study 2: Adults with ASD on milnacipran vs placebo had improvement on the Connors Scale measures of Inattention and Impulsivity symptoms, on global improvement measures(CGI-I) and on executive function.Study 3: Adults with ASD on 12 weeks of the helminth TSO vs placebo had improvement on repetitive behaviors measured by the YBOCS-compulsion subscale and the RBS-R ritualistic behaviors scale, and on global improvement measures(CGI-I).</p><p id="Par989"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We prospectively demonstrated that children with a history of fever response had improvement in clinical measures and biomarkers as a direct result of temperature elevation. It remains unclear whether this response can be attributed to CNS thermolabile enzymes that effect gene-expression. This fever effect could be due to enhancement of a hypofunctioning LC system, since the NE reuptake inhibitor milnacipran resulted in improvement of attention, impulsivity and executive function. Altering the microbiome via administration of the helminth TSO was associated with improvement in rigidity and its resulting disruptive behaviors, which is consistent with the notion that inflammatory mechanisms may play a role in the pathophysiology of ASD and be a target for experimental therapeutics in ASD.</p><p id="Par990"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> E.

Adult-born neurons have been implicated in both cognitive functions and in mediating the behavioral effects of antidepressants. However, it is not known whether stimulation of adult hippocampal neurogenesis is sufficient to improve cognition and mood.</p><p id="Par998"><bold>Methods:</bold> Here we use a combination of pharmacological and optogenetic approaches in mice to explore the impact of adult hippocampal neurogenesis on cognitive functions such as pattern separation and generalization and on mood and anxiety-related behaviors. Pharmacological manipulations include compounds that stimulate neurogenesis and target melatonin and serotonin receptors such as agomelatine as well as compounds that target apoptotic cell death such as Bax antagonists. Opogenetic approaches allow us to manipulate young adult-born granule cells specifically in the dorsal or the ventral hippocampus.</p><p id="Par999"><bold>Results:</bold> We show that both pharmacological and optogenetic approaches aimed at stimulating neurogenesis result in improved pattern separation in contextual fear discrimination tasks.

In contrast, the melatonin type1 and 2 receptor agonist and 5-HT<sub>2C/2B</sub> receptor agonist agomelatine has been established as an antidepressant in placebo-controlled trials and active comparator studies. The present studies were designed to assess the possible contribution of the activation of melatonin receptors and the antagonism of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> receptors in modyfying monoaminergic transmission in the rat brain using electrophysiological techniques.</p><p id="Par1003"><bold>Methods:</bold> Male Sprague Dawley were given either agomelatine or melatonin (40 mg/kg ip at 17:00), and/or the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> antagonist SB-242084 and the 5-HT<sub>2B</sub> antagonist LY 266097 (both 2 mg/kg ip at 17:00) daily for 2 or 14 days.

After 14 days, there were still more DA neurons firing spontaneously and their firing rate as well as their bursting activity were markedly enhanced. These effects were blocked by a melatonin antagonist.Only at this time, the firing rate of 5-HT neurons was marked increased; it was reversed by acutely injecting a DA2 antagonist. The enhanced firing of 5-HT neurons led to a net increase in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> transmission. The enhancing action of agomelatine on DA and 5-HT neuronal firing could only be reproduced by administering melatonin with the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> antagonist.

Voluntary running wheel activity induces antidepressant like activity and promotes neurogenesis in the mouse hippocampus (Van Pragg <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999).

With these pathologies as hallmarks, animal models are now being used to screen compounds that may ameliorate them.

Long splice isoforms of the PDE4 enzymes contain three important regulatory domains known as UCR1, UCR2 and CR3. UCR1 and UCR2 comprise a negative regulatory module that holds the PDE4 enzyme in a partially inactive conformation. cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of UCR1 by protein kinase A (PKA) releases the enzyme from inhibition and causes an 8 fold increase in enzymatic activity. An amino acid sequence polymorphism in UCR2 that is unique to primates allows the design of PDE4D selective allosteric inhibitors that are able to capture UCR2 in the closed conformation across the active site. Correspondingly, an amino acid sequence difference in CR3 allows the design of PDE4B selective allosteric inhibitors that close CR3 across the active site. The design of PDE4D and PDE4B selective allosteric inhibitors that distribute to brain has allowed us to explore the rich neuropharmacology of these important enzymes.</p><p id="Par1029"><bold>Methods:</bold> Long splice isoforms of PDE4B1 and PDE4D7 have been expressed with and without a PKA-activating mutation in UCR1 (PDE4B1 S133D or PDE4D7 S54D). Biochemical assays are performed with purified PDE4 proteins using a linked enzyme reaction (Burgin 2010, Nat Biotech <italic>28:63–70</italic>) and 4 μM cAMP. Rodent cognition tests (novel object recognition) and assessments of antidepressant-like activity (forced swim and tail suspension) were performed using standard protocols.</p><p id="Par1030"><bold>Results:</bold> In the absence of phosphorylation, the UCR1/UCR2 negative regulatory module holds the PDE4D7 dimer (or higher order multi-mer) in a trans-capped mostly inhibited basal state, and also prevents binding of the allosteric inhibitor. This allows the design of allosteric inhibitors that are more than 500 fold selective for the PKA activated form of the enzyme. Binding of the inhibitor returns PDE4D7 to the basal state, thus, the compound behaves as a partial inhibitor. In contrast, capping of the active site by CR3 (Control Region 3) occurs in cis-, so compounds targeting CR3 completely inhibit enzymatic activity. Structural studies show how compounds can be tuned to bind UCR2 or CR3. PDE4D inhibitors have potent pro-cognitive benefit in mice, rats and non-human primates. Contrastingly, PDE4B inhibitors have antidepressant-like activity in standard antidepressant models while lacking pro-cognitive benefit in adult rats and mice.</p><p id="Par1031"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The prototypical PDE4 inhibitor rolipram has convincing pro-cognitive and antidepressant benefit in multiple rodent and monkey models, but lacks tolerability in humans due to nausea. Rolipram is the prototypical example of a UCR2-directed allosteric inhibitor, but has low selectivity for PDE4D versus PDE4B (4.7x) and for the PKA-activated versus basal forms of PDE4D7 (13.4x). Thus, at the concentration needed to inhibit the PKA-activated form of PDE4D7, there is substantial inhibition by rolipram of the basal, non-phosphorylated enzyme which appears to be associated with lack of tolerability. By optimizing compounds for inhibition of the PKA-activated conformer, basal PDE4D activity is not inhibited, thereby improving tolerability. Our data indicate that PDE4D and PDE4B selectively regulate distinct signaling pathways within neurons and within the brain.</p><p id="Par1032"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> M.

However, their long-term use in management of chronic non-malignant pain is now being challenged, where concerns about safety and efficacy and addiction potential are debated. In addition to their powerful analgesic properties, opioids also possess incentive-motivational properties that contribute to their pain relieving attributes. Alterations in the affective-reward system in a chronic pain state are a logical hypothesis for their sub-optimal analgesic effects in treating neuropathic pain. In chronic pain, low doses of opioid antagonists such as naloxone and naltrexone can have analgesic effects. The impact of how chronic pain modifies opioid reward and analgesia remain poorly explored.</p><p id="Par1036"><bold>Methods:</bold> In this study, we examine how the reinforcing properties of opioids change in a chronic pain state, and examine the effect these changes have on the analgesic efficacy of these drugs. We use an animal model of chronic pain whereby the left sciatic nerve was loosely constricted with a polyethylene cuff, a chronic constriction injury (CCI). The reinforcing properties of opioids were then tested using the conditioned place preference test (CPP).</p><p id="Par1037"><bold>Results:</bold> CCI led to significant microglial activation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the brain region containing the dopaminergic cell bodies of the mesolimbic dopamine system. Microglial activation was correlated with significant increase in expression of BDNF, and blocking microglial activation reversed BDNF levels to normal levels. CCI also lead to significant dysregulation of chloride homeostasis in GABAergic interneurons of the VTA, an effect that could be reversed by a TrkB antagonist. Under basal conditions, morphine place preference was similar in both sham and neuropathic animals. However, concomitant treatment with a dopamine antagonist blocked morphine CPP in neuropathic, but not sham animals.</p><p id="Par1038"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results point to a significant dysregulation in reward systems of the brain in chronic pain conditions, and show that motivation for morphine preference may be altered.

The mechanism of improved treatment response remains unclear. GABAergic neuroactive steroids have been shown to promote GABAergic transmission, enhance ethanol sensitivity, modulate opioid inhibition of the HPA axis and protect against inflammatory neuronal damage. We tested whether naltrexone effects on the GABAergic neuroactive steroids may differ in those with the OPRM1 polymorphism.</p><p id="Par1041"><bold>Methods:</bold> Non-treatment seeking heavy drinkers received naltrexone (50 mg) or placebo for three consecutive days followed by an intravenous infusion of ethanol.

Although excessive consumption of fast food and pharmacotherapy with second-generation antipsychotic agents (SGAs) has been implicated in the schizophrenia/obesity comorbidity, the pathophysiology of this link remains unclear. The mechanism proposed here is based on the central opioidergic system owing to opioids’ role in: (a) enhancing rewarding features of food; (b) boosting orexigenic and suppressing anorexigenic neuropeptides; (c) reducing peripheral insulin secretion and (d) desensitizing insulin receptors. Opioidergic mechanisms of obesity may be particularly pertinent for schizophrenic patients because elevation of endogenous opiate concentrations in their cerebral spinal fluid and in plasma is a relatively consistent clinical finding while some SGAs (eg, olanzapine) purportedly exhibit pro-opioidergic brain effects. If excess of central opioid activity, which is consequential to schizophrenia neuropathology with or without SGA pharmacotherapy creates metabolic problems for the patients it is reasonable to expect amelioration of the symptoms through the blockade of opioid receptors. The purpose of this presentation is to discuss a potential heuristic value of such a blockade for SGA-treated patients’ metabolic status.</p><p id="Par1046"><bold>Methods:</bold> Translational evidence to be presented in support of the above contention includes a preclinical and two clinical studies. First, four groups of Wistar Han IGS rats were treated for 28 days with olanzapine, a combination of olanzapine and an opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone, naltrexone alone or vehicle, and their food consumption and body weight were measured daily for the first nine days and every other day thereafter. Second, a potential mechanism of naltrexone action was explored in 15 patients with heroin dependence who underwent the standard sweet taste test before- and 7 days after the injection of depot naltrexone.

Potential mechanisms of naltrexone action may involve diminution of rewarding features of food in conjunction with favorable effects on insulin sensitivity. If confirmed, our results may contribute to the identification of an inexpensive and effective treatment that specifically targets the underlying pathophysiologic effects of SGAs and provides a substantial clinical benefit to the at risk population. Our findings also support further inquiry into the pathophysiologic significance of opioidergic function derangements in schizophrenia along with various therapeutic strategies aimed at alleviating such deficits.</p><p id="Par1049"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> I.

However some evidence indicates that naltrexone (NTX) also modulates aspects of executive function. This talk will review the data from several laboratory studies in human subjects demonstrating NTX's acute effects on aspects of cognitive control. In addition, we will present new, unpublished data demonstrating that chronic NTX produces similar cognitive effects in treatment seeking alcoholics.</p><p id="Par1051"><bold>Methods:</bold> Study 1: Abstinent alcoholics and healthy controls were given a single acute dose of NTX (50 mg) in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over design, and computer-based cognitive tasks were used to quantify the effects of NTX on decisions between small immediate rewards (‘<italic>Now</italic>’) and larger delayed rewards (‘<italic>Later</italic>’), and a measure of attentional bias to attractive cues. Study 2: As for Study 1, but in the context of moderate alcohol intake (0.03 BrAC), and using only healthy controls.Study 3: As for Study 1, but in the context of an fMRI scan session; cognitive tasks were completed during scanning. We also quantified NTX's effects on task-related brain activity. Study 4: In the context of a 12 week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial for NTX, treatment seeking alcoholics were given daily NTX (50 mg), and effects of NTX on impulsive decision-making, and attentional bias to visual alcohol cues were quantified using computer-based cognitive tasks; for a subset of participants, the <italic>Now/Later</italic> task was completed during fMRI scanning, and thus we also quantified NTX's effects on brain activity.</p><p id="Par1052"><bold>Results:</bold> addition, we find that in people with a positive family history of alcoholism, acute NTX effects on <italic>Now</italic> vs <italic>Later</italic> bias depend on a personality measure (Locus of Control; LOC) linked to frontal dopamine (DA) signaling, with more external LOC scores predicting less impulsive choices on NTX. In other studies, we have found that indices of tonic frontal DA signaling predict impulsive choice according to a U-shaped relationship between impulsive choice and frontal DA levels, leading us to speculate that NTX modulates impulsive choice by altering tonic DA transmission in the frontal cortex. We hypothesize that those with a family history of alcoholism experience relatively greater effects of kappa opioid receptor blockade, resulting in more consistent elevation of frontal DA levels in response to NTX in this population. This frontal DA elevation then reduces <italic>Now</italic> bias in those with an external LOC, and increases <italic>Now</italic> bias in those with an internal LOC. Finally, we show that acute NTX modulates activity in the orbitofrontal cortex. We now show that chronic NTX similarly affects decision-making and orbitofrontal activity, and also reduces attentional bias to alcohol cues in treatment seeking alcoholics.</p><p id="Par1053"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data support further investigation of the cognitive effects of NTX, particularly in the domain of executive functions subserved by the frontal lobes. Moreover, the ability of NTX to modulate executive function points to possible therapeutic potential in disorders beyond addiction that are also characterized by executive impairment. Finally, the consilience of acute and chronic effects of NTX highlight the utility of acute studies for economically probing the neurocognitive effects of NTX.</p><p id="Par1054"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> C.

Whereas these mechanisms are active throughout life, recent findings point to a critical window of early postnatal development during which neuronal gene expression may be persistently re-programmed via epigenetic modifications. However, it remains unclear how modulation of the epigenetic machinery is triggered and executed. Here we focus on an important example of early-life programming: the effect of sensory input from the mother on expression patterns of key stress-related genes in the developing brain. We describe recent work that integrates organism-wide signals with intercellular and intracellular events that, in turn impact epigenetic regulation. We focus on the lasting effects of enriched early life experience on <italic>Crh</italic> gene expression in the hypothalamus, and describe the operational brain networks that convey sensory input to CRH expressing cells, highlighting the resulting ‘re-wiring’ of synaptic connectivity to these neurons.

We describe neuronal pathways activated by specific patterns of maternal behavior, that carry patterns of maternal care to stress-responsive hypothalamic neurons. How does activation of this neuronal network influence neurons to modulate cellular processes? We find that a week of early-life augmented maternal care reduces the number and function of excitatory synapses onto CRH-expressing hypothalamic neurons. This reduced excitatory input triggers intracellular cascades culminating in epigenetic chromatin changes, as evident from recent data showing that reduced glutamatergic neurotransmission suffices to repress <italic>Crh</italic> expression in hypothalamic slices <italic>in vitro</italic>.

The epigenetic mechanisms through which these influences may contribute to disease development are not well understood; though likely involve very complex interactions between parental germ cell lifetime exposures, the maternal milieu and the fetal genetic background. We have identified a sensitive period of early gestation where maternal stress produces sex-dependent epigenetic programming effects on offspring stress pathway neurodevelopment. In addition, in a paternal stress model, we have similarly found that offspring from males chronically stressed over puberty or as adults have offspring with significant alterations in their HPA stress axis.

Recent human exome sequencing studies have identified subunits of the polymorphic Brg1-associated factor (BAF) complexes (mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex) that are frequently mutated in sporadic mental retardation and sporadic autism. Moreover, <italic>de novo</italic> mutations in various subunits of the neuron-specific BAF (nBAF) nucleosome remodeling complex have been implicated in Coffin-Siris and Nicolaides-Baraitser syndromes, both of which are associated with intellectual disability. Together, these studies suggest that nBAF function is necessary for normal cognitive function. Nucleosome remodeling complexes modify chromatin structure and regulate gene expression by repositioning nucleosomes at the promoters of genes.Why disturbances to chromatin remodeling via mutations in BAF complexes result in cognitive dysfunction is unknown. Although an important topic in other fields (eg cancer), nucleosome remodeling has received little attention in neuroscience. The nBAF complex has a unique subunit, called BAF53b, which is neuron-specific and only found in the nBAF complex, making BAF53b an ideal target for investigating the contributions of nBAF to synaptic physiology and behavior. We tested the hypothesis that nBAF, after playing a key role in neuronal fate decisions during development, continues to regulate gene expression and does so in a manner critical to adult plasticity and memory.</p><p id="Par1072"><bold>Methods:</bold> To investigate the role of BAF53b in learning and memory, we used several different lines of genetically modified BAF53b mutant mice. Behavioral studies were carried out to assess learning and memory. Electrophysiological studies were carried out to examine long-term potentiation, a form of synaptic plasticity.

To understand what might be causing the effects on long-term memory and long-term potentiation, we examined spine and synapse function.

With hindsight, powered by the explosion of new genomic tools and findings, it is clear that though our approach was very naïve we were able to make some critical neurobiological findings which have guided drug hunting efforts around DISC1 and will allow us to set up a strategy for future targets like ZNF804A. Upon the cloning of DISC1 by Miller, Porteous and colleagues in 2000 we were presented with an 854 amino-acid protein of unknown function. Analysis of the sequence showed the presence of a number of domains likely to mediate protein-protein interactions. Thus our simple approach to understand this proteins function, and we hoped to provide new drug targets for Psychiatric illness, was to identify and characterize DISC1 interacting partners. I will summarize our efforts over the last decade on DISC1, where the ‘DISC1 Interactome’ has proved a very fertile resource for understanding a role for DISC1 in neuronal and glial functions. The importance of these findings for schizophrenia etiology and treatment though still needs to be confirmed. Our experience with DISC1 provides a ‘Road Map for Target Discovery’ where a risk variant is in a gene of unknown function. Matching this descriptor is ZNF804A, which has emerged as a robust schizophrenia gene from GWAS studies, but with little in the way of function known. It is likely a DNA or RNA binding protein and so understanding its impact on the expression of other genes is likely to be important.</p><p id="Par1078"><bold>Methods:</bold> Yeast 2 –hybrid screening on a semi-industrial scale was the core method employed to identify DISC1 interactors. Characterization of critical partners employed standard biochemical methods and most importantly multiple collaborations between industry and academia. Our studies have focused on the role of DISC1 at the synapse, with biochemical and electrophysiological analysis of synapse form and neuronal activity. I will describe the discovery of the DISC1 interactor and kinase TNIK as a key regulator of synapse function and more recent observations of the impact of DISC1 on the function of ionotropic glutamate receptors, which may involve another well known DISC1 partner, PDE4. Simulating the drug discovery pathway for ZNF804A will be performed through analysis of the literature, where some early publications have looked at the impact of ZNF804A on gene expression.</p><p id="Par1079"><bold>Results:</bold> The DISC1 interactome clearly predicted that DISC1 is likely to be involved in a number of cellular processes, but in particular was likely to have a role at glutamatergic synapses. We selected TNIK to scope out DISC1 s role in synapses as it had previously been found in post-synaptic densities in proteomic studies. The role of TNIK in the stability of synapses will be reviewed (see Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2010). More recent data has shown that DISC1 regulates the expression of NMDAR subunits in particular NR2A in both primary neurons and <italic>in vivo</italic> through cAMP dependent mechanisms. Thus DISC1 clearly plays multiple roles at synapses, from regulating a critical synaptic kinase to regulating the levels of NMDAR subunits. These processes, if dysregulated, clearly could play important roles in the etiology of mental illness. Analysis of the ZNF804A transcriptome opens up a number of complex avenues for drug discovery research, which will be discussed.</p><p id="Par1080"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Studies of DISC1, a risk factor for mental illness, which owes its position in the field to its celebrated discovery in a densely impacted pedigree in Scotland, have further exemplified the complexity of mental illness. We were naïve to assume that it would provide easy targets for drug hunting. Within this complexity, in TNIK and PDE4 we were able to highlight druggable targets. The validation and development of either of these will need to overcome the issues of target validation, safety, toxicity and human efficacy which are the challenges faced by all drug discovery programs. We have recently described the evolving ecosystem of psychiatric research in 2013 (Rizzo <italic>et al</italic>, 2013) and will put these targets into this context. This will provide a path forward for new and novel approaches, including those emanating from ZNF804A.</p><p id="Par1081"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> N.

Advanced statistical approaches can enhance biological signal in these postmortem human brain studies by accounting for technical variation and changes in cellular composition, to better functionally integrate epigenetic and transcriptome datasets, which typically consist of millions of measurements per sample.</p><p id="Par1083"><bold>Methods:</bold> Microarray-based gene expression, DNA methylation, and genetic variation were measured in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in 410 post-mortem human brain samples, consisting of 229 non-psychiatric adult controls and 181 patients with schizophrenia. We estimated the relative abundance of neurons using our genome-wide DNA methylation combined with publicly-available NeuN-sorted data (Kaminsky 2013) using a recently published regression method (Houseman 2012). We isolated the genomic data in and around <italic>DISC1</italic> and <italic>ZNF804A</italic>, two genes identified in large clinical genetics studies, and identified relationships between DNA methylation, gene expression, genetic variation, and illness.

Allelic variation at rs1344706, the most robust GWAS-positive SNP in <italic>ZNF804A</italic>, also has been associated with expression of full-length <italic>ZNF804A</italic> in human brain [Riley B, <italic>et al.</italic> 2010]. Studies of its mouse homologue, <italic>ZNF804A</italic>, suggest that this gene plays an important role in early brain development, including neurite outgrowth, and axonal and dendritic arborization [Hill MJ, <italic>et al.</italic> 2011]. A recent study of schizophrenia-derived induced pluripotent stem cells showed the expression of <italic>ZNF804A</italic> dramatically increased during the transition from a pluripotent stem cell to a neuronal precursor [Pedrosa E, <italic>et al.</italic> 2011]. The authors concluded that abnormally high expression of <italic>ZNF804A</italic> may occur in schizophrenia patients in early brain development.</p><p id="Par1093"><bold>Methods:</bold> Best estimates suggested that 90% of multi-exon genes, including <italic>ZNF804A</italic>, undergo alternative splicing. Using RNA sequencing, 5′ cDNA RACE and end-to-end PCR in the postmortem human brain, we have defined the transcriptome of <italic>ZNF804A</italic>. Next, we characterized the developmental expression pattern of the full length and truncated <italic>ZNF804A</italic> transcripts in 672 human samples from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ranging in age from 14 gestational weeks to 97 years using q-rtPCR. Finally, we studied transcript expression in three diagnostic groups (patients with schizophrenia (<italic>n</italic>=169), bipolar disorder (<italic>n</italic>=57), and major depression (<italic>n</italic>=133)) as well as normal controls (<italic>n</italic>=198).</p><p id="Par1094"><bold>Results:</bold> In addition tp confirming the previously known full-length transcript from <italic>ZNF804A</italic>, we also identified a novel truncated transcript that was composed of a novel exon 3 and exon 4. The trajectory of expression of the truncated transcript and the full-length transcript were similar across the lifespan. Both rose during the second trimester in the fetus and then fell after birth. The expression of the two <italic>ZNF804A</italic> transcripts showed heterogeneity in the DLPFC of patients with schizophrenia and affective disorders. The expression of full length <italic>ZNF804A</italic> was significantly decreased in the DLPFC of patients with bipolar disorder (<italic>p</italic>=0.0001). The truncated transcript was down regulated in the patients with schizophrenia (<italic>p</italic>=0.04), but up regulated in the patients with bipolar disorder (<italic>p</italic>=0.03) and MDD (<italic>p</italic>=3.59 × E-14). In a previous study from our group, there was no difference in the expression of <italic>ZNF804A</italic> in the patients with schizophrenia, but that assay measured both transcripts together. Finally, a polymorphism in <italic>ZNF804A</italic> at rs1344706 was associated with the expression of truncated transcript in patients with bipolar disorder (<italic>p</italic>=0.02), as well as in fetal controls (<italic>p</italic>=0.03).</p><p id="Par1095"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Both the full length and truncated transcripts from <italic>ZNF804A</italic> may be in important in brain development as they are most highly expressed in the second trimester fetus.

In parallel, heightened reward sensitivity is reported in adults with bipolar spectrum disorders (BPSD: bipolar I, bipolar II, bipolar NOS, cyclothymic disorder). Altered functional coupling (eg, functional connectivity, FC) between the posterior insula and reward circuitry may thus reflect a pathophysiologic process for heightened reward sensitivity in BPSD. Yet, no study has examined this in adults or youth. We aimed to determine whether distinct patterns of FC between insula and prefrontal cortical-amygdala-ventral striatal reward circuitry were associated with BPSD in youth.</p><p id="Par1104"><bold>Methods:</bold> 85 youth were recruited from the Longitudinal Assessment of Mania Study (LAMS), assessing youth with several behavioral and emotional dysregulation diagnoses (BPSD, depressive disorders, ADHD, disruptive behavior disorders (DBD), anxiety disorders), from three sites: Case Western Reserve University (<italic>n</italic>=25); Cincinnati Children's Hospital (<italic>n</italic>=31); and University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (<italic>n</italic>=29). 33 youth had a BPSD diagnosis (comorbid diagnoses included the other disorders above). 52 youth were without a BPSD diagnosis, but had one or more of the following disorders: anxiety disorders, ADHD, DBD, and depressive disorders. All participants completed a monetary reward, number guessing task with win, loss and no change (control) outcomes during neuroimaging. Analyses were in 2 stages. Psychophysiological Interaction analysis first examined FC within a large bilateral region of interest (ROI) mask that included key reward circuitry regions: bilateral ventral striatum (VS), insula, amygdala, and orbitofrontal, ventrolateral prefrontal, middle prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices, in all LAMS youth to win (<italic>vs</italic> control) and loss (<italic>vs</italic> control).

While classically considered a limbic region, recent evidence from network analysis suggests a critical role for the insula, particularly the anterior division, in high-level cognitive control and attentional processes.</p><p id="Par1109"><bold>Methods:</bold> I will first review new data that are leading to a reconceptualization of insula architecture, connectivity and function. The crucial insight from these studies I will present is that the anterior insula is an integral hub in mediating dynamic interactions between other large-scale brain networks involved in externally oriented attention and internally oriented or self-related cognition. The model I present postulates that the insula is sensitive to salient events, and that its core function is to mark such events for additional processing and initiate appropriate control signals.</p><p id="Par1110"><bold>Results:</bold> The anterior insula and the anterior cingulate cortex form a ‘salience network’ that functions to segregate the most relevant among internal and extrapersonal stimuli in order to guide behavior. Within the framework of our network model, the disparate functions ascribed to the insula can be conceptualized by a few basic mechanisms: (1) bottom-up detection of salient events, (2) switching between other large-scale networks to facilitate access to attention and working memory resources when a salient event is detected, (3) interaction of the anterior and posterior insula to modulate autonomic reactivity to salient stimuli, and (4) strong functional coupling with the anterior cingulate cortex that facilitates rapid access to the motor system. In this manner, with the insula as its integral hub, the salience network assists target brain regions in the generation of appropriate behavioral responses to salient stimuli. I will present findings from a recent study which shows how that insula function is impaired in children with autism and demonstrate that insula connectivity has good sensitivity and predictive ability as a potential biomarker of autism (Uddin <italic>et al.</italic> 2013, <italic>JAMA Psychiatry</italic>).</p><p id="Par1111"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> I conclude by proposing a systems framework which provides a parsimonious account of insula function in neurotypical adults, and suggest that it can be used to conceptualize why insula dysfunction is a prominent feature of several psychiatric disorders.

PTSD neuroimaging studies have identified functional differences in the amygdala and insular cortex during emotion processing. Childhood maltreatment (CM) is a strong risk factor for development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) upon adult exposure to extreme adverse events. However, the neural underpinnings of this relationship are not well understood. In this presentation, human functional MRI data will be presented from studies in women with intimate partner violence-related PTSD that underscore the importance of insula-amygdala functional connectivity in PTSD and consider a role for CM in these findings.</p><p id="Par1114"><bold>Methods:</bold> Dr. Stein will provide a brief overview of preclinical lesion and clinical morphometric and functional neuroimaging studies suggesting that altered amygdala- and/or hippocampal connectivity to insular cortex may underlie aspects of the clinical syndrome of PTSD and related conditions. He will then present fMRI data from studies in women with IPV-related conducted in collaboration with Drs. Martin Paulus, Alan Simmons, Robin Aupperle., and Gregory Fonzo. These data include 12 women with IPV-PTSD and 12 nontraumatized comparison women who underwent blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI while completing (1) an emotional face-matching task, and (2) an inhibitory ‘Go-No Go’ task. In addition (3) multivariate regressions examined the relationship of childhood maltreatment to patterns of activation, connectivity, and gray matter volumes.</p><p id="Par1115"><bold>Results:</bold> (1) For the emotional face-matching task, IPV-PTSD subjects relative to comparison subjects displayed significantly increased activation of the anterior insula and amygdala and decreased connectivity among the anterior insula, amygdala, and ACC while matching to fearful versus happy target faces. (2) Data for the Go-No Go Task are currently being analyzed and will be presented at the meeting. (3) Childood maltreatment (CM) severity was positively correlated with limbic-prefrontal connectivity while processing fear faces but negatively correlated with amygdalo-insular connectivity while processing fear and angry faces.</p><p id="Par1116"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Women with IPV-PTSD display hyperactivity and disconnection among affective and limbic sensory systems while processing threat-related emotion.

We are currently testing whether these findings from a candidate gene level extend to genome wide data. When analyzing expression quantitative trait loci moderated by early trauma, we found that the SNPs (<italic>N</italic>=497) interacting with child abuse to predict gene expression levels after correction for multiple testing, also interacted with child abuse to predict DNA methylation pattern in the same loci in over 97%.

Sullivan<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec665"><title>New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York</title><p id="Par1124"><bold>Background:</bold> Children learn to attach to the caregiver, even when experiencing abuse. We explore unique attributes of the learning attachment system in infant rodents to better understand how the brain supports this learning. Our previous work showed that the amygdala's learning plasticity is suppressed during attachment learning with an abusive caregiver. Here we present data indicating that, although the amygdala is not supporting fear learning, it is responding to the trauma and organizing to produce later-life pathology associated with malfunctioning amygdala.</p><p id="Par1125"><bold>Methods:</bold> Infant rats pups were either reared with a maltreating mother for natural attachment learning or classically conditioned in an experimentally controlled attachment learning paradigm that included pain (odor-0.5 mA shock) or no pain (odor-tactile stimulation). These procedures produce a maternal odor that pups require to interact with the mother. Controls included rearing with a typical mother and controls that do not learn the maternal odor (presentations of rewards unpaired with the odor). Social behaviors and neural activity (microarray, microdialysis, electrophysiology, 2-DG autoradiography) were assessed in pups and older animals to explore short-term and enduring effects.</p><p id="Par1126"><bold>Results:</bold> The short-term effects of pups experiencing pain within attachment (abusive mother, learning the maternal odor with pain) seem minimal since pups showed attachment to the caregiver and the amygdala did not participate in behaviour—similarly to that expressed by controls. While this attachment system ensures infants attach to their caregiver regardless of the quality of care received, the long-term effects indicate these early-life experiences with maltreatment have costs. Amygdala and behavioural abnormalities emerge around weaning and continue into adulthood. However, presentation of the early life maternal odor (natural and learned) appears to normalize both the behaviour and amygdala.</p><p id="Par1127"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Together, these data suggest that the attachment system in the brain is robust and supports attachment learning in myriad contexts, including pain. While there are short-term benefits, the long-term effects appear to go beyond normal programming and initiate a pathway to pathology and non-adaptive behaviors. Furthermore, learning in early life appears to be retained with the early life odors retaining strong ability to modify and normalize non-adaptive amygdala related behaviors into adulthood.</p><p id="Par1128"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> R.

We measured transcriptome-wide gene expression in all 48 samples using microarray technology.

While Ce metabolism did not meet whole-brain bonferroni multiple comparison correction, heritability in regions of Ce survived FDR multiple comparison correction (q</p><p id="Par1132"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Taken together, these data highlight the utility of the monkey AT model for identifying potential therapeutic targets and support the hypothesis that early-life experience and learning can impact AT and its neural substrates via neuroplasticity-related gene expression in the Ce.</p><p id="Par1133"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> A.

Nemeroff<sup>*</sup></title><sec id="Sec671"><title>University of Miami Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida</title><p id="Par1134"><bold>Background:</bold> There is now unequivocal evidence that early life adverse events including childhood sexual, physical and emotional abuse, as well as emotional neglect, interacts with genetic polymorphisms and epigenetic mechanisms to dramatically increase vulnerability to mood (depression and bipolar disorder), psychotic (schizophrenia) and anxiety (PTSD) disorders. In order to attain one of our major goals, namely to develop early interventions that prevent the now increasingly well documented clinical consequences of early life trauma, we need to better understand the cascade of neurobiological sequelae and the molecular mechanisms underlying such changes.</p><p id="Par1135"><bold>Methods:</bold> This presentation will highlight recent structural and functional brain imaging alterations using magnetic resonance imaging in adult victims of child abuse and neglect. In addition persistent neuroendocrine alterations, particularly of the HPA axis, that have been observed in patients with depression and early life trauma will be described. Finally novel candidate genes have been identified that appear to mediate, in part, the vulnerability of patients exposed to early adverse events, to depression and PTSD as adults. Finally neuropsychological testing has revealed relatively specific cognitive alterations in patients as a function of the nature of the abuse they endured.</p><p id="Par1136"><bold>Results:</bold> In the structural imaging studies, region specific alterations in cerebrocortical areas including thinning of the somatosensory cortex encoding for genital sensation was observed in women who were sexually abused during childhood. Alterations in the anterior cingulate were observed in patients exposed to emotional abuse in childood. Functional brain imaging studies revealed significant alterations in response to provocative stimuli in patient with early life trauma histories. In neuroendocrine studies, persistent alterations in HPA activity has been observed using provocative tests in men and women with a history of child abuse and neglect. Some of the genes comprising the HPA axis and related systems have been found to mediate the depressogenic and anxiogenic effects of early life trauma and new data on the oxytocin system will be presented. Long lasting neurocognitive alterations in response to physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect were documented using the CANTAB battery.</p><p id="Par1137"><bold>Conclusions:</bold> With the rapid accumulation of these findings of persistent CNS alterations in individuals exposed to untoward early life events, we can begin to turn our attention to both prevention and treatment strategies. It is now well established in several studies that in depressed patients, those with a positive child abuse history, exhibit a diminished response to antidepressants compared to equally depressed patients without such a history. The unique neurobiological consequences of child abuse and neglect produce a distinctive endophenotype that likely requires a novel treatment strategy based on the emerging neurobiological findings.</p><p id="Par1138"><bold>Disclosure:</bold> C.
