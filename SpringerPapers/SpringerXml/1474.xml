However, the levelised cost of green hydrogen (LCOH) is presently not competitive with fossil fuels. This is due to the high capital expenditure (CAPEX) and high operational expenditure (OPEX) of present-day water electrolysers. The OPEX is, by far, the larger component of LCOH and it is dominated by the overall energy efficiency of the water electrolyser and the cost of the input renewable electricity to which it applies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. At sub-MW scale, state-of-the-art commercial water electrolysers typically require ~53 kWh of electricity to produce 1 kg of hydrogen, which contains 39.4 kWh of energy, according to its higher heating value (HHV)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Of that, the electrolysis cell, which is ~83% energy efficient (HHV) at the operating current density, consumes ~47.5 kWh, with the engineering system, known as the balance-of-plant, consuming the remaining ~5.5 kWh<sup>2</sup>. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) has set a 2050 target<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> to decrease cell energy consumption to &lt;42 kWh/kg. Any improvements in net energy efficiency create a proportionally equivalent decrease in the levelised cost of the produced hydrogen (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">This work introduces a unique concept of water electrolysis that promises notably reduced CAPEX and OPEX compared to conventional water electrolysers, making renewable hydrogen more cost-competitive with fossil fuels.</p><p id="Par7">Inspired by the historic evolution of water electrolysis cells, which recently culminated in asymmetric polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) cells that directly produce one of the gases in a gas collection chamber rather than bubbling through the liquid electrolyte<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, we have developed a capillary-fed electrolysis (CFE) cell concept in which both gases are produced directly in gas collection chambers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The aqueous electrolyte is constantly supplied to the electrodes by a spontaneous capillary action in the porous, hydrophilic, inter-electrode separator. The bottom end of the separator is dipped in a reservoir, resulting in capillary-induced, upward, in-plane, movement of electrolyte. Porous gas diffusion electrodes are held against opposite sides of the separator, above the level of the electrolyte. The electrodes draw in liquid laterally from the separator and are covered with a thin layer of the electrolyte. The application of sufficient voltage between the electrodes results in the electrolysis of water, which is continuously replenished by water moving up the separator from the reservoir. Because the generated hydrogen and oxygen gases readily migrate through the thin layer of liquid electrolyte covering their respective electrodes, the capillary-fed cell concept provides for bubble-free electrolysis in which water is converted directly to the bulk gases without forming gas bubbles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Conceptualisation of the Capillary-Fed Electrolysis (CFE) cell.</title><p>Inspired by the historic evolution of water electrolysis cell architectures culminating in the direct production of one of the gases, the Capillary-Fed Electrolysis cell directly produces both gases. Liquid electrolyte is continuously drawn up the separator by a capillary effect, from a reservoir at the bottom of the cell. The porous, hydrophilic separator sustains the flow rate required for water electrolysis.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2022_28953_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par8">In so doing, the cell avoids bubbles masking the electrodes and maintains access to the catalytic sites on the electrodes. This includes access to the most active crevice, cleft and defect sites that are the first to be blocked by bubble formation, sometimes permanently so<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. It also ensures that water flow to an electrode does not counteract gas flow away from the electrode, thereby avoiding the counter multiphase flows inherent in conventional water electrolysers and their associated mass transport limitations. In diminishing the energy needed to overcome such inefficiencies, the capillary-fed cell realises significantly improved energy efficiency.</p><p id="Par9">It is also important to assess whether new cell configurations increase or decrease the complexity (i.e. the energy consumption and CAPEX) of the balance-of-plant. In the case of CFE cells, notable simplifications in the balance-of-plant are apparent. The absence of gas bubbles and associated gas-liquid froth formation in the cell stack, removes the need for liquid circulation, eliminating the gas-liquid separator tanks normally required and their piping, pumps, and fittings (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). The high energy efficiency, further, permits air-cooling, or radiative self-cooling, eliminating need for water-cooled chillers (Supplementary Tables <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). The small volumes of liquid electrolyte in each cell reservoir decrease the overall volume of water required (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Unwanted and wasteful shunt currents found in conventional alkaline water electrolysers, may also be avoided. These simplifications in the balance-of-plant lead to downward pressure on electrolyser CAPEX.</p><p id="Par10">The capillary-induced flow of aqueous 27 wt% KOH electrolyte up a saturated, hydrophilic, porous, polyether sulfone (PES) separator is initially measured and modelled, demonstrating its ability to indefinitely support water electrolysis at 1 A cm<sup>−2</sup> and ≥80 °C for a height of up to 18 cm. This height restriction, which is created by gravity, is taken into account here, although it may in future be avoided by locating the reservoir at the top of the separator.</p><p id="Par11">In this work we show that a capillary-fed cell, employing a known NiFeOOH oxygen evolution electrocatalyst on the anode and Pt/C hydrogen evolution electrocatalyst on the cathode, tested at 80–85 °C with 27 wt% KOH electrolyte, yields water electrolysis with performance that exceeds conventional, bubbled control cells, and commercial alkaline and PEM cells. Faradaic efficiencies approach 100%, with low gas crossover.

The present work sought to replicate this arrangement to make fair comparisons with commercial cells. This was done by combining the bipolar plate and conducting gas diffusion layer into a thick sheet of Ni with many small holes to allow evolved gases to exit (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>). This bipolar plate/flow field structure was housed within a gas chamber that could be sealed to the external environment. Leak-tight bolts through the walls of the gas chambers were used to press the bipolar plates and their attached electrodes against the polyether sulfone separator (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">6</xref>).

This equates to a decrease in the cell resistance of 120 mΩ cm<sup>2</sup>, which can be almost entirely attributed to the lower ionic resistance of the polyether sulfone separator compared to Zirfon PERL UTP 500 at 80 °C (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>).</p><p id="Par33">Following operation, a contact resistance was found to have developed between the anode and its bipolar plate.

The anodes of the capillary-fed cells had been welded to their bipolar plates for the same reason.

A BioLogic VSP potentiostat was used. The lower voltage of −1.0 V allowed for inclusion of a PTFE dispersion, without precipitation; the upper voltage of −0.2 V was found to provide the best catalytic performance. A dispersion of PTFE could be incorporated into the anode by including the equivalent of 10 g L<sup>−1</sup> PTFE in the electrocoating solution. Following electrodeposition, the working electrode was rinsed with deionised water and dried at room temperature.

OPEX is, by far, the major component of the LCOH for the following reason: Fig. ES1 in this reference provides an average electrolyser CAPEX (today) of USD$770 per 1 kW capacity. Over 10 years of continuous operation the electricity consumed by that 1 kW capacity, which will comprise most of the OPEX, will be: 24 × 365 × 10 = 1,752,000 kWh. At the average electricity price of USD$53/MWh, this gives a total OPEX of at least USD$91,104, which is 118-times larger than the CAPEX. The dominance of the OPEX over the CAPEX in the LCOH is projected to increase. Using the best future CAPEX of USD$130/kW and electricity price of USD$20/MWh over 10 years of continuous operation: the OPEX of USD$35,040 will be 270-times larger than the CAPEX.
