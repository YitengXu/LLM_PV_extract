The plant is integrated in the anode of the microbial fuel cell which consists of a bed of graphite granules. In the anode, organic compounds deposited by plant roots are oxidized by electrochemically active bacteria. In this research, salt marsh species <italic>Spartina anglica</italic> generated current for up to 119 days in a plant microbial fuel cell. Maximum power production was 100 mW m<sup>−2</sup> geometric anode area, highest reported power output for a plant microbial fuel cell. Cathode overpotential was the main potential loss in the period of oxygen reduction due to slow oxygen reduction kinetics at the cathode. Ferricyanide reduction improved the kinetics at the cathode and increased current generation with a maximum of 254%. In the period of ferricyanide reduction, the main potential loss was transport loss. This research shows potential application of microbial fuel cell technology in salt marshes for bio-energy production with the plant microbial fuel cell.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Plant microbial fuel cell</kwd><kwd>Rhizodeposition</kwd><kwd>Bio-energy</kwd><kwd><italic>Spartina anglica</italic></kwd><kwd>Potential losses</kwd><kwd>Green electricity</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>19</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2010</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Springer-Verlag</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2010</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2010</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/253_2010_Article_2440.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2010</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>18</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2010</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>17</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Microbiology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Microbial Genetics and Genomics</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biotechnology</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Biomedical and Life Sciences</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nowadays, the need for sustainable renewable energy is urgent due to depletion of fossil fuels, increasing energy consumption, climate change, and environmental pollution. Current production processes for bio-energy such as bio-ethanol or biodiesel often compete with food production. Competition with food production not only increases food prices and malnourishment (Pimentel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009</xref>) but also increases incentives for deforestation by claiming land for food production or bio-energy crops. Deforestation is the second most important source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world (von Witzke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>). Therefore, to have sustainable renewable energy, there should be no competition with food production. In search for renewable and sustainable bio-energy production, Strik et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>) presented the plant microbial fuel cell (P-MFC). The P-MFC harvests solar energy as electricity by combination of electricity generation by bacteria through oxidation of organic compounds and deposition of organic compounds by plants into the rhizosphere. The aim of the P-MFC is to transform solar energy into electrical energy through oxidation of rhizodeposits by electrochemically active bacteria. Potential electrical output without crop harvesting is 5,800 kWh ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup> (Strik et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>), comparable to conventional renewable bio-energy sources with crop harvesting.</p><p>De Schamphelaire et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>) presented the sediment type P-MFC which consisted of an anode and cathode without membrane separation. The P-MFC as described by Strik et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>) consisted of an anode and cathode separated by a membrane. In the anode, electrochemically active bacteria oxidize rhizodeposits whereby electrons, protons, and CO<sub>2</sub> are produced. Electrons and protons are transferred to the cathode compartment; CO<sub>2</sub> escapes to the atmosphere where it can be used again by plants for photosynthesis. At the cathode electrons, protons, and oxygen are consumed by reduction of oxygen to water. Production and consumption of electrons results in a potential difference between anode and cathode which makes electrons flow through the electrical circuit.</p><p>To avoid competition with agricultural food production, salt marsh species should be tested in the P-MFC, because there is no competition for arable land (Galvani <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>). Until now no salt marsh species was tested in the P-MFC. Furthermore, there is no literature describing biochemical conditions and potential losses in the P-MFC.</p><p>The first objective is to prove long-term electricity generation by <italic>Spartina anglica</italic> in the P-MFC. The second objective is to gain insight in potential losses of the P-MFC as well as biochemical conditions in the anode compartment. To meet both objectives, the <italic>S. anglica</italic> P-MFC was monitored for a period equal to the length of one growth season. One growth season is defined as the period <italic>S. anglica</italic> is able to photosynthesize, which is at temperatures above 7 °C (Gray et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1991</xref>), in the Netherlands in 2008 from mid March to mid November (around 240 days). In this period cell potential, cathode potential, anode potential, membrane potential, pH, and conductivity of the P-MFC were monitored.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental set-up</title><p>The P-MFC consisted of a cathode and an anode separated by a membrane. The cathode consisted of graphite felt in a beaker. The anode consisted of graphite granules in a glass cylinder in which <italic>S. anglica</italic> was planted, and a membrane at the bottom of the glass cylinder. The anode was placed with the membrane on the graphite felt in the cathode and the P-MFC was formed. Strik et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>) described the P-MFC in detail. The current collector was different, here the current collector was a golden wire glued to a Teflon-coated copper wire placed in the anode as well as the cathode. To close the electrical circuit, current collectors were connected over an external resistance of 1,000 Ω.</p><p>The P-MFCs were placed in a cabinet of which both front and back were open. In the cabinet temperature fluctuated between 23–27 °C, humidity was uncontrolled, light intensity in the photosynthetic active region was 261 ± 56 µmole m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, and illumination period was 14 h day<sup>−1</sup>. To provide illumination, metal-halogen lamps (two of 250 W and two of 400 W Spacesaver) were used. On day 154, P-MFCs were moved into a climate control cabinet (Microclima 1750 Snijders). In the climate control cabinet temperature was 25 °C, humidity was 75%, light intensity in the photosynthetic active region was 248 ± 44 µmole m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, and illumination period was 14 h day<sup>−1</sup>.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>) the relation between COD and current generation was Michaelis–Menten like. In this research there was no clear relation between COD concentration and current generation. This could be caused by: (1) the COD concentration did not represent substrate for electrochemically active bacteria, (2) saturation of electrochemically active bacteria with substrate, or (3) limitation by external resistance. Saturation of electrochemically active bacteria with substrate was improbable because the half saturation constant has to be small compared to substrate concentration. Half saturation constants of electrochemically active bacteria for different substrates vary from 111 to 725 mg L<sup>−1</sup> (Catal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>) which is in same order as even lower limits of COD concentration in the anode, hence there was probably no substrate saturation. Limitation of current generation by external resistance was improbable because of high anode potential (−221 ± 275 mV) compared to open cell potential (−369 ± 97 mV). Furthermore, the ratio between the external resistance and internal resistance was 1.5 which indicated that the external resistance was relatively small.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Electricity generation limited by VFA in the anode</title><p>It is improbable that COD concentration in the anode limited current generation as the average COD concentration is in the same range of the half saturation constants (see previous paragraph). However, current generation may be limited by formation of VFA from biodegradable COD. In anoxic environments—such as the anode compartment of the P-MFC—biodegradable organic compounds are degraded via formation of VFAs (Stams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1994</xref>). Low concentrations of VFAs in the anode in combination with relatively high COD concentration in the anode indicated that VFA consumption was faster than VFA formation by degradation of biodegradable COD. In other words, current generation could be limited by conversion of biodegradable COD into VFAs. However, it is not possible to validate the assumption that COD in the anode was biodegradable, therefore, rhizodeposition of biodegradable COD could also have limited current generation. However, this is improbable because biodegradable organic compounds make up a large part of rhizodeposits (Farrar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Acidification of anode compartment as a result of electricity generation</title><p>The production of protons by electricity generation can only result in a decrease of pH when proton production exceeds acid buffer capacity of the anode. The 1/2 Hoagland solution was able to buffer 4 mM of acid. Assumed that 20% (27 mL) of anolyte was refreshed every day, there was an acid buffer capacity in the anode of 0.108 mmol protons per day. Therefore, to saturate the acid buffer capacity, 0.108 mmol of protons had to be produced per day. When electricity was generated there was an average proton production 0.13 ± 0.08 mmol per day, based on stoichiometric ratio of acetate degradation. The average proton production exceeded acid buffer capacity, hence acidification of the anode was the result of electricity generation. Acidification of the anode was expected because in conventional microbial fuel cells the anode acidifies as well due to electricity generation (Rozendal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Fluctuations in anode potential induced by dynamics of root development</title><p>Rhizodeposits consist of a large range of organic compounds (Farrar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2003</xref>), therefore there was probably a mixed potential in the anode. Mixed potential is the average potential of simultaneous reactions of different redox couples or simultaneous oxidation of different organic compounds. Amount and speciation of rhizodeposits is related to the physiological state of individual root and changes with the life cycle of the root (Neuman and Römheld <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2007</xref>). Without doubt there were changes in life cycle of the root which resulted in fluctuation in amount and speciation of rhizodeposits. Fluctuations in amount and speciation of rhizodeposits probably resulted in changes in flux of rhizodeposition and/or rhizodeposition of different organic compounds and therefore fluctuations in anode potential and as a consequence cell potential. Furthermore, <italic>S. anglica</italic> is able to transport a substantial amount of oxygen to their roots via the aerenchyma (Maricle and Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2002</xref>) which results in oxic microzone of up to 2.5 mm around roots due to an oxygen flux from roots into the rhizosphere (Holmer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2002</xref>). Change in life cycle of the root results in change of metabolic consumption of oxygen by the root cells. Change of metabolic consumption result in a change of oxygen concentration in root cells and could therefore result in fluctuations in oxygen flux from the roots into the rhizosphere. Fluctuations in oxygen flux into the rhizosphere could result in fluctuations in the anode potential and as a consequence cell potential.</p><p>Furthermore, activity of electrochemically active bacteria which influenced the anode potential is also be affected by: fluctuations in speciation of substrate (Rabaey and Verstraete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>), fluctuation in the anode potential (Aelterman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>), and oxygen in the anode compartment (Harnisch and Schröder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>). However, it is beyond the scope of this research to fully determine the mechanisms which caused the anode potential to fluctuate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Increase in current generation after decrease of cathode overpotential</title><p>In the period of oxygen reduction the current generation was limited by the VFA concentration. It is therefore surprising that the period of ferric cyanide reduction resulted not only in higher potential but also in a higher current generation. This higher current generation can be explained by the increase of the anode potential that occurred after change to ferric cyanide reduction at the cathode. Anode potential increase can lead to (1) higher activity of electrochemically active bacteria (Aelterman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>) or (2) higher coulombic efficiency (Sleutels et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009b</xref>).</p><p>The activity of electrochemical active bacteria is affected by anode potential Aelterman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2008</xref>) found an optimal anode potential of −200 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl). Therefore, increase of anode potential from −425 to 125 mV (vs. Ag/AgCl) could increase current generation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, day 227 through day 250). Furthermore, the activity of electrochemically active bacteria could be limited by flux of biodegradable and bioavailable rhizodeposits. The flux of biodegradable and bioavailable rhizodeposits could have increased because of a decrease in vitality of <italic>S. anglica</italic>. A decrease in vitality of <italic>S. anglica</italic> could have resulted in an increase of cell membrane permeability of roots and therefore an increase in flux of biodegradable and bioavailable rhizodeposits hence an increased activity of electrochemically active bacteria and thus higher current.</p><p>Sleutels et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009b</xref>) found that an increase in current density results in an increase of coulombic efficiency because of improvement of competitive advantage of electrochemically active bacteria over methanogens. However, our data did not allow to point out the exact cause of increase of current generation after the decrease in cathode overpotential.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Transport loss is main component of membrane potential loss</title><p>To fulfill the requirement of electroneutrality, negative charge transfer due to current generation is balanced by cation transport through the membrane. Anion transport could be neglected because a cation exchange membrane was used. Because there was no forced convection through the membrane transport of a specific cation through the membrane was sum of diffusion and migration. Diffusion is driven by concentration gradient over the membrane; migration is driven by electrostatic force over the membrane which results in transport potential loss. Transport of cations other than protons result in a concentration gradient opposite to the electrostatic force (Harnisch and Schröder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>). Therefore, to fulfill electroneutrality, a large electrostatic force is needed because it needs to overcome the membrane resistance as well as the concentration gradients. The large electrostatic force results in a large membrane potential loss and therefore a large transport loss.</p><p>Contribution of proton transport to charge transfer was probably negligible due to low proton concentration (about 10<sup>−5</sup> M in the anolyte) compared to potassium and calcium concentration (K 0.015 M and Ca<sup>2+</sup> 0.002 M in medium). Proton transport could also be facilitated by phosphate buffer because of a concentration gradient of H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub arrange="stack">4</sub><sup arrange="stack">−</sup> to the membrane (Fan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2007</xref>). However, facilitated proton transfer was improbable because diffusion of H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub arrange="stack">4</sub><sup arrange="stack">−</sup> to the membrane was small due to the graphite bed in the anode compartment which made diffusion distance large. Furthermore, the negative charge on the membrane surface repelled H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub arrange="stack">4</sub><sup arrange="stack">−</sup>. It is important to realize that even when protons were transported a large electrostatic force is needed fulfill electroneutrality because diffusion will be small due to the small concentration gradient of protons. Furthermore, a larger proton concentration gradient would not result in a lower membrane potential loss. A large proton gradient would give a high diffusion flux which eliminates the need of an additional electrostatic force for migration. However, this large proton gradient leads to an additional pH gradient loss, counteracting the decrease in electrostatic force needed for migration. Overall this would not lead to a substantial decrease of membrane potential loss.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><sec><p>This research was funded by Senternovem, the Dutch governmental agency for sustainability and innovation from the Ministry of Economic Affairs (grant no.
