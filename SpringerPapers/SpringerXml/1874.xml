challenges that the world faces today is providing clean and sustainable energy to future generations. With a growing population and increasing economic development throughout the world, there is an ever-increasing need and stress on energy production. Every sector of human life is now energy dependent, be it for transportation, or electricity demands or heating and cooling system. From 1971 to 2012, the world’s total energy supply increased from 6106 Mtoes (megatons of oil equivalent energy) to 13,371 Mtoes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>••], while the total consumption of energy almost doubled, from 4672 to 8979 Mtoes. Meanwhile, the world’s consumption of electricity almost quadrupled during this same period, from 6129 TWh (terawatt hours) to 22,668 TWh. In 2012, 81.7 % of the global total primary energy supply, 67.9 % of global electricity generation, and 78.3 % of global total final consumption were met by fossil fuels. With the world population expected to continue to rise from about 7 billion today (2015) to about 9.6 billion in 2050, the demand for energy will continue to increase. The corresponding increase in energy and transportation needs and their major dependence on fossil fuels create several major problems that need to be dealt with over the coming decades, for example, the effects of fossil fuel emissions on climate and on air quality, and an uneven distribution of fossil fuels and other energy sources leading to a growing dependence in some countries on others for energy availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>••].</p><p id="Par3">Many of the pertinent environmental issues today, such as local and regional air pollution, acid precipitation (also called acid rain), and global climate change (or global warming as it gets called by the media), can be traced primarily to emissions from the use of fossil fuels for different energy and transportation sectors. Air quality is most strongly affected by some of the short-lived species like carbon monoxide (CO), different oxides of nitrogen (NO + NO<sub>2</sub> = NO<italic>x</italic>), sulfur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and various atmospheric particles (also called aerosols). The particles of most concern are those that can lodge deeply into the lungs; these are primarily the particles of less than 2.5 μm in diameter (called PM2.5) that are primarily produced from gases like SO<sub>2</sub>, but also includes black carbon (soot) and other very fine particles. Some of the pollutants like NO<italic>x</italic> and VOCs are especially important for forming ozone, a key component of urban smog, whereas SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<italic>x</italic> and other gases can produce particles that also lead to environmental concerns from acid rain. A variety of gases and particles, especially the long-lived gases like carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O), and various chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other halocarbons, are of special concern to the changes occurring in the Earth’s climate system. The CFCs and other halocarbons have also been the primary sources of observed decreases in stratospheric ozone that are now in the process of being controlled through the international Montreal Protocol to Protect the Stratospheric Ozone Layer.</p><p id="Par4">Some of the atmospheric pollutants are directly emitted into the atmosphere from various anthropogenic and natural activities, and can have direct effects on the environment, while others are formed from secondary reactions (and from other processes, e.g., the nucleation of aerosols) in the atmosphere. Emissions from vehicles are the primary source of CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, NO<italic>x</italic>, and human-related VOCs, while electric utilities and industry are important sources for CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, NO<italic>x</italic>, VOCs, and SO<sub>2</sub>. VOCs are not only emitted from the sources mentioned above, they are also emitted from natural sources. O<sub>3</sub> is a secondary pollutant formed in the atmosphere from photochemical reactions, especially between NO<italic>x</italic> and VOCs. The local and regional air pollutants like ozone and the particles (PM2.5) can significantly affect human health through the cardio-vascular and pulmonary system, causing shortness of breath, asthma, other issues—these effects are particularly harmful for children and the elderly.</p><p id="Par5">The major sources of PM2.5 are biomass burning and fossil fuel combustion. Almost all of the aerosols in the atmosphere have heterogeneous composition and are composed of inorganic and organic components. Ammonium nitrate, sulfate, and chloride mostly make up the inorganic fraction. The particles are formed due to the reaction between NH<sup>+4</sup> (mostly resulting from anthropogenic activities like use of fertilizer or from animal husbandry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]) and SO<sup>−4</sup> (from oxidation of SO<sub>2</sub> mostly emitted from coal-burning power plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]), NO<sup>−3</sup> (formed from oxidation of NO<italic>x</italic> emitted from fossil fuel combustion and biomass burning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]), or with Cl<sup>−</sup> (from sea spray or from hydrochloric acid emitted from incinerators or power plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]). The second major component making up the aerosols is the carbonaceous fraction that includes black carbon aerosols (BC) and organic aerosols (OA) that contain carbon along with hydrogen and oxygen. Organic aerosols have both natural biogenic sources and human-related emissions like biomass burning and meat cooking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). OA can also form in the atmosphere due to complex chemical reaction involving VOCs and subsequent gas to particle conversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], thus forming secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Organic carbon (OC) is the fraction of carbon in organic aerosol excluding the associated hydrogen and oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Black carbon or soot is the other carbonaceous fraction of aerosol and is formed during combustion processes.</p><p id="Par6">According to estimates made by the World Health Association (WHO), about 7 million people die each year as a result of their exposure to air pollution (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/air-pollution/en/</ext-link>). This estimate is more than twice larger than prior estimates because of stronger links to heart disease and strokes. This corresponds to roughly one in 8 of total global deaths per year. Over half of these, about 3.7 million (in 2012) are related to outdoor air pollution. WHO also states that this confirms that air pollution is now the world’s largest single environmental health risk. Countries with the highest risks include China, with over 1.2 million deaths per year from outdoor air pollution, mostly related to exposure to particulate matter and India, with over 600,000 deaths per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>••].</p><p id="Par7">Ambient particulate matter pollution remains in the top 10 risk factors associated with Disability Associated Life Years in the USA but declined by 35 % since 1990 (US Burden of Disease Collaborators, 2013) and is one of the major air pollutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], causing negative effects on human health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], impairing visibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and affecting climate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Recent studies still suggest that there are about 200,000 outdoor air pollution related premature deaths in the USA each year related to PM2.5 and another 10,000 due to changes in ambient levels of ozone, with the primary source of emissions coming from combustion of fossil fuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between energy production, and the associated use of fossil fuels, and resulting effects on air pollution. In the process, we examine a clean energy future imagined in this case for 2050 and then to consider the resulting effects on air quality. The next section looks into the current energy use portfolio and its impact on air quality in the USA and worldwide. This is followed with a discussion of projections of future energy needs and scenarios for the corresponding emissions of air pollutants. Finally, we examine scenarios for a clean energy future and the resulting implications on future emissions of air pollutants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Current Energy and Resulting Pollutant Emissions and Concentrations</title><p id="Par9">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows a conceptual diagram of key components in the global energy system. Shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> are conventional sources of energy from fossil fuels, e.g., from coal, natural gas, and oil, and alternate sources of energy such as biomass burning, nuclear power, and renewable sources (which includes a number of different possibilities including wind, solar, hydroelectricity, and geothermal). The resulting energy produced is used in a variety of different sectors including industry, homes, office buildings, and transportation (which includes road vehicles, trains, ships, and others). A major factor in this system is the generation of pollutants, especially emissions that affect air quality and climate change, plus other environmental concerns listed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The use of fossil fuels is by far the largest source of air pollutants but biomass burning also contributes to the production of CO, NO<italic>x</italic>, VOCs, and some other pollutants.

The global electricity supply sector accounts for about 80 % of the total human-related CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Energy production, industry, transportation, and buildings account for 47, 30, 11, and 3 % rise, respectively, in GHG emission from 2000 to 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>••]. Coal-fired power plants have been the primary source of pollutant emissions from the power production sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>••].</p><p id="Par11">About 40 % of US energy is used in the private, commercial, and institutional activities associated with residential and commercial buildings while roughly 30 % is used in industries and another 30 % in transport of goods and passengers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Transportation accounts for 29 % of total global energy consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>••]. At present the transportation sector depends primarily on fossil fuel burning, especially oil consumption through gasoline and diesel fuel. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), mobile sources, including both on-road sources and non-road sources are major emitters of pollutants in the U.S. Mobile sources are also one the major contributor to air toxics. Gasoline is one of the major contributors of benzene emission. EPA identified that emissions from vehicles contributed to about 21 of the 188 identified hazardous air pollutants.</p><p id="Par12">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the emissions of different air pollutants for the USA and the world from different energy sectors, including stationary sources (like fuel combustion in electrical utilities and industries), industries, and transportation (including both highway and non-highway vehicles). In the USA, fossil fuels account for 90 % of all energy production and use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and contributed to about 87, 3, and 14 % of SO<sub>2</sub>, VOC, and PM2.5 emissions, respectively (adapted from the National Emission Inventory of air pollutants in 2010 by EPA, <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.epa.gov/ttnchie1/trends/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.epa.gov/ttnchie1/trends/</ext-link>). States with larger areas, larger populations, and more intensive energy industries typically use more energy (EAP, 2012). The transportation sector also contributes greatly to pollutant emissions, about 53, 23, 57, and 6 % respectively to total CO, VOC, NO<italic>x</italic>, and PM2.5 emissions in the USA. The US damages from the transportation sector are about $56 million in health and from coal and natural gas are $62 billion and $740 million, respectively, due to emissions of criteria pollutants, not including the effects on climate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

This resulted primarily from a shift to cleaner technologies (control measures applied on vehicular emissions and on industries like chemical plants, dry cleaners, coke ovens, and incinerators). Despite this reduction, millions of people in the USA still live in counties that exceed one or more of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

Without major control measures, the world’s energy demand will likely continue to increase, with estimates of about 22 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] from 2010 to 2035. Existing control measures are definitely not sufficient to reduce air pollution enough to greatly reduce health concerns.

The science is clear that climate change is not just a problem for the future, it is happening now across the world, and we are already being affected by changing trends in certain types of severe weather and by the rising sea level. Analyses of past changes in climate show that the recent changes are occurring over 10 times faster than past natural changes. The scientific evidence also clearly points to the emissions from the burning of fossil fuels used for transportation and energy as being the primary cause of the changes in climate observed over at least the last five decades.</p><p id="Par15">The changing climate is already affecting humanity and our economies in many ways.

Large reductions in global emissions of the heat-trapping gases could avoid some of the damaging impacts of climate change. Just as importantly, countries and their local communities that adapt and prepare for the range of climate change impacts can prevent needless harm.</p><p id="Par16">Air quality and climate change are interlinked in a variety of ways. Emissions of both long-lived pollutants like CO<sub>2</sub> and methane, and short-lived climate forcing pollutants like black carbon and SO<sub>2</sub> need to be addressed if we want to really mitigate or slow down the amount of future climate change. At the same time, reducing emissions that affect climate would also reduce the concerns about air quality. Coordinated action on both climate change and air quality is necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>••].</p><p id="Par17">Climate change will continue—global emissions and concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and other heat-trapping gases continue to rise. Choices made now and in the next few decades about emissions from fossil fuel use and land use change will determine the amount of additional future warming over this century and beyond. How much climate will change depends on (1) human activities and resulting emissions and (2) how sensitive the climate is to those changes (that is, the response of global temperature to a change in radiative forcing caused by human emissions). Uncertainties in how the economy will evolve, what types of energy will be used, and how our cities, buildings, and vehicles will evolve all limit the ability to make accurate projections of future changes in climate. As a result, scenarios—plausible projections of what might happen—have been developed for a range of different assumptions. These scenarios describe possible futures in terms of population, economic development, energy sources, technology, lifestyle choices, heat-trapping gas emissions, atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide, and/or global temperature change.</p><p id="Par18">On the global scale, climate model simulations show consistent projections of future conditions under a range of emission scenarios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The most commonly used sets of scenarios used in these studies are those from the 2000 IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] and the 2010 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The latter were used in the latest international climate assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Comparing carbon dioxide concentrations and global temperature change between the SRES and RCP scenarios, the high SRES A1FI scenario is similar to RCP8.5, the middle scenario SRES A1B to RCP6.0, and the low scenario SRES B1 to RCP4.5. The RCP2.6 scenario is much lower than any SRES scenario because it includes the option of using policies to significantly reduce emissions and also requires net negative carbon dioxide emissions in the later decades of this century where CO<sub>2</sub> would need to be removed from the atmosphere, while the SRES scenarios do not attempt such a policy requirement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The high scenarios assume continued heavy use of fossil fuels while the lower scenarios assume different rates of movement towards alternative energy sources.</p><p id="Par19">As has been shown in a number of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], the warmer summer climates throughout much of the world will lead to more concerns about ozone production.

Addition of biofuel additives to gasoline and diesel vehicles is a common practice to reduce tailpipe emissions. The addition of biofuels to gasoline and diesel engines reduces CO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and VOC emissions (because of the presence of more oxygenated fuels), but does not show any appreciable change in NO<italic>x</italic> emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Natural gas vehicles have been shown to improve air quality by reducing particulate emissions and photochemical smog.

Although biofuels additives and CNG engines may reduce tailpipe emission to a certain extent, the overall energy production is still fossil fuel based, and their use does not eliminate emissions of all key pollutants.</p><p id="Par28">Another method is to shift to hybrid and/or electric and/or hydrogen fueled vehicles. Electric vehicles use electrical energy stored in rechargeable batteries and other energy storage devices, hybrid vehicles combine internal combustion engines with electric motors, and hydrogen-fueled vehicles use either hydrogen fuel cells or hydrogen in internal combustion engines as an energy source. Electrification of the vehicles will address three important environmental issues: (a) reduction of GHG emissions; (b) reduction of tail pipe emissions affecting air quality; and (c) reduction of gasoline consumption, which will reduce air pollutant emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Plug in hybrid vehicles uses electricity from the grid to power a portion of the vehicle use, but there is still use of petroleum-based fuels.

At present a conventional vehicle emits 100–150 g of CO<sub>2</sub>/km whereas a hybrid vehicle achieves about 90 g of CO<sub>2</sub>/km.

Hydrogen itself is not a primary energy source but it can be produced in fuel cells through catalysis or burned in internal combustion engines to supply electricity to the cars. Hydrogen gas can be extracted in various ways, from many conventional sources like coal and biomass, or from clean sources like water, wind, or solar power. Since it can be extracted from both renewable and non-renewable sources, it would be easy to incorporate it into an existing energy structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>].

Alternate sources of energy like nuclear power, and renewable power sources like hydroelectricity, wind, solar, and geothermal, and even to some extent biomass burning, have the potential to provide energy with greatly reduced pollutant emissions, thus improving air quality and also mitigating GHG production. It has been estimated that to keep further changes in climate below 2 °C throughout the twenty-first century, the cumulative carbon emission between 2011 and 2050 have to be limited to around 1100 Gt CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>].

All conventional sources of energy like coal, oil, and natural gas are all non-renewable and unevenly distributed in the earth with the Middle East holding the maximum oil reserves, Russia holding the maximum natural gas reserves, and the USA holding the maximum coal reserves. How long these reserves last will depend on the demand we put on them. In absence of any mitigation policy, the world’s energy use of fossil fuels would rise by over one third by 2035 with demand of coal rising by 21 % and natural gas by 51 %. The power sector would increase from ∼20 % today to 31 % in 2035. These analyses suggest energy demand in China would likely account for the largest share of the projected growth in global energy use demand, rising by 60 % in 2035, followed by India and the Middle East [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> gives the data for the changing demand of different energy sources in the whole world, in the OECD90 countries, and Asia till 2050 for three different SRES emission scenarios, B1, A1B, and A1FI (adapted from Nakicenovic et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]). Before going into the description of the trend in the data some of the terms used in association with the table are clarified first. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is comprised of the higher developed countries; OECD90 consists of 90 countries from Western Europe, Northern America, and higher developed Pacific nations such as Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. Asian countries like China and India are going through extensive economic growth and an unprecedented growth of energy and population is seen in this region. Regarding the IPCC SRES scenarios, we would expect the highest transition to alternate energy technologies in the B1 scenario, and the least in the A1FI scenario. Until at least mid century, total energy demand in Asia should increase at a higher rate than that in the OECD countries. Even in the most conservative scenario B1, energy from fossil fuels (coal and oil) keeps on increasing to 2050 for Asia. The OECD countries reduce dependence on fossil fuel by 2050 in the B1 and A1B scenarios, but in the fossil fuel intensive scenario A1FI, the consumption increases even for OECD countries. The B1 scenario does not consider nuclear power as a viable alternate energy. But use of biomass burning increases in both Asia and the OECD countries for all the scenarios, but we do not see a similar trend in renewable energy, and actually we see a reduction in use of renewable energy in Asia in case of B1 scenario. Even in the A1FI scenario, the use of alternative energy sources increase, but this is mostly because of the high-energy demand projected by this scenario. From Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, while pollutant emissions are reduced in the lower emission scenarios, air quality would still remain a serious issue over the coming decades.

This is not because it could not be done, but there needs to be a strong willpower to do so. Also, new technology development, like battery storage systems, will likely be key to that transition. Most of the studies that we found on use of clean energy from around the world were restricted to relatively small European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. The common feature of all these transformations was looking at high share of biomass, wind power, and solar power. Also, emphasis was given to new energy storage technologies, and the use of electric vehicles and heat pumps (to increase efficient heating and cooling in buildings). The studies showed that with these assumptions, electricity generation by renewable sources would increase in those countries, while operational cost decrease and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are eliminated.</p><p id="Par36">Towards examining a clean energy future, we have considered three existing idealized scenarios for shifting to clean energy, two of which are based on an energy shift throughout the world and one based on the USA. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. The study for the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>] assumed 80 % penetration of renewable energy by 2050 using technologies that are only currently available commercially. A strongly growing energy demand but much more energy efficient future in the world by 2035 is considered in scenarios developed by the World Energy Outlook 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A study by World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>] looked into a 100 % renewable energy world by 2050 (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The working principles of all these scenarios were to primarily supply electricity through renewable energy sources while also increasing energy efficiency. Simple measures like insulating building, recycling materials, use of energy efficient materials in industries, and shifting to more efficient forms of transportation can reduce total energy demand by 2050. Bioenergy (liquid biofuels and solid biomass) are likely to be important where other renewable energy sources are not viable, especially in providing fuels for airplanes and ships, and in industrial processes that require high temperatures. Compared to current fuels, the use of biofuels could still result in significant emissions of NO<italic>x</italic> and VOCs, but there would likely be a significant reduction in PM2.5 precursor emissions.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Global energy provided by different sources from 2000 to 2050 for a renewable energy future (adapted from the WWF study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>])</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40726_2015_9_Fig4_HTML.gif" id="MO4"/></fig></p><p id="Par37">Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the change in global energy usage by sources from 2000 to 2050 for a clean energy future based on the WWF study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Energy requirement for transportation and residential uses is completely provided by alternate sources of energy. Fossil fuels are assumed to be needed for some industrial processes, particularly for their mechanical properties and not to provide energy. This scenario reduces fossil fuel usage by 95 % and clean renewable sources like wind, solar, hydropower, and geothermal energy sources increase by 12, 31, 6, and 6 %, respectively, by 2050. Bioenergy is assumed to provide 40 % of the total energy by 2050. Implementation of these large-scale uses of alternatives will, of course, require careful planning and international cooperation. This is just one of many possible scenarios for achieving a clean energy future.</p><p id="Par38">The last two sets of columns for the pollutants considered in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> show a range of emissions for two scenarios of an idealized clean energy world. In clean energy scenario 1, we follow the WWF scenario and assume fossil fuel use has been brought down to 5 % and current fossil fuel use has been replaced by other cleaner energy sources. Therefore, emission of CO<sub>2</sub> can also be brought down to 95 % and SO<sub>2</sub> emission can also be reduced by 95 % (since its major source is fossil fuel combustion). The WWF scenario assumes that biofuels will become about 40 % of the total energy production by 2050. Given this, NO<italic>x</italic> and VOC emissions should decrease relative to today in roughly proportion to the amount of use of biofuels, while BC and OC emissions are likely to be much lower, perhaps 50 % of that proportion. Clean energy scenario 2 considers a world with even smaller emissions. The development of battery storage technologies, leading to electric vehicles along with much more extensive use of solar and wind power could make such an idealized clean energy world possible. If all energy production sources were entirely renewables without biofuels, and transportation systems, except for aviation (most emissions occur in the upper troposphere) and ships, were assumed to be run on electrical battery systems, then human-related emissions of NO<italic>x</italic> and VOCs can be assumed to drop by at least 90 % of current emissions even when the growth in energy demand is included for 2050. BC and OC emissions are also assumed to be reduced by 90 % in this scenario. Although these scenarios are hypothetical, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows that a cleaner energy world would greatly reduce emissions of air pollutants, resulting in greatly reduced concerns about air quality and the resulting effects on human health.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par39">Increasing population and economic development throughout the world could continue to exert a high demand on the conventional sources of energy, leading to higher pollutant emission which will directly affect both air quality and climate change in adverse ways. Europe, North America, Japan, and the other OECD countries already have widespread development of renewable energy technologies. Developing countries like China, India, Kenya, Argentina, Costa Rica, Brazil, and others also have large resource capability and market for renewable energy.</p><p id="Par40">In March 2015, Costa Rica ran for more than 75 days with 100 % renewable energy using mostly hydro and wind power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. In rural areas in most developing countries, there is no electricity grid. In these situations, off-grid renewable technologies like solar photovoltaic cells or micro-hydroelectric system can provide cost-effective and sustainable alternative to diesel generators, kerosene lamp, or biomass burning as source of energy. This can provide electricity in homes and can also provide electricity to run schools, small businesses, and health clinics, thus increasing literacy, improving living conditions, and reducing poverty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. End users should also be made aware of the environmental benefits of using cleaner and newer technologies, for example using electric vehicles instead of gasoline/diesel run vehicles or constructing green buildings. This will ensure that the change from conventional energy to alternate energy sources does not meet with a high resistance from the end users. Incentives may be needed. Renewable energy gives a country energy security by providing access to clean and natural sources of energy at cheap price. To enhance the market reach of these technologies, there might also be a need to subsidize the cost of alternate energy services to make them affordable to major part of the population.</p><p id="Par41">A country’s physical border does not restrict impact of degrading air quality or climate change issues. International collaboration can help in controlling impact of long-range transport or intercontinental transport of air pollutants. Sharing research and newer technologies pertaining to renewable sources can help countries without the immediate means to do so in implementing these without taking a very high setback in their industrial or economic developments. IPCC which is aimed at understanding climate change and its impact and not directly related to policy developments, also include analyses of the effects of climate change on air quality (IPCC Working group II: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability) and their assessment is extremely relevant to the discussion in this paper. Such assessments provide useful guidelines for policymakers as to the importance of the issues associated with climate change. They also provide useful summaries of state of the science to help guide further research.</p><p id="Par42">Greater emphasis should be given to research on clean energy like wind, solar, geothermal, and hydroelectricity. Research on new technologies like development of battery storage and incorporating electricity developed from the alternate sources in the current electricity grid system is also very important. If the renewable energy technologies take over conventional energy sources, a life cycle assessment of the newer technologies will also be very pertinent. For example, if vehicles shift from using gasoline/diesel to electric batteries from electricity generated from renewable sources, the tail pipe emission becomes almost zero but there can be newer emissions from the battery manufacturing facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Also, as the vehicles shift to the newer technologies, older vehicles have to be scraped and similar situation will arise for all the sectors changing from conventional sources to renewable sources. Extensive research should also go into handling the waste produced so that more pollutant and GHGs are not emitted from handling the waste. Air quality research is also needed. The processes affecting local and regional ozone production are reasonably well understood, but there remain some questions about the complete chemistry of some of the hydrocarbons. Much more uncertain are the processes affecting the microphysics and chemistry in the life cycle of many of the particles. More emphasis on research in this direction is needed.</p><p id="Par43">A shift from conventional energy sources that rely heavily on fossil fuel combustion, and from gasoline and diesel in vehicles, to renewable sources would greatly improve air quality and save a lot of lives. At the same time, such a shift would greatly reduce the concerns about future climate change. The study shows that such a world is possible—it is really our choice. Do we emphasize the push for the technology development required to get there or do we continue to heavily depend on fossil fuels and face the resulting effects on climate and air quality?</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>Dr. Wuebbles and Ms. Sanyal have no conflicts of interest.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list id="BSec1"><title>Papers of particular interest, published recently, have been highlighted as: •• Of major importance</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.••</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">International Energy Agency Technical Report.
