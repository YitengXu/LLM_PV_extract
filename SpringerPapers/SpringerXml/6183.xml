</title><p id="Par1">The COVID-19 pandemic not only has caused a global health crisis but also has significant environmental consequences. Although many studies are confirming the short-term improvements in air quality in several countries across the world, the long-term negative consequences outweigh all the claimed positive impacts. As a result, this review highlights the positive and the long-term negative environmental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by evaluating the scientific literature. Remarkable reduction in the levels of CO (3 − 65%), NO<sub>2</sub> (17 − 83%), NO<sub>x</sub> (24 − 47%), PM<sub>2.5</sub> (22 − 78%), PM<sub>10</sub> (23 − 80%), and VOCs (25 − 57%) was observed during the lockdown across the world. However, according to this review, the pandemic put enormous strain on the present waste collection and treatment system, resulting in ineffective waste management practices, damaging the environment. The extensive usage of face masks increased the release of microplastics/nanoplastics (183 to 1247 particles piece<sup>−1</sup>) and organic pollutants in land and water bodies. Furthermore, the significant usages of anti-bacterial hand sanitizers, disinfectants, and pharmaceuticals have increased the accumulation of various toxic emerging contaminants (e.g., triclocarban, triclosan, bisphenol-A, hydroxychloroquine) in the treated sludge/biosolids and discharged wastewater effluent, posing great threats to the ecosystems. This review also suggests strategies to create long-term environmental advantages. Thermochemical conversions of solid wastes including medical wastes and for treated wastewater sludge/biosolids offer several advantages through recovering the resources and energy and stabilizing/destructing the toxins/contaminants and microplastics in the precursors.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Air quality</kwd><kwd>Face

</title><p id="Par2">COVID-19 has spread over the world, causing a global health emergency. It was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and soon spread throughout the country, becoming a global disease (Ali and Alharbi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>; Zambrano-Monserrate et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2020</xref>). Coronavirus may have been transmitted from bats to people, according to one hypothesis (Brennecke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>). Humans were infected mostly by droplets, interactions, and airborne transmissions. COVID-19 has made a great impact all across the world. Almost all countries are currently focusing their efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 disease by enacting policies such as the complete closure of public places (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">b</xref>; Muhammad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2020</xref>; Naethe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2020</xref>). Though these policies or regulations may have a significant impact on the economies of most countries, they have some negative or positive effects on the environment, such as a substantial drop in the greenhouse gas emissions that have not been seen since World War II, as many industries in the world halted production and vehicle usage drastically decreased. These variables resulted in a significant drop in nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) and particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, diameter smaller than 2.5 µm) concentrations all across the world (Cui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>; Muhammad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2020</xref>; Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2021a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">b</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">To prevent the rise of coronavirus sickness, every country’s government has established social distancing regulations and forced its inhabitants to remain in their homes. Noise pollution levels have decreased dramatically in most countries due to reduced public and private transportation and other business operations (Jairoun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2021</xref>). A critical link exists between emergency control and the betterment of pristine beaches, air quality, and environmental noise depletion. Conversely, additional harmful indirect factors, like minimizing recycling, and the rise in effluents, threaten the pollution of land and water bodies even more, besides air (Zambrano-Monserrate et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">For instance, the demand for conventional energy has decreased by approximately 30% in several regions, and there has been a decrease in power consumption ranging from 12 to 20% for most countries (Mousazadeh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2021</xref>). Although the pandemic had some direct and short-term positive consequences, it has more severe negative effects on plastic production and solid waste management. Unfortunately, in many countries, the COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc on municipal solid waste management (Knowlton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2019</xref>). Some states in the USA, for example, temporarily closed recycling centers, ceased curbside recycling collection, and stopped onboard recyclables pickups owing to fears about the virus’s spread. Pesticides, detergents, soaps, single-use plastic, and other chemicals have surged dramatically in recent months, wreaking havoc on the ecosystem (Baldasano <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>). In the last few months, roads, buildings, and entire cities have been sanitized. The utilization of hand sanitizers has risen dramatically as well. Personal protective kits, gloves, and face masks have emerged as important safety precautions during the continuing epidemic (Neumeyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">Hand sanitizers containing isopropanol and alcohol are becoming more popular worldwide as a means of mass disinfection. In almost every location where people live, disinfectants such as hypochlorous acids, sodium hypochlorite, and chlorine are utilized in large quantities (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2020</xref>; Capoor and Parida <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>). In addition, the excessive usage of antibiotics, disinfectants, anti-bacterial hand sanitizers, and soaps during the COVID-19 pandemic will raise the concentration of these pharmaceutical and personal care products and other emerging pollutants in the discharged wastewater effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), posing great threats to the aquatic life and ecosystems (Neumeyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2020</xref>; Rugani and Caro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2020</xref>). The extraordinary use of pharmaceuticals (e.g., antibiotics, disinfectants) and personal care products (e.g., anti-bacterial soaps and hand-sanitizers), which contains triclocarban (anti-bacterial) and triclosan (fungicide) (Du et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2019</xref>; Patel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2019</xref>; Brennecke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>), will noticeably increase their concentrations in the WWTP influent and effluent. For the microorganisms and environment, sodium hypochlorite is extremely toxic. Endocrine disruption and various other neurological consequences are all linked to these substances. Both compounds are harmful to the environment since they are hard to break down and makeup 60% of all drugs identified in sewage sludge. The aquatic fauna is adversely affected by these chemical pollutants (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2020</xref>; Rizou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2020</xref>; Capoor and Parida <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">Several studies and reviews discussing the positive impacts of COVID-19 on the environment have been punished, while limited published studies are studying the long-term negative impacts of COVID-19 on the environment and waste management. The present review paper discusses the positive and long-term negative impacts of COVID-19 on the environment, waste management, and energy sectors. It is very important to evaluate the long-term negative impacts of COVID-19 on the environment for future strategies and regulations. Furthermore, the information presented in this review can be used to assess short- and long-term options for mitigating future harmful effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Short-term positive impacts of COVID-19 on the environment</title><p id="Par7">Many studies confirmed that air quality improved only during the lockdown period in various countries all over the world. Major reductions in the levels of NO<sub>2</sub>, CO, NO<sub>x</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, VOCs, and PM<sub>2.5</sub> were reported, which is mainly due to the lockdown and closure of many industrial and commercial activities in different countries including the USA (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">b</xref>; Son et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2020</xref>), Canada (Adams, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>), Mexico, Italy, Germany, China (Jia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2020a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">b</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2021a</xref>), India (Selvam et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2020</xref>; Yunus et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2020</xref>), Iraq (Hashim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2021</xref>), and Egypt (Mostafa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2021</xref>) (Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>, Supplementary material). The details regarding the impacts of COVID-19 on greenhouse gases emissions, VOCs, particulate matter, and air quality index are given in the following sections.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>GHG emissions</title><p id="Par8">In the USA, the pollution levels in the COVID-19 phase from March 13 to April 21, and before the COVID duration, from January 8 to March 11, were recorded in 2020. Notable NO<sub>2</sub> reductions were detected in 2020 than from 2017 to 2019, where a 25.5% reduction, including absolute mitigation of 438 ppb was recorded (Berman and Ebisu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>). Another study showed that the data obtained from 28 long-term air quality sites demonstrated varying reduction levels of CO and NO<sub>2</sub> in the initial lockdown period of March 15 to April 25, 2020, in the USA, corresponding to a reference duration, before lockdown, including previous baselines instituted from 2017 to 2019. The approximate reduction levels of CO by 37% and NO<sub>2</sub> by 49% are notable in around 67% of the regions and principally proliferate with the regional population density (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">b</xref>). Declines of 49 and 38% in CO and NO<sub>2</sub> levels were found at base level analyses in California, throughout the lockdown from March 19 to May 7 than before the lockdown on January 26 to March 18 in 2020 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Similarly, in Ontario, Canada, NO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> exhibited their lowest levels for 22 of the 29 recorders. Distinctive readings varied from 1 ppb of NO<sub>2</sub> to 5 ppb of nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), which was above average to 4.5 ppb of NO<sub>2</sub> and 7.1 ppb of NO<sub>x</sub>, which was lower than average (Adams <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Box and whisker plot showing the reduction of different air pollutants in different countries during lockdown</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11356_2022_20259_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">In Düsseldorf, Germany, the continuous observations of NO<sub>2</sub> level variations corresponding to the reduction of city traffic because of the lockdown enforcement were performed using down-welling light including RoX automated field spectrometer. A decision tree was established by primary constituents that were disintegrated from down-welling radiance spectra, which showed to be the highest durable methodology to obtain NO<sub>2</sub> readings. Improved differentiation of the NO<sub>2</sub> reading scale was derived with a partial least square regression model, and down-welling radiance measurements can be used to observe NO<sub>2</sub> levels continuously (Naethe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">In Italy, a study was conducted to measure the carbon footprint (CF) related to energy reduction because of economic undertakings and locations throughout the lockdown in the nation and to equate these environmental obstacles with the quantified CF for corresponding durations around March and April from 2015 to 2019. The study demonstrates that CF during lockdown reduced by approximately 20% more than the average computed CF before. This indicates that greenhouse gases or GHGs were regulated within approximately 5.6 and 10.6 Mt CO<sub>2</sub>e. Further studies indicate an inclination that happens toward larger impact savings in the northern provinces, which is approximately 230 kt CO<sub>2</sub>e of GHGs regulated by provinces on average, than approximately 110 to 130 kt CO<sub>2</sub>e in the southern and central provinces (Rugani and Caro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">In Madrid and Barcelona, Spain, the magnitude of the air pollution decline was measured in March and April 2020, during the lockdown, which demonstrated readings of a notable reduction of approximately 75%. The NO<sub>2</sub> levels in these two cities recorded a 50 and 62% reduction for Barcelona and Madrid, respectively. In March 2020, the hourly quantification readings were derived from 9 to 24 air quality sites from the recording systems, which provided data of the regulations, that can be accomplished by imposing low emission zones (LEZ), including the pollution level to be eradicated, which was 55% for Barcelona and Madrid (Baldasano <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>). Average monthly concentrations of pollutants in Tunisia examined from January 1 to April 30, 2020, revealed that actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have a major impact on emission levels. In March, there have been 51% decreases for NO<sub>2</sub> and 52% for SO<sub>2</sub> emissions for most of the cities compared to January, while the levels of NO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> decreased by about 40% (Chekir and Ben Salem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">To investigate the effect of the lockdown on air pollution in Egypt with a focus on Cairo and Governorates of Alexandria, the data for the lockdown period in 2020 were extracted and contrasted with the corresponding month for the specified baseline period (2015–2019). The absorbing aerosol index (AAI) was reduced by around 30%, NO<sub>2</sub> declined by 15 and 33% respectively in Cairo and Alexandria Governorates, while CO reduced by around 5% in both Governorates. Furthermore, during the epidemic, GHG emissions have been cut by at least 4%, while the amount of ozone in Cairo and Alexandria rose by around 2% (Mostafa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2021</xref>).

In the majority of traditional WWTPs, most of these emerging contaminants are not efficiently removed from wastewater. Effluent discharge and waste disposal on land might have long-term repercussions on our water systems and biota. Water and wastewater treatment systems for the removal of organic pollutants and emerging contaminants are thus necessary to be more effective and easily implemented.

Thus, more efficient and cost-effective disposal methods for the disposal of medical wastes are urgently needed during the pandemic and post-pandemic periods. Effective healthcare waste management is entirely based on a well-organized and well-executed management strategy. To create and maintain an effective waste management strategy, a waste management team or panel should be created. An infection control committee, with one individual involved in healthcare waste management in healthcare institutions, should be established in low-income regions (Das et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2021</xref>; Hantoko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2021</xref>). After the safe disposal of waste, the PPE must be removed safely, and the sanitizer used for disinfecting hands after the waste has been disposed of. For safe cleaning off-site or on-site, the soiled PPE must be placed in a sealed bag and should be cleaned with an agent containing 10% lime slurry (WHO, 2020). Several countries have current regulations and protocols for the disposal of the hospital or domestic medical waste. During the COVID-19 epidemic, certain modifications were made to the waste management method (Hantoko et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2021</xref>).

In addition to health education regarding disinfections and managing municipal solid waste with a scientific basis, clear instructions on the treatment of domestic medical waste are required (Das et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par51">Perhaps the COVID-19 pandemic has short-term favorable environmental benefits. However, the environmental issues resulting from this virus outbreak could have long-lasting effects and post challenges for all countries around the world. COVID-19 has also posed negative consequences on the water and soil ecosystem due to the significant usage of anti-bacterial hand sanitizers, disinfectants, and medications, increasing the accumulation of various toxic emerging contaminants including triclocarban, triclosan, and hydroxychloroquine. Face masks and other plastic-based protection equipment have been found as major sources for the release and accumulation of microplastics in the aquatic/terrestrial ecosystems, posing major threats for aquatics and humans. Proper handling of municipal solid waste, including medical wastes and treated sludge/biosolids, may lead to a viable energy source and thereby will achieve environmental sustainability. Thermochemical conversion processes including pyrolysis and gasification could be utilized effectively for the destruction and/or stabilization of toxins, viruses, emerging contaminants, and microplastics present in the sludge and solid waste, and energy and resources recovery from the precursors. The information presented in this review can be used to assess short- and long-term options for mitigating future harmful effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Drs.
