Graphite oxides (GO) were prepared and separated to individual sheets using Hummer's method. Graphene nano-sheets were prepared by chemical reduction with hydrazine. The prepared PtAg alloy nanomaterial and the hybrid composites with graphene were characterized by SEM, TEM, and zeta potential measurements. It is confirmed that the prepared Au@PtAg alloy nanorods/graphene hybrid composites own good catalytic function for methanol electro-oxidation by cyclic voltammograms measurements, and exhibited higher catalytic activity and more stability than pure Au@Pt nanorods and Au@AgPt alloy nanorods. In conclusion, the prepared PtAg alloy nanoislands/graphene hybrid composites own high stability and catalytic activity in methanol electro-oxidation, so that it is one kind of high-performance

years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], owing to its large specific surface area, high thermal and electrical conductivities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], great mechanical strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The unique properties of graphene sheets provide applications in synthesis of nanocomposites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], fabrication of field-effect transistors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], dye-sensitized solar cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], lithium ion batteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and electrochemical sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Up to date, many methods such as a scotch tape (peel off) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], epitaxial growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], chemical vapor deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and reduction of graphene oxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] have been used to prepare individual graphene sheets and to improve the properties of graphene. Among these methods, chemical reduction method of graphene oxide is with lowest cost and large scale to prepare graphene, which attract scientists' intensive attention, and exhibit great application prospect.</p><p>In the field of electrochemistry, graphene is an excellent substrate to load active nanomaterials for energy applications due to its high conductivity, large surface area, flexibility, and chemical stability. For example, Dai and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] made high-capacity anode material for lithium ion batteries by growing Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles (NPs) on graphene sheets. Zhang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] prepared mono-dispersed SnO<sub>2</sub> NPs on both sides of single layer graphene sheets as anode materials in Li-ion batteries. They found much higher retention of SnO<sub>2</sub>-graphene composite than commercial SnO<sub>2</sub> powder after 50 cycles. Apart from these studies, a lot of efforts had been paid on metal oxide/graphene hybrid composites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, so far, few reports are closely associated with the use of graphene-based metal materials as heterogeneous catalysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Therefore, to prepare and study graphene/noble metal, heterogeneous materials become more and more important.</p><p>In the field of catalysis, Pt (and Pd) is intensively applied in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], because of their high-efficient catalysis function for methanol dehydrogenation. To improve catalytic properties of the metal materials, the size and structure of NPs become more and more important. Pt NPs with several nanometers in diameter and porous structures own high catalytic activity because of their enlarged surface area. In addition, the composition of the catalyst is another important factor for catalytic activity. For instance, pure Pt nanostructures are easily poisoned by chemisorbed CO-like intermediates generated in the course of methanol oxidation, which makes their catalytic performance decreased quickly. To solve this problem, it is feasible to prepare bimetallic nanocomposites composed of Pt and those metals such as Ru, Rh, Pd, and Au [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Other metal materials are proposed to provide oxygen-containing species at relative negative potential, which can oxidize CO at Pt sites. Therefore, to prepare alloyed Pt NPs are very necessary. Wu and colleagues had proved that PtAg alloy nanoislands on gold nanorods had good optical responses and electrochemical catalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, up to date, graphene-based PtAg alloy nanoislands as heterogeneous catalysts are not still investigated well.</p><p>In this study, we reported to prepare PtAg alloy nanoislands/graphene hybrid composites based on the self-assembly of positively charged gold nanorods and Au@AgPt alloy nanorods on negatively charged graphene sheets. (Here "@" was defined as a core/shell structure. Au@AgPt alloy nanorod is a core/shell structure for Au nanorod as the core and AgPt alloy as the shell. We use Au@Pt<sub><italic>m</italic></sub>Ag<sub><italic>n</italic></sub>to represent the samples, and <italic>m</italic> and <italic>n</italic> are percentage determined by EDX.) The self-assembly technology enables loading a lot of Au NRs and Au@AgPt alloy nanorods on individual graphene sheets with uniform morphology. It was investigated that the prepared Au@AgPt alloy nanorods/graphene hybrid composites were used as a fuel cell electrocatalyst for methanol electro-oxidation. The utilization ratio of Pt was 23.4%, but its catalytic activity was 124 mA mg Pt<sup>-1</sup>, which was close to 162.5 mA mg Pt<sup>-1</sup> (99.2% utilization ratio of Pt) reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In addition, Pt material has also good catalytic stabilization, which shows that catalytic activity may increase with the utilization ratio of Pt increase, further investigation will be helpful to clarify its potential mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental section</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemicals</title><p>10000 mesh (dimension: 1.5µm) graphite, etyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), PVP (K30, Mw = 30000-40000) were obtained from Alfa Company and used as-received.

In the course of graphene preparation, PVP was used and remarkably increased the stability of graphene sheets because of strong hydrophobic interactions between graphene sheets and PVP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. After reduction, the color of solution changed from yellow to dark black. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> shows that graphene sheets could self-assemble into a plane on silica wafer without coagulation. The width of graphene was about 800 nm. GO had an oxygen content of 43 atom%, as shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>, the atomic ratio of carbon to oxygen was 1.24. This result indicated there was more oxygen content than the empirical formula C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> proposed by Boehm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. After reduction, a nitrogen peak from PVP appeared in EDX spectra. Oxygen content in reduced graphene had two sources: one was from GO, the other one was from PVP. When evaluating GO's reduction degree, oxygen content came from PVP should be deducted. After first reduction, the atomic ratio of carbon to oxygen was 5.2, there was still 30% oxygen content remained (the EDX spectra was not shown).

Both UV-Vis and TEM image indicate the prepared Au NRs had an aspect ratio of 4.4. Compared to Au NRs, all the three kinds of Ag-Pt alloy shell nanorods had rough surfaces. Ag-Pt alloy shell on the surface of Au NRs looked like nanodots or nanoislands. The nanoislands structure could increase surface area of Ag-Pt alloy shells, and improve the utilization of Pt material. When very few Pt<sup>2+</sup> ions were used, the nanodots of Ag-Pt alloy particles deposited almost on the two ends of Au NRs as shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2B</xref>. With the amount of Pt<sup>2+</sup> ion increased, the nanodots of Ag-Pt alloy particles distributed uniformly on the surface of Au NRs.

The zeta potential data were shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. GO had a zeta potential of -64.2 mV, which is attributed to a large number of negatively charged functional groups such as carboxyl groups and hydroxyl groups. Prepared GO solution was good water soluble, and very stable at ambient condition because of electrostatic repulsion. After reduction, PVP-capped graphene sheets had a smaller negative zeta potential value. The zeta potential data of Au NRs and Au@PtAg NRs were, respectively, 30.4 and 44.8 mV, because of double-layer adsorption of CTAB. The larger value of Au@PtAg NRs was consistent with more surface area resulted from the islands structure. In a typical experiment of self-assembly, the aqueous dispersion of graphene sheets (0.5 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>) was mixed with Au NRs solution with different weight ratios (1:1, 1:2, 1:5, 1:10, 1:20, 1:100) and sonicated for 15 min to form a homogeneous mixture. Self-assembly of positively charged gold nanorods and Au@AgPt alloy nanorods with negatively charged graphene sheets resulted in formation of heavier entities; therefore, after 24 h, precipitation could be found at the bottom of the vessel. For the front four samples (the weight ratio of Au NRs to graphene 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, 1:10), the corresponding supernatants were colorless. By contrast, the corresponding supernatants of the last two samples were still red color which suggested extensive Au NRs used. As shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref> (weight ratio 1:1 and 2:1), the edges of graphene sheets were quite clear, as well as Au NRs could spread out uniformly on silica wafer with few Au NRs found outside the graphene sheets; however, Au NRs adsorptive densities were very low. If a considerable quantity of Au NRs was used, in the case of weight ratio 20:1 and 100:1, redundant Au NRs could be found outside graphene sheets as marked by circles in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3E</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3F</xref>. Moreover, the edges of graphene sheets could not be distinguished. When the weight ratio reached to 100:1, Au NRs deposited on graphene sheets by means of layer-by-layer, which lead to illegibility of the edges of graphene sheets. As the results shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3C</xref>, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3D</xref>, the suitable weight ratio for self-assemble were 5:1 and 10:1, in which both graphene edges were clear, and Au NRs distributed uniformly on graphene sheets. Furthermore, the quantity of Au NRs loaded on graphene was appropriate.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Average zeta potential measured at 25°C</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="left"><p>GO</p></th><th align="left"><p>GN</p></th><th align="left"><p>Au NRs</p></th><th align="left"><p>Au@Pt<sub>0.57</sub>Ag<sub>0.43</sub> NRs</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Zeta potential (mV)</p></td><td align="left"><p>-64.2</p></td><td align="left"><p>-39.6</p></td><td align="left"><p>30.4</p></td><td align="left"><p>44.8</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>SEM images of Au NRs/graphene hybrid composites with different weight ratios</bold>: 1:1 <bold>(A)</bold>, 2:1 <bold>(B)</bold>, 5:1 <bold>(C)</bold>, 10:1 <bold>(D)</bold>, 20:1 <bold>(E)</bold>, 100:1 <bold>(F)</bold>.

In the case of weight ratio 2:1, graphene could easily be recognized from the fringe and some pleats of graphene sheets (marked by red arrows). When weight ratio was 5:1, apart from uniformly distributed Au NRs, graphene sheets could not be seen clearly, which is because it was quite hard to make a distinction between them and the carbon-supported films on the copper grid due to the thin thickness of graphene sheets. SEM and TEM images both showed that self-assembly method was effective in producing homogeneous high-loading nanorods on the surface of graphene. The procedure of preparing graphene/Au@PtAg NRs hybrids was similar to that of graphene/Au NRs hybrids except for using Au@PtAg NRs as precursor for self-assembly. In the following experiment, we used the hybrid composition of weight ratio 5:1 for methanol electro-oxidation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Catalytic activity for methanol electro-oxidation</title><p>In recent years, DMFCs have intensely been studied because of their numerous advantages, which include high-energy density, the ease of handling a liquid, low operating temperature, and their possible applications to micro-fuel cells. Electrocatalytic materials restricted the performance and application of DMFCs. Herein, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to investigate the electrocatalytic activity of various graphene/Au@PtAg NRs hybrids materials for the oxidation of methanol. Three samples of Au@PtAg alloy nanorods and one sample of Au@Pt nanorods were used to prepare graphene hybrids materials and measured. In the blank control test, cyclic voltammetry was carried out in 0.5 mol L<sup>-1</sup> H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> solution saturated with high-purity nitrogen gas to determine the hydrogen adsorption/desorption area between -0.3 and 0.1 V (see "Figure S3 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>"). Hydrogen adsorption/desorption peak did not appear in CV curve of pure graphene. It revealed graphene could not adsorb hydrogen effectively in this case. As reported, Pt material is good catalyst in hydrogen adsorption/desorption and methanol electrooxidation. The results in "Figure S3 in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>" show that all the three samples of Au@PtAg alloy nanorods graphene hybrids materials and one sample of Au@Pt nanorods graphene hybrids materials had similar large hydrogen adsorption/desorption areas denoting similar effective electrochemical surface areas. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows cyclic voltammetric curves for the methanol electro-oxidation. For Au@Pt nanorods graphene hybrids materials (sample b), no obvious oxidation reduction peak was detected, indicating a poor catalytic performance for methanol electrooxidation. For the three samples of Au@PtAg alloy nanorods graphene hybrids materials (sample c, d, and e), methanol-oxidation peaks were clearly observed at about 0.69 V (versus Ag/AgCl) in the forward sweep and at 0.49 V in the backward sweep, respectively. The anodic peak current in the forward sweep was attributed to methanol electrooxidation, in the reverse sweep was attributed to the removal of the incompletely oxidized carbonaceous species formed in the forward sweep. These carbonaceous species were mostly in the form of linearly bonded Pt = C = O, which usually decreased catalytic activities of Pt materials and the so-called "catalyst poisoning." All PtAg alloy hybrids had good performance than pure Pt hybrids. The higher activity of PtAg alloy hybrids can be explained by the bifunctional mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] which was assumed that Ag promotes the oxidation of the strongly bound CO<sub>ad</sub> on Pt by supplying an oxygen source (Ag-OH<sub>ad</sub>).

The EAS accounts not only for the catalyst surface available for charge transfer, but also includes the access of a conductive path to transfer the electrons to and from the electrode surface.

EAS and Pt utilization of the three graphene/Au@PtAg NRs hybrids catalysts were similar to that reported in previous reference listed in the fifth row. They showed much lower EAS and Pt utilization than that listed in the sixth row which reached nearly 100% Pt utilization. Interestingly, graphene/Au@Pt<sub>0.64</sub>Ag<sub>0.36</sub> NRs (sample e) had high catalytic activity reached 124 mA mg Pt<sup>-1</sup>, which was just a bit lower than the sample of 99% Pt utilization in the sixth row.

As Pt utilization was not high for our three samples tested in the experiment, if Pt utilization even enhanced, catalytic activity might even reach a new high platform. Furthermore, the ratio of <italic>I</italic><sub>f</sub><italic>/I</italic><sub>b</sub> was all higher than the commercial E-TEK catalyst (0.74) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].

For instance, in the first 200 sweep cycles, the catalytic current increased in the first 45 cycles. From the 45th to the 70th cycles, the catalytic current was stable at a high level, while it decreased afterward. In the period of decreased, the minimum value was still 60% of the maximum.

To make out what role graphene played in the course, we done controlled experiment using pure Au@Pt<sub>0.57</sub>Ag<sub>0.43</sub> NRs (sample a) and the NRs hybrid compositions of graphene and Au@Pt<sub>0.57</sub>Ag<sub>0.43</sub> NRs (sample b), whose results were shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. In the case of the sample a (Au@Pt<sub>0.57</sub>Ag<sub>0.43</sub> NRs without graphene), it was hard to find an oxidation peak in the first cycle (line a, blue dot line). With cycles went on, oxidation peak current gradually appeared and increased. The 25th cycle of sample a was shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> (line b, red dash line). As the results shown, it seemed that an electrical excitation process was needed to achieve a good oxidation current of methanol oxidation. In the reverse case, in the first cycle of sample b (Au@Pt<sub>0.57</sub>Ag<sub>0.43</sub> NRs with graphene), obvious methanol-oxidation peaks were observed at 0.69 V in the forward sweep and at 0.49 V in the backward sweep (line c, black solid line), which were similar to that in the 25th cycle of sample a. For this reason, sample b had good oxidation current of methanol oxidation, and electrical excitation process was not needed.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>Cyclic voltammetric curves for the electrooxidation of methanol (sweep rate: 50 mV s</bold><sup><bold>-1</bold></sup><bold>, 0.5 mol L</bold><sup><bold>-1</bold></sup><bold>H</bold><sub><bold>2</bold></sub><bold>SO</bold><sub><bold>4</bold></sub><bold>, 2 mol L</bold><sup><bold>-1</bold></sup><bold>CH</bold><sub><bold>3</bold></sub><bold>OH, 298 K)</bold>. <bold>(a)</bold> the first cycle of Au@Pt<sub>0.57</sub>Ag<sub>0.43</sub> NRs; <bold>(b)</bold> the 25th cycle of Au@Pt<sub>0.57</sub>Ag<sub>0.43</sub> NRs; <bold>(c)</bold> the first cycle of graphene/Au@Pt<sub>0.57</sub>Ag<sub>0.43</sub> NRs.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11671_2011_Article_307_Fig5_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p>Another important parameter to value catalytic activity of the samples is onset potential in electrical oxidation process. In forward sweep, all the samples had the same onset potentials (0.216 V). Otherwise, in backward sweep, sample b had frontier onset potentials (up to 124 mV) than sample a (without graphene). As mentioned above, the oxidation current of methanol oxidation in backward sweep represented the removal activity of the incompletely oxidized carbonaceous species (usually CO adsorbed on sample surface) generated in the forward sweep. The frontier onset potentials of graphene/Au@PtAg alloy NRs hybrid compositions indicated easier remove of the incompletely oxidized carbonaceous species. This phenomenon was very similar to that discovered by Yoo et al. before. In their research, Yoo et al. had done CO<sub>ad</sub> stripping voltammograms to explain the role graphene played in this reaction. The different state of CO adsorption on Pt/graphene was inferred to traditional Pt catalysts supported on carbon black [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In our study, the values of <italic>I</italic><sub>f</sub><italic>/I</italic><sub>b</sub> were 1.46 and 1.24, respectively, for graphene/Au@PtAg alloy NRs hybrid compositions (the first sweep) and Au@PtAg alloy NRs (the 25th sweep) without graphene. The different onset potential and <italic>I</italic><sub>f</sub><italic>/I</italic><sub>b</sub> value in backward sweep could be attributed to different CO adsorption state. The different CO adsorption state on graphene/Au@PtAg alloy NRs hybrid compositions and ordinary PtAg alloy NRs materials influenced the catalytic activity for methanol electrooxidation. Graphene in hybrid compositions could enhance anti-poisoning effect in the backward sweep. Graphene in the hybrid composition could change adsorption state of reactant, so the electrochemical process was affected. The higher oxidation peak in the first cycle of graphene/Au@PtAg alloy NRs hybrid compositions might result from the different interaction between graphene and methanol. Therefore, graphene in the hybrid compositions could improve the catalytic activity for methanol electrooxidation.</p><p>In addition, graphene had the advantages of good dispersion, high conductivity, large surface area, flexibility, and chemical stability. The higher catalytic activity of graphene architecture was attributed to the larger surface area which led to large currents and good dispersion of Au@PtAg NRs on the surface. The good dispersion of Au@PtAg NRs on graphene would give reactants easy access to the catalytic active sites, which would help to improve proton diffusion and mass transport.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, PtAg alloy nanoislands/graphene hybrid composites based on self-assembling of Au@PtAg NRs on graphene sheets were successfully prepared. The high-loading Au@PtAg NRs distributed uniformly on the surface of graphene sheets. It is confirmed that PtAg alloy nanoislands/graphene hybrid composites own better catalytic activity and longer stabilization for methanol oxidation compared with traditional method. Because large-scale graphene can be prepared by chemical reduction of graphene oxide; therefore, the PtAg alloy nanoislands/graphene hybrid composites can be obtained by large scale with low cost; therefore, as-prepared PtAg alloy nanoislands/graphene hybrid composite has great potential in applications such as electro-catalyst for DMFCs in near
