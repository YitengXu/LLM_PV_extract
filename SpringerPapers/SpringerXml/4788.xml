Hence, three different point-focus optics (parabolic mirror, spherical mirror and a commonly used Fresnel lens) characterized by same dimensions are compared in this paper from energy and economic point of view in order to identify the most convenient in terms of unit cost of electrical power. The optical concentration factor, the maximum values of triple-junction (TJ) cell electrical power and temperature are experimentally measured for each optical system, and successively, the unit cost of electrical power is calculated. The parabolic mirror results the least convenient because it guarantees almost the same performances of a spherical optics but with costs of about 2.7 times higher than it. The Fresnel lens presents a value of the unit cost of electrical power near to the spherical mirror, but its much lower optical efficiency implies a necessary area for the CPV plant about three times larger. Moreover, a forecast of the increase in the CPV plant power capacity in Italy and the consequent decrease in the unit cost of electrical power in two possible scenarios, optimistic and pessimistic, is realized. A reduction of the unit cost of electrical power, between 13 and 30%, is expected for the CPV systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Concentrating photovoltaic system</kwd><kwd>Point-focus configuration</kwd><kwd>Refractive and reflective optics</kwd><kwd>Energy and economic comparison</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>39</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/40430_2022_Article_3408.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2022</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Mechanical Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par25">The energy demand in the world is significantly increasing due to population growth and industrial evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the burning of the traditional fossil fuels, which are available and commonly used for satisfying the world energy demand, is causing environmental problems such as climate change, global warming, air pollution and acid rain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Hence, there is an urgent need for the development of renewable energy technologies in order to deal with the political, economic and environmental challenges in electricity production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Even if currently the traditional energy conversion technologies based on fossil fuels are often more convenient, it can be expected in the next future that some renewable technologies will become economically competitive with conventional ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In particular, the solar energy could be an optimal option because of several reasons. First, it is the most abundant source of renewable energy and is not exhaustible, giving solid and increasing output efficiencies in comparison with other sources of energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Moreover, the solar energy can be simultaneously converted into different energy vectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In fact, the photovoltaic–thermal (PV/T) systems can simultaneously produce electrical and thermal energy, decreasing electricity production costs and increasing the overall use of solar energy. An effective way to maximize efficiency levels is to adopt concentrating photovoltaic (CPV) or concentrating photovoltaic and thermal (CPV/T) systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These systems use optical devices such as mirrors or lenses able to convey the solar radiation on smaller multi-junction (MJ) cells and to obtain higher electrical power due to their higher electrical conversion efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. On the other hand, the increase in the sunlight concentration leads to an increase in the cell temperature. However, exploiting the thermal energy recovery from the solar cells by means of an active cooling system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], it is possible to obtain an increase in electrical efficiency producing simultaneously electric and thermal energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Hence, CPV and CPV/T systems allow good results at competitive costs for generation of clean energy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but a careful selection of the optical system typology and of its concentration factor is fundamental to obtain energy and economic advantages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Several types of optical systems have been developed. They differ in terms of geometry, methods and levels of concentration and each of them presents advantages and disadvantages. Hence, the optical systems can be classified into several ways. According to their principle of operation, optical systems can be divided into refractive and reflective optics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Moreover, they can be classified according to the achievable level of concentration: low (&lt; 10 suns), medium (10–100 suns), high (100–2000 suns) and ultrahigh (2000–42,000 suns) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Depending on whether the sunlight is conveyed on small or larger area or along line, optical systems can be classified into point-focus, dense array and line-focus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Referring to the point-focus optics, in this paper the main technologies used are considered and a comparison from the energy and economic point of view is realized for three different typologies of optics: Fresnel lens, parabolic mirror and spherical mirror. The principal aim is to evaluate the optical systems most convenient in terms of unit cost of electrical power.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Experimental analysis of optics adopted in a point-focus CPV system</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Typologies of optics</title><p id="Par26">Because the CPV systems are still in stage of development, several optical systems are tested to improve their energy and economic performances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As for the point-focus optical systems, most applications use refractive optics such as the Fresnel lens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The most common Fresnel lens is generally made of PMMA, but other materials are being analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. A Fresnel lens conveys sunlight by refraction on the solar cell; it requires the presence of secondary optics to avoid chromatic aberration problems. An interesting analysis of the experimental methods used to evaluate the optical performances of a Fresnel lens is reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] a Fresnel lens conveys the sunlight on plano-concave lens which works as secondary optics to uniform the concentrated solar radiation on MJ solar cell. In [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], both electrical and thermal parameters are analyzed to evaluate the potential energy production of CPV system that uses a Fresnel lens as primary optics.</p><p id="Par27">On the contrary, the point-focus reflective optics are less diffused but can increase the CPV system performances. A reflective optics generally is subjected to an appropriate reflective treatment (protected aluminizing treatment) to reflect the solar radiation within the TJ cell operating wavelength range. A typical point-focus reflective optics is the parabolic dish and different studies investigate models able to determine the parabolic dish opto-geometrical parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. An interesting application is discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] where double reflection Cassegrain CPV with parabolic dish and hyperbolic mirror, is studied. A similar configuration is analyzed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] where the primary parabolic dish concentrates the solar radiation at its focal point, and the secondary hyperbolic reflector redirects the solar radiation to glass homogenizer and solar cell.</p><p id="Par28">The economic performances of reflective point-focus optics can be improved considering a spherical shape rather than a parabolic. In fact, from a study commissioned by the authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], it has emerged that considering very small size of solar cell, spherical mirror is to be preferred to parabolic from a technical–economic point of view. Even if it requires secondary optics to overcome the spherical aberration problem, the total cost of a spherical optical system can be much lower with respect to parabolic mirror of the same dimensions because it results easier to produce. Hence, the main aim of this paper is to compare the three mentioned types of point-focus optics (parabolic mirror, spherical mirror and Fresnel lens) presenting the same diameter. The three optical systems are compared also from an energy and economic point of view to identify the most convenient in terms of electrical power unit cost.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Experimental point-focus CPV system</title><p id="Par29">The experimental CPV plant, shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, has been realized at the Applied Thermodynamics Laboratory of University of Salerno (Italy). It is a point-focus CPV system that can accommodate more typologies of optics both refractive and reflective. The refractive optics is a Fresnel lens made of PMMA with diameter and thickness, respectively, equal to 30 cm and 0.4 cm and a focal distance of 23.9 cm; the reflective optics present the same diameter. The primary optics convey the solar radiation on the receiver consisting of TJ solar cell and passive finned cooling system. The TJ solar cell is the same for each receiver and is constituted by InGaP/GaAs/Ge and presents an area equal to 10.0 × 10.0 mm<sup>2</sup>. For all TJ cells, a pyramid-shaped light-guide, of height equal to 75.0 mm and presenting major base area and minor base area, respectively, equal to 16.0 × 16.0 mm<sup>2</sup> and 10.0 × 10.0 mm<sup>2</sup>, is used as secondary optics to avoid chromatic aberration problems and to improve the optical efficiency. A tracking system is adopted in the experimental CPV system to converge the maximum direct normal irradiance (DNI) on the receiver. The experimental system allows to move on vertical axis of the receiver in the case of reflective optics and the Fresnel lens in the refractive case. So, the incident solar radiation on the TJ cell can be varied modifying the concentration factor. As for the measurements, a pyrheliometer (accuracy of 2%) measures the DNI and PT100 thermo-resistances (accuracy of ± 0.2 °C) measure the cells and outdoor temperatures. A variable electrical load is connected to each cell and an acquisition data system is adopted for the experimental measurements of voltage, current, DNI and temperatures. The experimental calculation of the optical concentration factor (<italic>C</italic><sub>opt</sub>) is obtained as ratio between the solar radiation concentrated on TJ cell (<italic>R</italic><sub>c</sub>), measured by means of thermal power sensor (accuracy of ± 3%), and the DNI that represents the incident power flow on the optical system. Hence, C<sub>opt</sub> results independent from the TJ cell electrical performance, while it depends only on the system optical performances. During the measurement of <italic>C</italic><sub>opt</sub>, it is necessary that the solar radiation concentrated on TJ cell and power sensor, is the same. The thermal power sensor presents bimetallic junctions (thermopile). The heat flows in the sensor and determines a voltage proportional to the power absorbed when it flows through the thermopile.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Experimental plant</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40430_2022_3408_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Energy and economic comparison between the point-focus optical systems</title><p id="Par30">The optical concentration factor (<inline-formula id="IEq6"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq6_Math"><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">opt</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq6_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

In fact, the parabolic mirror guarantees almost the same optical and energy performances of the spherical one, but it presents a cost of about 2.7 times higher than it. On the contrary, the costs of spherical optics and Fresnel lens are approximately the same. However, spherical mirrors are not as much diffused as Fresnel lenses which constitute the commonly used point-focus optical system. Hence, the cost of spherical mirrors is expected to decrease if their use in CPV systems increases. Moreover, the spherical mirror is characterized by an optical efficiency which is about three times higher than the Fresnel lens. This means that, for the same electrical power, the necessary area for the CPV plant with spherical mirrors is about three times lower with respect to the use of Fresnel lenses.

The unit cost decrease in CPV systems, divided into four categories in the years from 2011 to 2019 in Italy, has been also reported together with the increase in the CPV power capacity during the same years. The unit cost of the electric power supplied by CPV system in the years 2020–2025 in an optimistic and a pessimistic scenario has been forecasted.
