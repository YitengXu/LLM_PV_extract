It is well-known that the adaptation of technical development this way requires from agricultural entreprises to set up serious condition system which means considerable challenge to the farms of the present segmented but – at the same time – heterogenous Hungarian farm structure. On the basis of a survey in the small, medium and large-scale farms of a conventionally cereal producing region, the current research examines the relations between the factors of technical development and the efficiency interpreted in two relations. As regards the factors of technical development, the experiences prove that the adaptation willingness – or rather ability from financial muscle - is increasing by the growth of farm size. The complexity of factors also improves which results increasing natural and economic efficiency. The economic efficiency is significantly decreasing in lower farm sizes, due basically to the inconsistency of mechanization, which supports the necessity of cooperation in the field of mechanization. Keywords: cooperation, efficiency, private farms, technical development. Introduction The success of agricultural production – especially in fieldcrops production due to its exposure – is greatly influenced by biotic and abiotic stress. One of the highlighted tasks of agricultural technical development is the exclusion and moderation of negative stress affects by permanent improvement of technical, biological, chemical and human factors. The appropriate level of elements of technical development involved as input in fieldcrop production and their proper balance and complexity protects against the negative impacts of (biotic and abiotic) stressors coming from the external environment – or from the system itself. These impacts can be the most directly measured through the natural efficiency (yield per area unit) [Magó 2008; Takács-György 2008; Takács 2007]. It should be noted that the efficiency in economic terms (which can be described with the proportion of input and output value) gives less adequate information on the question due to the involvement of market conditions, but it is obvious that the operation of the system has considerable impact on its development. In this approach it can be stated that the carefully executed technical development – by influencing the external factors which may affect production – greatly contributes to the competitiveness of agricultural entreprises (Figure 1). It should be made clear in the relation of natural and economic efficiency that natural efficiency is not always paired with economic efficiency, and it is true vice versa. It is well-known that the appropriate adaptation of results of technical development imposes significant requirements to farms. Thus the question is the following: can the farms in the Hungarian agriculture, which copes with structural problems and the related significant lack of capital, utilise the achievements of technical development at</p><p id="Pg3">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 458 adequate level and – more importantly – in what complexity? Our aim with the research was basically to find the answer to this question. Materials and methods The research was made on the basis of primary data. The questionnaire survey complemented with deep interviews was made in the South-Eastern part of Hungary, in the Southern Great Plain region, in Békés county. The element number of the examined sample (N) is 111 private farms – selected by random sampling – and on average, 88.6% (s=14%) of farm-level Standard Gross Margin (SGM) of the surveyed farms comes from fieldcrops production, therefore they can be regarded Specialist field crops (Fieldcrops) farms according to the EU typology. As regards representativeness, according to the production lines, the examined sample represents 1.08% of private farms in Békés county, which means 0.04% representativeness nationally. During the survey, the private farms were also grouped according to economic size units. The applied grouping corresponds to the methodology applied in the European Union, so the economic size groups are as follows: (1) 0 - &lt;4 ESU, (2) 4 - &lt;8 ESU, (3) 8 - &lt;16 ESU, (4) 16 - &lt;40 ESU, (5) 40 - &lt;100 ESU, (6) &gt;= 100 ESU.

Main logical relations of the research (Source: own construction) On the basis of Figure 1, the problem can be approached with the following equation, parameterizing the influencing factors: ),),(),(),,(),,,(()( ξµσγϕδ raznitsmfe =Φ , where to express Φ = the natural efficiency of crop production (NE), the natural yield (e) per area unit is used. Due to the diversified production structure and for the actual comparability, the natural yield is determined in „cereal unit” [GU t·ha -1 ]. δ = technical factor of technical development. Our research covered only the examination of mechanization out of the technical pillar because of the specialities of the examined area. The relations used for the description of machine supply of farms are as follows: level of assets supply (m), which was evaluated with „specific Fixed Assets Capital” (sFAC) index [EUR·ha-1]; in order to express technical level (s) a so-called „ModernityIndex” (MI) was determined by evaluating individually the assets of farms in a scale from 1 to 5 on the basis of relation and age, and took the simple mathematical average of the figures we got [-]. The costs (t) connected with mechanization of farms were</p><p id="Pg4">VIII.

The cumulated value is in the „specific Total Machine Cost” (sTMC) index [EUR·ha -1 ]. φ = factors of chemical use. In order to describe the quantity and quality of chemical substances, we used value index per area unit, delimiting two areas: fertilizer use (sFU) and crop protection chemical use (sPU) [EUR·ha-1]. γ = biological basis. The level of this pillar of technical development was described also with the propagation material use (z) per one area unit (sB) [EUR·ha-1]. σ = human resources. Quality (a) and quantity (r) dimensions were considered in the evaluation of the human factors of farms. As regards quality aspects, the „Education-Index” (EI) was introduced by evaluating the professional school qualification of farmers in a 1-4 scale [-]. Model calculations were used to determine the working-time utilisation of farms, as quantity factor. This value comes from the „specific working-time use” index (sWT) [h ha-1]. µ and ξ = biotic and abiotic stress-factors. For further examinations we introduced a „specific Total Technical Development Costs” index (sTTDC) which defines the total technicaldevelopment-related expenditure of farms in value per area unit ([EUR ha -1 ]. The examinations were made with uni- and two-variable statistical methods (average, dispersion, correlation calculation) and graphical boxplot built on them. Results and discussion The examination has revealed that there is a statistically traceable relation between the three factors of technical development and the natural production efficiency of farms (Table 1). The experiences prove that the improving level of human resources, chemical and technical resource use is realised in higher production efficiency. The lack of correlation between biological factors refer to the fact that no significant difference can be observed between the performance of biological basis created by breeding. Table 1.

It is, however, far different in the field of mechanization. While the previous aim of farms can be proved in the technological level, the costs of mechanisation (sTMC) contradicts to it and indicates problems in the allocation of technical resources, which means that the farm-level complexity of technical development is damaged.</p><p id="Pg5">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 460 The results of the research prove that the level of technical development in the surveyed farms is improving by the growth of economic size unit, and it can also be traced in the natural efficiency which significantly improves in many cases (Figure 2). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) Economic size categories N at u ra l ef fi ci en cy [G U t ·h a1 ] N at u ra l ef fi ci en cy [G U t ·h a1 ] 200 300 400 500 600 (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) Economic size categories sT T D C (s T M C + sF U + sP U + sB ) [E U R ·h a1 ] sT T D C (s T M C + sF U + sP U + sB ) [E U R ·h a1 ] Figure 2. Boxplot analysis of natural efficiency and costs of technical development on the basis of economic size unit (Source: own construction) As regards the questions of economic efficiency, we have concluded that it is in positive relation with the economic size, too, which can basically be explained with the costs of technical development (Figure 2) The costs connected with machine use (sTMC) have determining part in the total costs. Conclusions In general it can be stated that improving level and consistency can be observed in the technical development of agricultural entreprises, which is realised in – statistically provable - higher natural and economic efficiency, thus reducing the degree of specific abiotic stress. In farms with small and medium size unit, the complex system of technical development is basically broken down in the field of mechanisation, which negatively influences efficiency in economic terms and decreases the competitiveness of farms. There is an adequate solution for the emerging problems in the frames of different forms of cooperation among farmers (e.g. machine rings, machine partnerships, machine cooperatives, etc.). By creating harmony between the pillars, these solutions can evoke small improvement in natural efficiency and great improvement in economic efficiency.

We concluded that after one day of 300 µM Ni exposure, only malate rose considerably, by 260 %, the rest of the OAs rose only slightly. The activity of POX did not change, APX however rose both in roots and in leaves indicating ROS formation and that this enzyme plays part of the detoxification processes in the early phase of Ni exposure. Keywords: heavy metal, nickel (NiSO4) accumulation, organic acids, antioxidative enzyme, ascorbate peroxidase, peroxidase Introduction Plant productivity depends on environmental conditions and whenever the intensity of an environmental stress, such as frost, heat, osmotic, or heavy metal stress (Janda et al., 2003, Ötvös et al., 2003, Balla et al., 2007, Rabnecz et al., 2007, Csiszár et al., 2008) is beyond the detoxifying capacity of plants, new processes are induced, or the activity of ongoing pathways increase. Heavy metals get into- and accumulate in different organs of various plant species (Varga et al, 2002) and their amount has increased significantly in the biosphere (Ötvös et al, 2003) as a consequence of human activity. Ni toxicity is mainly dealt with OAs: Cit and Mal are responsible for chelation and transportation into the vacuoles (Brooks et al., 1981; Tatár et al., 2000). We did not find information whether Ni alters the levels of other OAs or not. Furthermore, Ni toxicity also results in the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Gajewska and Sklodowska, 2007, Szepesi et al., 2008) the induction of which is easily detectable by the measurement of antioxidative enzyme activity. The literature of the initial phase of Ni toxicity and the following detoxification in plants is still poor both in terms of OA and ROS induction (Gajewska and Sklodowska 2007). In our experiment therefore, we investigated the changes of POX and APX and OAs (Ox, Cit, Mal, Suc and Fum) under Ni stress in barley seedlings during one day, moderate (300µM) Ni stress, hoping to characterize the changes of these detoxifying compounds during the primary stage of Ni exposure. Materials and methods Growth conditions: The growth conditions of barley (Hordeum vulgare L. „Triangel”) were according to Hegedős et al., (2001). Ten days old seedlings were treated with half-</p><p id="Pg7">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 462 Hoagland solution containing 300µM NiSO4 for 1 day. Seedlings were sampled for OA, Ni 2+ content determination and also for antioxidative enzyme activity measurement. The experiment was repeated three times, mean values and standard deviation are presented. Ni content measurement: 0.2 g of powdered dry material was dissolved in 2 cm3 of HNO3:H2O2 mixture (1:1 v/v). The Ni content of the filtered solution was determined by an ICAP 61E Plasma Spectrometer (Horváth et al., 1996). OA content measurement: 0.5 g of leaves of barley seedlings were ground in liquid nitrogen and quartz sand in 1 ml distilled water, and after being centrifuged, samples were filtered through a 45 µm nylon membrane and 20 µl was used for the measurement of OAs with RP HPLC (Waters). The peaks were quantified with a Breeze analytical chromatography data system (WATERS) using standards (Merck).Tissue extraction and antioxidative enzyme activity measurement: 0.5 g of barley tissue (root, leaf) was ground in 1,5 ml isolating buffer (0,1 M potassium-phosphate, pH 6,8) then was centrifuged (4 ºC, 20 minutes, 10000 g). The supernatant was used for enzyme activity measurement. The POX activity determination was according to Chance et al (1995), and the APX activity was according to Nakano and Asada (1981). The activity values were calculated as the average of three parallel measurements. Results and discussion Ni accumulates in roots an order of magnitude more compared to that of leaves (Table 1.) that is in accordance with the findings of Yantiang and Marschner (1995). Although roots accumulate more Ni, the level of it started rising in the leaves as well after one day of Ni treatment. Table 1.

The levels of all investigated OAs increased: in roots Ox, Cit, Suc and Fum rose 132, 145, 144 and 112 % respectively, compared to the level of control. Mal, however, showed a sharp increase up to 240 %. In leaves Ox, Cit, Mal, Suc and Fum also rose by 131, 134, 132, 112 and 167 %, respectively. Altogether, Ni stress caused the rise of OA levels generally between 111-167 % during a one-day-treatment. This increase is most probably due to the effect of Ni accumulation, when an overall strain increases the turnover of ATP and for adequate supply of the active metal extrusion from cytoplasm. This leads to higher rate of respiration and thus results in enhanced turnover of OAs of citrate cycle (Lamoreaux and Chaney, 1978). In the xylem sap of cucumber the presence of Cit, Mal and Fum (Tatár et al., 2000) indicates their role in the transport mechanism of Ni. In our short term experiment though, only Mal increased sharply designating that the chelation and transportation of the excess amount of Ni starts even after one day of exposure and Mal may be the major compound if Ni detoxification. When comparing the activities of the two enzymes, POX activity was higher than APX activity: in roots ten times more and five times more active in leaves, as it was found by</p><p id="Pg8">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 463 Figure 1. Changes of OA content under 1 day, 300 µM Ni treatment in barley roots and leaves Hegedős et al (2001). The constitutive POX activity in roots was two or three times higher, than in leaves. This was not true for APX, where roots and leaves showed similar activity (Fig 2). The activity of POX did not change significantly, only root activity increased slightly, either because POX does not play a role in the early detoxification, or barley plants are able to detoxify ROS either with the constitutively high level of POX, or by other non-enzymatic antioxidants (carotenoids, ascorbic acid, glutathione). APX increased both in roots (158 %) and in leaves (163 %) after one day of 300 µM Ni treatment. The activity rise was similar in roots and in leaves probably because Ni is transported to the above ground plant organs shortly after the stress Figure 2. Changes of POX and APX activity under 1 day, 300 µM Ni treatment in barley roots and leaves induction, as the sharp rise of Mal, its chelator, has already indicated it. Also, POX activity is higher than AXP activity both in roots and leaves. This fact can be the reason of the standard activity of the enzyme.

Cereal Research Communications 464 Conclusions We concluded that during one day Ni stress, Mal is the only OA that is possibly responsible for the chelation and transportation. The rise of the other investigated OAs indicated only a respiratory strain induced by Ni. Ni causes ROS formation in the roots and also in the leaves of barley seedlings even in the early phase of Ni stress, when APX has a clear role in the inactivation of ROS. All these indicate a very rapid effect of this metal, and also highlight that although Ni is mainly transported and detoxified with organic acids, after one day of exposure the antioxidative system also joins to detoxify the ROS formed by excess amount of Ni. Further investigations are needed to clarify the exact role of POX in these processes. Acknowledgements This work was supported by OTKA grants T 037748 and M 036652.

The hobby gardens are regularly flooded by the Toka-creek, which carries metal polluted sediment from the abandoned mining area north to the village. Due to the anthropogenic stress the vegetables and crops produced in the area contain high amount of toxic metals, which represents unacceptable risk for humans and other members of the food chain. The metal content of plants was found to be above the limit value for food and fodder. The activity of the soil microflora was lower than in the unpolluted area and the soil was toxic for bacteria, plants and animals, according to ecotoxicological testresults.To reduce the stress posed on soil living organisms and plants, the area is planned to be treated by combined chemical and phytostabilisation, which reduces the mobility of metals and therefore their availability for plants and other organisms. A wide selection of chemical stabilisers was tested in microcosms and field experiments. Due to the most efficient fly ash treatment and the properly selected plants the metal accumulation of plants grown close to the creek decreased by 70–78% thus getting below the limit value. Further away from the creek the lower initial value decreased by 20–50% after treatment. The biological activity of the soil microflora increased and the toxicity of the soil decreased by 16–32% according to bacterial and plant biotests. Keywords: soil, metals, chemical stabilisation, fly ash, phytostabilisation, mining site remediation Introduction The human interaction with the environment cause stress on all the members of the ecosystem (Várallyay, 2006). Mining is one of the most important sources of anthropogenic stress resulting in large disturbed areas contaminated by metals. A complex survey was carried out in the former mining area of Gyöngyösoroszi (Hungary) to assess the impacts of mining activity (Gruiz and Vodicska, 1993). In the hobby garden area south to the village, which is regularly flooded by the Toka-creek transporting metal contaminated sediment from the mining site, metals, such as Zn, Cd, Pb, Cu and As were found above the Hungarian limit value for soil (Horváth and Gruiz, 1996) and high concentration of metals were measured in vegetables, especially in sorrel (Sipter et al., 2008). The results of the environmental survey indicated that the environmental and health risks due to metal contamination are unacceptably high therefore risk reduction is necessary on the site (Gruiz et al, 2007). A complex risk management strategy was developed, which uses GIS based, catchment scale risk assessment (Gruiz et al., 2008). An efficient in situ technology for contaminated soils may be phytoremediation (Kımíves et al. 2003, Máthéné and Anton, 2004, Biró et al. 2005), in our case for the hobby garden area combined chemical and phytostabilisation is the best fitting technology to restrict plant uptake of mobile Zn, Cd and Pb. As chemical stabiliser fly ash was applied to reduce stress. Fly ash proved to be efficient in reducing metal mobility in soil (Vangronsveld et al., 1995) and in mine waste materials (Feigl et al., 2009). The combined chemical and phytostabilisation technology is able to reduce metal transport by all possible pathways: transport by</p><p id="Pg11">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 466 runoff and seepage water, erosion, deflation and plant uptake. Plant uptake is reduced both by chemical treatment restricting metal mobility and by the selection of nonaccumulative plant species (Simon, 2005; Uzinger and Anton, 2008). In this study we present the results of the field experiments applying this technology in one of the most exposed hobby gardens in Gyöngyösoroszi. Materials and methods A 20 m × 60 m field plot was constructed in a regularly flooded hobby garden. Half of the area was treated by 5 w/w% fly ash as chemical stabiliser based on previous microcosm studies (Feigl et al., 2007), the other half was used as an untreated control. Three, previously selected plant species were sown: Zea mays, Sorgum vulgare technicum, Sorgum vulgare sudanense and we applied natural vegetation (invasive weed) as plant control. The experiment was monitored during one growing season by an integrated methodology, the combination of chemical-analytical methods with biological and toxicity testing (Gruiz, 2001). The mobile metal content of the soil was determined after distilled water and ammonium-acetate extraction (pH=4.5), the total metal content was measured after aqua regia digestion by ICP-AES according to Hungarian Standards (MSZ 21470-50:2006; MSZ 21978-9:1998; MSZ 21978-9:1998). The soil biological activity was evaluated by determining the aerob living cell number in soil. The toxicity of the soil was measured by Vibrio fisheri luminescence inhibition test and Sinapis alba root and shoot growth inhibition test applying direct contact with soil. The methods were developed by Gruiz et al. (2001). Dry weights (drying at 70°C, 10 hours) of plants were determined at the end of the growing season. The metal amount accumulated by plants was analysed after nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide (5:1) digestion by ICP-AES. Results and discussion The experimental area was assessed by using a portable XRF device (Tolner et al., 2008), which proved that the concentration of metals in the garden soil is the highest close to the Toka-creek and decreases with the distance. For this reason the area was divided into two parts from the point of view of sampling: within 5 m from the creek and further from it. At the end of the growing season a more detailed assessment was carried out by sampling at 1, 5, 9 and 13 meters from the creek. The most mobile metals in the hobby garden soil are Zn and Cd: 21–29% of the total metal content of soil is extractable by acetate and 4–5% by water (Table 1). Pb and As are less available: only 0.2–0.4% of the total As and Pb content if soil is extractable by acetate and less than 0.1% by water. Table 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 467 The treatment with fly ash resulted 80–82% decrease in the acetate extractable and 92% decrease in the water extractable metal concentrations of the soil near the creak (0–5 m), exposed to frequent floods (Table 1). The total metal contents of the soil did not change because chemical stabilisation aims at reducing the available metal forms, no metal elimination is caused by the stabilisation technology. In the soil 5–10 m from the creek 50% decrease was observed on the effect of the fly ash treatment, due to the lower metal content of the soil.

Acetate extractable metal content of fly ash treated and non-treated soil in function of distance form the creek The fly ash reduced by 20–80% the toxic metal content of the selected stabilizer plants and their metal content decreased under the food and fodder quality criteria in all cases, except for maize. In contrast, the vegetation grown spontaneously (weed) extracted more metals from the fly ash treated soil than from the non-treated control soil (Table 2.). The explanation for the seemingly strange behaviour of weed is that different mixtures of weed were spontaneously grown on the treated and non-treated plots. These results underline the importance of the proper selection and control of plants applied for phytostabilisation. There was no significant difference between the biomass grown on treated and non-treated field plots, some differences were measured in relation to the low lying and as consequence higher moisture content subareas.

Cereal Research Communications 468 toxicity testing of the soils proved the positive effect of the fly ash treatment, 1.5 times higher activity was measured in the treated soil. Plant bioassay of Sinapis alba root and shoot growth inhibition showed that the fly ash treatment caused 30–32% increase in the plant growth in the most contaminated subareas. The most sensitive bioassay, the Vibrio fischeri luminescence inhibition test showed 15% decrease in the toxicity, resulting an EC20 equivalent with 290 mg/kg Cu. Conclusions The fly ash additive decreased the mobility of the Cd, Pb and Zn in toxic metal contaminated agricultural soil at a former mining site. According to our field experiments’ results fly ash is an efficient chemical stabilising agent and combined with suitable phytostabilising plants is a promising environmentally- and cost efficient remediation technology able to reduce environmental risk to an acceptable value.

Global climatic model has been run prediction on monthly basis for the southern Mediterranean part of the Country (Popovo Polje) the percentage decrease of precipitation (25%) and air temperatures increase (2 oC) with respect to mean monthly values for the last fouty years. In our paper we would like just to test how this change could exert influence on the future soil water stress. Keywords: prediction, climate change, modeling, drought, precipitation, evapotranspiration Introduction The increasing concentration of the greenhouse gases emission into atmosphere is altering the earth's radiation balance and causing the temperature to rise. This process provoke the changes which lead to altering the components of hydrological cycle, such as evapotranspiration rate, amount of precipitation, soil moisture, soil water deficit, water surplus and groundwater recharge. Although we have not yet the scientific founded statement about global climate change, some institutions of the today world are offering the models for prediction of these changes. For instance, the UK Hadlley Center’s global climatic model has been run prediction on monthly basis for the southern Mediterranean countries the percentage decrease of precipitation (25%) and air temperatures increase (1,5 to 2,5%) with respect to mean monthly values by the year 2050 (De Wrachien, D., et al., 2002). In our paper we would like just to test how this change could exert influence on the future soil water balance. The area on which we have done the test is the karstic area of Popovo Polje, which is situated at the south part of BiH, very close to Adriatic coast and Dubrovnik area. Materials and methods The soil water balance or budgeting is a method to find out what amount of water is falling upon the soil by precipitation, what amount is infiltrating and holding into the soil, what amount is running off and percolating and finally what amount is evapotranspirating from the soil and plant. The soil water balance or soil water budget because it is real monitor of water input-output through the soil as a hydrological medium. It is a method, which has gained widespread popularity among agronomists, ecologists, geographers, geologists, physicists, hydrologists and others concerned with water problems (Bouchet, 1964; Darves-Bornoz, 1957; Remenieras, 1965; Rense, 1992; Thornthwaite, 1944, 1958; Turc, 1953,1961). The method is based on three entering data, and they are: monthly potential evapotranspiration (PET) in mm calculated by Thornthwaite, monthly precipitation (P) in mm registered in the area and the soil water available reserve (R) which is supposed to be 100 mm. Thornthwaite did the calculation of monthly PET because it is only</p><p id="Pg15">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 470 method for which the unique data of air temperature is being enough for calculation of PET. From these three entering data we got three outcome data such as: real or actual evapotranspiration (RET), soil water deficit or drought effect (D) and soil water surplus (S) or potential outflow (runoff +percolation). In addition, relation of RET/PET is giving coefficient of drought (drought effect) and relation of S/P is giving coefficient of potential outflow (water surplus). The soil water balance for Popovo Polje has been done for long-term times series (fourty years) for two locations (Trebinje and Ravno). The mean long-term data has been used as a base for future predicted calculation. The predicted PET was based on air temperature increase of 2° C and predicted precipitation on 25% decrease. With so predicted calculated data of monthly PET and monthly precipitation the predicted soil water balance was done. Results and discussion Popovo Polje is situated between 42 and 43 of northern geographical latitude and between 17 and 19 of eastern longitude with about 50 km of aerial distance from Dubrovnik under Mediterranean climate. Locations for which soil water budgeting were done are Trebinje and Ravno. Both are on the altitude about of 200-300 m. The mean annual previous data are the result of long-term series soil water budgeting month per month, year per year continuously through the 40 years. Predicted data are calculated on the base of precipitation decrease (25%) and air temperature increase (2, 0 C) for calculation of PET increase. The soil water available reserve (R) is not changed. The change of two entering hydrological parameters precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) has provoked the change of outcome hydrological parameters. The results of change are given in comparative form in table 1. Table 1.

Cereal Research Communications 472 Comparison of these data shows the following changes in the hydrological structure relations: Potential evapotranspiration (PET) was increased on both locations about 7,7%, real (actual) evapotranspiration (RET) was decreased 8,8% in Trebinje and 7,1% in Ravno. Water deficit (D) was increased 119,4% in Trebinje and 131,7% in Ravno, but seasonal occurrence of water deficit (drought) was not changed (July and August) just the intensity of drought was changed. Water surplus (S) was decreased 54,6% in both locations, drought effect coefficient (RET/PET) was changed from 0,88 to0, 75 in Trebinje and from 0,9 to 0,78 in Ravno. Coefficients of outflow (S/P) was changed from 0,58 to 0,49 in Trebinje and from 0,64 to 0,55 in Ravno. The trend of previous annual precipitation in Trebinje (fig.1) shows the light increase what is in contrast to prediction, but in Ravno shows the light decrease (fig. 2.), but both trends are without, enough confidence because the coefficient of determination is very low and scattering of points around the trend line is very high. The trend of previous annual potential evapotranspiration for both locations, shows also the slight decrease (fig. 3.) what is in contrast to prediction. Conclusions The question which is possible to pose in our case is the following: does the prediction of annual precipitation decrease of 25% is realistic? Previous results of trend of annual precipitation couldn’t confirm that because in Trebinje (fig. 1) we have found the inverse situation « id est.» the increasing trend of annual precipitation with higher coefficient of determination than in Ravno (fig. 2), which has a light trend of decrease of annual precipitation. Both trends are with low coefficients of determination, which don’t allow extrapolating their data. Our opinion is that the prediction of precipitation decrease about 25% is overestimated because if the evapotranspiration increases then is really to expect the increasing of precipitation. May be it would be interesting to test the predicted soil water balance without precipitation change and only with predicted increased PET. Finally, our opinion is that is may-be too early to talk about climate change without long-term data available, particularly it is very difficult to generalize this phenomenon.

The aim of this paper is to show how landscape forming factors respond to the environmental stress by giving some examples (soil pollution, changes of groundwater level, natural vegetation and plant production). An example of soil pollution in nearly natural environment is the area along the Orfő-Pécs road in Western Mecsek. We detected that the total cadmium content is higher than the allowed limit in samples taken near the surface, presumably because of an anthropogenic effect. Vehicles travel slowly in the so-called Szuadó-bend because of the sharp hairpin bend and this is why the soil is susceptible to transport-related pollution. Aridification of the sand ridges between the Danube and Tisza Rivers is a serious stress on groundwater as landscape forming factor. Because of aridification, the level of the groundwater sunk 1,5-2 m in the last 25-30 years, and saline lakes between the Danube and Tisza are in a desiccation state. Changes of the vegetation are one of the most apparent examples of the response to stress caused by a decreasing level of groundwater. In this paper, it is attempted to reveal the changes that occurred in the last 25 years by analysing vegetation maps of Szívós-szék and Szappan-szék from different periods. The influence of environmental stress on agricultural production is emphasized by the sensitivity of sandy soils with high organic matter content to nitrate-nitrite pollution. The results of the nitrogen calibration test on soil with good pervious and bad water keeping characteristics show that – depending on groundwater level – pollution due to excessive fertilizing can reach the groundwater after 3-4 years. In case of excessive fertilizing the overdosed fertilizer could also be a stress-factor for cultivated plants. Keywords: environmental stress, soil pollution, aridification, overdose fertilization Introduction Negative influences from the environment appear as stress on landscape forming factors (bedrock, soil, relief, water, vegetation etc.), and some factors have sensitive reactions to these effects. The aim of this paper is to show how landscape forming factors respond to the environmental stress by giving some examples (soil pollution, changes of groundwater level, natural vegetation and plant production). As an example of soil pollution caused by anthropogenic effects we present the cadmium pollution detected in the surroundings of one of the public roads in WesternMecsek. The depression of groundwater level in sand ridges between the Danube and Tisza rivers, and changing in the vegetation as a result of it serve as an example of environmental stress caused by compound effects. The nitrate-nitrite pollution of the soil also exemplifies the possible damages of the excessive fertilization which is an anthropogenic effect.</p><p id="Pg19">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 474 Materials and methods The examination of heavy metal content in the soil sample from Western-Mecsek was performed by aqua regia digestion using an atomic-absorption spectrophotometer. Changes in the vegetation of saline lakes (Szívós-szék and Szappan-szék) between the Danube and Tisza rivers was traced using vegetation maps (Bagi I. 1988.; 1989.; Fehér B. 2004.) from different periods (1988 and 2003). The depression of groundwater level can be demonstrated based on data from groundwater detecting wells in the surroundings of the saline lakes. The detection of nitrification caused by excessive nitrogen fertilization was made possible by applying the provocative fertilizer amounts of the nitrogen calibration test set up in Kisfái Research Farm of Kecskemét College. The arrangement of the experiment is a two-factor stripped split-plot with four repetitions. The amount of nitrogen fertilisers per hectare delivered on the main plots was 0, 150, 300 and 450 kgs. In the control plots and in plots treated with 450 kg ha -1 doses deep boring was applied 6 m deep. Then the nitrate-nitrite content of the soil samples from wet samples were measured in the Plant and Soil Testing Laboratory of the Institute of Environment Science. Data were calculated based on 100% dry matter content. Results and discussion Mecsek is one of the most diverse mountains in Hungary. Similarly to its geological diversity the soil types and natural vegetation also show great regional variation. Industry and transport related heavy metal pollution and acidic sedimentation causing soil acidification are the most important environmental stress factors. Considering its dominant soil types, primarily strongly acidic non-podsolic brown forest soil appearing on sandstone bedrock and pseudo-gley brown forest soil react to the pollution with decreasing pH values. The western part of Mecsek is situated near the mining area of Komló and the industrial area of Pécs. The mines – with a few exceptions – have already been closed, the industry is, however, still in operation. The spoils and ventilation-shafts of the former coal and uranium mines and the operating industry represent a potential source of danger and a stress factor. The heavy metal content detected in most of the soils of the area is low, but in a few cases (e.g. cadmium) it reaches or exceeds the environmental limit value. Cadmium content exceeding the limit value (higher than 1 mg kg -1 ) was detected in 7 samples (Table 1), most of which came from near the surface, that presumes an anthropogenic origin. Table 1.

Vehicles travel slowly in the socalled Szuadó-bend because of the sharp hairpin bend and this is why the soil is susceptible to transport-related pollution. Recent aridification that concerns primarily the sand ridges between the Danube and Tisza rivers in Hungary, manifests itself most pronounced in the changes in groundwater level and vegetation among the landscape forming factors. Aridification as environmental stress became one of the most serious present-day problems (Hoyk E. et. al. 2007.). Unfavourable changes in the natural environment are indicated by the aridification of the saline lakes on the sand ridges. On average, the level of groundwater sunk 1,5-2 metres on the sand ridges during the past 30-40 years, reaching 6-7 metres at some places. As a consequence, vegetation is also changing, which is one of the most obvious examples of the responses to stress. By comparing the vegetation maps of Szappan-szék and Szívós-szék beside Fülöpháza created in different periods, the changes on natural phytocoenosis level occurring during the past 20 years can be exposed. In case of Szappan-szék, by the end of the 1980s the place of the open air lake was not taken over by a saline swamp as it was expected parallel with the slow aridification; blind salt vegetation settled on the drying lake ground instead. At around the turn of the millennium rapid changes took place in the amount of precipitation and groundwater level (in 1999 record amount of precipitation, in 2000 record height of groundwater level). As a consequence, in 2003, a kind of “rearrangement” towards the wetter period of the time before the 1970’s can be observed. Due to its larger size and larger local catchment area, Szívós-szék is less exposed to the extreme effects; therefore its vegetation shows a more gradual drying. The place of the former open lake was taken over by a saline swamp by 1988, which was followed by vegetation zones typical of saline lakes on the basin borders. By 2003, the former zonation pattern decayed; practically the whole lake-basin was occupied by salt meadow with its fresher and drier variations, while the saline swamp and the reedy phytocoenosis disappeared completely. Environmental stress also exerts an adverse influence on agricultural production. In the region between the Danube and Tisza rivers, areas with sandy bedrock belong to the environmentally sensitive category. The soils and the groundwater of these areas are both endangered by nitrification, if nutrients are not supplied adequately. It also has an influence on the quantitative and qualitative indices of agricultural production. In our experiment on sandy soil with humus around Kecskemét we set a high starting nitrogen supply, the marking plant was sweet corn (Buzás I. et. al. 2008.). Among the quantitative indices of the yield both the grain-dry matter yield and the non-husked corn ear yield decreased parallel with the excessive nitrogen supply (Buzás I. et. al. 2006.). In case of good pervious and bad water keeping characteristics on sandy soil with humus the nitrate-nitrite pollution went down in the ground about one meter in half a year. Then, in the next one and a half year the pollution dispersed, and in the zone from 1 meter to 2,5 meters depth high nitrate-nitrite concentration could be revealed (Fig. 1). Depending on groundwater level, pollution due to excessive fertilizing can reach the groundwater after 3-4 years. In case of excessive fertilizing the overdosed fertilizer could also be a stress-factor for cultivated plants.</p><p id="Pg21">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 476 Figure 1. NO3-N content of soils on experimental field in three different periods (mg kg -1) Conclusions In the territory of Western-Mecsek, the greatest stress factor today is transportation. As a consequence of this, the heavy metal content (primarily the cadmium content) of soil samples taken from the road crossing this area exceeds the environmental limit value in a few cases. In the case of the saline lakes between the Danube and Tisza rivers the natural vegetation structure broke down on large areas due to the adverse climatic changes of the past decades. The ability of the phytocoenosis to adapt to rapid changes has been impaired, which predicts that the former natural vegetation would eventually break up. The changes in the vegetation of Szappan-szék and Szívós-szék are reactions to the environmental stress and they confirm the unfavourable tendencies of our changing climate. For crops, the excessive amount of fertilizers spread during the vegetation period may appear as a stress factor, in the case of deeper soil layers and groundwater level, however, the time of fertilization is not as important. The high nitrate content of the soil poses a danger only if it reaches and pollutes ground water. References Bagi I.

According to our research, the changes of hydrological factors significantly influence the landscape in a relatively short period of time. The water shortage observed in the Danube-Tisza Interfluve has a stress-like effect not only on the vegetation but on soils and landcover at many places. We managed to show that the area of wetlands is continuously decreasing. The soils sensible to hydrological effects have transformed and we could observe ‘forced migration’ in case of certain habitat types. Keywords: climatic change, soil, groundwater, stress, habitat changes Introduction Due to the global warming at least 50-80 mm precipitation decrease can be observed in Hungary in the last few decades. The main consequence of this process is the sinking of the groundwater table, especially in the case of the Danube-Tisza Interfluve. The changes starting in the 1980s were first noticed by the nature conservation, since the number of bird species breeding in the wetlands significantly decreased (Iványosi, 1994) (indicating the shrinkage of wetlands). It has became evident by the end of the 1980s, that there is a significant groundwater-sinking in the area causing serious problems for farming. At the beginning of the 1990s groundwater-sinking has reached such a degree that scientists realised the importance to make clear the role of the natural and antropogenic changes. They established that both natural and antropogenic processes are responsible for the changes to a similar degree (Pálfai, 1994). Our geoinformatic analysis beginning in the end of the 1990s proved that climatic processes (directly or indirectly) are the most determinent factors (Rakonczai–Bódis, 2001). Further on we managed to reveal that the water shortage significally transforms the landscape even in two decades. The results of the VAHAVA project in Hungary proved as well that climatic changes have significant effect on Hungarian landscape factors (Várallyay, 2007a). In this way monitoring and sustainability must be the most important tasks for recent landscape researches to protect ’conditionally renewable natural resources’ (Várallyay, 2007b) like soils and vegetation. Materials and methods In our survey we examined groundwater level sinking on the entire Danube-Tisza Interfluve and determined the scale of the water shortage by softwares Surfer 8 and ArcMap 9.2. Satellite images and map surveys were applied to estimate the changes of wetlands. On a sample area located on the Danube-Tisza Interfluve we analised the effect of the decreased groundwater-level on the soil and the vegetation. Measurements of soil parameteres followed the Hungarian patents.</p><p id="Pg23">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 478 Results and discussion Detailed surveys showed that the sinking of the groundwater level is a complex process in which antropogenic effects strenghten natural causes. The most important factors are: precipitation shortage, increasing exploitation of artesian water, more intensifying irrigation due to precipitation shortage, canals and other water extraction facilities, finally landuse changes. It is important to mention in respect of the groundwater-flow in the Danube-Tisza Interfluve, bordered by the two great rivers, has got a high elevation forming a ridge, thus precipitation is the only source of groundwater supply. The role of the two main rivers can be felt only in a narrow zone. In areas mostly affected by the changes it was observed that the sinking of groundwater table is in strong connection with the relief. On certain parts of the area groundwater level is much more strongly related to the meteorological background. This way a wetter period can contribute to the restoration of the previous state. These things support the fact that shortage can be traced back to the climate, which is becoming increasingly drier. The effect of more humid periods can be felt less and less on areas with highly decreasing groundwater level. Wet periods (like the second part of the 1990s, the beginning of 2000, 2005 and 2006) can moderate the water shortage of the whole region, but the extent of the area seriously affected by water shortage changes almost nothing. The degree of changes can be demonstrated with two data. On the one hand, the sinking of groundwater has reached 6-7 meters since the 1970s’ level at higher parts of the Danube-Tisza Interfluve. On the other hand, based on geoinformatic analyses, the water shortage of the last 30 years is about 5 billion m 3 (Fig. 1/A), which is approximately the annual total water consumption of the whole country! The detailed evaluation of more than two hundred groundwater wells with factor analysis showed that the higher parts of the interfluve behave differently than other areas (for example the effect of more humid periods is less significant). In these areas permanent unfavourable groundwater-sinking is observed, which has a stress-like effect not only on the vegetation but on soils and landcover at many places. Figure 1. Water-shortage, A. its degree on the Danube-Tisza Interfluve, B. its value related to the 1970s Surveys have shown that the extent of wetlands decreased significantly. In the analysis remotely sensed data and maps were overlain. The early spring extension of lakes was compared (Fig. 2), as the area of water surfaces is the largest in this period of the year. One or two really humid periods are not enough to stop the harmful processes.</p><p id="Pg24">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 479 Figure 2. Changes in the extent of wetlands between 1882 and 2006 in the Danube-Tisza Interfluve Although, the alteration of soil genetical types usually takes centuries, the groundwatersinking observed on the Great Hungarian Plain can significantly modify this process even in decades. The investigations on the Szabadkígyós steppe (Rakonczai et al, 2008) showed that the changed vertical transfer of water and salt infers the alteration of the genetical soil type: the protected sodified area became not at all or hardly saline due to leaching and steppification processes. Our sample area is located on the border of the Illancs Sand Hills and the Bácska Loess Plateau (Fig. 1/B), which is in one of the most critical area in terms of groundwater-sinking. The first soil science mapping of the area was in 1949 in the course of the national soil mapping project initiated and led by Lajos Kreybig. The survey was based on field work and laboratory analyses, and cathegorised most of the area as a second class, more saline region. The agrotopographical map database determines the area as solonchak-solonetz. We repeated the measurements in 2008. Soil sampling was made at the 1949 sampling point. Figure 3. The change of pH, total salt content and humus content between 1949 and 2008 The examinations showed that the salt content and pH have decreased since 1949 (Fig. 3). Due to the present low level of groundwater (6-7 m below ground surface) the effect of water does not predominate in the examinated soil profile, however, the presence of different forms of iron refer to the past effects of water. The structure of the upper soil horizon is grained and crumby, and increasingly similar to the appropriate levels of meadow chernozem. Soil organic matter measurements were not made in 1949, the results of the 2008 analysis show significant humus accumulation in the upper 20-40 cm (Fig. 3), which refers to the process of steppification. The field observations and the measured parameters point on the fact that the soil has a ”meadow solonetz turning into steppe formation” type at present. The local and regional patterns of fen and saline habitats were examined at many places during the last years at the edge of the Sand Ridge (Biró et al, 2007; Deák, 2006). The fen head-saline foot local habitat pattern of the deflation hollows - meaning that in the northwestern part of the depressions fens, whereas in their southeastern parts saline habitats can be found - described in the Dorozsma-Majsa Sandlands, appears at the edge</p><p id="Pg25">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 480 of the meeting point of sand and loess covered microregions too. The formation of habitat patterns is explained by groundwater-flows moving from the middle part of the Sand-ridge toward its edges (Deák, 2006). In our sample area this local vegetation pattern was also found. The remains of fen and saline habitats can be identified, but as a consequence of groundwater-sinking these habitats transformed into sand steppe grasslands or steppic subassociations of the former wetter habitats. In the northern part of the area the remains of the fen habitats (Molinia fens, sedgefields) are more frequent indicating groundwater up-wellings coming from the middle part of the Illancs. The sinking of the groundwater resulted the spread of hawthorn on the Monilia fen, and the shift of vegetation zones: the sandy steppe took the place of the Monilia fen in the deflation hollows, whereas the Monilia fen moved into the channel that intersects the sample area. The dried, steppe-like, degrading varieties of saline meadows – last remains of the former saline vegetation – can be recognised only in the middle part of the sample area. These consist of Festuca arundinacea (it refers to sand sheet burial) and Agrostis stolonifera, but the ratio of Dactylis glomerata and Festuca pseudovina exceeds their coverage referring to steppisation, which also is shown by other sand steppe-grasslands species such as the Ononis spinosa. The higher proportion of Agropyron repens and Poa angustifolia refers to the leaching of these saline meadows. The previously saline meadows transformed totally into sand steppe-grasslands in most blow-outs in the northern and southern part of the area losing absolutely their previous saline species composition. Conclusions Our research revealed that climatic changes, beyond their well-noticable direct effects, have more consequences than it was previously assumed. For example, precipitation decrease resulted groundwater-sinking on the Danube-Tisza Interfluve which causes significant damages not only for farming, it also changes the natural vegetation, and moreover, it significantly alters soils. However, by desalinisation soils become more productive, such protected saline areas can also disappear at the same time which were once important parts of the natural vegetation.

This water storage differs by from free water its properties. To utilize this stored water vegetation has to have a well developed root system with such suction pressure as to be able to surmount the bond of water with the soil. Energetic bond of water to soil is quantified by the moisture retention curve. Its characteristic points are: field water capacity (FWC), point of decreased accessibility (PDA), and wilting point (WP). These characteristics determine water accessibility for the vegetation root system. Time course of water in the soil aeration zone can be determined by direct monitoring. Comparison of its values with characteristic points determines the state of water supply storage for vegetation. Its critical state for vegetation cover corresponds to the wilting point. Storage drop to this point causes the state of drought, and the vegetation decay, as a consequence. In the presented paper, results are described of the monitored water, stored in two soil types in localities around Hurbanovo (Slovakia) community, and their evaluation with respect to critical state for the vegetation cover. Moisture measurements with respect to water storage were performed by the weighing (gravimetric) method, as well as by the TDR method. Keywords: soil water storage, monitoring of soil moisture, soil moisture regime. Introduction Water resource for agricultural plants is the water storage in soils. How, and if, it will fulfil its role in the production process during the vegetation period, depends on its amount as well as on the soil characteristics and the cultivated plants (Várallyay, 2007; Hagyó et al., 2007; Neményi-Milics, 2007; Gusev-Novák, 2007 Koltai et al., 2008). For assessment of the vegetation cover interaction with the above mentioned soil aeration zone water storage, are on the conventional base (Kutílek, 1978) selected following characteristic points (CP): • Wilting point (WP), corresponding to pF= 4.18 value (unsufficient permanent soil moisture at which the vegetation for lack of water wilts away). • Point of limited accessibility (PLA), corresponding to pF= 3.3 value (soil moisture at which the plants physiological processes are limited by insufficiency of water). • Field water capacity (FWC), corresponding to pF= 2.0 to 2.7 (soil moisture lasting for a relatively longer time in the soil profile, with sufficient soil aeration for plants further development). It follows from the definition, that this soil state does not correspond to an equilibrium and thus is defined by a moisture potential interval (pF=2 for sandy soils, pF=2.4 for earth clays, and pF=2.7 for loamy soils). A disposable soil water resource for biosphere is that located in the soil aeration zone, corresponding to energetic bond of water with the solid soil phase, between the FWC and the WP (Gomboš 2008; Tall 2008). In this connection it is necessary to mention that unsaturated water storage between the FWC and the WP (FWC-WP) represents an „existence“ water storage interval for vegetation cover, on a given land locality. This is because only in this interval is the water for it accessible in the unsaturated zone. Therefore, this water storage does not</p><p id="Pg27">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 482 have the properties of free water. To be able to use it, plants have to have a well developed root system with such suction pressure, to surmount the bond between soil and water. Up-to-date plant production technologies – especially site specific or precision farming – investigate the possibilities to utilize this attribute of the soil (Jolánkai-Németh, 2007; Milics-Neményi, 2008) It is also necessary to mention how these water storages are determined. The mostly used methods are based on the direct soil moisture measurements (Kordik-Lichner, 1996), or on computational methods based upon meteorological characteristics. These methods do not reflect the water requirements by plants, which changes with its ontogenesis, physiological development. Such physiological methods for characterizing aeration zone water storage, based upon such plants characteristics in their critical development stages, are more useful and effective, because they reflect better the soil water utilization. Methods based on morphological plant marks monitoring, e.g. of their wilting marks (WP), indicate reliably water insufficiency (Štekauerová-Nagy, 2006). However, such indication usually comes too late, because in such state the plants already show some physiological damage. Water regime optimization methods based upon physiological indicators of plants are objective and very sensitive. They characterize the water state within the plant body, and indicate the need of water still in time, when the plant did not suffer any damage yet. Such indicators are: plant water potential, osmotic potential, leaf diffuse resistance, leaf water saturation deficit, etc. Optimization methods for water need determination, based upon physiological indicators, follow a real water requirement by plants, their deviation from the normal state. They also ensure the highest effectivity of the aeration zone water utility. But the mentioned physiological indicators require demanding experimental instruments; therefore their applications are relatively limited, in Slovakia almost unused. For this reason, here are used those based on critical characteristics of the moisture retention curve, FWC, PLA, and WP. Materials and methods For determination of real soil zone of aeration water storage on the locality Hurbanovo (Slovakia), monitoring was organized in 2008 with one month frequency. Measurement was performed by weighing and TDR methods, from the soil surface up to the 130 cm depth, at 10 cm horizon intervals (weighing method), and in horizons 0-15 cm, and 1530 cm by the TDR method. For the monitoring, the following localities were selected: 1st locality: CS clay-sandy soil (I.category particles content between 10 and 20 %), on the northern edge of Hurbanovo comunity (α = 47 o 53 ´ 39,7 ´´ , λ = 18 o 12´08´´ ), 2nd locality: C clay soil (I. cat. 30 – 45 % ), on the western Hurbanovo edge (α = 47 o 52 ´ 40,2 ´´ , λ = 18 o 10´58,6´´). For selection of the localities, the groundwater level elevation was taken into account. Its location from a critical depth under the soil surface favourably influences the soil aeration zone water balance. This critical depth depends directly upon the plants, cultivated on these localities. Time course of the groundwater levels in the Hurbanovo surroundings, is under a strong influence of water levels in the Danube and Váh rivers. Groundwater table in locality 1 is in depth of appr. 7 meters, that of locality 2 in depth appr. 4 meters.</p><p id="Pg28">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 483 Results and discussion By soil moisture measurements from the soil surface, i.e. from z = 0 up to the depth of 130 cm, data series were obtained of the volumetric soil moisture, for the two Hurbanovo localities. Processing of these data into those of soil aeration zone water storage in the 100cm deep layer were performed with the aim of evaluation of the plants water supply. In this process, water storage was taken into account, corresponding to the WP. For their determination for various soil types on the monitored localities, the pedotransfer functions were used (Štekauerová et al., 2003). On Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, in a graphical form, time courses of the monitored water storage WP on localities 1 and 2, in the vegetation period of the 2008 year can be seen, together with the water storage values corresponding to storage at the WP.

Cereal Research Communications 484 Conclusions Comparison of results of the soil aeration zone water storage organized monitoring, on the two localities in 2008, yields more results. The first one is the documented and known fact that water storage in the soil aeration zone depends upon the soil type. In Fig. 1, it can be seen a gradual development of the soil water storage volume from the beginning of the year until November. Water storage decreases in May-June under the wilting point. As a consequence, the harvest has dropped considerably. Because the groundwater table was at 6-7 m depth, capillary rise from water table was zero. Another situation can be seen in results presented in Fig. 2. The water storage time course has not dropped to the wilting point. Its lowest values have been reached in June. In this case, the harvest has not been influenced negatively. One of the reasons is the fact, that on this locality, the groundwater table was at depth appr. at 4 meters below the soil surface. In that case, the sunflower root system was supplied by the capillary rise from the groundwater table.

Here, the diversity of plants is the result of locally different conditions – often extreme ones (such as drought and overheating of the surface, toxicity of the substrate, erosion, etc.). At initial stages, phytocenoses, which are not rich in the number of species and which usually have a dominant edificator species, emerge here. The abiotic stress in the spoil heaps is a regular and predictable phenomenon. The theory of primary strategies, represented by the relations of stress, disturbance and competition, was applied. A general diagram of succession development of vegetation in the spoil heaps in the North Bohemia has been prepared; the basic concept is the concept of C-S-R strategies here. The stress-tolerant taxa are determined by the conditions of these anthropogenic areas, i.e. these species are diagnostic indicators for an environment strongly burdened with stress factors (S-strategists). On the other hand, there are species well adapted to unpredictable disturbances (R-strategists); these often include field weeds and ruderal plants. Competitive C-strategists grow in the relatively stable habitats of spoil heaps areas. They are able to resist stress and disturbance only with difficulties. The C-S-R life strategies represent intersections based on the principle of the compromise of profits and losses. Keywords: spoil heaps, CSR strategy, succession, stress tolerance Introduction In the spoil heaps, which are formed by upper soils (predominantly mine waste) being heaped in the process of open-cast mining of coal, there are especially unfavourable conditions for growth and development of plants. In spite of that, natural vegetation takes hold there, strengthening the surface, limiting water and wind erosion, reducing the temperature of the surface layers of dump-site clay and the air layers near the ground. Between the borderline limits, represented by the primary C-S-R strategies, the most significant and systematically acting stress factors are present in the spoil heaps, virtually until the reclamation measures are carried out (including crops, e.g. Hejnak et al., 2008; Tuma et al., 2008). In the particular stages of a specific succession, the stresstolerant taxa (S-strategists), besides the plants adapted to various disturbances (Rstrategists), also have a strong presence in the spoil heaps areas. The competitive species (C-strategists) would be present substantially later but the natural succession is usually interrupted by reclamation of various types (forest or agricultural reclamation and the like). Materials and methods The subject matter of the research consisted of the extensive areas of variously old nonreclamation spoil heaps in a north region of the Czech Republic. For example, the spoil heap called "Radovesická" occupies more than 1,000 ha. This area consists mainly of materials of Tertiary origin; sand and white-grey illitic and kaolinitic clays with coal admixture predominate here. These soils are very poor in the basic nutrients, with unfavourable water characteristics, grain size and chemical characteristics. The vegetation in spoil heaps was studied by means of floristic and phytocenological methods; for example by Prach (1987), analogously. For morphological classification</p><p id="Pg31">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 486 by a diacritical method, analysis of signs or their variation range, determination and nomenclature is in accordance with Kubat et al. (2002). In individual locations, the list of species of higher plants was made or the presence of species was assessed according to a semi-quantitative five-grade scale. The vegetation was being systematically assessed in the period from 1995 to 2007. With respect to C-S-R strategies, the vegetation was being assessed in the years 2001 through 2007. The method of identifying three types of primary strategies, represented by specific taxa according to the relations among disturbance, stress and competition was used (Grime et al., 1990; Harper, 1977). The basic principle is the different adaptability of plants in the conditions of the special environment of the spoil heaps areas, with various capabilities of growth, development, reproduction and proliferation. The strategies were classified according to the following assessment criterion: limitation of the production of biomass as a result of the action and combination of the disturbance, stress and competition factors. Results and discussion Adaptation to the habitat is a manifestation and consequence of the strategy of a species. The types of primary strategies, significantly differentiated in the spoil heaps, are represented by the relevant species taxa present in the succession development or significantly predominating in these anthropogenic areas. Between the borderline versions (strategies) stated below, there are smooth transitional forms (such as an R-C continuum), in compliance with Hunt et al. (2004). A) Species adapted to disturbances, R-strategists (ruderal). They are often invasive plants, penetrating to various habitats of spoil heaps and they are usually less demanding in terms of the fluctuating soil moisture; they are resistant and capable of existing on the slopes and ridges of these hills made of mine waste. Losses resulting from high mortality in the new successive conditions of the spoil heaps and with frequent disturbance changes are usually replaced through massive reproduction, production of a high number of seeds. They are plants with a relatively short life cycle; they include a number of typical weeds and ruderal plants. In the relatively fresh spoil heaps areas, there is the R-selective environment with the plants having this life strategy (or approximating this strategy) and later on, very roughly after three or four years, the stress-tolerant taxa (see below) usually start to dominate more or less. Atriplex sagittata, Sinapis arvensis, Tripleurospermum inodorum, Lactuca serriola, Sisymbrium altissimum, Chenopodium album, Senecio viscosus, etc. | B) Species typical of an environment burdened with stress, which they resist relatively well, S-strategists (stresstolerant). Stress is a more or less constant factor in the spoil heaps areas; the stress is of long-term nature and it is predictable to a considerable degree. For example, it is caused by a long-term lack of water, high temperature of the surface, the presence of a toxic compound in the substrate or a long-term lack of certain nutrients. Stress is a fundamental phenomenon limiting or determining the growth and development of populations. The stress-tolerant taxa are species, which are predominantly perennial, with well-developed underground organs, often ensuring intensive reproduction and proliferation. Some of the species mentioned below (such as Calamagrostis or Epilobium) form virtually monocultural vegetation in the North Bohemian spoil heaps areas for several years. Calamagrostis epigejos, Tussilago farfara, Epilobium</p><p id="Pg32">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 487 angustifolium, Equisetum arvense, Cirsium arvense, Rumex crispus, Polygonum lapathifolium, etc. | C) The species featuring considerable competitiveness in the given environment with stable conditions and with other species are called C-strategists (competitive). They have relatively low resistance to stress and disturbance; they usually grow in a suitable environment. In the spoil heaps areas, they can take hold after many years. The basic objective of forestation and other rehabilitations is also to create (through actions and measures carried out by man, however) an environment providing conditions favourable for growth and development of C-strategists so that with their vitality, they perform as best as possible in competition with the other plants. C-strategy is generally characteristic of woody plants (especially trees) and many forest perennial plants, etc. Under the extraordinary and diverse conditions of the environment in the spoil heaps, the vegetation, including the succession, is influenced by a number of factors. Besides abiotic conditions of the habitat, there are also biological aspects such as the content of diasporas in the soil, the supply of diasporas from the surroundings, the content of fragments of roots and offshoots of perennial species capable of growth and development (they often start secondary succession). At the initial stages of development of the vegetation in the spoil heaps areas, there are usually very poor phytocenoses with a dominant edificator species (see Figure 1). Approximately for a period of three years after the dumping of mine waste is terminated, annual plants from among R-strategists significantly predominate; the first species are usually ruderal plants and weeds. During the next period (approximately 10 years), the perennial species of S-strategist plants start to grow and their presence increases. Also, woody plants and grasses appear and proliferate. c.

Cereal Research Communications 488 Conclusions In the special, highly diverse and often extreme environment of the spoil heaps areas consisting of the material (waste rock) removed in the process of open-cast coal mining in the region of North Bohemia, there are various levels of adaptability of plant species. Based on the main assessment criterion – limitation of the production of biomass by the limiting factors – the vegetation was assessed here in accordance with the concept of the primary disturbance, stress and competition strategies. The characteristics of these strategies are stated and the significant species in the spoil heaps areas are stated as examples in this context (R-strategists, ruderal plants; S-strategists, stress-tolerant plants; C-strategists, competitive plants). At the initial stages of the vegetation, during the first years after the upper soils were dumped in the area, annual herbs, often ruderal species and weed species, with good adaptation to disturbances, are the dominant taxa. At the following succession stages, the increasing presence of perennial, often stresstolerant herbs as well as woody plants and some graminoids is characteristic. The composition of the plant species is influenced by the specific conditions in the individual spoil heaps areas, including the composition, mixing and possible toxicity of the substrate, the irrigation and nutritional conditions, etc. The effect of the surrounding vegetation and proliferation of diaspores, anthropogenic activities and other factors can also be important. The clearly organised diagram shows the development of vegetation in the North Bohemian spoil heaps areas as concerns the basic general presence of the most significant species taxa.

Relevant input data for solving of water transport in the soil are hydrophysical characteristics, among others. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is a critical value for soil water regime. Objective of this study is to compare values of hydraulic conductivity estimated by two methods based on the in situ measurement techniques (by Guelph permeameter - KGP, and by disc permeameter - KDP) and a laboratory technique - KS. The hydraulic conductivity values measured by disc permeameter were estimated in the near saturated state. The preferential paths were eliminated in this case. All measurements of hydraulic conductivity were performed in the field in Sintava in 3 verticals with maiz, capsicum, and dividing line of maiz-capsicum, and in Gabcikovo in 2 verticals with maiz, and millet. The KGP–values and also KS–values are higher than KDP–values in both verticals in Gabčíkovo in depth 30– 40cm under the soil surface. KGP measured in maiz is 2,6- times higher than KGP measured in millet. It is possible, that this soil layer contents more preferential paths in maize than the same soil layer contents in millet. The KDP–values are very close in both verticals, KS – values are characterized by the highest variance. Keywords: saturated hydraulic conductivity, Guelph permeameter, disc permeameter Introduction Interest in the soil profile water motion is concentrated upon problems related to preservation of the optimum unsaturated soil layer water content for use through plants and to complementation and pollution of groundwaters (Koltai et al., 2008; Neményi – Milics, 2007; Milics – Neményi, 2008). Recently, much effort has been spent on creation of mathematical theories of water motion under various initial and boundary conditions. These resulted in development of mathematical models, which describe the water motion in the soil-water-atmosphere system. Simulation of several water motion processes in a real soil by mathematical models requires an adequate knowledge of the hydrophysical soil characteristics in the locality of interest. It is much complicated to allocate real properties to soils through the hydrophysical characteristics (Gusev – Novák, 2007; Kotorová – Mati, 2008.), because of general heterogeneity of the field soils. To the basic hydrophysical characteristics belong the retention curve and the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity. The saturated hydraulic conductivity K has a key role in mathematical modelling, because it characterizes the soil ability to transport water also in the preferred paths presence. The saturated hydraulic conductivity values depend, inter alia, also upon the measurement method. For water motion simulation under field conditions, it is always appropriate the K values to determine in the same field conditions. It is the aim of this study to compare the saturated hydraulic conductivity values measured by the laboratory method, with the values measured directly in the field. Materials and methods The saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements were performed in the south Slovakia localities Sintava (catchment of Vah) and Gabcikovo (catchment of Danube). In the first locality, the measurements were made in three different verticals, and in various horizons in each, in autumn. The first vertical was located in a maize field, the</p><p id="Pg35">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 490 second one in a capsicum field, and the third vertical was located on boundary of the both above fields (maize - capsicum). In all three verticals, first was measured the matrix saturated conductivity (KDP) on the soil surface (about 1cm under soil surface). It was done by a disc permeameter at an applied moisture potential hw = -1.7cm, i.e. in a state when the soil is saturated with water, but the water flow through the preferred paths is still excluded. After the KDP values were measured, the soil sample was taken into the cylinders (100cm 3 ). Thereafter, in all three verticals at a 30 cm depth, the saturated hydraulic conductivity KGP was measured by a Guelph permeameter (model 2800K1, Soilmoisture Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA), with a 6 cm borehole. Then again in all three verticals, at a 32 cm depth, the soil matrix conductivity was measured by a disc permeameter, at hw = -1.7cm, and the samples were taken into the cylinders (100cm 3 ) after the measurements. At the end, in all verticals at depths 61 and 90 cm, the saturated hydraulic conductivities were measured by a Guelph permeameter. Similar measurements were performed in the Gabcikovo locality, but only in two verticals. The first one was located in the maize field, the second in the field with a millet vegetation cover. In laboratory, on all cylinders, the saturated hydraulic conductivities were measured by the falling hydraulic head method. The granulometry of soil samples was determined by the densometric method, and the CaCO3 content was measured too. Results and discussion The soil granulometry, determined from the cylinders soil samples, in all verticals on the both localities, is summarized in table 1, together with some other physical soil characteristics.

This was not expected, and apparently does not correspond to reality. It is difficult to discuss the cause of this result only on a single measurement result. It is also possible to assume that some fault could occur at measurement or when taking the sample. In the second vertical (capsicum), the conductivity relations appear quite opposite, KGP = 3.04 KDP, KS = 30.62 KDP. In the third vertical, the KGP value appeared to be negative.

Cereal Research Communications 492 were considerably different (Wu, et al., 1993). The KGP values are determined by the relationship : 1r2r bkak QQKGP −= , where a = 0.0041, b = 0.0054 and kr are parameters indicated by manufacturer. Q1 and Q2 are the stationary flow velocities of water, infiltrating into the soil in the case when the borehole water level remains at level 5 or 10 cm. If KGP &lt; 0, then the flow velocities Q1 and Q2 are related as Q2 &lt; 1.317 Q1. In the third vertical, the relationship between Q1 and Q2 is : KS = 4.40 KDP. At the Gabcikovo at 30–40 cm horizons, it is again possible to compare all the three methods used for saturated hydrulic conductivity measurements. In the first vertical KGP = 49,10KDP, KS= 3,92 KDP, in the second vertical (millet) KGP=19.23KDP, KS=1.97KDP. On all negative KGP values, already mentioned conclusions are valid. The saturated hydraulic conductivity values measured laboratory methods on cylinders (KS) are characterized by the highest variance. Conclusions Within this study, saturated hydraulic conductivities were measured in two localities of south Slovakia – Sintava and Gabcikovo. At Sintava, in three verticals located in fields with maize, capsicum, and at boundary of the both above fieds maize- capsicum. At Gabcikovo, there were two verticals in fields with maize and millet vegetation. It was confirmed that the saturated hydraulic conductivities, measured by laboratory method, show the highest variance. It was ascertained that the Geulph permeameter measured conductivities (KGP) and the laboratory method measured values (KS) are higher, than those measured by the disc permeameter (KDP), in horizons 30 to 40 cm, in the both verticals of the Gabcikovo locality. This witnesses presence of the preferred paths, both in maize as well as in the millet fields. The maize measured KGP value is higher by a 2.6 multiple than the same measured in millet field. It is probably also due to the preferred paths presence, which are more contained in maize than in the millet fields. The KDP values measured in both fields with those vegetation covers, are practically the same.

Linkages with surface water, the land surface and the land use are numerous and extend over many different timescales. The aim of this paper is to evaluate quality of water at the part of the Danube Lowland – the east half of the Rye Island (Žitný Ostrov). This area is one of the most productive agricultural area of Slovakia, so it is very important to deal with pollution stresses in it. On the other hand, agricultural production depends also on accessibility of water by the plant roots. Groundwater level is regulated by channel network in this region. For that the next aim of the paper is to evaluate quantity of water flows through unsaturated zone of soils at this part of Rye Island area. It means to investigate and analyse the silting of the channel network and influence of the silt on the groundwater recharge. Next we tried to investigate the impact of the recharge changes on the water flow from the groundwater into an unsaturated zone of soil for some agricultural plants in their different ontogenesis phases. In this paper there were used results of field measurements and computer simulations. Keywords: water resources, quality, quantity, agri-environment, Rye Island (Slovakia) Introduction Rye Island is a part of the Danube Lowland, it is one of the most productive agricultural areas of Slovakia. For this reason it is very important to deal with quantity and quality of water resources at this region and their impact on biomass production. Many specialists have studied this complex problem: Balážová et al. (2002), Štekauerová – Nagy (2007), Gusev – Novák (2007), etc. This paper makes a contribution to solving this problem at Rye Island – especially along Gabčíkovo-Topoľníky channel. In this paper there were used results of field measurements, computer simulations and values from database of Slovak Hydro-Meteorological Institute (SHMI). Materials and methods Quality of surface water, groundwater and soils was evaluated separately in this paper. Evaluation of quality of water resources along Gabčíkovo-Topoľníky channel was performed by using data from field measurement (Kováčová, 2007) and data from Annual reports of SHMI. There were applied standard statistical methods. Recharge from the groundwater into the stream (or in reverse) is a key hydrological/ hydraulic characteristic in the process of mutual interaction between the stream and the groundwater. This characteristic is given as an inflow/outflow over the channel bottom area. Determination of the total recharge amount was done by a numerical simulation (model SKOKY- Kosorin, 2005) and by so-called method of interaction formulas. We calculated the total recharge amount for four alternatives of the surface water levels in the channel and the surroundings groundwater respectively. Alternative I was a symmetrical double-sided groundwater inflow into a symmetrical stream cross-section.</p><p id="Pg39">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 494 Alternative II was a symmetrical double-sided outflow from a symmetrical stream cross-section to the groundwater. Both alternatives used the identical groundwater levels, the water depth in the stream was h. Alternative III was a double-sided groundwater inflow into a symmetrical stream cross-section with the same groundwater levels and with water depth in the stream h/2. Alternative IV was a symmetrical doublesided outflow from a symmetrical stream cross-section with water depth 2h and with the same groundwater levels. In areas where the groundwater table (GWT) is close to a soil surface (less than 3 m), water is transferred from the groundwater to the root zone and thus the soil water regime and the groundwater regime affect each other. The intensity of the interactions between the water table and the root zone of the soil profile depends especially on GWT level, hydrophysical properties of the soil, the properties of the roots and on the meteorological properties (Jolánkai et al., 2008). We performed measurements of the influence of soil and plant properties on water uptake from the groundwater to a root zone for five different plants and for four soil classes of the study area. The rate of water uptake from the groundwater table into the root zone was measured at the lysimetric station in Žihárec, close to Topoľníky (Gavenčiak, 1981) as a function of: a) the agricultural plants; b) the soil classes; c) different simulated groundwater levels below the ground surface (zGWT = 50, 100, 150 and 200 cm). Because the rate of water uptake from the groundwater into the soil profile during a vegetation period depends mainly on the rate of water extraction by the roots of plants and rootage changes during this period, the ontogenesis of plants was divided into three phases: No. 1 - from the germination to the occurrence of the first leaves; No. 2 - up to start of generative organ formation; No. 3 - to the plant ripeness. Results and discussion Rye Island area is approximately 2000 km 2 . Its average slope is about 2,5.10 -4 and there was one of the reasons for building channel network there (as a drainage system). Gabčíkovo-Topoľníky channel is one of the largest channels of this network. Its length is about 30 km, channel width ranges from 8m to 17m by water depth values. Mean values of some chemical characteristics of its surface water and surrounding groundwater are in tables 1 and 2. Concentrations of Na + , NO3 - and Mg 2+ at four localities of studied part of Rye Island are shown in Figure 1. From view of mutual interaction and recharge between the channel network and the groundwater it has been necessary to estimate the impact of the channel network silting by the alluvials. We performed measurements of silt thickness in the channel and we also took the silt samples to determine its granularity and hydraulic conductivity. Measurements of the silt thickness in the channel were done in great detail in 1993. In 2004 we performed measurements to check the silting changes. The range of the percentage change of silt thicknesses between 1993 and 2004 varies from 144% up to 215%. Coefficients of hydraulic conductivity can be determined by several empirical relationships, but in our case we could use only the relationships by Beyer-Schweiger (cited in Mucha - Šestakov, 1987) and by Špaček (1987) as we could not take undisturbed samples. The values of hydraulic conductivity by them range (1,99 up to 7,64).10 -6 m s -1 . We simulated groundwater recharge for four hydrological alternatives.</p><p id="Pg40">VIII.

Concentration of ions in soil profile Cross sections, in which the total groundwater recharges were calculated, were distributed along the whole channel. The results of simulation with sediments in the channel and their comparison show that the change of the total groundwater recharge value in the case of inflow is approximately 10%. In the case of outflow the comparison of simulation results shows 50% increase of total recharge in Alternative IV. Based on lysimetric measurements we determined the rate of uptake from the groundwater to the root zone. The results for five agricultural plants, three ontogenesis phases and various levels of groundwater table are shown in Figure 2. Ratio v/vmax expresses relative daily rate of water flow for a given GWT in comparison with the rate of water flow for zGWT = 50 cm, particularly for each ontogenesis phase of plants. Conclusions The aim of this paper was to evaluate quality of water at the part of the Danube Lowland – the east half of the Rye Island and impact of channel-driven oscillation of the groundwater level on the plants at this region. Because of extensiveness of the region, at this phase of study we focused our interest only at the part of the area, namely along the Gabčíkovo – Topoľníky channel. From point of quality we evaluated: electrical conductivity EC, total dissolved solids TDS and concentrations of NO3 , NO2 - for surface water, concentrations of NO3 , NO2 , SO4 2, Cl - and chemical oxygen demand for surrounding groundwater. Concentration of Na + , NO3 - and Mg 2+ ions were evaluated for soils, because they are indicators of salinization. Even on this partial result we could notice linkages among surface water, groundwater and soils. On the other hand, for correct and homogeneous conclusion it is necessary to carry on with monitoring and to analyse observed data. Groundwater level is regulated by channel network in this region, so the next aim of the paper was to investigate and analyse the silting of the</p><p id="Pg41">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

The results of the simulations show greater impact of the silt in the case of outflow from the channel to the surroundings than in the case of inflow into the channel from GWT. a) 0,0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 0 50 100 150 200 groundwater level [cm] v /v m a x 1 2 3 b) 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1,0 0 50 100 150 200 groundwater level [cm] v /v m a x 1 2 3 4 5 c) 0 0,2 0,4 0,6 0,8 1 0 50 100 150 200 groundwater level [cm] v /v m a x 1 2 3 4 Figure 2.

Based on the lysimetric measurements we came to a conclusion that the soil class and plant species have minor influence on the rates of water uptake into the soil root zone. On the other hand the ontogenesis phases of plants have decisive influence on it. We did not quantify the interaction of the plant transpiration rate. These findings are important for mathematical modelling of water flow/uptake from the groundwater into the soil. The results of our research are useful also for the channels’ maintenance program purposes and it might be a tool to predict the plant water supply and the crops.

The lack of oxygen kills most of the cultivated plants in the flooded depressions and in its muddy fringes. This hypoxic stress makes bare soil surfaces free from competition which are favorable for aquatic and amphibian plant-communities. During our coenological and floristical investigations of Hungarian Bodrogköz (Szirmai et al. 2008) micro region (NE Plain), there are seven protected plant species have been found from the 69 natural species of the flora of flooded depressions. We have explored four associations which were new for the territory of Hungary. The Elatinetum alsinastri (Nagy et al. 2006). (dominated by the protected Elatine alsinastrum) and the Veronico anagalloides-Lythretum hyssopifoliae (Wagner ex Holzner 1973). Belong to the Nanocyperion associations, and the Oenanthetum aquaticae (Nagy et al. 2006). and Butometum umbellati (Konczak 1968) (Philippi 1973). belong to the Oenanthion aquaticae associations. All of the four associations are mono-dominant, herbaceous community, built by native species. They appear as the early state of secondary succession of agrarian habitats and appear as scattered small islands with more or less natural vegetation in the so called „rural deserts”. Altogether the flood stress decreases the profitable size of ploughland but increases the natural value of it. Keywords: Bodrogköz, Elatine alsinastrum, Oenanthe aquatica, Veronica anagalloides, Butomus umbellatus, plant association, mono-dominant, North-Plain of Hungary Introduction It is a commonplace that the agrarian habitats are artificial habitats where the aim the economical profit. These habitats are extremely poor in natural floristical elements especially in plant species with high natural value. This is true on the majority of territories of arables, but on the flooded depressions and on its muddy fringes the lack of oxygen kills most of the cultivated plants. This hypoxic stress makes bare soil surfaces free from competition which are favorable for aquatic and amphibian plantcommunities. Gál et. al. (2007) mentioned the memories of the original vegetation of the present arable areas of the Hungarian Bodrogköz micro-geographical region could be found in their canals and in their temporary water-filled depressions. Generally these wetlands are the only habitats that can present and protect native and often protected species and their associations on numbers of ten hectares of these “agrarian deserts”. Here we publish the short description and the nature protection importance of those Nanocyperion and Oenanthion aquaticae associations that had explored by us as new plant communities of Hungary (Nagy et al. 2006.). They can appear immediately on water-filled depressions of arables and on other fresh mud surfaces. Materials and methods The Hungarian-Bodrogköz situated in north-east Hungary, bordered by Tisza- and Bodrog-river, and the Slovakian border at the north. The micro-region (Tuba and Szirmai 2008) belongs to the Samicum plant-geographical region (Gál et al. 2007). Now</p><p id="Pg43">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 498 the Hungarian-Bodrogköz as other alluvial micro-region (Tuba 1994, 1995, 2005) is dominated by arable-lands, but has one of the largest naturality on the Great Hungarian Plain (Nagy et al. 2006). Those habitats (ca. 25% of the area of Bodrogköz) which have any naturality are fairly diverse in flora and vegetation. The larger part of the area (ca. 75%) is arable-land (Gál et al. 2007, Tuba and Szirmai 2008). The botanical data had been recorded by us between July 2003 and October 2007. We have studied the temporary inland-water pools on arables. Floristical data collected by field trips, coenological data collected by Braun-Blanquet method (Braun-Blanquet, 1951). In the sample plots cover was estimated species by species on a percentage scale in the case of higher plants. As there are so much floristical and coenological data, here we publish just the essence of our records. We used Simon’s (1988) nature-protection categories to indicate the natural condition of the investigated area. The nomenclature of the species follows Simon (2000), the nomenclature of plant associations follows Borhidi &amp; Sánta (1999) and our previous publications (Nagy 2006). We plan to examine the vegetation dynamics using digital techniques (Cserhalmi and Nagy 2008, Szirmai and Czóbel 2008) and will extend our investigations on the ecophysiological aspect (Czóbel at al., 2005, 2008; Juhász et al., 2005) for knowledge of carbon-balance during the succession, where the mosses will be in the center in the future. Results and discussion Floristical results: Out of the 69 plants of mud vegetation of Bodrogköz 7 species have been protected in Hungary. They are the Callitriche palustris L., Elatine alsinastrum L., E. triandra Schkuhr, E. hungarica Moesz, E hydropiper L., Lindernia procumbens (Krock.) Philcot and Ludwigia palustris (L.) Elliot. Out of the four protected Elatine species the Elatine alsinastrum has built almost monodominant association (Elatinetum alsinastri Nagy et al. 2006.) More than 2/3 of the recorded species indicate natural conditions.(Figure 1.) Coenological results: Nanocyperion Elatino-Eleocharition ovatae Elatinetum alsinastri Nagy et al. 2006 Figure 1.

Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 499 The association appears only in the first year of flooding in shallow, clear water during early summer. It is absolutely mono-dominant (Elatine alsinastrum) plant community which is poor in species. The character species show its highest dominance in 35-40 cm deep water above 20-30 cm thick mud. The dominance of Elatine alsinastrum decreased paralelly the deepening of water, but still was 75 % in the deepest point of the water (90 cm). By the decreasing of water depth the abundance and dominance of shore species, like Alisma lanceolatum, Alopecurus aequalis, Persicaria lapathifolia, Typha angustifolia, Lycopus europeus, Sparganium erectum, Stachys palustris, Phragmites communis, Butomus umbellatus, Lythrum salicaria, Lythrum virgatum, Rumex crispus increased. Radiolion linoidis Veronico anagalloides-Lythretum hyssopifoliae Wagner ex Holzner 1973 This belt-like, also mono-dominant pioneer association appears on bare muddy surfaces as margins of flooded arables, canals, ditches, digger holes during early summer too. The water depth was (0-10 cm). The association was belted by Elatinetum alsinastri and/or Bolboschoenetum maritimi from the deeper side and Juncetum tenuis from the higher side. In side of the absolute dominant Veronica anagalloides (A-D: 40-65%), the other frequent species were the Lythrum hyssopifolia (A-D: 0,01-5%), Alisma lanceolatum (A-D: 7-15%) and the Polygonum amphibia (A-D: 0,01-2%). Subfrequent were the Agropyron repens, Matricaria maritima, Anagallis arvensis, Juncus tenuis and the Equisetum arvense and the alien Echinochloa crus-galli. The Bolboschoenus maritimus, Rumex crispus, Alopecurus aequalis, Plantago major, Ranunculus sceleratus, Persicaria lapathifolia, Mentha aquatica, Lythrum virgatum and the Trifolium arvense appeared just in the half or less of our sample plots. Oenanthion aquaticae Oenanthetum aquaticae Nagy et al. 2006 The association appears in the second year of the flooding in a shallow (0-20cm) open water. In side of dense texture of Oenanthe aquatica the accidental species, the Lemna minor, Alisma plantago-aquatica, Alopecurus equalis and Eleocharis palustris have situated only on the margins of the „community”. Butometum umbellati (Konczak 1968) Philippi 1973 The association situating in the shallow (20-40cm) open water. It can appear in the first year of flooding. The only dominant and constant species o fit is the Butomus umbellatus. Subconstant are the Alopecurus geniculatus, Stachys palustris, Symphytum officinale, Lycopus europaeus and the Sparganium erectum. The accidental species were the Alisma lanceolatum, Calamagrostis epigeios, Cirsium palustre, Lythrum salicaria, Rorippa amphibia, Epilobium tetragonum, Persicaria amphibia and the Lemna minor. From the second year of the appearing of the mentioned four associations they had outplace by the associations of more competitive species like Typha angustifolia, Schoenoplectus lacustris, Sparganium erectum, Glyceria maxima, Carex riparia, Oenanthe aquatica.</p><p id="Pg45">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 500 Conclusions As the appearance and disappearance of the above mentioned plant communities are very fast, the propagating organs of their plants could survive tens of years or more in the soil. As the presences of these associations are fully depending on the formation of flooded surface bare of competition we put them to the PE (potentially endangered) IUCN category. As Dornerné et al. (2003) published that the species diversity could not increase measurably in case of the elimination of chemicals on arable lands, we suggest, that there would be a valuable mission of the official nature protection to prepare these artificial flooded habitats bare of competition on the arables.

Dry conditions are described by Standard Precipitation Index (SPI). For this purpose, different time scales are used. The correlation between precipitation deficit and water table depth and soil moisture is investigated, the SPI time series are discussed. It can be used for statistical estimation of agricultural drought damages. Keywords: drought, SPI, effect on yield Introduction Climate exerts fundamental control on the global pattern of vegetation, soils and other physical characteristics of the environment and that this presents constrains for human habitation and the exploitation of natural resources. Civilisations have adapted to their regional environments by developing methods of resource management that account for seasonal cycles and year-to-year variations in the climate (Ligetvári 2000). When climatic regimes undergo major shifts, these can be disruptive for certain activities or even in some cases can trigger the collapse of entire civilisations (Lamb 1982). This problem becomes more and more actual, because recent research results provide increasingly compelling evidence of ongoing and accelerating (Brohan et al. 2006) global climate change. According to the IPCC 4AR (IPCC 2007), drought events are expected to be more frequent in our region. Increases in the frequency of droughts are projected to affect local crop production negatively. In Southern Europe, climate change is projected to worsen conditions (high temperatures and drought) in a region already vulnerable to climate variability, and to reduce water availability, hydropower potential, summer tourism and, in general, crop productivity. Although Hungary is usually not classified as South-European country, but the tendencies of most important climate variables show similar features like that ones in the Mediterranean region. The area suffered by drought is likely to grow based on projections for 21st century using SRES scenarios, and its major impacts are land degradation, lower yields/crop damage and failure, increased livestock deaths, increased risk of wildfire, more widespread water stress (Farkas et al. 2005). Materials and methods Drought is a complex phenomenon, but the origin of any kind of drought is the less than normal precipitation. Therefore, the simplest drought indices have the input of precipitation only. We use the well-known Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) in this paper (see for example http://drought.unl.edu/monitor/spi.htm). The atmospheric drought has to mention as a primary stress here, e.g. when the relative humidity is less than 30 %. This type of drought does not continues for a long time, usually only for hours. Longer below normal precipitation leads to decrease in soil humidity, streamflow, etc. These effects appear after different period of time can be used as characteristic time.</p><p id="Pg47">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 502 This parameter can describe the sensitivity of different water depending processes to the not satisfactory precipitation. Prolonged drought stress to plants is unhealthy and could lead to pest problems, loss of yield, etc (Simic et al. 2008). A plant under drought stress is in weakened state (Szıllısi, E. et al. 2008). We measure the drought stress by soil moisture. Using the versatile feature of the SPI, the different characteristic times of soil moisture loss was calculated by SPI. Results and discussion Figure 1 shows the relationship between the 5-month SPI and the depth to the water table at Keszthely in western Hungary (Szalai et al.) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5-month SPI W a te r T a b le D e p th ( c m ) Figure 1. Relationship between 5-months SPI and water table depth in Keszthely Although the scatter is quite large, a linear relationship identifying low ground water table with negative SPI values (dry conditions) and high water table with positive SPI values (most humid condition) is evident. There are many different other factors effecting the water table depth than precipitation, therefore we have relative low correlations. A table of the regression coefficients was constructed showing the relationship between groundwater measured by well levels at the four locations in Hungary and the SPI for various time periods (Table 1). The strongest relationships are at longer time-scales: 5, 12, 18 and 24 months for the different areas. Some of the differences in time may be accounted for in the distance between the well and the station with climate data. They are close at Keszthely and farther apart at Kaposvár. The PDSI (Palmer Drought Severity Index) is also included in the table, but those</p><p id="Pg48">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 503 relationships are not as strong as the particular SPI relationships.

The loss of yield cannot be explained only by drought, even many other meteorological disasters can be found among the abiotic yield decreasing factors like the frost in 2007. Conclusions Short-term heat (low relative humidity) can cause direct stress on the plants (atmospheric drought), but long lasting dry and/or hot meteorological conditions effect the agricultural production via water availability in the soil. The meteorological events effect the soil moisture on different time scale, but a declining tendency can be measured at almost all time scale of precipitation. Although droughts used to be the largest disasters, but their effects and damages is not easy to estimate because of their complexity and lacking of exact methodology of damage estimation. Mostly dynamical model estimations used for this purpose, and statistical approach needs foresight. References Brohan, P. – Kennedy, J. J. – Harris, I. – Tett, S. F. B. – Jones, P. D.: 2006.

Products of new generation of satellite and airborne sensors could give advanced tool for end users to fill this gap. In this paper a 8 years time series from satellite multispectral remote sensing data model was introduced in the region of Békés-Csanád Loess Plateau (BCSLP, 172737 ha). The estimation of biomass production changing related to actual yearly available water resources (i.e. drought and/or excess water stress). The effects of changing spectral and physical space and time of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) correlated with Relative Frequency of Excess Water Inundation, Precipitation, Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) were calculated to enhance and modify regional water balance equitation. Based on our biomass potential evaluation method could be develop better irrigation and water management practise on the Békés-Csanád Loess Plateau. Keywords: NDVI, PET, LAI, year effects Introduction The development of remote sensing techniques and the new generation of satellite and airborne sensors could give advanced tool for analysing the biomass productivity in different space and time. Sustainable competitiveness is accomplished through sustainable farming methods, whose key motives are sustainable production, adaptability, quality to any extent and favourable investments levels; consequently this kind of competitiveness is altogether different from any old practice (Várallyay 2007). The global warming is likely to have significant impacts on the hydrologic cycle, affecting water resources system (Stehlová, 2007; Mikulec, 2007). The NASA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service (USDA FAS) jointly funded a new project to assimilate NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and products into an existing decision support system (DSS) operated by the Production Estimates and Crop Assessment Division. In monitoring crop conditions for a specific region, remotely sensed vegetation index data are used to track the evolution of the growing season compared to reference long-term mean conditions (Tucker, 1985). A global normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is produced from MODIS data, and is referred to as the "continuity index" similar to the existing archive of NOAA-AVHRR derived NDVI. SPOT Vegetation NDVI data and MODIS NDVI data from the Terra and Aqua platforms represent improvements in the ability to monitor land photosynthetic capacity. Croplands vary from year to year due to events such as drought and fallow periods, and they vastly differ across the globe in accordance with characteristics such as cropping intensity and field size. To describe this temporally heterogeneity a global NDVI timeseries database, with a spatial resolution of 250 meters has been assembled using a 16-</p><p id="Pg51">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 506 day compositing period, allowing for interannual comparisons of growing season dynamics (Tamás and Németh, 2005). Materials and methods Basic data source is made after dual average by MODIS Terra remote sensing data. This MODIS NDVI dataset is reprojected and mosaicked to suit the BCSLP region with 250 meter rescission. For the calculation of NDVI values the reflected solar radiation in the red (RED=620-670 nm) and near-infrared (NIR=841-876) wave-length bands were used from the MODIS 36 hyperspectral channels: NDVI = (NIR-RED)/(NIR+RED). NDVI values vary with absorption of red light by plant chlorophyll. NDVI is a nonlinear function which varies between -1 and +1 but it is undefined when the reflectance or sum of RED and NIR are zero. The values of PET were modelled by FAO CropWat 4.3 (Clarke et al., 1998). The method of Penman-Monteith (Allen et al., 1998) is based on using the monthly minimum and maximum mean temperature ( o C), relative humidity (%), wind speed (m s -1 ) and daylight hours (h). Excess water inundation data series were originated from the Körös Valley District Environmental and Water Directorate. Results and discussion The progress of biomass process is a climate dependent periodicity in time so it is manifest to analyze the observation of time series by time steps methods. Basic data source consists of dual averaging NDVI values counted by MODIS Terra remote sensing data. These data are monthly frequency covering 16 day periods which had respected for in 8 years duration (standardised NDVI values was shown in Figure 1.). The mean of presented time series of NDVI data sources in region of BCSLP is 0.567; standard deviation: 0.101; maximum: 0.708; while minimum: 0.251. Discrete time steps in time describe phenomenon of biomass growth. The components of time series model were determined in four steps. The applied theoretical model was described by Kontur et al. (1993), used for another phenomenon (groundwater hydrograph) which was continuous in time and space. This adopted time series analysis based on the next formula: Yi = Ti + Pi + Ai + Vi, where Ti trend, Pi periodic, Ai autoregressive and Vi contingent component, which was transformed froward. First of all the trend was detached from the series for term 2001-2008. Due to this process the long term effect was eliminated from the data source, which means the effect of serial of wet and drought years resulted of biomass production changing was filtered out. As next step the periodic component was detached by using the model. After the isolation of the periodic component from the data source the autoregressive and random components are remained. The whole process in details was published by Tamás and Bozán (2008). According to our method the next examination was the determination of influential factors which have an effect of changing NDVI (i.e. biomass production) in space and time. At first the connection between standardised NDVI and PET (Figure 1.) was examined which was harmonised by the results (R 2 = 0.631) of Li and Ren (2007). The PET values compared to NDVI values were moved later in time. There are several explanations about the reasons. There is a need to know what the influential factors are able to determine the yearly NDVI changing. In the vegetation period there are some different peaks of biomass production depending on changing land use, agrotechnical practice and crop rotation.</p><p id="Pg52">VIII.

Yearly standardised NDVI and PET on the region of BCSLP (2001-2008) On the region of BCSLP the main cultivated plants are winter wheat and corn. According to the different greenness of plants in connection with different chlorophyll intensity the values of NDVI are able to change continuously but not rapidly. According to Kovács (2007) the ratio of territory with higher frequency of NDVI values and biomass production is higher in May, June and August than in July and September. In case of BCSLP the maximum NDVI values was in July, meanwhile the maximum values of PET was some days later (Figure 1.). NDVI values could reach the maximum values in May in case of grass-meadow-pasture land use category (Kovács, 2007), however the ration of this category is very low on the region of BCSLP. For this reason there was no enough biomass production of it to be able to increase the values of NDVI in May. Changing of NDVI values related to PET and LAI was documented (Nagler et al., 2005; Han et al., 2006), which was harmonised with our results (Figure 2.). 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 I. II. III. IV. V. VI. VII.

The estimated LAIcrops (Petrasovits, 1988) in connection with NDVImean and PETmean values Regarding to climate change effects the higher yearly mean temperature could cause an earlier vegetation cycle (Stöckli and Vidale, 2004). For this reason we can expect higher yearly average NDVI values in Hungary. According to Bartholy and Pongrácz (2005) the low NDVI values cold-wet and cold-dry conditions tend to occur, while large NDVI values imply warm-wet and warm-dry climate conditions, which was similar with our examination and results regarding to the NDVI values in August: i.e. average year, excess water and/or drought hazarded extrem year (Figure 3.).</p><p id="Pg53">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

Hungary Abstract: All of examined communities show the responses of biotic (namely the land use and weed invasions) and abiotic (river regulations) stress. The main aim of our research was to explore and characterize the typical grassland and forest communities of this area. All of these communities show several anthropogene disturbances because of effects of agriculture and partly river regulations. Nevertheless these fragments and spots are valuable for nature protection.The next communities were examined: 1. Carici vulpinae - Alopecuretum pratensis, 2.

Introduction The flora of Bodrogköz is belonging to the Samicum (Tuba 1994), which has fairly diverse lichen (Farkas et al, 2005), bryophyte (Kis et al, 2000) and phanerogamic flora (Czóbel et al, 2008) and vegetation associations (Szirmai et al, 2008, Tuba, 1995, 2005). However, the detailed analysis of Bodrogköz flora and vegetation is still missing (it is in press now, Tuba et al, 2008, Szirmai et al, 2008), and floristic records new to the region were published even in the latest years (Tuba 1995, 2005, Csontos et al, 2006). Here we give some results about characteristic grass and forest associations in the Hungarian Bodrogköz region. Materials and methods The size of grassland sample plots were 2 x 2 m and in forest were 20 x 20 m in all records. Species composition were published earlier (Gál et al. 2006), distribution of floral elements, ecological parameters have been analysed now. The next relative ecological parameters of the species composition was detected of all sample plots as follows: relative water requirement (WB), relative nitrogen requirement (NB), continentality values (KB) and social behaviour types (SOC) (Horváth et al., 1995). Results and discussion The vast stands of Carici vulpinae - Alopecuretum pratensis association are common of the eastern part of Bodrogköz. Dominant species is the Alopecurus pratensis. Edificator species e. g. Carex hirta, Carex acutiformis and Carex melanostachya, and appears Festuca pseudovina tufts because of grazing. The floraspectrum can be seen in Fig.1. Common species from these Eua-Eur-Kont groups e.g. Achillea collina, Alopecurus pratensis, Galium verum, Cirsium canum. Distribution of NB values shows a rather nitrofrequent stand. E.g. Scutellaria hastifolia, Potentilla reptans, Cirsium arvense (Fig. 2.). The synphysiological research (Czóbel et al., 2005) confirmed our results (Fóti et al.</p><p id="Pg55">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 510 2005). These results harmonize the synphysiological measures, too (Balogh et al., 2005a, 2005b). The stands of Fraxino pannonicae-Ulmetum association frequently lie the highest position of the flood area at the backwaters. Dominant species are the Fraxinus angustifolia subsp. angustifolia, Ulmus laevis, U. minor, rarely Populus alba, P. nigra. In the bush level occur several Acer and Cornus spp. In grassland level appear wetland and forest species (Circaea lutetiana, Iris peseudacorus) at all. The floraspectrum besides of dominance of EUR-EUA-CEU elements shows the high rate of adventive species . 0 10 20 30 N1 N2 N3 N4 N5 N6 N7 NB values of Alopecuretum pratensis in Cigánd-Pácin 0 20 40 60 koz euá kont pom Floraspectrum of Alopecuretum pratensis in Cigánd-Pácin Figure 1.

In the first part of our research work we describe the measurement method of the AGA 782 thermovision camera and the measurement results of the plant production and the sylviculture. The utilization of the AISA DUAL aerial hyperspectral scanner is presented in the second part. Hyperspectral remote sensing is one of the latest surface cover examining methods, that is the full spectral measurement is done simultaneously by splitting a big area into image elements. A fairly continuous spectrum curve is available for us on all image elements. The available reflectance curves in the 400-2500 nm spectral band provide us an opportunity on the one hand to separate the different types of the plants and on the other hand to separate the healthy and the under stress standing vegetation. In the case of the soil we can draw conclusions concerning the moisture content and the mineral substance from the reflectance curves. This method was successfully used in foreign “Hyperspectral EU projects”, which was taken in Finland, Switzerland and Germany in 2008. Keywords: abiotic, biotic, hyperspectral, plant, remote sensing, soil, stress, thermal Introduction Remote sensing methods provide the best solution for studying and monitoring soil and plant stress factors on a vast area (Csete – Láng, 2004; Dobos et al., 2002; Rakonczai – Kovács, 2006). Remote sensing images are able to measure and visualise the reflectance values of numerous wavelength ranges, from which statements can be made concerning the normal (healthy) and stressful status of soil and vegetation (Burai, 2006; Burai et al., 2006). This research work intends to introduce the ways of application as regards thermal and hyperspectral remote sensing technology in order to detect the stress effects of soil and vegetation in a vast area encouraging its practical utilisation. The application of hyperspectral remote sensing technology is quite new in the field of remote sensing. As for the possibilities of the application we must note that this technology is used to examine the materials on the surface of planet Mars (Ládai et al., 2005). The first Hungarian airborne hyperspectral remote sensing campaign was realized in 2002 within the framework of the HySens project by using DAIS 7915 – Digital Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (Hargitai et al., 2006). Materials and methods Thermal remote sensing Measurements defining the temperature of the soil and plants were done by a specially modified AGA 782 camera both in the case of ground and aerial examinations. The accurate definition of the temperature in case of aerial images (atmospheric correction) was based on the temperature measured at the ground reference points. Hyperspectral remote sensing The hyperspectral images were taken by an AISA DUAL (Eagle and Hawk) hyperspectral system which was purchased in joint venture by our institute and the University of Debrecen. The Eagle takes images in the visible and near infrared (400-</p><p id="Pg59">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 514 970 nm) range, while Hawk operates in the middle infrared (970-2500 nm) range in the 244-244 spectral channel (Erdeiné Késmárki-Gally et al., 2008). The hyperspectral remote sensing images are able to measure the reflectance values of numerous wavelength ranges, from which so called vegetation indices may be calculated in relation to the volume, distribution, health, etc. of the flora. The steps of the hyperspectral image processing were: 1) Aerial and land image taking. 2) Radiometrical and geometrical corrections. 3) Filtering and data decrease. 4) Choosing the objective spectrum. 5) Classification. 6) Imaging. 7) Checking. The above mentioned steps were made with the CaliGeo (radiometric and geometric corrections) and the ENVI 4.1 Geographical Information System Computer Softwares. Results and discussion Thermal examinations Temperature is always the result of an instant heat balance between the incoming and outgoing energy. The description of this heat balance in relation to the natural conditions is rather complex. Figure 1 shows the radiation balance characterising the thermoregulation of the plant. Figure 1. The radiation balance characterising the thermoregulation of the plant The specific radiation balance: (1 – Rn) (SI + SH) + εn Satm – εnσTn 4 – H – T = Q (1) where, Tn: stands for the surface temperature of the plant [K -1 ]; σ: Stephan-Boltzmann constant [Wm -2 K -4 ]; H = f(∆Tl; rl): heat loss with reduction of heat [Wm -2 ]; T = f(∆e; rv): transpiration heat loss [Wm -2 ]; Q: stored energy [Wm -2 ]; SI: indirect sun radiation [Wm -2 ]; SH: transmission [Wm -2 ]; Satm: atmospheric radiation; Rn: reflection factor of the leaf; εn: emission factor of the plant. The radiation and atmospheric parameters depend on the weather and do not characterise the flora directly. The aerodynamic parameter may be characteristic to the state of the leaf indirectly, in case the angle of the leaf changes, it rolls or due to some damage the surface of the leaf decreases. The Rn and εn emission factors are influenced by the external deposit (dust, brown rot, etc.) and the quality and quantity changes of pigmentation. The area in the frame indicated in Figure 2 shows an autumn grain plant in a sandy soil that contains less moisture, where the temperature is higher by 1-1.5°C in the area marked with “A”.</p><p id="Pg60">VIII.

Thermal image of noble popular The temperature is higher within the “A” area marked with arrow. plant in Szigetújfalu The thermal image of the noble poplar plant in Figure 3 demonstrates a similar phenomenon, where as a result of the planted radial collector-type wells the level of groundwater decreased to 4-7 meters from the ideal 2-3 metres near the wells, which can definitely be traced in the measured temperatures (19.6; 20.5; 20.7; 20.9°C). As a result of the above mentioned reasons the leaf surface decreased drastically, on average by 50 %. We also examined the reaction of plants given to physical stress (the damage of the stem) on ground circumstances. The direct reaction was the increase of transpiration and consequently the decrease of temperature. The maximum level of temperature drop was 2-3°C, which increased above the ambient temperature only after this due to the effects of intensive sunlight. Hyperspectral examinations The spectral reflectance curves gained from the hyperspectral images we are able to draw consequences in relation to soil, plant and water. The characteristic surface covering category spectrums are shown in Figure 4. When examining the soil the wet and dry areas, in case of plants the different vegetation types may be separated from each other, but information may be gained concerning the physical state of plants (see Figure 5).

We carried out a coverage examination in one of these areas in the curse of our work.</p><p id="Pg61">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 516 Figure 6. Wheat in the Hevesi area (on the left) and the result of the coverage examination (on the right) Coverage (%) = 157,92*NDVI – 2,37 (R2 = 0,78, n = 21) where, NDVI is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Conclusions With the help of the thermal remote sensing technology the surface temperature of the soil and the plant may be measured, from which further consequences may be drawn provided that the ambient temperature and the intensity of sunlight is known (for example the thermal and water regulation of the soil; the state of vegetation transpiration, abnormalities, etc.). The aerial hyperspectral remote sensing means a remarkable quality jump in spatial and spectral resolution too. Because of this, images can be taken from each of the parcels that can operatively used in the field of precision farming for making soil and weed maps (Neményi et al., 2001). The precise knowing of the reflection spectrums, applying together with the field samples can be used for determining quality (e.g. plant condition) and quantity parameters (e.g. biomass green mass, etc.). The other great application field of the hyperspectral images can be the detection of the environmental pollution, mineral mapping, etc. (Jung et al., 2005).

Methodically, the soil moisture content profile data measured with the BR-150 moisture meter are converted to water potentials using the van Genuchten model fitted to measured water retention data by genetic horizons of soils at the three sites. The method allows the assigning of the critical water table depth depending on the actual crop growth phase, soil conditions together with the actual moisture content and the climatic conditions as air temperature and precipitation. Keywords: Danube, ground water, water potential, van Genuchten model Introduction Monitoring in Szigetköz includes soil moisture measurements among others. The measurements were carried out with a BR-150 moisture meter (Andrén et al. 1991). Compared with other methods, Nagy et al. (2008) state that the cumulative correlation coefficient between the neutron probe and the capacity method was R 2 =0.8694. The ground water level in Szigetköz is determined by the water-level of the Danube. The water level strongly affects the changing of the moisture content in the soil. In practice the capillary zone above the groundwater level is 1-2.5 m (Koltai et al. 2008). The thickness of the cover layers and the ground water levels are different at the chosen measuring sites. We compared the moisture conditions of three measuring sites on five dates between 7th June and 9th August 2006. The two most important arable crops of the monitored area, winter wheat and maize have the biggest water consumption in this period (Varga-Haszonits et al. 2008). The direction and intensity of water flow in the soil are determined by the water holding and retention capacity functions. In consequence of the layering with different grain compositions, the measured moisture content data in volume percentage are difficult to evaluate by themselves. Knowing the physical characteristics of the soil, we determined the function connection between soil moisture content and moisture potential for each soil layer. We applied the so-called Mualem-van Genuchten method widely used in modelling practice (Fodor and Rajkai, 2004; Rajkai, 2004). After calibration, with knowledge of the measured moisture content the depicted pF curves are suitable for predicting water stress and the need for watering. We demonstrate the wetting effect of soil water with the help of the measurements and their processing. Materials and methods The conditions for plant production and the security of yield in the relatively dry Szigetköz area are highly dependent on replacing moisture from the ground water (Várallyay, 1992). Measuring site No. 2605 is located in the outskirts of the village Halászi (47-54-09, 1721-18). It is humus alluvial soil with 330 cm cover layer. The depth of moisture</p><p id="Pg63">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 518 measuring reached 300 cm from the surface. The ground water stood at the bottom of the cover layer from April to September in 2006. Measuring site No. 2630 is near the water measuring well in Dunaremete (47-52-45, 1727-23). Under the upper 150 cm of the multi-layer humus alluvial soil there is sandy pebble, under 180 cm the pebble is more than 50%. The moisture measuring ranged to 140 cm from the surface. The changing of the soil water level follows the changing of the water level of the Danube within one day. During floods the soil water rose to the cover layer. Measuring site No. 2659 is located in the outskirts of the village Gyırladamér (47-4718, 17-35-44) on alluvial meadow soil with a thick cover layer. The depth of moisture measuring reached 300 cm from the surface. In this profile the ground water was continuously high, i.e. near the surface. During floods it rose to the soil surface. Table 1 illustrates the main physical characteristics of the soils at the measuring sites. We described the pF curves of the soil profiles interpolating the van Genuchten function: nn rs h h /11))(1( )( −⋅+ Θ−Θ =Θ α (1) where h=moisture potential (cm), Θ= moisture content (m3. m-3), Θs, Θr, n, α= interpolation parameters.

Above this there is a drier soil layer. The moisture content of the soil layer ranging to the soil surface was determined by the atmospheric precipitation. The fluctuating soil water level of measuring site No. 2630 ensured equalized moisture conditions under the depth of 100 cm. The upper 1 m soil layers were under the effect of the atmosphere because their moisture content changed according to the precipitation and evaporation. At measuring site No. 2659 the soil water, which rose near to the surface and then sank, kept the soil layers at field water capacity or temporarily fully saturated. The atmospheric effect was restricted to the depth of a few dm.</p><p id="Pg65">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

The minimum-maximum pF values of the 10-70 cm layers at the sample sites were No. 2605: 2.2 -3.8; No. 2630: 1.4 – 4.8; No. 2659: 0.0-3.8.

The presented simple moisture content – moisture potential conversion technique should however be completed by in site plant water potential or leaf surface temperature monitoring for validation in the future.

Results showed that Cr (VI) was highly toxic for crop in the 1st year, than it transformed quickly less toxic, later on non toxic form. The high ( 90 and 270 kg.ha-1 doses of Zn, Cu and As resulted also in yield losses of crops in the first years. Their toxic effect decreases, in time there is a fixation, transformation of these elements in the soil. Crops can tolerate high doses of Pb and Hg in the soil. Cd remains mobile in the soil–plant system for a long time. Crop plants didn’t reveal any toxic symptoms and yield loss on the Cd amended soil, but Cd accumulation was significant in their vegetative and generative organs. Keywords: heavy metals, crops, toxicity, yield loss, cadmium accumulation Introduction Most heavy metals occur naturally in the environment and normally present in small amounts in soils and all surface and ground waters. Human activities during the last centuries have continuously increased their levels in the environment. Increased level of certain heavy metals can negatively impact the soil ecology, soil fertility thus agricultural production and/or product quality (Láng et al. 2002). Increased mobility and bioavailability some of these elements in agricultural soils can be favourable condition for their accumulation in plants, but it depends also on the plant itself (Szabó et al. 2008). Some trace elements, because of their low solubility in soil, have a negligible uptake and translocation by plants (i.e. Cr, Sn, Ag, Zr). Others (i.e. As, Pb, Hg) are strongly sorbed by plant roots but are not readily translocated to edible plant parts (Kádár 2006, Kádár-Morvai 2008). B, Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn elements are partly readily taken up by plants, but are phytotoxic at higher concentrations. The most detrimental trace elements (Cd, Mo, Se) give rise to human and animal health risks at plant tissue contents that generally are not phytotoxic (Kádár-Lehoczky 2008, Nagypál et al. 2008). The objective of this presentation is to evaluate harmful effects of some toxic metals on field crops and to follow their accumulation in plant organs. Materials and methods A long term field experiment on microelement loading was established in 1994 at Tasspuszta Model Farm of Károly Róbert College. The soil type of the experiment field is a slightly acid chernozem brown-forest soil (vertic cambisol). Its main characteristics are as follows: pH(H2O)=6.4; pH(KCl)=5.4; y1=9.5; CaCO3%=0; humus content=3%; upper limit of plasticity (KA)=45. The dominant mineral particles are clay and silt. High doses of eight different heavy metal salts (Al(NO3)3·9H2O, NaAsO2, 3CdSO4·8H2O, K2CrO4, CuSO4·5H2O, HgCl2, Pb(NO3)2, ZnSO4·7H2O) were added to the soil and different crop plants were grown in each year on the experimental plots (winter wheat, maize, sunflower, etc.). Salts were used in three doses which represented 30, 60 and 90 kg element ha -1 heavy metal loads to the soil. Each treatment was set up in three replications. Plants were sampled yearly during the vegetation period at phenophases</p><p id="Pg67">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 522 characterized by intensive nutrient uptake. Effects of heavy metal salts on the development of crop plants were evaluated by visual assessment and weighing fresh and dried shoot samples. Main product (grain yield) and secondary products (straw, husks, shoot, corncob, etc.) of test plants were also determined at harvest. Element content of prepared samples was determined after microwave digestion using cc.HNO3+H2O2. The element composition was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICPAES). Soil samples were also taken and analysed both in NH4-acetate+EDTA and HNO3+H2O2 extraction solution by ICP-AES technique. Results and discussion In 1995 winter wheat was the test plant in the experiment. Early in May, at shooting phenophase stand development was evaluated by visual assessment and plant samples also were collected. At this stage of growth Cr and Zn treatments gave rise to strong and As and Cu loads moderate phytotoxic effects. Because of high dose of this heavy metal salts, wheat plants turned yellow and dry, which reflected problems is life function. Data of visual assessment and weights of shoot samples are presented in table 1. Table 1.

Damaging effects of Cd, Hg and Pb treatments on wheat plants couldn’t be observable in the experiment. In the second experimental year (1996) high dose of Cd also showed some toxic effect on 4-6 leaf maize in addition to As, Cr and Zn elements.

As, Cd and Cr treatments resulted in a significant loss on air dried matter of 4-6 leaf shoot compared to the control plants.

The 0.1-0.5 mg kg -1 Cd content of control crops proves that the background contamination with Cd is rather high in soils of the Gyöngyös area. Each treatment resulted wheat grain unsuitable for human consumption. The Hungarian Standard (8/1995. (X. 21.) EüM.) allows 0.1 mg kg Cd in ground cereals and flour. Cd content was about 10-40 times higher in treated sunflower grains than in the control, so there wasn’t usable for food. Cd remains mobile in the soil-plant system for a long time. It can get and accumulate in the reproductive grain so it is a real risk for the food chain (table 3). Table 3.

Enrichment of Cr in plant tissue is not significant. • Increased application of As, Zn and Cu elements to the soil can be also toxic for crops, but their toxic effect decreases significantly in the next growing season. • Cd is mobile in the soil-plant system thus its enrichment can be detected both in vegetative and reproductive organs. Wheat plants can tolerate high dose of Cd in the soil with no symptoms of toxicity and yield loss. • Crops grow very well on Hg and Pb amended soil. These elements are not mobile in the soil-plant system, their plant uptake and translocation is not considerable. References Kádár, I.: 2006.

Thus, retarded development and damage of thylakoids come into prominence, which may be accompanied by an acclimation of the thylakoid structure and function to the changed circumstances. To elucidate these alterations, we studied Cd induced organizational/compositional changes of thylakoid supercomplexes, and parallel changes in the excitation quenching. Poplar (Populus glauca var. ’Kopeczkii’) plants were grown on ¼ strength Hoagland solution (iron source: Fe(III)-citrate), and treated with or without 10 µM Cd(NO3)2 from their four-leaf stage for two weeks. The first leaf that developed entirely under the treatment (sixth leaf) was used for isolation of thylakoid complexes and measurement of fluorescence induction in vivo. Mildly solubilised thylakoid macrocomplexes of control and Cd treated plants were analysed by gentle blue-native PAGE. The protein composition of the corresponding (super)complexes was similar in control and Cd treated samples. However, the ratio of photosystem (PS) II complexes being in higher aggregation state increased under Cd treatment. In parallel, a high relative amount of photoinhibited PS II centres and a significantly elevated dissipation of energy by inactive PS II centres were found in the treated samples. It was concluded that PS II aggregates could be involved in energy dissipation as heat under Cd stress. Keywords: blue-native PAGE, cadmium, chlorophyll-protein complex, photoinhibition, photosynthesis Introduction Cadmium, one of the most toxic heavy metals, accumulated in soils due to human activities (Panwar et al. 2007). Cd taken up by plants and transported to the shoot disturbs many physiological functions, foremost the photosynthesis. Cd was shown to cause retarded chlorophyll biosynthesis and chlorophyll-protein complex accumulation leading to serious structural changes of thylakoid membranes (Sárvári 2005) and disturbed photosynthetic electron transport (Krupa and Baszyński 1995). In the presence of Cd, photosystem II (PSII) activity was strongly inhibited both at donor and acceptor sides (Sigfridsson et al. 2004). In some Cd treated plants, photoprotective mechanisms were found to be disturbed due to decreased zeaxanthin-epoxidase activity (Latowski et al. 2005) but, interestingly, a decreased non-photochemical quenching was also observed (Solti et al. 2008b). However, increased thermal energy dissipation of excess light energy (Sigfridsson et al. 2004) was found under Cd treatment. Therefore, to clarify the photoprotection processes under Cd stress we investigated the structural and functional background together with the energy dissipation of PSII complexes. Materials and methods Experiments were performed on micropropagated poplar (Populus glauca Haines, 1906 var. ‘Kopeczkii’) plants grown under particular conditions (Solti et al. 2008a). For treatment, 10 µM Cd(NO3)2 was used from the four-leaf stage of plants for two weeks, and new leaves developed under the treatment were investigated during this period. Chlorophyll (Chl) content was determined in 80% (v/v) acetone extracts by a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) using the absorption coefficients of Porra et al.</p><p id="Pg71">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 526 (1989). Fluorescence induction measurements of leaf samples were performed in vivo using a PAM 101-102-103 Chlorophyll Fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) under circumstances as described before (Solti et al. 2008b). Parameters were calculated as in Hendrickson et al. (2005). Thylakoid membranes were isolated according to Jansson et al. (1997). For blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE), thylakoids were washed in 50 mM Bis-Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) buffer containing 330 mM sorbitol and 250 µg ml -1 Pefabloc. Pellets were resuspended in solubilising buffer: 750 mM aminocapronic acid, 50 mM Bis-Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 0.5 mM EDTA, 250 µg ml -1 Pefabloc, 2% dodecyl-maltoside (500 µg Chl ml -1 ). Unsolubilised proteins were removed (15 min, 15000 g), and 5% Serva Blue G (in 750 mM aminocapronic acid) was added to the samples. BN PAGE (Schägger and von Jagow 1991) was used to separate the mildly solubilised Chl-protein complexes. For identification of the complexes by their polypeptide patterns, a second dimension SDS PAGE, according to Laemmli (1970), was performed but modified by adding 10% glycerol to the stacking and separating (10-18% linear gradient) gels. Coomassie-stained gels were evaluated by Phoretix software (Phoretix International, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). Results and discussion The Cd stress symptoms – the strong chlorosis and reduced PSII activity – were developed in poplar leaves for the second week of treatment. Thylakoids isolated from symptomatic leaves of cadmium treated (Cad) and control (Ctrl) poplar plants contained corresponding bands of similar mobility in the BN gel. The macrocomplexes showed Figure 1. 1st and 2nd dimension electrophoretograms of thylakoids of Ctrl and Cad plants. Arrows show the major proteins of PSII and PSI complexes. similar polypeptide composition according to the 2.D SDS PAGE analysis (Fig. 1). Amongst the Chl-protein bands 4 PSI (PSIa-d), 6 PSII (PSIIa-f), and 1-1 PSII connecting antenna (CA) and light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) bands were detected. Polypeptides of the complexes were identified by comparing them to reference gels</p><p id="Pg72">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 527 (Nelson and Yocum 2006). In large PSII complexes (PSIIa,b), the 1 st band contained the oligomer LHCII, 2 nd and 3 rd the apoproteins of CP47 and CP43, 4 th the D2 protein, 5 th the PsbO, 6 th the D1 and CP29 apoproteins, and 7 th the apoproteins of LHCII and/or CP26 proteins. PSII a-c and d were oligomer and dimer complexes whereas PSIIe and f were monomer PSII core complexes lacking oxygen evolving complex. The decreased amount of solubilised CA in Cd treated samples could be explained by the increased amount and stability of oligomer PSII complexes. In Cad samples, the amount of CP43 in PSIIf band was strongly reduced. It refers to the presence of regenerating complexes damaged by photoinhibition (Andersson and Aro 2001). Inhibition of photosynthesis causes photodamage and photoinhibition even at lower light intensities. The small amount of this regenerating complex and the increased ratio of aggregated PSII are in Figure 2. Energy allocation in PSII complexes and the level of photoinhibition. ***= P&lt;0.001 in t-test. Description of parameters: see in the text. agreement with the decreased turnover rate of D1 protein under Cd stress (Franco et al. 2001). Analyzing the allocation of excitation energy (Fig. 2), significant decrease was found in PSII actual efficiency (ΦPSII) and xanthophyll-cycle-based non-photochemical quenching (ΦNPQ), whereas the level of constitutive heat dissipation (Φf,D) increased. Photoinhibition of PSII (kpi) also significantly increased. As opposed to Ctrl plants, a huge amount of thermal energy dissipation by photoinhibited PSII centres (ΦNF) occurred in Cad plants. It is important to note that the growth light intensity was quite low (120µE m -2 s -1 ) to be able to grow Cad plants for longer time. The regeneration rate of PSII centres was not high enough compared to the photoinhibition even at that light intensity. It seems that damaged PSII centres transformed to dissipative centres instead of degradation (Chow et al. 2002). The non-photochemical quenching was based mainly on these dissipative centres instead of ∆pH-based quenching under short-term Cd stress. It correlated with the increased amount of larger oligomers built of PSII and LHCII complexes. Conclusions PSII-LHCII oligomers, found in increased amount under Cd treatment, seems to be not operable centres but have function in the thermal dissipation of excitation energy. Therefore, reaction centre quenching is an important protective mechanism under shortterm Cd stress.</p><p id="Pg73">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

Stress in the agro-ecological system (the maximum energy input) can be calculated. The agro-ecology, like the natural intact ecological systems, is a complex adaptive system. It is not true in general sense, as complexity does not mean such diversity that characterizes natural ecological systems. On the other hand the adaptive feature also does not realize, because the breeding emphasizing some characteristics of the given species, decreases the adaptation. These changes cause thermodynamic consequences. In terms of thermodynamics the change of the entropy of the agro-ecological systems evokes: 1. irreversible changes in the plants and the soil; 2. entropy exchange between the system and its surroundings. The study analyses the opportunities and characteristics of the ecological systems’ thermodynamic modelling. Keywords: agro-ecology, thermodynamics, stress, plant production, energy balance Introduction Researchers are continuously looking for links among the characteristics of living systems, ecology, communities of societies and the laws of thermodynamics. The above mentioned systems are complex adaptive systems, it means: complex, because they get high diversity; adaptive, because through the impacts and information from their environment they are able to adapt to the new circumstances, to that point to change their structure as well. The system exchanges energy, mass and information with its surrounding. When the gradient of intensive state variables (temperature, pressure, density, information characteristics, diversity index etc.) emerges the transfer of extensive state variables realizes. The adaptive systems are able the change their structure in a way to decrease the amount of gradients or eliminate them. It is not difficult to imagine, that several living and social systems fulfill the requirements of criteria. Consequently the topic is investigated by mathematics, social sciences, engineering sciences etc. Before analyzing the differences between the natural and agro-ecosystems let us point out that the time before the industrialization the nature was – without stress – in dynamic balance. It means that flora, fauna and organisms in the soil, in the atmosphere and in the natural water resources were in harmony (Várallyay, 2007). “No organism feeds on its own waste…One organism’s waste is another’s food. Failing to distinguish anyone’s food from someone else’s waste, the Gaian system recycles matter on the global level…The sum of planetary life, Gaia, displays a physiology that we recognize as environmental regulation.” (Margulis, 1998). The conditions have been continuously changing. At the same time during the 4.6 billion years old history of the Earth only in the last decades its cause is anthropogenic. It is harmful, because herby the change of the conditions is very rapid, the nature can not cope with the challenges. The basic problem is that due to the industrial activities, logistic (transfer), the intensive agriculture, and the consumer society huge number of such materials are getting into the environment that have got high chemical bonds,</p><p id="Pg75">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 530 degrading within years, decades and even centuries: polluting the environment, diminishing the habitat of species, causing greenhouse effect etc. It is important to mention the fact, that we can cultivate only the 3-4% of the surface of the Earth, and on the major part of these areas the cultivation is not intensive. Hungary is in a special situation, namely 50% of its territory is cultivated intensively, and 20% of Hungary is covered by forest treated by a nearly intensive way. Materials and methods Thermodynamic background Clausius R. (1822-1888) investigated the closed thermodynamic systems, studying the change of state variable of ideal gases and introduced the term of entropy. The infinitesimal change of this is the infinitesimal input or output energy transfer at a constant temperature. The introduction of the consent entropy enables us to study the state variables in a circle, especially the irreversible ones. S=dQ/T (1) where S is the entropy of the system (J/K), dQ is the input or output heat in the system (J), T is the temperature (K). After Clausius, Boltzmann L.E. (1844-1906) appeared making contact between entropy and probability using the theories of statistical mechanics, and therefore the entropy (S) of the system can be calculated by the following: S=k ln W (2) where k is the Boltzmann constant (J/K), W is the number of possible microstates of a system. The use of thermodynamics in the living systems The entropy of natural ecological systems (the disorder and diversity of characterized species) is at the highest level at the given circumstances, while the entropy of agroecological system is decreasing after anthropogenic intruding (order). The compensation or the maintenance of this state requires large energy input: natural (physical) and intellectual respectively. The question is, how can this difference expressed by the thermodynamic tools. It is reasonable not by taking the energy input or its calorific value into consideration. In the meantime the artificial energy input decreases the diversity (entropy) of the system, consequently the probability that the abandoned system itself reaches this state. If under the given natural circumstances diversity of flora and fauna is taken as one unit then its change by given technology can be measured and calculated as following: ∑ = −= F i ii ppS 1 ln (3) where the pi =ni /N</p><p id="Pg76">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 531 ni is he number of individuals in species i; the abundance of species i., F is the number of species, N is the total number of all individuals, pi the relative abundance of each species, calculated as the proportion of individuals of a given species to the total number of individuals in the community. It is undisputable that the base of this approach is the study published by Shannon (1948). According to Shannon’s research activity the information theory, the entropy - on physical phenomena originally developed by Boltzmann -, and the entropy of ecological systems harmonize. The question is: Where is the limit of ‘making order‘? The answer is given by nature: the technological (artificial) energy input can be increased until we can increase the efficiency of solar energy transfer. Results and discussion In the developed countries the biological and ecological systems are under anthropogenic pressure that is why it is called agro-ecology. The reason for this is that due to artificial energy input the energy output is increasing, thus the utilization of solar energy is also better. Under the conditions of intensive production the bio-energy output should be Eout,techn.. In this case the change of entropy is: )( 1 .,., . technouttechnin techn e EET S +=∂ (4) where Ein,techn. is the energy content of the directly (diesel oil, natural gas etc.) and the indirectly (fertilizers, other chemicals, production of machinery etc.) used energy sources. We assume that this energy helps plants to utilize solar energy and to bond the carbon more effectively. As regards technologies of plant cultivation the function of energy output: .,technoutE (Ein,techn,Es)≈ .,.,., )/( technintechintechnout EEE ∂∂ (5) where Es is the solar energy that can be taken constant. The ( rtechintechnout eEE =∂∂ .,., / ) is the factor, differential function the so called energy rate function. Although this function cannot be made optimal as regards technological energy input. It is more obvious if we use the function of technological net energy difference (Neményi, 1983). The Enet,techn. function (usually a parabola) has a maximum→ 0/ .,., =∂∂ techintechnnet EE The energy input of this rate gives the difference between the highest energy output and the technological energy input, so a higher technological energy input decreases the net utility of solar energy. We have to emphasize that the maximum of .,technnetE function is not detectable at the maximum of technological energy input of the .,technoutE function, but at a lower rate. According to wheat experiments for several decades Pepó (2004) described the relation between the period of 1985-1996 and 1997-2003.</p><p id="Pg77">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 532 In the previous case the biggest energy difference is 189,145 MJ/ha, that shows 11,604 kg/ha difference in output, while the output difference between 1997 and 2003 is 11,159 kg/ha. This can be contrasted with the output that appears on the fields out of crop. In Hungary this value is between 6,000-7,500 kg/ha (Láng in Shirezhev, 2000). Conclusions At the input causing the highest net technological energy, that is the maximum of such input, the rate of the diversity can be defined. On the basis of this information the rate of decreasing entropy can be calculated under reasonable intervention. It is another question who decides the rate between the two extreme energy inputs - taking energy and food supply, social, political etc. aspects into consideration. The effects of technological energy input causing decreasing diversity is gradually decreasing by using rapidly developing technologies of precision plant production and other techniques aided by satellites (Milics, 2007; Milics – Tamás, 2007; Milics G. 2008; Szabó et al., 2007; Németh et al., 2007; Neményi et al., 2006; Neményi et al., 2008).

Several stress factors induce elevation of anthocyanin content in plant tissues which suggests their possible participation in the antioxidant defense mechanisms. Duckweed Spirodela polyrrhiza accumulate considerable amounts of anthocyanins on its abaxial frond surface. In this work we investigated the effects on Cr (VI) (0-100 µM) on growth and the relationship between growth rate and leaf anthocyanin content in axenic cultures of two S. polyrrhiza ecotypes. We hypothesized that anthocyanin accumulation capacity of plants would influence the development of oxidative damage and reduction of growth under Cr (VI) treatments. S. polyrrhiza ecotype with lower anthocyanin production exhibited stronger growth potential under growth conditions but it responded more sensitively to Cr (VI). On the other hand the S. polyrrhiza ecotype with constitutive anthocyanin accumulation showed slower growth but higher tolerance against Cr (VI). Furthermore these results also suggest that ecotypedependent differences in anthocyanin accumulation of this species may at least partly explain the observed differences in growth rates of two ecotypes under Cr (VI) stress. Keywords: anthocyanins, chromium (VI), duckweed, heavy metal, stress Introduction Despite the frequent appearance of anthocyanins in plants their actual physiological role is still unclear. This pigment group, like other flavonoid compounds may have multifold role, e.g. photoprotective, antioxidant and osmoregulative functions (Láposi and Mészáros 2005, Pintér et al. 2007, Szepesi et al. 2008) but pros and contras make hard to definitely answer this question (Manetas 2006). Elevation of their concentration in certain plant tissues under stress suggests the probability of their participation in the antioxidant defense (Veres et al. 2008). Heavy metals may induce severe oxidative damage principally in phtosynthesizing tissues. Elimination of harmful effects needs the rapid onset of effective antioxidant processes including accumulation of specific compounds (Solti et al. 2008). Duckweed Spirodela polyrrhiza is one of the largest representatives of Lemnoideae (Araceae). In contrast with most duckweed species S. polyrrhiza accumulates considerable amount of anthocyanins on its abaxial frond surface. This pigment accumulation takes place even under ‘normal’ conditions and increases to multifold levels due to various environmental constraints providing a proper marker of stress in this species (Oláh et al. 2008a). Advantageous growth properties (Lakatos et al. 1993) and anthocyanin accumulative capacity of some duckweed species make them appropriate test organisms in ecotoxicological research (Tkalec et al. 1998, Kumar and Sharma 1999). The aim of present study was to explore whether anthocyanin accumulation of S. polyrrhiza had actual role in coping with chromium (VI) induced oxidative stress.</p><p id="Pg79">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 534 Materials and methods Axenic cultures of two S. polyrrhiza ecotypes were used which differ in anthocyanin accumulating capacity (Oláh et al. 2008b). The ecotype ‘KB’, collected from lake KisBalaton (Hungary) has low anthocyanin accumulation. The ecotype ‘KSz’ collected in a former sewage water pond affected by strong chromium load next to the town Kunszentmárton (Hungary) (Keresztúri et al. 2008) exhibits permanent considerable anthocyanin accumulation even under optimal growth conditions. Cultures of both ecotypes were grown on 1/2th strength Hutner’s medium under controlled conditions (Oláh et al. 2008b) under axenic conditions. Tests were performed with an initial frond number of 12 (~15-20 mg and 0,9-1,2 cm 2 ) in 100 cm 3 Erlenmeyer’s flasks containing 50 cm 3 Hutner’s medium. Chromium (VI) (K2Cr2O7) was applied as an oxidizing agent (Hörcsik et al. 2007) at 0, 25, 50 and 100 µM Cr (VI) l-1 concentrations in 4 replicates. Effects of Cr (VI) on growth parameters and anthocyanin accumulation were measured on the 10 th day of Cr (VI) treatments. Growth and Cr (VI) induced inhibition of cultures was characterized by relative growth rates calculated by changes in fresh weights and total frond areas (Oláh et al. 2008a). Anthocyanin content of plants was measured spectrophotometrically in MeOH/distilled water/HCl 79:20:1 (v/v/v) extractions and was expressed as absorbance at 530 nm per unit fresh weight or frond area (Oláh et al. 2008a). Results and discussion Growing under same conditions the two clones of S. polyrrhiza showed different growth speed. RGR values of the control cultures indicated stronger growth potential of KB strain compared to that of KSz ecotype (Table 1.). Table 1.

The inhibition was different in case of the two ecotypes (Table 1., Figure 1.). With a lower decrease in growth rates KSz ecotype showed considerably higher tolerance to Cr (VI) at 25 and 50 µM concentrations. However, growth inhibition was more or less the same at 100 µM Cr (VI) in the cultures of both ecotypes. S. polyrrhiza plants usually accumulate considerable amounts of anthocyanins on their abaxial frond surface. In pure (i.e. without Cr) culture only KSz ecotype shows significant anthocyanin accumulation, KB colonies seem to be green and contain negligible anthocyanin content (Oláh et al. 2008b). It had been reported that non-lethal stress can enhance anthocyanin accumulation of S. polyrrhiza (Tkalec et al. 1998, Kumar and Sharma 1999, Oláh et al. 2008a).</p><p id="Pg80">VIII.

On the 10 th day of tests Cr (VI) resulted in multifold and concentration-dependent increase in anthocyanin levels (Table 2., Figure 2.).

Phytoremediation uses living higher plants for the removal and biochemical decomposition of environmental pollutants and became a front-runner among cleanup technologies. The efficiency of plants as detoxifiers, filters or traps has been proven in cleaning up soils polluted with crude oil, explosives, landfill leachates, metals, pesticides, and solvents. Although phytoremediation of POPs is made very difficult by their low bioavailability, recent literature indicated that some plants (primarily those belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family) are capable of taking up significant amounts of POPs and accumulate them in their tissues. A joint French-Hungarian research project will investigate the possibility of phytoremediation of POPs. Keywords: Persistent organic pollutants, POPs, phytoremediation, uptake, translocation, metabolism Introduction Chlorinated insecticides and polychlorinated biphenyls representing groups A and B of persistent organic pollutants (POPs, Table 1 and Figure 1) have been developed in the first half of the twentieth century. Group C relate to polychlorinated dioxins and furans (Table 1 and Figure 1) that are generated as bye-products of industrial processes and incineration [Inui et al. 2008, White 2009]. Table 1.

Environmental and human health hazards demand the cleanup of sites polluted by POPs. Phytoremediation, i.e. the use of plants for removing, sequestering, or chemically decomposing environmental pollutants, has become one of the most rapidly developing fields of environmental restoration.

Although information on the phytoremediation of POPs is rather scanty, very recent literature has indicated that some plants (primarily those belonging to the Cucurbitaceae family) are capable of taking up significant amounts of POPs and accumulate them in their tissues [Inui et al. 2008, White 2009].

Examples of POP chemicals belonging to groups A, B, and C The collaborative study between our laboratories will focus on the possibility of phytoremediation of soils contaminated by POPs. Uptake and Translocation of POPs in plants Uptake and translocation of a POP molecule in plant tissues depends on the pollutant’s concentration in the soil solution, its ability to enter the root system, and the rate of transpiration in the plant [Komives and Gullner 2000]. Binding of most POPs to soil particles is practically irreversible and usually very little desorption occurs: only low concentrations of POPs can be detected in the soil solution and POPs seldom reach the groundwater. Therefore, efficacy of the phytoremediation of POPs is limited by the bioavailability of the pollutant. Bioavailability is determined by the physical and chemical properties of the POP molecule, as well as those of the soil. Uptake of aqueous solutions of POPs and their translocation within plant tissues are usually passive processes, regulated by the water transport into the cells. Thus, removal of POPs from soil is possible only by increasing their apparent water-solubility. A new approach takes advantage of the ability of cyclodextrins to increase the elution of organic compounds from soils. Cyclodextrins have dual solubilizing potency: they may act as surfactants as well as complexing agents that form inclusion complexes with hydrophobic compounds. Metabolism of POPs in plants An efficient phytoremediation of POPs would include the conversion of the pollutants by the plant tissues into harmless derivatives. Unfortunately, very little is known about the rates of transformation and the structure of the metabolites derived from individual POP molecules by plant cells [Campos et al. 2008], although plants are capable of transforming a number of xenobiotics by a wide variety of chemical/biochemical metabolic pathways. These biotransformation reactions are generally referred to as Pha-</p><p id="Pg84">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 539 ses I and II, where Phase I includes oxidative transformations and Phase II deals with the conjugation of Phase I products to amino acids or sugars. Xenobiotic (hydrophobic) Phase I Functionalized derivative (less hydrophobic) Conjugate (hydrophilic) Phase II Phase III Terminal metabolite (compartmentized) Figure 2. Metabolic scheme of the biotransformations of xenobiotics in plants In plants, the oxidative metabolism in the Phase I system is usually mediated by cytochrome P-450-containing mixed function oxygenases (CYP, E.C.1.14.-.-). These enzymes support the oxidative, peroxidative and reductive metabolism of both endogenous and xenobiotic substrates. In plants there are a surprisingly high number of CYP genes: 246 in Arabidopsis (representing approximately 1% of the plant’s gene complement) compared with less than a 100 in humans. CYP enzymes are characterized by the high diversity of reactions that they catalyze and the high range of their chemically divergent substrates. Increasing emphasis on functional genomic approaches to CYP research recently has greatly advanced our understanding of CYP-mediated reactions in plants. In the Phase II systems hydrophobic xenobiotics functionalized by the Phase I system are converted to more hydrophilic forms via conjugation with sugars or sulfhydryl (-SH) group-containing tripeptides, such as glutathione (γ-L-glutamyl-Lcysteinyl-glycine, GSH). Plants lack the excretion system of animals. In plant cells toxic metabolites and pollutants are sequestered into the cell vacuole. This Phase III type process is an active one and is catalyzed by membrane-bound ATP-driven pumps [Komives and Gullner 2004]. Discussion and conclusions The questions the unique ability of some Cucurbitaceae plants to take up and accumulate POPs raises are very interesting. Most importantly, the key factors influencing the uptake are not known and should be investigated. In practical application, the high-uptake plants will be very useful in phytoremediation of POPs and they can also serve as possible hosts for phytomonitoring of these contaminants in soils. On the other hand, the findings show that non-cucurbit crops make good substitute crops in fields contaminated with POPs. Also, low-uptake Cucurbita biotypes will be useful in the breeding of substitute rootstocks for grafting commercial cucumber and melon cultivars. Another intriguing aspect of the phytoremediation of POPs is the dependence of the uptake and translocation processes on the chemical structure of the pollutants.</p><p id="Pg85">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 540 Quantitative structure-activity relationships describing their behavior in the soil-soil solution-plant system will provide us information on key biological mechanisms determining the efficiency of phytoremediation. With advances in plant biology and soil science, phytoremediation has become one of the most rapidly developing fields of environmental restoration. Our knowledge of the factors that determine the efficiency of the phytoremediation of organic pollutants has expanded greatly in recent years. It became evident that this process is determined by a highly complicated sequence of events, elements of which may play a significant role, depending on the plant-soil-pollutant system (Jolánkai et al. 2008). In case of POPs the key role of the solubilization of the pollutant has been clearly established. However, much is yet to be learned about the systems regulating the uptake of POPs by plant roots, especially, with respect to their specificity and their mechanism of regulation. Genetic variability studies of Cucurbitaceae [Szabó et al. 2005] and investigations to follow the fate of POPs in hyperaccumulating plants will provide us with exciting challenges for further research.

To this date, measured and simulated (using HYDRUS–ET model) SWC distributions in the 0.10 – 0.15 m soil layer were compared for two identified soil types (clay loam, loamy sand), respectively. Model approximated the measured SWC variability well. After that, the simulations went on for the whole vegetation season with maize being the modeled crop. From the outputs of the model, maximum and minimum values of potential evapotranspiration, Etp were used to calculate the ranges of possible θla values for both textural classes. The θla values varied strongly depending on both, the evapotranspiration rate and the textural heterogeneity of soil. The influence of textural heterogeneity was roughly the half of that of evapotranspiration rate. Keywords: soil water availability, spatial variability, soil water content, evapotranspiration rate, HYDRUSET model Introduction The critical SWC of limited availability for plants θla characterizes an average SWC of the upper soil root zone layer at which transpiration rate is starting to decrease followed by the biomass production decrease (Novák and Havrila, 2006). It depends on actual evaporative demand of the atmosphere Etp, specific physiology of the respective crop, the functional dependence of SWC on soil water potential θ(h) and the hydraulic conductivity function k(θ). Thus, it is not a constant value, but it moves in a relatively wide range, in which transpiration is not limited by lack of water (Šimůnek and Hopmans, 2008; Feddes and Raats, 2004). The bottom boundary of this range θla-min., corresponds to the minimum transpiration rate and the upper boundary θla-max. corresponds to maximum transpiration rate. (Fig. 1). Figure 1.

For details about the sampling strategy and estimated soil hydraulic characteristics see Orfánus et al. (2008). Two different soil textures with narrow transition between them were identified. Fig. 2 shows the horizontal distribution of SWC in the 0.10 – 0.15 m layer over the research plot. The distinct bimodal distribution of SWC should be ascribed to the abrupt change in soil texture. SWC variability reproduction Further, it was tested whether the spatial variability of SWC can be satisfactorily reproduced by the variability of estimated θ(h) and k(θ), when using one-dimensional mathematical model. Model HYDRUS –ET was used as a simulation tool (Šimůnek et al., 1997). θ(h) and k(θ) estimated in horizon 0.10 – 0.15 m were assigned for the soil layer 0 – 0.25 m and those estimated in horizon 0.30 – 0.35 m were assigned for the rest of the soil profile, during the simulation period (81 days from 19. 01. 2002 till 10. 04. 2002). The upper boundary condition was defined by daily meteorological characteristics (air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, sunshine duration and vapour pressure). The weekly averages of groundwater table depth were set as bottom boundary condition; the SWC at field capacity (after the snowmelt) was set as an initial condition. Measured and simulated SWC distributions to the date 10. 04. 2002 were compared to validate the model.

Results and discussion Influence of soil texture on SWC is strong, as was expected, but the SWC variability in both soil types is similar (Table 1). The simulated values of SWC are overestimated by about 6 % vol. when compared with the measured ones (table 1). It was probably caused by the hysteresis effect. Considering the shallow groundwater table during the whole simulated season (about 0.7 m under the soil surface), using also the wetting branch of θ(h) in simulations would provide better results. Both, measured and simulated distributions of SWC kept approximately the gauss-curve shape and the standard deviation moved between 4 and 6 % of volume (Table 1).

Cereal Research Communications 544 Values of calculated θla moved between 0.19 and 0.34 in clay loam soil when the transpiration is the highest calculated (5.1 mm / day) and in the range from 0.09 to 0.25 when the transpiration is low (1 mm / day). In case of loam sandy soil the corresponding intervals of θla for the same transpiration rates were (0.16 - 0.25) and (0.066 – 0.15). Conclusions The spatial variability of actual SWC in the root zone in our study was significant and good agreement between modelled and measured SWC distributions showed that it is influenced mostly by the spatial variability of the hydraulic characteristics of soil (soil hydraulic conductivity, soil water retention curves). The spatial variability of the SWC of limited availability for plants θla is similar to the variability of the actual SWC. The θla values strongly depend on both, the transpiration rate and the textural heterogeneity of soil. Maximal differences ∆θla due to temporal variability of evaporative demand under maize cover reached 100 mm of water layer in one-meter thick soil layer during the vegetation season 2002. The influence of soil texture was roughly the half. These results are significant and should be considerd in on-farm research and agricultural practice mostly in context of the avised climatic change (Eitzinger et al., 2008).

In Hungary, the bioindication of ozone has started in June 2007, using the ozone bioindicator clover clones (Trifolium repens NC-S and NC-R) and bean strains (Phaseolus vulgaris S156 and R123) according to the ICP Vegetation Protocol. Besides collecting ozone and meteorological data, ozone injuries, dry weight and number of flowers of clover plants, and dry weight and number of pods of bean clones were assessed. Stomatal conductance and chlorophyll fluorescence of experimental plants were also measured. The typical symptoms of ozone injury were observed on sensitive clones of both plant species, and the extent of symptoms proved to be directly proportional to the ozone pollution expressed as the cumulative daily AOT40 values. Besides the typical symptoms, number of flowers of clover clones could also be a useful indicator of tropospheric ozone load. In addition, the measured physiological parameters showed differences between sensitive and resistant clones: Fv/Fm ratios and Rfd values of sensitive plants were usually higher than those of the resistant plants, however in the case of stomatal conductance, contradictory results were observed. Keywords: tropospheric ozone, bioindication Introduction Tropospheric ozone is not only the constituent of photochemical smog, but it is also a greenhouse gas. Ozone injures plants by causing oxidative stress, just like other stressors, such as excess of certain metals (Bouazizi et al., 2008). There are consequences of ozone damage on agricultural production, because it affects both yield quantity and quality (Hayes et al., 2007). Bioindicators have been used to detect the toxic ozone levels on a large scale since the 1950s (Cristina et al., 2008). A field experiment conducted in USA in the late 80’s revealed variability in sensitivity to ozone in the Regal line of Trifolium repens L. The vegetative propagation of the plants selected by their field response determined the identification of NC-S (ozone sensitive) and NC-R (ozone resistant) clones. Although the clover system shows difference in biomass production at ambient ozone levels, the reason for the difference in ozone sensitivity is not yet fully understood (Cristina et al., 2008). Disparities in O3 sensitivity also have been identified among genotypes of snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). Genotypes R123 and R331 are considered O3 tolerant while genotype S156 is known to be highly sensitive. Open-top chamber (OTC) studies have shown that pod yield and biomass production are suppressed in S156 while effects on R123 are minimal under moderate ozone stress (Flowers et al., 2007). Alterations in photosynthesis can occur before visible symptoms of injury appear. Stomatal limitations may be the cause of decreased photosynthesis, however, in some ozone exposure experiments contradictory results have been found (He et al., 2007). All these literature data show that there are considerable uncertainties in understanding the effect of ozone on physiological processes, and that the mechanisms or physiological differences that determinate O3 sensitivity in plants are still not known. Besides building an ozone</p><p id="Pg91">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 546 biomonitoring project in Hungary, we aimed to examine physiological features those responsible for ozone sensitivity. Since elevated levels of carbon dioxide can change the plant’s resistance against several stresses (Bencze et al., 2007), we also tried to evaluate the combined effect of CO2 and ozone. Materials and methods Our experimental site in Gödöllı lies close to our capital city (40 km) so it might be affected by the pollutants of the town. Plants studied were the Trifolium repens L. cv. Regal NC-S (ozone sensitive) and NC-R (ozone resistant) clones, and Phaseolus vulgaris S156 and R123 strains. The experimental plants were grown in pots. Open-top chamber experiments with elevated CO2 (700 ppm), control chambers with ambient air and field grown control plants were carried out to examine the joint effect of CO2 and ozone. Planting and transplantation of white clover clones and bean strains and also injury assessments were performed according to the Protocol of the ICP-Vegetation (International Cooperative Programme on Effects of Air Pollution on Natural Vegetation and Crops, Hayes et al., 2006). Besides assessment of ozone injuries measuring of total dry weight and number of flowers of clover plants and total dry weight and number of pods of bean plants were also performed. Measurements of chlorophyll-a fluorescence induction (Handy PEA Fluorescence Measurement System) and stomatal conductance (AP4 Porometer AT Delta-T Device, UK) were made on each plant and treatment. All measurements were carried out at least in 5 replications. Results and discussion Ozone injuries of clover clones in the OTCs without elevated CO2 were more expanded than those grown in field or in OTCs with elevated CO2, which means that glasshouse effect of OTCs promotes development of ozone symptoms. Bean plants grown in field showed higher extents of ozone injuries than those grown in control OTCs. This difference between the behaviour of the two ozone bioindicator species may refers to their different environmental needs. The CO2 fumigation decreased the emerging of ozone injuries in each case; consequently CO2 can partly compensate the harmful effect of ozone on sensitive plants (Fig. 1. A and B). Number of flowers of sensitive clover clones were lower on treated as well as on control plants, and as the ozone load enhanced, the difference between the sensitive and resistant clones increased. CO2 fumigation considerably elevated the number of pods of ozone sensitive bean strain. In autumn, pods did not develop on field grown bean plants because of colder conditions compared with that in OTCs, where warmer conditions prolonged the vegetation period (Fig. 2 A and B).</p><p id="Pg92">VIII.

Stomatal conductance of sensitive clover clone showed generally lower values than that of the resistant one, while in the case of bean stomatal conductance of sensitive strain was higher in summer, but not in the autumn period. Unexpectedly, maximal efficiency of light energy conversion of PSII indicated by Fv/Fm values was higher at sensitive clover and field grown sensitive bean plants. However, in the case of bean strains this was a consequence of extremely low values of Fv/Fm of resistant plants. In clover clones, higher Fv/Fm ratios are usually accompanied by higher RFd values. In bean plants, this phenomenon occurs only in the colder autumn period, and only in field grown plants which are more affected by cold temperature. Elevated CO2 concentration had effect only on RFd values of clover plants during the intensive growth period.

Conclusions According to our study, clover clones proved to be more suitable for ozone bioindication since besides the symptoms other morphological (the number of flowers) and physiological characteristics (primarily the stomatal conductance) were also markedly changed with changing ozone loads. Our results show that the number of flowers of clover could also be a useful indicator of ozone pollution. In addition, similarly to the literature data, we found that changing temperature and CO2 concentration can change the effect of ozone on sensitive plants.

Károly ANTAL – Julia BUDAI – Sándor SZABÓ Karcag Research Institute, CASE, University of Debrecen, Kisújszállási út 166., H-5300 Karcag, Hungary, e-mail: antal@dateki.hu Abstract: A number of abnormal environment parameters such as salinity, nutrient imbalances, heavy metal pollution etc. are collectively termed as abiotic stress factors. Application of a sheep manure compost was tested as a possible way of protection of plants from abiotic stresses caused by high heavy metal contents and nutrient imbalances. Pot experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of the compost on the growth and the stress tolerance of maize. We tried to obtain detailed information about the compost feature which increases the stress tolerance of plants on the basis of experimental data originated from the chemical analysis of the tested soil and the compost and from the carried out sorption and heavy metal leaching laboratory tests. Adsorption of extracted humic–like components of the compost on contaminated soils was studied by Langmuir-type isotherm to make clear the sorption processes of soluble organic fraction of compost in the heavy metal polluted soil. We established the effects of the applied compost on the solubility of soil pollutants by measuring the extent of salt leaching from the tested contaminated soil as well. Keywords: abiotic stress, stress tolerance, sheep manure compost, Langmuir-type adsorption isotherm, solubility of salts Introduction The metal mine at Gyöngyösoroszi closed up in 1986. The slag sites of this area contain residual heavy metals (e.g. Zn, Cu, Pb, Hg, Cd). The location and the degree of the contamination were studied in details in this area and a contamination map was constructed (Draskovits et al., 2002). The vegetations of these slag sites were mapped as well and different phytoremediation experiments were carried out here (Draskovits et al., 2002, Murányi and Ködöböcz, 2008). Application of composts for the purpose of increase the stress tolerance of plants is wide-spread in agricultural practice (Bülent et al., 2007; Ma del mar Delgado et al., 2002). However, the effect of composts is not completely clear in this respect. It is known that composts contain high amount of humic-like matters which are very good complex forming agents for metal ions, therefore we presume that the composts can protect plants from the stress and the toxicity caused by different heavy metals (Fodor, 2003; Keresztúri et al., 2008). Pot experiments were carried out with four different compost doses 0 (control), 50 g, 100 g, 200 g per pot (0, 30, 60, 120 t ha -1 compost doses respectively). In order to clarify this concept, we studied the adsorption of humic-like fraction of the compost in the tested slag site soil, and the leaching processes of heavy metal ions from the soil treated with a sheep manure compost similarly to the methods used by Esakku et al. (2008). The compost applied in our experiments was made from sheep manure (SM). Its production technology was developed by our institute. In this paper we summarize the conclusions of our study concerning to the abiotic stress moderating effect of the tested compost. Materials and methods Pot experiments: Maize was grown in contaminated soils treated with SM compost in a greenhouse. The soil was collected from the surface layer of the contaminated area at Gyöngysoroszi. 5 kg of soil were put into plastic buckets. The following amounts of SM</p><p id="Pg95">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 550 compost were added to the soil: 0 (control), 50 g, 100 g and 200 g per pot. The pots were arranged in completely randomized design with four replicates. 20 maize seeds were sown in each pot as indicator plants. Soil and compost analyses: The soil and the compost analyses were carried out according to the adequate Hungarian standards. The concentrations of the metal ions were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry with SpectraAA 220FS spectrometer in both cases. Adsorption experiments of Extracted Humic-like Material (EHLM) on soil by Langmuir isotherms: The equilibrium concentration of EHLM was determined spectrophotometrically based on the calibration curve. The adsorbed amount of EHLM was calculated by the following formula: a = (C0-Ce)V m -1 , where: C0 is the initial concentration, Ce is the equilibrium concentration of EHLM after the adsorption, while V is the volume of the solution, m is the weight of the adsorbent (soil). By calculating Θ=a/amax, the coverage of the surface (%), the Langmuir-plots were analyzed. Salt leaching experiments: Soil samples of 100 g were suspended in a 0.5 dm3 0.65-5 m% aqueous solution of EHLM at room temperature for a month. At the end we determined the amount of salt in the liquid phase gravimetrically. Results and discussion The pot experiment shows clearly that the increasing amount of compost resulted in the monotonously increasing height of maize (Figure 1). It can be probably caused by the improving phosphorus (P) supply and the complex forming ability (with metal ions) of the SM compost. Figure 1. The effect of the SM compost doses on the height of maize in pot experiment Some chemical features of the soil and the applied compost are presented in the Table 1-2, respectively. The analytical data show clearly a deficiency of phosphorus in the tested soil (Table 1). Contrary to the investigated soil, the compost provided a good phosphorus source for the plants. Table 1.

Another problem was whether the reduction of the chromium caused by the heavy metal content lead to false results (Table 1 and 3). We calculated the availability of the heavy metals for plants in the examined soil (Table 3) to clarify the cause of heavy metal stress. Table 3.

It means that the EHLM forms a monomolecular layer on the surface of the soil particles and the process is reversible. The type of this bond is probably electrostatic with binding constant of 2.9+0.3 dm 3 g -1 , which represents a remarkably strong interaction between the surface of soil particles and EHLM. y = 0.9845x + 0.3227 R 2 = 0.9985 0 5 10 15 20 0 5 10 15 20 ce Figure 2. Linearized Langmuir-type isotherm of EHLM extract on the tested soil Figure 3-5 show that the compost application decreases the solubility of salts and heavy metals ions. Hence their availability for plants decreased as well in soil-SM compost suspensions.

The following conclusions can be drawn on the base of our results: 1. The water soluble fraction of the compost can adsorb strongly to the contaminated soil particles, and as a very good complex forming material, it can prevent the plants from the heavy metal stress. 2. The SM compost reduces the solubility of salts and heavy metals, hence their availability as well. 3. The phosphorous content of the compost improves the P supply of the crops and decreases the stress caused by the phosphorus deficiency. We established that the favourable effect of the compost application resulted in a higher productivity of the maize plants in the pot experiment.

DURING DISPERSION STAGE ON A SANDDUNE AREA IN HUNGARY Melinda JUHÁSZ 1 – István BAGI 2 1 Institute of Botany and Ecophysiology, Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, Szent István University, 1 Páter K. u., Gödöllı, 2103, Hungary, e-mail: melinda.juhasz@gmail.com 2 Dept. of Plant Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Szeged, 52 Közép fasor, Szeged, 6701, Hungary Abstract: Four to five decades ago significant areas in numerous regions of Hungary were planted by bird cherry (Prunus serotina (Ehrh.)), however at present the area occupied by this tree species is already considerably larger, even in areas affected by drought stress. The aims of our investigations were to determine the physiological features playing substantial role in this invasive tendency and the ecophysiological properties that ensure the survival and successfulness of spreading individuals. On behalf of this we made detailed photosynthesis and stomatal investigation on seedlings, saplings, and older individuals at the focal point and at the dispersal area. Individuals at the focal point can be distinguished into three juvenile groups with improving ecophysiological characteristics and tolerance against drought and photoinhibition along with age and size of plants. The most sensitive age-category was the seedlings grown in amazingly dense patches. The most important environmental factor determinant in survival was the water supply and the excess of irradiance during drought stress. At the dispersal area the prospects of survival of scattered individuals grown under the forest canopy was considerably higher. At this place the same drought-stress had notably less limiting role. It exerted unfavorable influence only on individuals in marginal or exposed situation. Keywords: coenopopulation, drought, invasion, ecophysiology, juvenile, P. serotina, sand dune Introduction The invading and transformer plant species cause enormous damage in natural habitats by drastically decreasing the biodiversity. If they successfully spread in a landscape they disadvantageously modify numerous essential ecosystem processes at both population and community levels. The two major environmental problems, the climate change and the invasion are in close connection each together. The exciting agent of both problems is the considerable modification of aspect of human activity. In connection with the enhancing globalization the increased claims on traffic, trade and energy significantly speeded up the climate change as well as the invasion of nonindigenous species. Beside the large extent of accidental introduction, the special human demands (such as cold or drought tolerance, disease resistance, or high productivity) on non-indigenous plant species (NIPS) to be intended to cultivate for agricultural, horticultural or economical purpose can represent another great risk, because these required features can be advantages to turn into invader (Theoharides &amp; Dukes 2007). If the climate change affects the filters that limit the success of NIPS, these plants which generally have greater physiological and phenotypic plasticity (Pattison et al. 1998, Lavergne &amp; Molofsky 2007) can obtain further benefits and can expand their presence towards colder and/or warmer areas (Theoharides &amp; Dukes 2007). One of the key issues of the protection against invasion is the identification of the most critical stage in which the invasion can stick with a great probability, since this can help to understand the interaction between invasion filters and invading characteristics (Wang &amp; Wang 2006). The only species can transform into a real invader which can attain the dispersion stage</p><p id="Pg99">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 554 (Botta-Dukat et al. 2004). This event is not only critical, but determines remarkably the spatial structure and distribution of non-native plant populations. For our investigation of dispersion stage, the transformer invading bird cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.) was chosen. This species is able to spread even in extremely arid environment. Its regional distribution in Flanders is manly limited by the scattering (Verheyen et al. 2007) although it has efficient dispersal system (mainly the wood pigeon, Columba palumbus) within the fragmented rural region of Western Europe (Deckers et al. 2008). The main aim of the present research was to establish how the environmental conditions in our investigated dispersal area are suitable for long-term survival and transformation of P. serotina to invader. We also investigated the differences in ecophysiological features of seedlings grown in an extremely dense stands at the invasion focal point and of sparse individuals of dispersal area. Materials and methods Our sampling area was chosen in an arid, sandy dune region in the Kiskunság National Park, close to Ágasegyháza, in Hungary. The invasion area was originally planted with P. serotina about four to five decades ago. The dispersal area was allocated in a pine plantation (Pinus sylvestris L.) with interspersed poplars (Populus x canescens Sm.) in which poplar trees represent popular perching places for propagating birds. In this area twelve 5x5 m 2 permanent quadrates were marked out. At the focal point numerous 1x1 m 2 quadrates were designated both under the shaded, monodominant bird cherry canopy and at the more exposed marginal situations. The juveniles were grouped into three age categories (seedlings of the year, 1-3 year-old, and 5-6 year-old saplings) and were investigated separately. In three-week regularity the stomatal conductance (AP4 Porometer AT Delta-T Device, UK), the chlorophyll-a flourescence induction (PEA Fluorescence Measurement System, Hansatech Instruments, UK, and CFM-636973 Double-wavelength Fluorometer, CEAT Ltd., Hungary), as well as the leaf temperature (Raytek MX4 infrared thermometer, Raytek, USA) were measured at both sites from the end of April to the beginning of October in 2008. Simultaneously the soil moisture in the rhizosphere (TDR reflectometer ML2, Delta-T devices Co., Cambridge, UK) and the soil temperature (soil thermometer) were also monitored. All measurements were carried out at least in 5 replications. Results and discussion During the investigated vegetation period from April to October in 2008, the maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem 2 (PS2) expressed by Fv/Fm was evenly high in all the three coenopopulation (age) categories at the dispersal area (Fig. 1A). On the contrary, Fv/Fm values of juveniles grown under the canopy decreased significantly at the invasion area in August, but restored during the wet autumn. In 2008, the peak of drought occurred also in August. This decline, however, appeared just only in August, the maximal photochemical efficiency was also stable at focal point during the preceding period, even during the evolving drought at the end of July (data not showed). At early summer the non-photochemical quenching estimated by RFd was significantly higher at invasion source than at dispersal area in every case of age categories (Fig. 1B).</p><p id="Pg100">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 555 At late summer, this contrast between the two areas decreased and finally disappeared in autumn. The great decrease in Fv/Fm in August without a remarkable change in RFd indicates a seriously increased sensitivity to photoinhibition at the source area. The Fm690/Fm735 ratio which is inversely proportional to chlorophyll content did not show any significant difference between the two areas or among the three age categories. However there was a gradual increase in this ratio in time indicating a temporal decrease in chlorophyll content (Fig. 1C). In spite of slightly lower soil moisture at the dispersion area through the whole investigated period the stomatal conductance (gs) of the spread P. serotina juveniles was considerably higher in June and even during the water limited subpessimum in August when the gs was extremely dropped in every case. In autumn, however, the survivors of drought stress showed higher stomatal conductance at the source area (Fig. 1D). 18-Jun 14-Aug 7-Oct R F d 2 3 4 5 seedling 1-3 year-old 5-6 year-old F v /F m 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 seedling 1-3 year-old 5-6 year-old source areadispersion area A B F m 6 9 0 /F m 7 3 5 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 seedling 1-3 year-old 5-6 year-old 18-Jun 14-Aug 7-Oct g s ( m m o l m -2 s -1 ) 0 8 16 40 80 120 seedling 1-3 year-old 5-6 year-old source areadispersion area C D Figure 1.

In respect to survival the enduring restricted allocation to root or the insufficient carbohydrate supply for root growing has a role of crucial importance in arid habitats (Marshall 1986). Because the root system cannot develop to adequate depth it is not able to remain contact with the moister soil layer during the dry season (Coomes &amp; Grubb 2000). The reduced gs in the invasion area even at optimal water supply let also to suppose reduced assimilation rate mainly among the youngest, densely developing seedlings. The permanent intraspecific root competition, the drought and heat stresses and the increased susceptibility to photoinhibition resulted in a serious decay among current year seedlings in August, however only at the focal point. Similarly high mortality of young seedlings and a high survival rate of saplings older than 4 years were observed in a Belgian pine plantation with productive adult bird cherry trees (Pairon et al. 2006).</p><p id="Pg101">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 556 Beside the environmental conditions the successional stage is another key factor playing important role in regulation of photosynthetic carbon assimilation and allocational responses of plant species (Fekete et al. 1988, Ürmös et al. 2007). According to Tari et al. (2008), the sustained steady Fv/Fm of bird cherry’s juveniles suggests broad physiological plasticity which can provide either starch accumulation or favorable alteration in photosynthetic pigment composition (Maróti et al. 1984, Tuba 1984) for the sporadic individuals of dispersion stage or the thinned survivors at the source area helping to prepare themselves for the water limited period. Conclusions At both sites seedlings were the most sensitive coenopopulation category. The most important environmental factors determinant in their survival was the water supply and the excess of irradiance during drought stress. At the dispersal area, however, the prospects of survival of scattered individuals grown under the pine plantation canopy were considerably higher. At this place the same drought-stress had notably less limiting role, and exerted unfavorable influence only on individuals in marginal or exposed situation.

Paraquat/methylviologen/ (MV) is widely used as nonselective contact herbicide and as crop dessicant on products. Pesticides may induce oxidative stress, leading to generation of free radicals and alternative in antioxidants, oxygen free radicals, the scavenging enzyme system and lipid peroxidation. Buckwheat is a valuable source of flavonoid of rutin. The effect of 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 168 hours treatment of MV in 3 various concentrations on rutin production by Fagopyrum esculentum callus and suspension cultures was tested in this study. The maximum rutin content (0.25 %) in callus culture was demonstrated after 72 hours of MV elicitation in concentration of 2.1929.103mol/L. The maximum rutin content in suspension culture (0.02 %) was reached after 24 hour of MV treatment in concentration of 2.1929.10-5 mol/L. Keywords: Paraquat, methylviologen, rutin, Fagopyrum, culture in vitro Introduction Plant tissue and cell cultures provide model systems for the study of various molecular, physiological, systemic and genetic problems. These systems were used in studies with herbicides and other xenobiotics (Dwight Cameber and McDonald, 1989). The bipyridyl herbicides exist in the market as paraquat, diquat and mixtures of these 2 agents. Paraquat/methylviologen/ (MV) is used throughout the word as contact herbicid and as crop dessicant on products such as cotton (Dinis-Olivera et al., 2008). Herbicides may induce oxidative stress, leading to generation of free radicals and alternative in antioxidants, oxygen free radicals, the scavenging enzyme system and lipid peroxidation.The basic mechanism of oxidative stress in bipyridyls is simple: they initiate a cyclic oxidation/reduction process. First, they undergo 1 electron reduction by NADPH to form free radicals that donate their electron to O2, producing a superoxide radical; upon exhaustion of NADPH, superoxide reacts with itself and produces hydroxyl free radicals that lead to cell death. Hydroxyl free radicals are highly toxic and react with lipids in cell membrane, a destructive process known as lipid peroxidation (Smith 1978; Sunters, 2002). MV as generator of superoxide anion (O-2(-)) triggered the formation of cryptotanshinone (a phytoalexin) in cultures of both galls and hairy roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza. MV also inhibited the biomass formation and decreased the phenolic acids content in both cultures (Chen and Chen, 2000). Dandelion leaves exposed to MV showed a decrease of photosynthetic energy storage with increasing concentration of enviromental polutant (Szurkowski and Dobrowolska, 2006). So paraquat can be used to induce oxidative lipid peroxidation and lipid peroxidation can be taken as an indicator of oxidative stress. MV as a stress activator was able to increase resveratrol content in transgenic plants of Rehmania glutinosa L. (Lim et al., 2005) but decreased</p><p id="Pg103">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 558 the content of chlorophylls, carotenoids and soluble proteins in in vitro cultures of Gerbera (Lai et al., 2007). Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) is a valuable source of flavonoid-rutin. Buckwheat haulm is administered to increase blood vessel walls’ strength and elasticity. It is utilized in the treatment of varicose veins, hemorrhoids, venous ulcerations, also in cases of vascular deficiencies of the limbs that are characterized by the appearance of red capillary blood vessels and as prevention against blood vessel rapture (Janča and Zentrich, 1996). The aim of our study was to find the effect of MV on rutin content in Fagopyrum esculentum culture in vitro. Materials and methods Callus cultures were derived from the root parts of young seedlings of the Fagopyrum esculentum plants (in the 11st - 20st passage). The callus and suspension cultures were allowed to grow in Murashige-Skoog nutrient medium (Murashige and Skooge, 1962) supplemented with α- naphthalene acetic acid as a growth regulator for 3 weeks (Tumova et al., 2007) at 25°C under daylight photoperiod /16 h daylight and 8 h darkness/ (Safrankova and Hejnak, 2007). MV in concentrations of - c1 2.1929.10 -3 mol/L; c2 2.1929.10 -4 mol/L and c3 2.1929.10 -5 mol/L was added to the callus and suspension cultures on the 30 th day of cultivation. 12 h; 24 h; 48 h; 72 h and 168 hours after MV application, the cultures in vitro were sampled, dried and the content of rutin was determined. Simultaneously, the controls (without MV application) were run. Evaluation of rutin was done according Czech Pharmacopeia 2007 (Compositae authors, 1997). All experimental analyses were caried out in a minimum of 3 independent samples for each elicitation period and each concentration of MV. The rutin content was reffered to the dry weight of culture in vitro. Statistical significance was calculated using Student t-test for unpaired data (p≤0.05). Results and discussion Statistically significant increase in rutin content in Fagopyrum esculentum callus culture was observed after 12 and 72 hours of MV treatment (c1 concentration) and 72 hours of MV treatment (c2 concentration) and also after 6, 48 and 72 hours of MV treatment (c3 concentration). All three tested MV concentrations activated high-level rutin production in callus culture after 72 hours treatment. Maximum rutin content (0.25 %) was reached after 72 hours application of MV in c1 concentration (2.1929.10 -3 mol/L)Table 1. As shown in Table 1 rutin content in Fagopyrum esculentum suspension culture was statistically significant increased after 6 hours of MV treatment (c2 concentration) and after 6, 12 and 24 hours treatment of MV in c3 concentration. Maximum rutin content (0.02 %) in suspension culture is evident after 24 hours elicitation with MV in c3 concentration (2.1929.10 -5 mol/L ). Callus cultures were more sensitive to MV application in comparison with suspension cultures. The rutin production in callus culture was 12.5 times higher after 72 hours of MV application in c1 concentration in comparison with the highest rutin production in suspension culture.

Callus and suspension cultures of Fagopyrum esculentum didn´t produce rutin in the tested passages and without MV application. Paraquat as the stress factor was able to cause rutin production in F. esculentum callus and suspension cultures. Acknowledgements This work was supported by Research Project MSM 0021620822.

U. 1., e-mail: istvan.szabo@kti.szie.hu 2 Regional Center of Excellence, Szent István University, 2100 Gödöllı, Páter K. U. 1. Abstract: In our study 11 hydrocarbon degrading aerobic microbe strains were examined. These strains are originated from Hungarian hydrocarbon contaminated sites (eg. petrol stations, pipeline breakages and former oil distribution facilities, sites) and as members of a product (soil and groundwater inoculum) they are used for bioremediation purposes. In some cases the mentioned strains are used on hydrocarbon contaminated sites that have heavy metal pollution also (eg. complex contaminations of heavy industrial areas). High heavy metal concentrations are toxic (Takács et al., 2003) and able to decrease the growth of aerobic bacteria (Algaida et al, 2007). Our work was focused on this abiotic stress. This abiotic effect was studied by in vitro, agar diffusion hole tests and this method was used to determine the effect of 10, 100, 1000 and 5000 mg/l concentration of the chosen heavy metals (zinc, lead, copper, nickel and chromium[VI]) on the inoculum strains. Some of these elements (Zn, Cu) are essential but the excess of them is toxic (Raja et al, 2008). From practical point of view it was very important to determine whether the members of the inoculum are able to grow and degrade in groundwater or soil that is contaminated not only with hydrocarbon but with heavy metals also. After assessing the results of our study, strains from the inoculum, those could be selected that are able to degrade hydrocarbon compounds on these kinds of complex contaminated sites. Notes about heavy metal tolerance of the degrading strains could be added to the biodegrading products as information for users, to assure them the possibility of choosing the appropriate site specific inoculum. Keywords: heavy metals, hydrocarbon, biodegradation, microbes Introduction The aim of our study was in vitro examining of the toxic effects of different heavy metal compounds (Takács et al., 2003) as abiotic stress on eleven aerobic hydrocarbon degrading soil microbes. These microbes were isolated from hydrocarbon contaminated sites in Hungary (eg. petrol stations, oil facilities). Species of these microbe strains were determined by sequencing (ABI 310Prism) a semi conservative 16S rDNA region by 27 forward and 519 reverse primers. The nucleotide order was compared to the data of international reference DNA collections (BLAST, LeBibi). The identification results are able to be seen in Table 1. These strains are used on hydrocarbon contaminated sites as a part of biodegrading product (know how) for in situ, on site microbial remediation. Table 1.

Cereal Research Communications 562 Materials and methods The abiotic effect of five individual heavy metals in four different concentrations was measured on the eleven hydrocarbon degrading microbes. The used heavy metals were copper (CuSO4 × 5 H2O), zinc (ZnSO4 × 7 H2O), chromium(VI) (CrO3), nickel (Ni[NO3]2 × 6 H2O) and lead (Pb[NO3]2) in 10 mg/l, 100 mg/l, 1000 mg/l, 5000 mg/l concentrations. The inhibiting effects caused by these concentrations was measured by in vitro, agar diffusion hole tests. For these tests 24 hours old, individual bacteria cultures were multiplied from the eleven isolated strains on agar tubes. These isolated monocultures were washed into 50 ml nutrient solution and cultivated in shaken Erlenmeyer lombics to make a starting inoculum. 1-1 milliliters of the prepared starting inocula were put into Petri dishes and poured up by hand warm agar containing nutrient solution. Four holes with 1 cm diameter were drilled into these agar plates and the four mentioned concentration of heavy metal solutions were injected into them. The agar plates that were prepared like this were put into 10 ºC for ten hours to let the solution diffuse into the agar. After 48 hours the diameter of the clearing zone (excl. the diameter of injection hole) caused by the growing inhibition of the heavy metal solution were measured. This method was 5 times repeated with the strains and with the four concentration in parallel to avoid measuring mistakes. By the mathematical average of the five repeatedly measured clearing zone’s diameter the inhibition value of the heavy metal solutions was determined. The mentioned zone diameter was maximized in 4 centimeters so thus the heavy metal solution that caused bigger or equal inhibition diameter like this we determined that as 100% inhibition. Every clearing zone diameter length was compared to this value, to validate the caused inhibition value to percentage. Results and discussion By the percentage of inhibition it can be said that the examined microbes are mostly not sensitive to 10 and 100 mg/l concentration of the heavy metals (except zinc and chromium for CHB-15p and nickel for NCP-3). By the results of 1000 and 5000 mg/l concentration caused inhibition it could be noticed, that chromium(VI) caused the highest inhibition for the strains and lead caused the lowest (Figure 1.). 0,00 10,00 20,00 30,00 40,00 50,00 60,00 70,00 80,00 90,00 100,00 In h ib it io n % 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11.

Inhibition percentage between 0 and 10 was valued as negligible inhibition (0), between 10 and 20% (2-4 mm clearing zone around the injection hole) was rated as low inhibition (+), between 20-50% (4-10 mm clearing zone) resulted to inhibiting effect (++) and more than 50% (more than 10 mm clearing zone) was noticed as significant inhibition (+++). Table 2. contains the results of the (five times repeated) inhibition percentage values that was counted into the mentioned rating system. Table 2. Results of the inhibition parameters caused by the applied heavy metals for the strains By the rated values of inhibition percentage following results were noticed by strains: AK-35 (1.): inhibiting effect caused by copper was only detected in 5000 mg/l concentration. Zinc and chromium caused the same rate in 1000 mg/l concentration. Nickel and lead caused inhibition was rated as inhibiting effect in 1000mg/l. Significant inhibition was caused by zinc, chromium and nickel at 5000 mg/l concentration. AK-36 (2.): the examined heavy metals, including copper (that causing only low inhibition), causing inhibiting effect on this strain in 1000 mg/l concentration. AK-37 (3.): Lead causes inhibiting effect only in 5000 mg/l concentration. In 1000 mg/l concentration copper, zinc, chromium inhibited the growing of this strain as well as nickel causes significant inhibition effect in this concentration. AK-38 (4.): Copper caused low inhibition in 1000 mg/l and significant in 5000 mg/l concentration. The other chosen heavy metals (Ni, Cr[VI], Pb, Zn) caused inhibition effect at 1000 mg/l. AK-40 (5.): In 1000 mg/l concentration low inhibition was caused by lead, but copper didn’t cause any, in 5000 mg/l concentration inhibition effect was caused by lead and copper caused significant one. In case of zinc, chromium(VI) and nickel 1000 mg/l concentration caused inhibition effect. AK-44 (6.): in case of lead only 5000 mg/l concentration caused inhibition, moreover just a low one. 1000 mg/l of copper caused low inhibition, in case of zinc and nickel this concentration caused inhibiting effect, and significant inhibition was noticed by chromium(VI) solution. NCAIMB 1494 (7.): In case of 1000 mg/l concentration lead caused low inhibition, copper and zinc effect was rated as inhibiting, chromium(VI) and nickel caused significant inhibition to the growth of the Strains CuSO4 × 5 H2O ZnSO4 × 7 H2O CrO3 Ni(NO3)2 × 6 H2O Pb(NO3)2 100 1000 5000 100 1000 5000 100 1000 5000 100 1000 5000 100 1000 5000 No. mg/l mg/l mg/l mg/l mg/l 1. 0 0 ++ 0 ++ +++ 0 ++ +++ 0 + +++ 0 + ++ 2. 0 + ++ 0 ++ +++ 0 ++ +++ 0 ++ +++ 0 ++ ++ 3. 0 ++ +++ 0 ++ +++ 0 ++ +++ 0 +++ +++ 0 0 ++ 4. 0 + +++ 0 ++ +++ 0 ++ +++ 0 ++ +++ 0 ++ ++ 5. 0 0 +++ 0 ++ +++ 0 ++ +++ 0 ++ +++ 0 + ++ 6. 0 + +++ 0 ++ +++ 0 +++ +++ 0 ++ +++ 0 0 + 7. 0 ++ +++ 0 ++ ++ 0 +++ +++ 0 +++ +++ 0 + ++ 8. 0 ++ +++ 0 ++ +++ 0 +++ +++ ++ +++ +++ 0 + ++ 9. 0 ++ +++ 0 +++ +++ 0 +++ +++ 0 ++ +++ 0 0 ++ 11. 0 ++ +++ + ++ +++ + ++ +++ 0 ++ +++ 0 + ++ 12. 0 +++ +++ 0 ++ ++ 0 +++ +++ 0 +++ +++ 0 + ++</p><p id="Pg109">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 564 strain. NCP-3 (8.): inhibiting effect was caused by nickel even in 100 mg/l concentration. In case of 1000 mg/l concentration this strain has the same rating markings as AK-44. CHB-20p (9.): inhibiting effect caused by lead was only noticed in 5000 mg/l concentration. In 1000 mg/l concentration nickel and copper have inhibiting effect, zinc and chromium(VI) have significant inhibition on them in this concentration. CHB-15p (10.): very sensitive to zinc and chromium(VI) because these two toxic elements even have low inhibition on it in 100 mg/l concentration. 1000 mg/l concentration of nickel and copper caused inhibiting effect. In case of lead this concentration only caused low inhibition. SM-0625 (11.): copper, nickel, chromium(VI) caused significant inhibition on it in 1000 mg/l concentration. In this concentration zinc caused detectable inhibiting effect and low inhibition was caused by lead. Conclusions As a main result of the rated inhibitions strains are able to be labeled: AK-35, AK-40 and AK-44 hydrocarbon degrading strains could be used in contaminated areas that have high pollution of copper and lead, because they are less sensitive to these two heavy metals. AK-36 strain could be inoculated on sites that contaminated by copper but the other examined heavy metals could affect their growing so their using as a part of degrading inoculum in complex contaminated sites is not recommended. AK-37, CHB-20p, NCAIMB 1494 strains are able to be used for degrading hydrocarbon on the sites that highly polluted by lead. The growing (so in vivo usage) of AK-38 could be inhibited by highly concentrated heavy metals on the sites. The NCP-3 had the highest sensitivity to nickel and CHB-20p was most sensitive to zinc and chromium(VI), because detectable inhibition was caused by 100 mg/l concentration of these heavy metals. SM-0625 strain was generally sensitive to heavy metal pollutants, but mostly to copper, nickel and chromium(VI). As a summary of these inhibition tests the abiotic effect (generated by heavy metals) determining degrading ability of the inoculating strains could be planned. By the results of these in vitro tests professional users are able to choose the effective strains for degrading hydrcarbons on complex polluted sites so this method could support the decision making for on site bioremediation.

Heavy metals, which cause potential danger for organisms, are one of the best known abiotic stress factors. Parameters of sediments influence stress effects, which put pressure on plants. Samplings were taken from such areas, which are covered by water in rainy periods but in dry periods when the water level decreases terrestrial plants can appear periodically. During the experiment seed germination tests were applied and abiotic stress effects of heavy metals in sediments on plants were studied. Relationships between concentration of organic matter and metal content of sediments were also studied. Results were evaluated statistically. Between the metal content and the organic matter of sediments positive correlation was found, which means that effects of abiotic stress factors depend on organic matter content as well. The quantity and quality of sediments, shaking period and concentration of sediment suspensions influence abiotic stress factors, which have conspicuous effects on plants. Due to our results it can be established that the more the quantity of the sediments are and the longer period they are shaken, the better the ability of the sediments is to buffer the phytotoxic effect of heavy metals, thus heavy metals as stress factors, which influence plant growth, have less effects. Inactivation of heavy metals is presumed by adsorption. Keywords: abiotic stress, sediment, heavy metal, ecotoxicological testing Introduction It is well known that due to technology and urbanization environmental pollution tend to be a serious problem (Olade 1987). Plants easily take up heavy metal ions which accumulate (Szabó et al.2006) in them and become nutrient source for animals. Heavy metal pollution in the environment, which becomes an increasingly severe problem for humanity as well, is one of the best known stress factors for organisms, so they have to be monitored (Clemens 2006). Samples are derived from Balatonaliga situated in Siófok basin and from Balatonlelle located in Középsı basin. Samplings were carried out near the local ports, which are covered by water in rainy periods but in dry periods when the water level decreases terrestrial plants can appearperiodically. The aim of our experiments was to assess how heavy metals as stress factors influence the growth of seeds. Effects of stress factors on plants also depended on the buffer capacity of the given sediment, the shaking period, the concentrations of heavy metals and the concentrations of the sediment suspensions as well. Materials and methods Ecotoxicological seed germination tests study how the phytotoxical heavy metals affect germination. In our experiments 10, 20 and 30 mass percent of sediment suspensions were shaken for one, two and three hours using 50, 100, 250 and 500 ppm concentrations of heavy metal ions. Shaking period illustrates the period of interaction of sediment and water phases. The examined heavy metal ions were the cadmium and the lead, which are typically antropogenic stressors (Coga et al. 2007). The experiments were carried out with Sinapis alba seed germination test (Nagypál et al. 2008).</p><p id="Pg111">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 566 Results and discussion Effects of stress factors in untreated sediments 10, 20 and 30 mass percent of sediment suspension were prepared from samples which were taken from Balatonaliga („A”) and Balatonlelle („L”). They were shaken for one, two and three hours on a bolting machine. On the y-axis average lengths of seedlings in the different samples can be observed correlating to the average length of seedlings grown in distilled water. In the case of the “A” sample the three-hour-shaking proved to increase the root length (Figure 1.). Under these circumstances stress prooved to have positive effects. In other cases mild toxic effect can be observed. In the case of the “L” sample an opposite effect can be seen (Figure 2.). We measured significantly smaller values when the suspensions were shaken for three hours. In this way we can observe that the three-hour-shaking proved to inhibit the root growth. Under these circumstances stress was experienced negatively. In other cases no significant changes were found. Figure 1. Length of seedlings grown Figure 2. Length of seedlings grown in untreated “A” sediments in untreated “L” sediments The possible explanation of the results can be that the “A” sample might contain nutrients which were dissolved in the solution due to shaking and became easily available for seeds. Presumably in sample “L” some kind of toxic matter were at present, which was also dissolved due to shaking and blocked the growth of seedlings. These experiments demonstrated that under different circumstances stress might have positive or negative effects as well. Comparing the stress effects of lead and cadmium Cadmium and lead ions were added to the samples in laboratory circumstances. Different heavy-metal concentrations were prepared: 50 ppm, 100 ppm, 250 ppm and 500 ppm. On the whole it can be established that both the heavy metal ions blocked the growth of seedlings but the cadmium proved to be more toxic than the lead, which means that the cadmium is a stronger stressor than the lead, therefore owing to lack of space only effects of cadmium are studied. Effects of stress factors in treated sediments In Figure 3. the average length of seedlings can be seen depending on the cadmium concentration and the sediment content. The signs A10%, A20% and A30% correspond to 10%, 20% and 30% sediment content of sample “A”, L10%, L20% and L30% correspond to 10%, 20% and 30% sediment content of sample “L” (Figure 3.).</p><p id="Pg112">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 567 The tendency, when “A” sediments were treated with cadmium, is obvious. The higher concentration of heavy metal was at present in the sediment suspension, the smaller the seedlings were, the rate of the abiotic stress factor increased. In most cases 250 ppm and 500 ppm proved to be so toxic that much of the seeds did not even sprout. When 50 ppm and 100 ppm concentrations were used the germination was restricted. The average root length is smaller when 10% sediment content was used at 50 ppm and 100 ppm than 20% or 30 % sediment content at 50 ppm and 100 ppm. The reason can be that the more the amount of the sediment in the suspension is, the better the buffer capacity of the suspension is. Nevertheless this statement is true only till a breaking point since when the sediment content of the suspensions were 20% or 30% no significant difference could be observed. Presumably the longer shaking period and the higher sediment content help on adsorbing polluters, which decreases the rate of stress. Comparing samples “A” and “L” In Figure 3. it is unambiguously seen that the average root length of seedlings which were grown in sediment “L” are significantly smaller than those which were grown in sediment “A” (Figure 3.). Thus for plants growing in sediment „L” a possible pollution means a significantly stronger stress than for those growing in sediment „A”. Consequently the buffer capacity of sediment “L” is notably smaller than the buffer capacity of sediment “A”. The reason for this can be the organic matter content of sediments (Figure 4.). Figure 3. Comparing the stress effects of the cadmium Figure 4. Loss of ignition (LOI) of sediments polluted sediments “A” and “L” depending on “A” and “L” the sedimentcontent and the cadmium concentration Relations between the sediment and the organic matter Positive correlations were found between metal concentration and organic matter content of sediments (Gerriste,1984, Förstner,1981). The higher the initial metal concentration is, the more the amount of the adsorbed heavy metal is in the organic matter because of the directing power of the higher concentration-gradient. (Jain,1997). The organic matter content of the sediment can also be used to establish the rate of pollution of different sediments.

Comparing the sediment and water samples Toxic matters can dissolve from the sediment into the water or they can precipitate from the water to the sediment. Since the sediment and the water are in a dynamic equilibrium state we have to consider that they interact with each other and water is able to modify stress effects on plants. L” water sample had a mild block effect for germination while “A” water sample had no significant effect for germination. This statement was also underpinned by seed germination tests with treated sediments. Presumably ”L” samples contained some sort of toxic matter and stress plants more. Conclusions Both the cadmium and the lead produced a more or less retarded germination, thus they can be considered as abiotic stressors. The cadmium proved to be more toxic than the lead when the same concentration was used, so the cadmium is a stronger stressor (2008, Ammar et al.). Due to our results it can be established that the more the amount of the sediments are and the longer period they are shaken, the better the ability of the sediments is to buffer the phytotoxical heavy metal in this way the polluting effects of stressors are moderated. Between the metal content and the organic matter of the sediments positive correlation was found. The higher the initial metal concentration is, the more the amount of the adsorbed heavy metal is in the organic matter, which means that the organic matter content decreases the effects of stressors. The organic matter concentration of sediments can be used as a potential toxic index of the sediment as well. References Ammar, W. B., Nouairi I. Zarrouk M., Jemal F.: 2008.

A. Hlinku 2, 949 76 Nitra, Slovakia, e-mail: marek.zivcak@uniag.sk Abstract: Osmotic adjustment represents one of the most important mechanisms of plant stress responses to drought and some other stresses. Accumulation of soluble compounds in plant cells enables turgor maintenance, improved soil water extraction and water saving; moreover, organic compounds (e.g. proline) provide stabilization and protection of cell membrane system. In our experiments with varieties of winter wheat we observed the changes in osmotic potential of leaf tissues during progressing drought stress. In addition, we determined free proline content in leaves using spectrophotometric method. The obtained data showed important differences among genotypes in capacity of accumulation of osmotic active compounds. We observed two groups of genotypes: with high and low osmotic adjustment. Similar distribution of genotypes was observed also for accumulation of free proline. The higher osmotic adjustment was correlated with delayed stomatal closure and thus can be considered as advantageous for higher photosynthetic assimilation in water limited growing conditions in wheat. Moreover, osmotic adjustment showed high level of correlation with grain yield maintenance in observed genotypes. Keywords: osmotic adjustment, proline, wheat, drought stress, photosynthesis, stomatal conductance Introduction Understanding plant tolerance to drought and co-occurring stresses is recently of fundamental importance and forms one of the major research topics. Plants can perceive abiotic stresses and elicit appropriate responses with altered metabolism, growth and development (Bartels and Sunkar, 2005). Water deficit induces gradual changes and protective mechanisms. Stomata closure decreases transpiration, however, it leads to depression of CO2 assimilation (Hnilicka et al., 2008) and increase of midday leaf temperature (Matuz et al., 2008). Moreover, there are many metabolic effects and responses during dehydration leading to limitation of photosynthetic capacity and other physiological processes (Lawlor and Cornic, 2002). Plant species and genotypes differ in tolerance to drought because of unequal ability to utilize possible strategies and protective mechanisms. Moreover, we can find different level of tolerance in leaves with various positions on the same plant (Repkova et al., 2008). There are many different approaches of evaluation and improvement of crop drought tolerance based on growth (Bhuta, 2007), plant morphology (Shao et al., 2008) and metabolic processes (Bartels and Sunkar, 2005). One of frequently studied mechanisms is increase of concentration of osmotic active compounds in plant tissues, which can be established physically as osmotic adjustment or by biochemical analysis of individual compounds contributing to whole osmotic adjustment. Reported studies show general effect of osmotic adjustment on turgor maintenance and root water uptake and hence on maintenance of growth and photosynthesis longer time during drought stress (Zhang et al., 1999) as well as function of individual compounds (e.g. proline, glycinebetaine) in protection of metabolic processes and structures (Ashraf and Foolad, 2007; Yang and Lu, 2007). The aim of our work was evaluation of importance of higher capacity for osmotic adjustment and free proline accumulation in leaves for drought tolerance of observed genotypes expressed by measured physiological parameters and grain yield.</p><p id="Pg115">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 570 Materials and methods Seven genotypes of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), Viginta (abbr. VIG), Ilona (ILO), Arida (ARI), Eva (EVA) originating from Slovakia; Pobeda (POB) from Serbia; Stephens (STE) from USA and Amerigo (AME) from France, were cultivated in the pot experiments in three growing seasons. After anthesis some plants were exposed to slowly developing water stress induced by restricted irrigation. Osmotic adjustment (OA) was calculated using values of relative water content RWC and osmotic potential (ΨS) according to Wilson et al. (1979). Relative water content (RWC) was calculated using formula RWC (%) = (W – WD) / (WFT – WD) * 100, where W is fresh weight of leaf segment, WFT – weight of leaf segment after saturation by water, WD – dry mass of leaf segment. Osmotic potential (ΨS) was measured by psychrometric method using microvoltmeter Wescor HR-33 with measuring chamber C-52 (Wescor, USA) after freezing in liquid nitrogen and subsequent thawing. Free proline content in leaves was determined using spectrophotometric method (Bates et al. 1973) at wavelength of 520 nm. Absorbance measured using spectrophotometer Spekol. Proline content (in µmol.g -1 of fresh weight) was adjusted to 100% RWC to reduced sampling errors. Stomatal conductance (gs) was measured by a porometer Delta T AP4 (Delta-T Devices, UK) regularly during dehydration. Measurements of CO2 assimilation were performed using portable open gasometric system Ciras-2 (PP Systems, UK) in wheat flag leaves on the main stem of randomly selected plants using a portable infra-red gas analyzer (CIRASII, PP Systems, UK), using an artificial light source (PPFD 800 µmol m -2 s -1 ). The chlorophyll a fluorescence emitted by leaves after excitation with red light was measured in the dark adapted parts of leaves using a fluorometer Handy PEA (Hansatech, UK). Collected data were analyzed by the JIP-test and parameter performance index was calculated (Strasser et al. 2000). The spikes from non-stressed and stressed variants were collected in the phase of full ripening; the grain yield per plant was established for each genotype. Collected data were processed and analyzed using Microsoft Excel and SigmaPlot 9.0 software. The correlations between parameters were assessed by correlation analysis and analysis of variance. Results and discussion Soil water deficit induced by withholding of irrigation caused progressive water stress with decrease of relative water content (RWC) in leaves. In all of three growing seasons we observed continual decrease of osmotic potential and hence increase of osmotic adjustment (OA). Free proline content showed more exponential increase. However, in leaves with RWC below 70% we established maximum values of OA and free proline in leaves (figure 1). In osmotic adjustment we observed average values from 0.49 to 1.01 MPa. These results are in accordance with many research works performed on wheat (e.g. Morgan, 1992). In 7 observed genotypes could be identified two statistically different homogenous groups. Genotypes Ilona, Amerigo, Stephens and Pobeda were characterized by higher capacity for osmotic adjustment (over 0.8 MPa); genotypes Arida, Viginta and Eva were characterized by average values below 0.6 MPa. Similar distribution of genotypes was observed also for accumulation of free proline in leaves</p><p id="Pg116">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 571 with two different homogenous groups (over 30 µmol.g-1 and below 20 µmol.g-1) and with genotype Amerigo remaining between these two groups. Figure 1. Maximal values of osmotic adjustment (left) and free proline content (right) assessed in flag leaves of winter wheat genotypes (capacity for osmotic adjustment or free proline accumulation) caused by drought stress. In graphs are used average values of measurements realised during three growing seasons. Error bars represent standard deviation of mean values. Different letters indicate mean values that are significantly different, while the same letter indicates means are not significantly different (homogenous group). Osmotic adjustment is mechanism important for maintenance of plant cell turgor and hence it is important for delay of full stomata closure (Zhang et al., 1999). Results of our correlation analyses (table 1) show significant positive correlation between capacity for osmotic adjustment and values of stomatal conductance during drought stress. Same trend was confirmed also for relationship of osmotic adjustment and net assimilation rate. It indicates that higher capacity for accumulation of osmotically active compounds is beneficial for elongation of active period of CO2 assimilation in drought conditions. Table 1.

Results of correlation analysis (table 1) confirmed lower damage in photosynthetic apparatus in genotypes with high capacity for proline accumulation. As we made experiments in three years with different weather conditions during dehydration period, the time of water stress (before RWC fell below 60 %) was different. We observed positive effect of longer dehydration period on capacity for osmotic adjustment, whereas the non-significant effect on maximum proline content. Grain yields of all genotypes were strongly reduced in drought-stressed variants compared to non-stressed variants. Our results (table 1) show that the grain yields in genotypes with higher capacity for osmotic adjustment were less affected compared to group with lower osmotic adjustment; however our correlation was non-significant. Conclusions Higher capacity for osmotic adjustment and accumulation of free proline in wheat genotypes correlates with better photosynthetic performance in water limited conditions. This findings as well as studies published by many authors suggest that osmotic adjustment is an important mechanism of drought tolerance; however, it is only one of many other components contributing to higher yielding in water limited conditions.

In Hungary the expansion has begun recently, but the economic aspects of introducing this new technology have not yet been cleared exactly. The paper reports about the results of economic research projects and model calculations that – on the basis of empirical data - examine the effects of soil parameters, degree and variance of weed coverage on plant nutrition and protection costs, as well as on yield and the threshold of introducing and leaving off precision farming from economic side. Simulation model was used for analyzing the effects of abiotic elements (technology, soil, etc.) on the yield, determined also by biotic factors, and combines them with economic requirements at farm level. The model examination verifies that the lower – introducing – and upper – giving up – thresholds (bounds) criteria depend i) on the soil parameters and weed coverage and their heterogeneities and variances, ii) on the additional investment costs of new technology and iii) on the yield differences due to the nutrient supply and weed coverage of crops. Keywords: cereals, abiotic factors, implementation threshold, model analysis, simulation Introduction Agrotechnical and technological developments of the 20th century, the biotic (varieties capable for higher yield, better nutrient utilization and resistence against plant pests, fungi and insects) as well as abiotic (soil and environmentally friendly, environmental load reducing) solutions and impacts get special attention, and the same attention should be given to the economic aspects of complex impact mechanism of these factors (direct microeconomic returns of developments and macroeconomic returns of created positive externalities). The new technical application (GPS, new achievements of monitoring technique) enabled the implementation of a new technological direction by the end of the 20th century. It is called precision plant production. The examination of its economic aspects gives new tasks to agricultural economists. The microeconomic analysis of the technology was necessary in the early period of practical implementation of precision farming. The analysis included the examination of costs, parallel with the consideration of multiple factors and their interactions. [Weiss, 1996] It required the description of factors and their costs in multi dimension, and plot level, breaking up with the former analysis of production functions which were based on average values. The computer simulation is an appropriate tool for analyzing economic impacts. Precision farming is the way of increasing production efficiency, and at the same time, it is an abiotic factor, which can reduce the pollution of the environment. [Wolf – Buttel, 1996] In connection with placing nutrient supply on precision bases, on the one hand, the costs of soil sampling are increasing – and micro-element analysis is also necessary in the case of one-sixth of the samples, which requires additional costs – and on the other hand, presuming the achievement of the same yield level, 20-40% material can be spared. Its cost reducing impact depends on the actual nutrient prices, it was 15-17% of the variable costs in the year of analysis [Batte, 1999]. Neményi et al. (2008) added that the changeability of soil qualities also affects the applicability of precision technology.</p><p id="Pg119">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 574 If nutrient supply of the land is basically good, active agent saving cannot be achieved with precision nutrient spraying technology, compared to the conventional technology. Researchers started to analyze later the economic impacts of precision plant protection. Within the weed control, the practical implementation of damage threshold principle requires the development of decision supporting models, with which the experts also get a tool to reduce risks. German authors examined damage threshold level of precision weed control on herbicide and cereal prices of 2007, on the basis of weed distribution, soil and yield maps. They made a decision model involving economic calculations, which can be used in extension services [Gutjahr et al., 2008]. Reisinger et al. (2007) applied similar logical connections in their internet-based decision-support model for supporting weed control in maize under Hungarian conditions. The complexity and implementation difficulties of precision weed control technology are further increased because the dose to be sprayed depends on the quality of the soil and the sowing time [Reisinger – Pálmai, 2007]. Humus content and solidity is a determinant soil parameter. In the case of higher humus content, higher dose is recommended in the dose interval proposed by producers and manufacturers. Soil sampling in smaller than 3-hectare details is not necessary for planning of precision weed control. Materials and methods The starting point of conceptional basis of model examination is that different inputoutput relation system is resulted by different production methods and technologies, therefore they are described with different production functions (output curves and cost curves). According to this, we can use the generalizing presumption that the group of questions can be examined with univariable production function. Three domains can be determined on the basis of the created univariable production function, the cost function and the output function– which cannot be described here due to the limits of the paper. The function characteristics are determined on the basis of the outputs of experiments, with function fitting.

In the results of running the results of the simulation model, describing in Descartes coordinate system, shows the following. In the function of heterogeneity (horizontal axis), • the damage threshold is indicated by the point, where the line (function) of difference of profits of input (cost) minimalizing production strategy and precision farming intersects the horizontal axis (the profit surplus of cost minimalizing strategy is 0). • the threshold of giving up precision farming is indicated by the point where the line of difference of profits of precision farming and the whole-surface treatment strategy, made on the basis of locally identified factor value, intersects the horizontal axis (profit surplus of precision technology is 0) (Figure 1). Average and dispersion values were determined for the above, the typical strategies were pointed out on the basis of the distance of average values and the dispersion. -0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Figure 1. Economically justified range of applicability of precision farming In the case of winter wheat, maize and sunflower, four intensity categories (low, medium, intensive and super intensive), the degree of which was different in each culture, and three weed coverage categories (0-10%, 10-20% and 30-30%) were distinguished in the examinations depending on the level of nutrient-supply. As regards the economic tenability of precision farming, four categories are distinguished, as possible farming strategies: 1) input (cost) minimalizing strategy; 2) precision farming strategy; 3) high-risk precision farming and 4) whole-surface damage minimalizing strategy. Results and discussion On the basis of the simulation model analyses and in relation to the weed coverage and the nutrient resupply (intensity), the lower (damage threshold) and upper (giving up precision technology or shifting to whole surface treatment) limit of applicability can be determined. In the case of maize, when the weed coverage is low and the weed control input (cost) is minimalized, the precision technology is worth in economic sense only at the highest nutrient resupply level. In the case of high weed coverage and low nutrient level, precision technology can be applied but it is not worth in economic sense, because the value of yield saved this way does not cover the extra costs required for the implementation of the technology (Table 1).

The economical applicability of precision technology in different crops depends on the nutrient supply level of the soil, the nutrient reaction of the crop under the given supply (input-output relation), as well as on weed coverage, competency, the extra costs and/or cost savings of the technology. In economic sense, the tenability (gives extra income) of the precision farming strategy depends on the level of nutrient supply (intensity) and the level of weed coverage. In the case of medium and/or high weed coverage besides increasing intensity of farming, the precision crop production results higher income but only to a certain limit than the income from whole surface treatment. All these, however, do not exclude its applicability. Attention should be drawn to the long-term advantages of precision technology, which comes from the environmental load reducing impact of locally specified spraying.

For the natural ecosystems the most dangerous stressor is coming from abiotic sources. Anthropogenic influence on natural ecosystems most of the time appear in form of pollution. Due to this activity, conditions for the natural environment are changing which appears in degradation. Degradation can be indicated with various ecological values. These values – since they appear spatially – can be mapped with the help of geographical information systems (GIS) softwares. On the other hand to sustain artificial ecosystems – namely plant production – information on stress – being biotic such as weed, disease, pest, or abiotic such as temperature, available water, soil parameters or nutrient supply – is mandatory in order to achieve the aim of plant production. In order to apply this kind of knowledge in decision making processes, according to the collected information, stress maps (e.g. soil water content map, nutrient supply map, weed map) can be drawn. This article is focusing on the different information collecting methods – applicable in natural and artificial ecosystems – as well as difficulties and problems appear during mapping process. In order to create spatially correct and precise maps, different mapping and interpretation techniques are available, this paper provides information on the possibilities how stress can be mapped using various input data about our surrounding environment. Keywords: degradation, biotic and abiotic stress mapping, precision plant production, isoecological map, GIS Introduction Vegetation influenced by stress shows different behaviour from normal. Stress state of the flora, texture and co-texture of the populations or the vegetation of a given area can be determined by comparison of the actual state to an earlier, natural reference state, or in absence of such reference comparison to similar areas natural reference state (JuhászNagy, 1986). To determine the abiotic background, stress-factors can be deducted by direct measurements or by indirect fitoindication. Based on the intensity of stress and the disturbance habitat Grime (1979) created a three-way (C-S-R) strategic model. Borhidi (1993) further developed this model and adopted it to the Hungarian plant species. In this model in the Social Behaviour Types (SBT) categories Borhidi divided the competitors to natural, ruderal and allien competitors, and He further divided the specialists to numerous smaller categories. The stress-state of a plant sample can be qualified by its flora, or rather its vegetation (calculating with the mass relations), or based on the share of the category of the SBT system. Using the representation of the spatially qualified plant samples fitoindication based stress maps can be drawn. On the other hand artificial ecosystems - including cereal production fields - are open to various biotic and abiotic stress effects. The negative stress (distress) limits the productivity of the cereals (Hegedüs et al., 2004). From the environmental point of view biotic stress caused by weeds, diseases or pests can be prevented or at least reduced if the location of such stressors is known to the farmers. In case of abiotic stress coming from the environment the stressors can be divided into two different groups. The first group is the one that stressors can be influenced by the farmers such as nutrient or water supply; the second group is those stressors that can not be influenced by the farmers</p><p id="Pg123">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 578 such as climatic conditions (drought, precipitation, temperature etc.). Soil for crop production is mandatory. Soil is the most complex sphere utilized by plant production and as a conditionally renewable source (Várallyay, 2007) can be considered as stressor for the plant production or a special organism stressed by another stressors like pollution. The aim of plant production is to keep up the ideal conditions for one species within one year on one field. Since variations within one field exist, for effective plant production technology intensive site-specific treatment is needed (Neményi et al., 2003; Neményi, 2007; Németh et al., 2007; Neményi et al., 2008). This practise is named precision agriculture. In order to be able to fulfil the requirements of precision agriculture, stressors of the given produced plant have to be mapped precisely. The most dangerous general stressor for plant production in the Carpathian basin is soil drought. Data collection of soil drought is localised to certain spatially distributed measurement point (Štekauerová - Nagy, 2006; Štekauerová - Nagy, 2007; Sútor – Gombos, 2006; Stehlová, 2007). In order to create a stress map – in this case a soil drought map – interpolation techniques has to be applied. For study area Csallóköz (SK) has been investigated in this case. Materials and methods In this article the first sample area from Mecsek hills (south of Hungary) is presented. The valley used to be covered by seminatural forests, however it was filled up with refuse from the uranium mine after deforestation. In the 17 hectare valley nowadays a tailing tip can be found which is covered by various weed vegetation after recultivation sodding. In the buffer zone mainly the original forests stayed. Flora of the tailing tip was compared with flora of natural-potential vegetation type using SBT categories. The refuse was treated as one unit, the vegetation map was a 1:10000 scale EOTR based map, the categories contained the phytocoenological associations by Borhidi-Kevey (1996). Samples were taken by the Zürich-Montpellier method was analysed and carried out based on Morschhauser (1995). The stress state of the vegetation units can be defined by the percentage of the SBT categories represented in a vegetation patch. For the soil drought map sampling data was collected by various soil moisture data collection methods (Štekauerová et al., 2007). Data was analysed by interpolation technique (kriging) and converted into a three dimensional map (Fig 1b). Results and discussion The flora of the refuse hill consists of 140 species (Borhidi-Morschhauser, 1997). The percentage of the wide stress tolerant specialists (S: 2,9%) and the tight stress tolerant generalists (G: 11,5%) is very low in the tailing tip. The natural disturbance tolerant (DT: 33,1%) and and weed (W: 28,1%) species play major role on the tailing tip. The share of the natural pioneer (NP 5,8%), the ruderal (RC: 7,2%) and aggressive (AC: 4,3%) competitors is also high. The anthropogenic total stress can be described by one number in case we sum up the different categories. If we take the categories describing the natural attributes (S, C, G, NP) and the categories showing the degradation we can state that the degradation of the</p><p id="Pg124">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 579 tailing tip is 74% which is 50% higher than the degradation of the surrounding reference forest (Potentillo micranthae-Quercetum dalechampii). The degradation mass map (Fig. 1a.) with application of the SBT categories shows the emergence area of the anthropogenic stress effects. The patch in the middle of the map is the degraded (marked with red) tailing tip, where the weed associations (marked with Nr. 1) neither differ - based on degradation - from the tailing tip’s planted southern zone nor from the surrounding spontaneous acacia (Nr. 2). The northern part is a seminatural (marked with dark green) Potentillo-micranthae-Quercetum dalechampii (Nr. 3) and Luzulo forsteri-Quercetum (Nr. 4) covered area, in a smaller patch less degraded (light green). The valley below the tailing tip is covered by moderately degraded (marked with yellow) Asperulo taurinae-Carpinetum (Nr. 5). According to the above mentioned facts the anthropogenic stress in not restricted to area where the influence appears, but can be shown in the buffer zone as well depending on the sensibility of the plant communities. Figure 1. a, Degradation mass map of the investigated tailing tip; b, Three dimensional map of soil drought as a stressor of plant production In soil drought mapping after data collection and interpolation a further step was taken and a three dimensional map was drawn. Opening the surface level on a separate layer and adding the investigated plants height and root depth the drought areas can be visualized (Fig. 1b). Conclusions The vegetation maps can be treated as stress maps based on the indication by the vegetation units. Natural and anthropogenic influence can be mapped based on relative distant sampling points and applying interpolation techniques. In order to lessen the number of sampling points interpolation techniques were applied in vegetation mapping as early as mid nineties (Morschhauser, 1995). To the specific stress factors different ecological indication values can be assigned, and based on these factors further isoecological curves can be drawn (Morschhauser– Salamonné Albert, 2001). The vegetation modifying factor of the anthropogenic stress can depend on numerous factors such as age distribution, substance, percentage of dead plants, etc.. Such systems can be applied to determine the naturalness of forests (Bartha et al., 2006). Other possibility is for determine the naturalness of the forests to further process the META regular</p><p id="Pg125">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 580 hexagonal grid based maps covering the surface of the country (Molnár et al., 2007).In case of soil drought monitoring three dimensional maps visualized the area where soil drought does not appear as stress in the investigated area. With spatially more precise (or online) soil moisture monitoring, soil drought can be avoided in agricultural land system. Mapping stress in natural and artificial ecosystems showed that data collection techniques has to be chosen very carefully in order to receive the correct information of the investigated phenomena.

In particular, actual status as well as change in status of objects on ground surface can be evaluated, providing useful information for e.g. agriculture, and environmental management, and thematic information can also be obtained, such as landuse pattern for a given area. In our study, effect of adverse soil processes on plants at an arable land was investigated by processing airborne remotely sensed data. Hyperspectral images were taken by using an AISA Dual hyperspectral sensor detecting between 400 and 1.000 nm in parallel with field measurement of certain biomass parameters, including plant height, cover, leaf area index, etc. and sampling at points determined by GPS, for laboratory analysis of chlorophyll a content. After radiometric and geometric corrections, channel selecting methods were applied to improve the information content. In addition to the traditionally used vegetation indices, channels potentially useful to estimate biomass and chlorophyll were selected. After evaluating point data, spatial distribution of chlorophyll a content was also examined, and as a result, a vegetation stress map was generated. In addition, based on calculations from field measurement data for coverage, and selection and processing of certain spectra, a coverage map was also generated for the studied area. Keywords: remote sensing, chlorophyll, hyperspectral, vegetation stress Introduction Hyper- and multispectral technology is widely used in agriculture and environmental protection. Similar remote sensing methods are well adaptable not only in agricultural resource-searches, but for assessment of environmental protection problems as well. In reference to this, searching areas referring to early recognizability of plant diseases, mapping of deficiency of nutrients by reflectance spectrum, the singular or association level approach of the vegetation in agro-ecological, cropping technologies respect, are have to been mentioned (Németh et al, 2004). Chlorophyll content of the leaf is a good indicator of photosynthetic activity, mutations, stress (Szigeti, 2003), and the state of plant nutrient, and this have a particular high significance in precision agriculture. Vegetation is a very good indicator of degradation processes occurred in soils, since effects caused by soils are well detectable in the vegetation. Such like this for example secondary salinization, inland water spots or spreading and effect-inquiry of contaminant, which is important in environmental protection respect. Precision plant protection is also realizable as a decision support system and farming form based on GIS, which takes into account the spatial heterogeneity of pests occurs at the production site (Burai. This approach is fundamentally different from the earlier husbandry, which regards the table as a homogeneous unit (Németh et al., 2007). Materials and methods Our search was pursued on Kardoskút sample area. Hyperspectral data collection were taken on a 10 x 10 km area, extent of the area appointed to the search is 2700 x 6500 m.</p><p id="Pg127">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 582 The landscape, which has loess soil forming rock, is surmounted by chernozem soil types, except of a hardly more than 1 % area, which is meadow solonetz. Hyperspectral data were collected by AISA DUAL hyperspectral imaging system (Deákvári et al., 2008). Collection of reference data is realized at the date of flight. During the terrain imaging, different parameters of the biomass were measured in situ, these parameters were the plant height, covering, and leaf area index. During the sampling, the elementary aim was the samples’ highest differentiation as possible in respect of state of health, and, for this, two of the signed sampling cluster gratified. By the in situ measured data, 14 points were excepted for the laboratory determination of chlorophyll concentration, reserving the further adequacy for the terms of competent differentiation, where plant leaf samples were also taken. Parameters, originated from the two clusters, were managed henceforth as a uniform dataset, and coherence-inquires were fulfilled for those points, for which chlorophyll-a concentration values were also determined. The first part of data processing was performed by the help of Caligeo program, developed by Specim Ltd., where elemental radiometric and geometric corrections were used. Results and discussion The aim of the coherence inquiry is the demonstration of close correlation between the similar biophysical parameters. Covering, stem height and chlorophyll-a concentration datasets were represented normal distribution in every case, which was confirmed by frequency inquiry. The effective covering map 1 m 2 measured area units were 8-88% values. Calculated LAI value showed a value between 0,2 and 5,8. Close connection was verified between covering and LAI, where determination coefficient, R 2 =0,81 (Figure 1).

Conclusions By the ambition, the most appropriate channels for the estimation of chlorophyll content and vegetation index calculated from this was determined successfully from the hyperspectral image, which can be appropriate for the determination of vegetation stress by remote sensing instruments. We established that vegetation indices calculated by hyperspectral data and the values of vegetation stress indices shows correlation with the chlorophyll content of the terrain samples. By this, it can be determined, that hyperspectral remote sensing is an important instrument of the state measurement of vegetation, in particular consideration of the spatial estimation of environmental stress.

Theoretically DDT contaminations could be treated with bioremediation methods, but such microbes are needed that have efficient degrading activity. For isolating DDT degrading microbes DDT contaminated soil samples were used that were collected in Kyrgyzstan. 13 bacterium strains were isolated and maintained as axenic cultures. According to the 16Sr DNA sequence analysis 10 isolates belong to the Bacillus, 1 to the Pseudomonas and 1 to the Gordonia genus. The DDT degrading capability of the isolates was detected by GC analytic method. Among the researched strains only the Gordonia amicalis KIR-2E showed significant DDT degradation. It could decrease the original 1 ppm DDT concentration by 94% during the 5 days experiment. Based on the notable DDT degrading abilities this strain could be used to develop novel bioremediation methods. Keywords: DDT and metabolites, microbial degradation, Gordonia, Bacillus, Pseudomonas Introduction During the 1970’s it became scientifically proven that DDT (4,4'-(2,2,2-trichloroethane- 1,1-diyl)bis(chlorobenzene)) is seriously endangering human health and has severe negative effects both on humans and the environment as a result of the discovery, DDT was banned in the US and Europe (Sanja et al. 2007). Although many countries ceased using DDT over 20 years ago, its residues still persist in the environment, predominantly as DDE (1,1-bis-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene), DDD (1-chloro4-[2,2-dichloro-1-(4- chlorophenyl)ethyl]benzene), as well as unchanged DDT. Among these residues, toxicologically DDE is the most significant residue, as it acts as a strong endocrine disrupting chemical (Lori et al. 2008) In soil and water sources the presence of DDT and DDE limits land use options, drinking water usage and may have an impact on human health. Cost-effective remediation methods for widespread low-level contamination are therefore required. Amongst the applied technologies (thermal desorption, incineration, phytoremediation, bioremediation) economically the most promising candidate is the use of DDTdegrading microbes for bioremediation (de Percin, 1995; Lunney et al. 2004; Foght et al 2001). However, the application of the bioremediation based DDT-decontamination mainly sets back that only mixed cultures possess high degrading ability (Bidlan et al. 2002). Considerably few aerobic microbes (Terrabacter, Pseudomonas) were described till now capable to degrade the DDE- aromatic structure in pure culture (Aislabie et al. 1999; Hay et al. 1998). On the basis of the Stockholm Convention -besides the Basel and Rotterdam Conventions- our research group is involved in a Dutch-Hungarian project, which is carried out to eliminate obsolete pesticides stocks in different countries. During the latest project in Kyrgyzstan soil samples were taken from DDT</p><p id="Pg131">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 586 contaminated land, where both the soil and the grown crop (carrot) contained near mg/kg concentrations of DDT/DDE/DDD. The aim of the research is to isolate and select DDT tolerant and degrading microbes that can degrade DDT successfully and its metabolites to non-hazardous compounds. Materials and methods Sampling: soil samples were collected in September 2008 from the close vicinity of a former pesticide storage building, next to a small agricultural airstrip in Madanyat, Kyrgyzstan (coordinates of the two sampling locations: KIR-1: N 40º35´29.12˝, E 72º50´51.60˝; KIR-2: N 40º35´29.76˝, E 72º50´52.44˝). Both samples contained DDT, more precisely KIR-1: 0,10 mg/kg, KIR-2: 0,65 mg/kg DDT/DDD/DDE. According to the analytical measurements of the local, regionally competent plant protection department, the carrots harvested from the field where the KIR-2 sample was taken contained 0.17-0.2 mg/kg DDT/DDD/DDE. Isolation of the microbe strains: serial dilutions were made from the soil samples. Plating method was applied on basic nutrient agar (Merck No.1.07881.0500) for obtaining axenic cultures. Strains with different colony morphology were chosen for further study. The strains were propagated on agar plates at 26 o C. Molecular taxonomic identification: the 16S rDNA sequence was obtained by PCR amplification of the gene with universal primers forward 27, reverse 519 and 1492, respectively. The PCR product was used as template for sequencing after column purification using PCR-M DNA extraction Kit (Viogene). Chromosomal DNAs used as template were prepared from the strains by the steam explosion method. Purified PCR products were sequenced directly by an ABI Prism 3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) with the above-mentioned primers. The MEGA4 program was used for connecting the sequences of the fragments. For determining the taxonomical position of the isolates the 16S rDNA database of type strains of the LeBIBI server (http://umr5558-sud-str1.univ-lyon1.fr/lebibi/lebibi.cgi) was used with standard defaults. For exact gene homology search the BLASTN program was applied. Microbial degradation of DDT: all experiments on the degradation of DDT were carried out in triplicates. The data presented are an average of these three values. The required quantity of DDT (for 1 ppm final concentration) as an acetone solution was dispensed into sterile 250 ml capacity Erlenmeyer flasks containing 25ml sterile nutrient medium The flasks then inoculated with cell suspension of the isolates and were incubated on a rotary shaker (180 rpm) at 26 o C temperature for 5 days. Uninoculated flasks served as controls. DDT, DDD and DDE analytical method: residual DDT and derivatives were determined by gas chromatography. The culture broth was extracted with equal volumes of ethyl acetate. The treated extract was than measured by HP-6890-GC-MS-075973 gas chromatography equipment. Results and discussion Isolation of the microbe strains: 13 bacteria were isolated from the DDTcontaminated soil samples as axenic cultures.</p><p id="Pg132">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 587 Molecular taxonomic identification: 11 out of the 13 strains could be identified on species level. Results are shown in Table 1. Among them the representatives of the Bacillus genus were dominant, due to the fact that Bacillus strains are capable of tolerating extreme environmental conditions by endospores. The presence of the Pseudomonas and Gordonia isolates was also expected, as both genus members have a wide range of metabolic abilities, and are capable of degrading even recalcitrant substrates also (Kamanawalli et al. 2000, Arenskotter et al. 2004). According to our results the isolates were identified as follows: KIR-1A – Bacillus pseudomycoides; KIR1B – Bacillus megatherium; KIR-1C – Bacillus mojavensis; KIR-1DL – Bacillus subtilis; KIR-1DT – Pseudomonas sp. FX32; KIR-1E – Bacillus megatherium; KIR-1F – Bacillus mojavensis; KIR-2B – Bacillus simplex; KIR-2C – Bacillus thuringiensis, KIR2D – Bacillus megatherium. Two strains - because of only partial ribosomal sequence was obtained - could be identified only at genus level, these isolates, KIR-1G and KIR2A also belong to the Bacillus genus. The KIR-2E isolate was identified as Gordonia amicalis. Gordonia, a group of taxa within the suborder Corynebacterineae of the Gram-positive bacteria, are mycolic acidcontaining actinomycetes widespread in natural environments (Nishiuchi et al.2000). Presently, this genus consists of 28 described species and more than 10 species in this genus have been isolated for their abilities to degrade either environmental pollutants, xenobiotics or other slowly biodegradable natural polymers (Arenskotter et al. 2004). Microbial degradation of DDT: based on GC analysis none of the Bacillus strains showed significant DDT degrading ability (5,2-7,8 % DDT decomposition). There is no available literature about the enzymatic DDT degrading capability of the Bacillus genus, but they are able to absorb significant amounts of DDT on their cell surface (Hicks et al. 1973). Their presence is probably connected with their high environmental tolerance (endospore-forming ability) and not with their degradation activity. It is interesting that the Pseudomonas isolate also showed negative results with as low as 6,3% DDT degradation activity, although there are literature references about their of DDT degrading ability in axenic cultures (Kamanawalli et al. 2004). According to the results of the GC analyses only the KIR-2E strain, Gordonia amicalis was able to significantly decrease the DDT concentration of the substrate during the five-day experiment: notable, more than 94% degrading activity was detected, the original 1ppm DDT concentration decreased to 0.057 ppm. Although the aromatic degrading ability of the Gordonia species is well documented (Kim et al. 2000, Nishioka et al. 2006), no data are published so far about their DDT degrading capability. Table 1.

Cereal Research Communications 588 Conclusions According to our results at sites long ago contaminated with DDT, such microbes can be selected that are capable of degrading the contaminant, utilizing it as substrate. The results of the further research on the significant DDT degrader KIR-2E Gordonia amicalis strain could decide whether it can be applied for developing a bioremediation technology. After the promising first attempts further samples will be collected from DDT contaminated sites in order to isolate and describe additional microbe strains with effective degrading ability.

As a result, the level of copper in agricultural soils is regularly high which could cause many ecotoxicological effects. Relevant co-application of biocontrol microorganisms with copper containing pesticides requires the evaluation of the copper tolerance levels of biocontrol microorganisms: especially the effect of copper ions on the antagonistic potential of the strains has to be investigated. From the soil samples of a Hungarian tomato plantation more than 200 bacterium strains had been isolated and their antagonistic potentials were evaluated against phytopathogenic microorganisms in in vitro confrontation tests. Twenty strains with the best antagonistic features have been selected for further investigations. The copper tolerances of these strains have been determined: it was clarified that all of them were able to grow up to 400 mg l-1 copper sulphate concentration. Changes of the antagonistic potential in dependence of the copper concentration were analysed in in vitro confrontation tests with different fungal (Pythium ultimum, Phytophthora infestans, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopesici, Alternaria solani, Rhizoctonia solani) and bacterial (Pseudomonas syringae) phytopathogenic microorganisms. According these experiments, copper concentrations above 100 mg l-1 significantly increased the antagonistic effects of the biocontrol strains against fungal pathogens. At the same time, there was a substantial antagonostic effect between copper and the biocontrol bacteria against Pseudomonas syringae. Keywords: in vitro test, copper tolerance, plant pathogens Introduction Copper homeostasis is very important for both the fungal and the bacterial cells. Copper is basically a trace element which is essential being present in living cells as prosthetic group in some enzymes. This metal ion enters the cell and ultimately incorporates into the appropriate active sites (Algaidi, 2007; Tóth et al., 2008). On the other hand, free copper ions can cause serious cell damage through oxygen radical formation; therefore, the careful regulation of intracellular copper concentration is required (Gutteridge, 1983). Recently, metal-ion chaperones (which are part of the cellular metabolism in eukaryotes and guarantee that the metal ions are delivered to the various cell organelles and eventually to the target proteins) have been identified in fungi (Pufahl et al., 1997). In prokaryotic organisms (because of the different cellular organization), different pathways and sets of copper binding proteins are present. The tolerance of the bacterial cells against copper is principally accomplished by the use of copper specific efflux systems (Smaldone and Helmann, 2007). Though the copper level in natural soils is generally low, but the agricultural soils are different from this respect: they generally characterized with high copper content due to the regular use of copper containing fungicides and bactericides against phytopathogenic fungi and bacteria (Naár et al., 2002. Heijerick, 2006). Different biocontrol approaches against phytopathogenic microorganisms are attractive and environmentally friendly plant protective methods (Balicevic et al., 2007; Whipps, 2001). However, the effective co-application of biocontrol microorganisms with copper</p><p id="Pg135">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 590 containing pesticides requires the testing both the copper tolerance of the biocontrol microorganisms and the effect of copper ions on the antagonistic potential of these strains. Materials and methods Thirteen microbial strains representing 7 phytopathogenic bacterial and fungal species were used in the in vitro confrontation tests: Pseudomonas syringae (5 strains), Pythium ultimum, Phytophthora infestans (3 strains), Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici, Alternaria solani, Rhizoctonia solani. The investigated 20 antagonistic bacterium strains (representing 7 species) were the followings: Bacillus mojavensis (3 strains), B. subtilis (3 strains), B. amyloliquefaciens (2 strains), B. licheniformis (2 strains), Pantoea ananatis (2 strains), Pseudomonas fluorescens (5 strains), Pseudomonas sp. (3 strains). The copper tolerance of these strains was tested at 10, 20, 40, 100, 200, 400 and 800 mg l -1 concentrations in yeast extract and glucose medium (0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% glucose, 3% agar). The copper was supplemented to the medium in the form of copper sulphate. Copper containing plates were inoculated from 10 -6 ml -1 suspensions of overnight grown bacterial cultures: an inoculum of 100 µl was evenly spread on the surface. In the case of copper containing liquid cultures the cell proliferation was followed by turbidimetry at 620 nm. Investigations of in vitro antagonism were performed on peptone agar against Pseudomonas syringae, on potato dextrose agar (PDA) against fungi, except of Phytophthora. In the case of the latter, pea agar medium was used. In every case, the media were supplemented with the appropriate amount of copper sulphate. There was a distance of 3 cm between the inoculation point of the antagonistic bacterium and the target microorganism. The incubation occurred at 25 ˚C in the dark. The inhibition zones were measured in every 24 h. All data were analyzed by covariance analysis. Results and discussion All the investigated antagonistic bacterium strains showed high copper tolerance both on solid and in liquid media (Fig. 1.). The multiplication rates begin to decrease only above 300 mg l -1 copper concentration. Maybe this phenomenon is linked to the fact that these strains were isolated from the soil of a tomato plantation where copper containing fungicides and bactericides are used regularly. Anyway, this high copper tolerance makes it possible that integrated pest management (IPM) approaches could be used involving the combined application of effective biocontrol bacteria with copper containing pesticides. This type of pest management was modeled in the in vitro antagonisms tests. As shown in Figure 2., all tested biocontrol bacterial strains shown elevated antagonistic potential against phytopathogenic fungi in the presence of copper ions above 100 mg l -1 concentration. At the same time, the presence of copper lowered the antagonistic potentials (at every tested concentration, with a minimum at 100 mg l -1 ) against the phytopathogenic P. syringae strains.</p><p id="Pg136">VIII.

In contrast of this, the presence of copper is inhibitory to the antagonisms of biocontrol bacteria if they are used against Pseudomonas syringae. Further studies required (e.g. for the isolation and strain-improvement of new biocontrol strains) which allow the elaboration of a IPM biocontrol system also against P. syringae.

Abstract: The application of various alternative nutrient supplies can partly be substituted by chemical fertilizers resulting in economical use with less environmental strains. Biofertilizers promote nutrition uptake, but still there are a lot of questions about their application under stress conditions. One of the main abiotic factors is polluted soils containing toxic elements. In the course of the intensive plant growing, considerable quantities of cation leave the soil to lead to acidification, thereby enhancing the uptake of heavy metals by plants. Cadmium (Cd) toxicity is a major problem affecting crop productivity worldwide. The presence of Cd in the rhizosphere can cause stress responses and alteration in many physiological processes, including nitrogen metabolism, photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, sulphate assimilation and plant-water interactions. Cd can get into the food-chain, causing public health problems. The aim of our work was to investigate the effects of biofertilizers on plant production and nutrient uptake in the case of Cd-polluted soils. Cd accumulated primarily in the roots, transport to the shoots was rather low, but there were differences between the two investigated plants. Sunflower took up more Cd, and may have had larger stress-tolerance to Cd than maize. With the use of the bacterium-containing biofertilizer, the toxic effect of cadmium was moderated. Keywords: cadmium accumulation, biofertilizer Introduction The abiotic factors, such as heavy metal stresses, play an important role in quality and quantity of crop production (Birkás et al., 2006; Veres et al., 2006; Várallyay, 2007; Solti et al., 2008). Soil accumulates toxic heavy metals from a number of various sources. These toxic metals reduce microbial activities in the soil, which affects soil fertility at higher concentrations. The presence of excess cadmium in the soil decreases the yields of crops, and also causes nutrient imbalance in the soil (Panwar et al., 2007). Information on metal-plant interactions is important in view of the safety of the environment, but also for reducing the risks associated with the introduction of trace metals into the food chain. Cadmium ion is easily collectable and also transportable inside plants. The inhibition of root Fe(III) reductase induced by Cd led to Fe(II) deficiency, and it seriously affected photosynthesis. Das et al. (1997) reported that in general Cd has been observed to interfere with the uptake, transport and use of several elements (Ca, Mg, P, K) and water by plants. Cadmium treatment has been shown to reduce the ATP-ase activity of the apoplasma membrane fraction of wheat and sunflower roots. Cadmium produces alternation in the functioning of membranes via lipid peroxidation (Fodor et al., 1995). The plasma membrane may be regarded as the first living structure targeted by heavy metal toxicity, and appears to be an efficient barrier preventing metals from entering the symplasma (Pál et al., 2007). Biofertilizers have the potential to decrease environmental impacts by means of exercising positive effects on plant physiology and production. The aim of our work was to investigate the effects of biofertilizers on plant production in the case of cadmium-polluted soils.</p><p id="Pg139">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

The paper was placed in a vertical position in order to provide for the straight growth of seedlings. The seedlings were then transferred to a continuously aerated nutrient solution when the coleoptiles and hypocotyls were 4–5 cm. The composition of the nutrient solution was as follows: 2.0 mM Ca(NO3)2, 0.7 mM K2SO4, 0.5 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM KH2PO4, 0.1 mM KCl, 1µM H3BO3, (10µM in the case of sunflower), 1µM MnSO4, 0.25 µM CuSO4, 0.01 µM (NH4)6Mo7O24. Iron was added to the nutrient solution as the form of Fe-EDTA in a concentration of 10 -4 M. Phylazonit MC ® biofertilizer was added to the nutrient solution in quantities of 1 mlL -1 . When Cd treatment was applied, the concentration of CdSO4 was 1, 5, 10, 20 mgL -1 . Phylazonit MC ® contains living bacteria, Bacillus megatherium var.

The seedlings were grown under controlled environmental conditions (light/dark regime 10/14 h at 24/20 o C, relative humidity 6570% and a photosynthetic photon flux 390 mEm -2 s -1 at plant height. The contents of elements were measured with ICP. The number repetitions are indicated in the title of figures and tables. Results and discussion Growth and development were deteriorated with Cd treatment applied. A decrease in dry matter was observed, when the corn seedlings were treated with cadmium.

The intensity of dry matter accumulation depends on intensity of photosynthesis. Therefore the contents of photosynthetic active pigments determine the activity. Decrease of chlorophyll contents was observed in our experiment when Cd treatment was applied on corn seedlings. However, in the case of sunflower the chlorophyll contents were increasing. The Phylazonit treatment moderated this toxic effect in this case, as well (Fig.1.). Figure 1.

Although the Phylazonit treatment decreases the uptake of most of the heavy metals, metal ions being similar to heavy metals, such as the Al, the role of Phylazonit was contradictory i.e. when Phylazonit treatments were applied, Cd concentrations tended to increase in almost all the samples (Table 2.). Conclusions The cadmium treatment decreased dry matter accumulation, as well as the intensity of photosynthesis in the experimental plants, while treatments with the biofertilizer increased these parameters.</p><p id="Pg141">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl.

The possible effects of SA on the growth and catalase enzymes in white mustard seedlings under heavy metal and salt stress were studied. Experimental data were analyzed to determine the LC50 values and statistical tests were applied to evaluate the effects of different treatments. Our results showedthat The 1.0 mM SA solution had significantly reduced the effect of stress, especially at higher concentrations of heavy metal and NaCl. However, SA has no influence on the inhibition of CAT activities induced by metal and salt stress. Keywords: heavy metal, NaCl, salicylic acid, catalase Introduction There is a broad spectrum of stress mechanisms that is activated by different types of stress and many of them are also activated by heavy metals (Chen et al., 2007; Gumze etal., 2007; Oláh et al., 2008). Mechanisms involved in oxidative stress are important in this context since heavy metals may cause formation of free radicals, and many metals are known to activate different antioxidant systems. Some metals (such as Cu, Fe, and Mn) are able to transfer electrons directly from the metal ion to form free radicals, e.g. the superoxide anion, while other metals disturb metabolic processes such as photosynthesis, resulting in elevated production of free radicals (Landberg and Greger, 2001). The superoxide anion is extremely aggressive and attacks, among others, lipids, resulting in severe damage to membranes. The enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) transforms superoxide anions to peroxide anions (H2O2). The peroxide anion may then be transformed to H2O by catalase. Thus, metals may activate a cascade of antioxidative systems. SA has been suggested as signal transducer or messenger under stress conditions (Klessig and Malamy, 1994); however, there is little known about whether or not salicylic acids are affected in heavy metal stress (Horváth et al., 2007). The physiological role of salicylic acid is usually addressed as a signal substance, altering the antioxidative systems by inhibiting catalase and stimulating peroxidases and glutathione production (Srivastava and Dwivedi 1998). We investigated in effects of the heavy metal and salt stress on the white mustard (Sinapis alba), by studying parameters of growth of root. In addition, we examined antioxidant enzyme catalase, which is among the main antioxidant defences in the plants (Wu et al., 2007). Materials and methods Seed germination and early seedling growth toxicity tests have often been used in ecotoxicology (Lakatos et al., 2003). In the present tests seeds of mustard (Sinapis alba) were used as the test subject. Seeds of white mustard (Sinapis alba) were sterilized and divided into two groups. Half of the seeds were presoaked in 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5</p><p id="Pg143">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 598 and 1.0 mM SA solution for 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours while the other half were soaked in water (control). After which both groups were allowed to germinate on moist filter paper in the dark for 72 h. For the investigation of heavy metal stress the seedlings were treated with Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu solution at concentrations of 5, 15, 20, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 250 µM. In the case of salt stress we applied 1, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 250, 500 and 1000 mg.l -1 NaCl solutions. After the growing period we measured the length of the plant’s roots. The milled plant material was mixed in 50mmol/L KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 7.0) and 10g/L PVP-10, and then centrifuged at 5,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was used for assays of enzyme. Catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.16) was measured according to Aebi (1984). Samples were mixed with 10 mmol/L H2O2. The H2O2 consumption was measured at 240 nm. Extinction coefficient was 0.039 mmol/Lcm –1 . All measurements were performed with 3 replicates. All statistical calculations were performed using STATISTICA (StatSoft) and GraphPad Prism for nonlinear regression curve fit and calculation of LC50 values. The least significant level was p=0.05. Results and discussion We examined the effect of soaking time on the root elongation in the case of different metal ion concentration under different salicylic acid treatments. Our results showed that there were not significant effects of short time soaking (1. 6 an 12 hours) and the lower salicylic acid solution on the root length of the seedlings. Therefore we present the results of experiment lasted for 24 hours long soaking in the only effective solution of the 1.0 mM SA mixture in Table 1a and 1b and Table 2. and Figure 1. Table 1a.

Salts of 13 microelements (AlCl3, NaAsO2, BaCl2, CdSO4, K2CrO4, CuSO4, HgCl2, (NH4)6Mo7O24, NiSO4, Pb(NO3)2, Na2SeO3, SrSO4, ZnSO4) were applied in four levels: 0, 90, 270 and 810 kg·ha-1. In this paper the results of the 13th year of the experiment are discussed. The main conclusions of the 13th year of the experiment are the following: The contamination after 13 years of the beginning of the experiment is still detectable in the NH4-acetate+EDTA soluble element fraction of soil though the concentration values decreased significantly compared to the values measured in the first year of the experiment. The stress caused by the As, Se, and the highest Cr loads induced a moderate depression in the air-dry yield. The highest toxicity was observed in the highest Cd-treatment where almost the total yield have been destroyed. The higher As and already the smaller Cd load resulted in a yield that was not suitable for animal feeding. Keywords: contamination, soil, plant uptake, yield Introduction The increasing amount of heavy metals in soils is a serious stress factor on plants and a hazard to the environment and the food chain. In agricultural soils the main source of contamination is often caused by sewage sludge application. Other anthropogenic activities like settlements, industry, traffic, agriculture may also seriously effect the whole food chain in Hungary (Rékási and Kádár, 2008; Kádár and Morvai, 2007). Proper evaluation of the stress caused by soil contamination on plants can only be attained from a precise long-term field experiment. An extensive experiment has already been set up for the examination of the microelement contaminants in the soil-plantanimal system in Hungary (Kádár, 1995). In this paper the results of the 13 th year of this experiment with alfalfa test crop are discussed. Materials and methods A long-term field microelement experiment was set up in spring of 1991 on a calcareous chernozem soil at the Experiment station of the Research Institute for Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry in Nagyhörcsök. The ploughed layer of the growing site contained around 5% CaCO3 and 3% humus and was very well supplied with Ca and Mn, well supplied with Mg and Cu, moderately with N and K and poorly with P and Zn. The soil texture is loam with 40% clay + silt fraction. The pH (KCl) of the ploughed layer was 7.3. The groundwater depth was 15 m and the water balance was negative, tending to drought (Németh and Kádár 2005). Salts of the 13 microelements tested were applied once at four levels in spring 1991, prior to maize sowing. The 13 x 4 = 54 treatments were set up in two replications giving a total of 104 plots in a split-plot design. The loads were 0, 90, 270 and 810 kg·ha -1 for each element in the form of AlCl3, NaAsO2, BaCl2, CdSO4, K2CrO4, CuSO4, HgCl2, (NH4)6Mo7O24, NiSO4, Pb(NO3)2, Na2SeO3, SrSO4, ZnSO4. Background fertilizers were applied in the 100-100-100 kg/ha N, P2O5 and K2O dose in every year (Kádár 2006).</p><p id="Pg147">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 602 The representative plant samples were made from at least 20 subsamples collected from the 9.6 m 2 net plot area. Determination of plant element concentrations was carried out with ICP-AES method after cc. HNO3 + cc. H2O2 digestion. The 20-20 soil core samples of each plot were united to get a representative sample. The mobile element fraction of soil (0.5 M ammonium-acetate + 0.02 M EDTA extractable; Lakanen and Erviö 1971) was determined using also ICP-AES method. Results and discussion The mobile soil element fractions of As, Ba, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Se, Sr and Zn showed significant increment even after 13 years of contamination (Table 1). The highest increment can be found in case of As since the concentration of this element was one of the lowest in the control soil. Only the Al concentration did not show any significant increase. Thus the contamination after 13 years is still detectable in the plant available element fraction of soil though the concentration values decreased significantly compared to the values measured in the first year of the experiment.

On the soil treated with 810 kg·ha -1 Cd the test plant thinned out and the plot became weedy. In case of Se this phenomena occurred only at the 4 th harvest. The element composition of alfalfa is shown in Table 2. Only those elements are presented that had a negative effect on yield. On the uncontaminated soil the amount of As, Cd and Cr was below the 0.1 mg·kg -1 detection limit. The maximum concentrations of As and Cr were around 2-4 mg·kg -1 , that of Cd was 5-7 mg·kg -1 . It seems to be a small value but it is 20-70 times more or a few order of magnitude higher than the concentration in control plants. The 4/1990 (II. 28.) Ministry of Food and Agriculture Technical Order gave limit values for Cd (0.5 mg·kg -1 ) and As (2 mg·kg -1 ). According to this, the higher as and already the smaller Cd load resulted in a yield that was not suitable for animal feeding.</p><p id="Pg148">VIII.

The stress caused by As, Se, and highest Cr loads induced a moderate depression in the air-dry yield. The highest toxicity was observed in the highest Cd-treatment where almost the total yield have been destroyed. The 810 kg·ha -1 As load resulted in 20 mg·kg -1 mobile As concentration in soil that caused a yield that was not suitable for animal feeding. The smallest Cd load resulted in also inappropriate yield but the soil mobile Cd concenration was only 2-3 mg·kg -1 .

Strossmayera, Gajev trg 7, Osijek, 31000-HR ; e-mail: zpozega@efos.hr Abstract: Rural economy in Croatia with its small sized sector of peasant enterprises still stays in the shadow of restructuring of large industrial sector. The slow leading process of privatization, the wandering in the claim to the best solution in agricultural development, absence of consensus about key development priorities, as well as common indicators of backwardness, are only part of gray scale of problems which dented the continue pauperization of wide rural area in Croatia. The Croatian government administration late with implementation of new rural policy measures, which are recommended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999. This act emphasises the balanced development of the countryside alongside the market support measures in the lights of the social and territorial cohesion. It is based on the following principles: recognising the multifunctional role of agriculture, improving competitiveness, ensuring that environmental issues are taken into account, diversifying economic activity, and conserving rural heritage. In the past time new rural policy in Croatia has been considered within local and regional development programs, where the LEADER approach takes important role. This is result of pre-accession process to EU and new possibilities of using considerable financial support in IPA subsidy program 2007-2113. Keywords: indicators of backwardness, leading and lagging rural area, Leader approach, Croatia Introduction During the last decade a number of rural regions in the EU showed a considerable employment growth in their non-agricultural sectors. However, most rural areas in the EU member states no longer reflect this image of dominance of the agricultural sector and outmigration of labour. Subsequently, the sectoral dichotomy of rural and urban areas, as assumed in traditional economic development theories, is no longer adequate to describe economic developments that rural areas in advanced countries have experienced during the last decades, and suggests that there are other factors at work which affect the economic performance of rural areas in different ways (Terluin-Post, 1999). Thereat, the rational soil management as well as soil tillage methods is the important element of reduction the environmental stress (Varallyay 2003; Bencsik et al. 2007) and of contribution to sustainable social, economic and environmental development. With the development of capitalism, the economic and social differences among the Croatian counties increase rapidly. Economic deterioration has become especially intensive in most rural area on the east and some other rural area located deeply into the countryside because the employment base was done a lot of large agricultural and food industry organizations that helped small-scale family agricultural production or cooperatives. Many of them have gone bankrupt or have undergone slow leading process of transformation from state to private enterprises. This has led to a significant family income decrease in ‘(more) rural’ entities or regions (Tolić-Lončarić 2006). Nowadays, Croatia after long time absence of the strategic frame of sustainable rural development, thanks to pre-accession process to EU and new possibilities of using considerable financial support in IPA subsidy program 2007-2113, is ready to follow</p><p id="Pg151">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 606 the best EU practice experience in implementation successful rural programs under local, regional and national level according LEADER approach. In this process the most difficulties will have lagging rural counties which will be needed in the future better care and help of the ‘top-down’ institutions. Materials and methods This analysis is made of the investigation of socio-economic characteristic in all Croatian counties in the goal to identify 'leading' and 'lagging' rural regions by using OECD population density concept. RUREMPLO concept is used in practice of chosen some indicators of rural, because it is constructed on the wide theories patterns on economic development in rural regions (Therluin, 2001). It is directed to recognition of bottlenecks in process of further local and regional development programs applying with accordance to the LEADER approach. In this work the analyses of rural regions is based on county level statistic which is equivalent for NUTS3 level regions according to the EU classification, whereas the term ‘rural regions’ refers to the whole set of intermediate rural and most rural regions. But, in Croatia is not established the set of the obligate attended indicators for judging the progress in rural development, because of that in this case was used set of dates available for all Croatian counties. Comparing dates between counties for chosen indicators, it was derived synthetic marks on the base of the percent of difference between maximum and minimum of the amount of attributes. Total estimation is generated with sum of all marks of one county what finally forms the base for ranging the counties according development prospects. Results and discussion Definitions of mentioned terms. I) OECD criterion in Croatia defines three groups of counties depending on population density on the NUTS 3 level. There are 1) predominantly or most rural regions with more of 50% inhabitants who live in local rural settlements, 2) significantly or intermediate rural regions whit 15-50%, 3) predominantly or most urban regions with less than 15%. It result with 91,6% of total is classified as rural region, while only 8,4%. In rural area are located 88,7% of all settlements and 11,3% in urban area which represent 14 towns with more then 30.000 inhabitants. Finally, 47,6% inhabitants live in rural, and 52,4% in urban area. II) The NUTS is hierarchical classification of territorial units for statistics in EU. NUTS 3 level regard to regions whit 150.000 inhabitants minimum, and 800.000 maximum. All Croatian counties belong on NUTS 3 level (REGULATION, 2003). III) RUREMPLO is the acronym of the FAIR (CT96 1766) project 'Agriculture and employment in the rural regions of the EU'. For this project a quantitative analysis of socio-economic characteristics in all EU regions and 18 case studies in 'leading' and 'lagging' rural regions in 9 EU Member States have been carried out by 9 national teams from 9 EU Member in order to reveal forces behind employment dynamics during the years 1997 and 1998. This resulted in a number of key messages towards enhancing the employment situation in rural regions (Terluin–Post, 1999). IV) LEADER (Liaison Entre Actions de Dévelopment de l’Economie Rurale). Leader stands for ‘Links between actions of rural development. As its name suggests, it is a method of mobilizing and delivering rural development in local rural communities,</p><p id="Pg152">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 607 rather than a fixed set of measures to be implemented. Since its launch in 1991, LEADER has provided rural communities in the EU with the tools to play an active role in shaping their own future. It has evolved over time, together with the rest of the CAP. For the 2007-13 programming period LEADER will no longer be a separate programme but will be integrated (‘mainstreamed’) in all national/regional Rural Development Programmes. This opens up new possibilities for the Leader approach to be applied on a far wider scale and across a much broader range of rural development activities than hitherto (The Leader Approach, 2008). The LEADER programme widely advocates ‘the local milieu models’ in rural development with ‘community-led rural development theory’. It is concerning on adjustment of the institutional structure is especially needed with respect to the linkages between the local, regional and national authorities, as the community-led development theory recommends an institutional structure that encourages and responds to bottom-up. The approach has among others been applied in Colorado, USA and Ireland (Therluin, 2001). V) IPA subsidy programme 2007-2113. The Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA) is a new facility aimed at assisting candidate countries and potential candidate countries to better understand how the Union works, and adapt national policies, rules and regulations in preparation for membership. This is supported under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Cohesion Fund (EC, 2006). Rural measures in Croatia are supported by IPARD programme.

The first place holds Istria County, than follow the counties on the coast irrespective of intermediate or most rural attributes and counties around big centres as Zagreb, Osijek and Rijeka. In the group of lagging regions are mostly the periphery counties, especially those in which no existing any high school programmes (Table 1). Conclusions Republic of Croatia is in pre-accession process to EU. According that Croatia is implementing Leader programme for rural development. Leader is based on the community-led rural development theory which suggests that the building of self-help capacity of communities serves as a key to solve these bottlenecks. Self-help capacity refers, for example, to organizational expertise of rural communities with regard to group processes, conflict resolution, mediation, leadership, understanding the business of government, and achievement of a shared vision. The ultimate goal of the theory is to transform an attitude of apathy and dependency into one of spiritedness and selfreliance. Or putting it simply, it aims at teaching people how to catch a fish rather than presenting them one on a plate. Because that, the Leader approach is throw IPARD a new chance for rural Croatia especially for many lower rural area under NUTS 3 level. References Bencsik, K., Ujj, A., Miko, P.: 2007.

PLANTATIONS Attila KONDOR1 – István LENTI 2 1 Agricultural and Regional Development Office, Nyíregyháza 2 College of Nyíregyháza, Department of Technology and Agriculture, Nyíregyháza Abstract: Biomass, the production of plants, is being richly reproduced all around the world. It can (also) be the renewing source of energy for the human race. An outstanding proportion of this renewable energy source can be used to replace fossil energy sources. Since our country, too, is concerned in saving up “preserved energy”, we have to look for new options. A perspective for this dilemma can be biomass, which produces energy through transforming cosmic energy. Keywords: energywillow, Salix viminalis L., insects, process, biotic stress. Introduction Willow species found in their natural environment are a source of nutrition for a wide range of zoological symbiosis. When man started to grow these plants, plenty of parasitic species were discovered and recorded. The release edited by Jermy and Balázs (1988–1996) in several volumes is a good source for identifying willow pests. Small willow aphid (Aphis farinosa Gmelin /=A. saliceti Kaltenbach/ ) was identified at several spots in our country and described in its harfmul action by Halmágyi (1974). Females are wingless, round and mottled light-green. Its abdomen pipe is yellowishwhite. Colonies of the small willow aphid (Aphis farinosa) already appeared in midsummer, and later were sucking on the plants. As a consequence of the species\' feeding habits, contagious symptoms were found on the leaves from the end of July. In some time plants shed off these symptoms, leaving the tip of the shoots stringy, however. Giant willow aphid (Tuberolachnus salignus GMELIN), is a species of anholocyclic development, its spread is almost identical with that of the willow (Salix) spread (Börner et Heinze, 1957). Its presence was reported from several regions of the country (Horváth, 1897). Szalai-Marzsó (1963) recorded the same about bushes of Salix cinerea and S. viminalis, but experienced a widespread presence in Telkibánya. He considered it as a pest on the basket willow, as its damage decreases rod development and sets back shaving. It\'s a fairly sizeable (4-5 mm long) kind. They have a colour of metallic dark brown. Its winged females\' wing-span is 15-16mm. Quite obstructive is their curve tipped and hard chitin hump protruding on the back of the animal, on the half line of the abdomen, of which function is unknown (Szalai-Marzsó, 1989). The nourishment plants of willow-feeding leaf beetles brown willow beetles (or brown willow beetles) (Galerucella lineola FABRICIUS) are mainly willows, but it subsists on poplars, black alder and on common hazel (Sáringer 1990). It's a widespread species in the whole countryside (Kaszab, 1962). The length of the imago is 5-6 mm, its body elongated and a bit flat. Cover wings are yellowish red, on the centre of the head and neck, and also the prothorax a longish black spot can be seen. Cover wings are slightly haired. It’s imagos winter in the dead fallen leaves. They appear in April and place their eggs on the back of willow leaves in clusters. One cluster approximately contains twenty eggs. Young dark brown larvae starts damaging on the top leaves, then move downwards. They have more generations annually (Gyırfi, 1957), there can be even</p><p id="Pg155">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 610 four.Important feeding foliage for the (Plagiodera versicolor) and poplar (Populus) Sáringer, Gyırfi there can be even four. Important feeding foliage for the imported willow leaf beetle (Plagiodera versicolor LAICHARTING) are willow (Salix) and poplar (Populus) kinds. Young larvae groups are peeling the leaves in the beginning. As they grow, they leave irregular shaped holes and pits on the surface. Black defecation of larvae often contaminate the leaves. Fully developed imagos “lace” the leaf edges primarily on sprouting “energy willows”, or often devastate the whole foliage. Fully developed beetles 2,5-4,5 mm long, with shades of blueish green, olive green, rarely cyan or dark purple, or copper with green, purplish red. Its ventral side is black. It is finely dotted on the dorsal side of the head and prothorax and roughly spotted of the cover wings (Sáringer, 1990). Its eggs are yellowish, elongated. Larvae are greyish black (Gyırfi, 1957). It has an annual 3-4 generations. They winter as beetles and appear in early spring. Females lay eggs on the leaves. Their larvae grow into a pupal cocoon on the leaves, too. Materials and methods Our entomological samples were taken in the 50 acres willow (Salix viminalis L.) land in Mátészalka, Szalka Pig Ltd. During three occasions of supervisory outings in 2007 (24 April, 03 June and 25 July) we examined feral pests of the “energy willow”. We repeated our examinations four times on 25 one year-old, and 25 two year-old plants per occasions. On each outing we measured the rate of damaging and specified the species of pests. We also ventured to observe and record imported species, in a perspective of a better professional overview to estimate forthcoming damages. We took photos and notes of the import species, and the damaged area on host plants. Results and discussion During our supervisory outings in 2007. we experienced that various types of pests plant themselves in our “energy willow” (Salix viminalis L.) plants, and damage it in the course of their feeding. Primarily polyphagous pests and willow-specific insects got planted, of which living is tightly related to it. We establish that this year dominant pests on 1 and 2 year-old offshoots and branches are the following: • Imported willow leaf beetle (Plagiodera versicolor LAICHARTING) Its young larvae are peeling the leaves in groups between July and September. When grown, they chew irregular holes and pits on the leaf, contaminating it with their black droppings.

The nutrition of these pests causes economically significant damage, so it is practical to monitor their living habits, the pace and characteristics of their breeding and the rate of damaging. We can put forward an effective, on-the-purpose pest control on the technological level.

Health status and climate of the last 30 years were investigated in selected zonal beech stands. To assess the climatic conditions of beech forests a tolerance index (QBTI) was developed, based on the spring and summer precipitation and on summer mean temperature. Using the regional climate scenario of PRUDENCE the expected future distribution of beech was presented in Hungary by the end of this century. Keywords: Climate change, beech, shift analyses, tolerance limit Introduction Drought sensitivity is assumed to be a key factor limiting the growth and distribution range of beech in the subhumid climates of Southern and South-eastern Europe (Backes and Leuschner 2000). An increasing decay of beech forests has been observed in many regions of Hungary after the extremely dry period of 2000-2003. The future spatial distribution of a tree species due to climate change can be predicted by ecophysiologically based process models (Woodward et al. 2001) or statistical methods applying relationships between climate indices and tree distribution. Climate indices based on temperature and precipitation are used for statistical models (Führer and Jaro, 2000). Materials and methods Climate data and interpolation Monthly meteorological data were obtained from the Hungarian Meteorological Service (HMS). The dataset included 31 temperature and 594 precipitation stations in monthly resolution for the period 1975-2004 for Hungary. Annual precipitation and mean surface temperature maps were compiled using the universal kriging interpolation algorithm. Kriging has been applied extensively for the interpolation of climate data (Hevesi et al. 1992, Garen et al. 1994). The reliability and quality of the kriging gridding technique was assessed using the cross-validation method. Health status assessment Zonal sites were needed for the exact determination of the drought tolerance limit of beech forests, where the relationship of the vitality-loss and climate can be analysed, excluding as many disturbing factors (soil defect, slope effect, effect of seeping water) as possible (Mátyás, 2007). More than 30 stands situated in the xeric frontier zone of beech were selected and investigated. In every stand a 50x50 m sample square was set out. Assessment of the vitality of individual trees was based on canopy density (transparency). After analysing the results, 6 sites in strictly zonal positions were selected for further analyses, where the individual beech trees showed clear signs of a chronic decline.</p><p id="Pg159">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 614 Tolerance index Recent ecophysiological studies have highlighted the effect of June’s climate on the seasonal growth pattern of beech (Lebourgeios et al 2005) which is highly correlated with vitality. Until the end of June, between 30 and 70 % of annual growth is achieved and the radial growth stops between the end of August and mid-September (Lebaube et al. 2000, Barbaroux &amp; Bréda 2002, Bouriaud et al. 2003). In conclusion, beech appears particularly sensitive to drought during the main growing season (from May to July). In order to express the relative importance of the precipitation of the different months of the growing season a modified climate index (QBTI) for beech was introduced based on the weighted spring and summer precipitation and mean summer temperatures: 3/)( 8.05.02.0 VIIIVIIVI VIIIVIIVIVIVIII BTI TTT PPPPPP Q ++ ⋅++++⋅+⋅ = where: T: mean temperature in the given month P: precipitation sum in the given month Results and discussion Climate trends and determination of tolerance limit of beech forests The climatic conditions of the last 30 years of the six selected sites was characterised using the climate index (QBTI) fed by interpolated climate data. The driest site was Balatonszarszo (see Figure 1.), where almost every tree had already died by the summer of 2004. Figure 1. Temporal change of the values of the tolerance index of beech (QBTI) between 1975 and 2004 in Balatonszarszo Only few heavily damaged individuals remained and more than 2/3 of their upper canopy was already dead. The climate at this site has already exceeded the tolerance limit of beech because of the droughts in the growing-season of the period 2000-2003.</p><p id="Pg160">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 615 The relationship of the health status and the tolerance index in the six investigated sites is shown in Table 1. The results indicate the value of the QBTI based drought tolerance limit of beech in Hungary is about 10.8 as an average over a short term period of these 4 years. It is also necessary to outline, that one single year below 10.8 (QBTI) is not enough for mass mortality. Table 1. Average damage class of the investigated beech stands and the average tolerance index between 2000 and 2003 Forecasting future distribution Knowing the lower tolerance limit of beech, and using climate change scenarios, the future distribution of beech can be predicted. It is important to outline that our distribution model is based on the theory that the distribution of certain tree species is regulated only by the climate (macroclimate) and therefore the results are only valid for forest stands at strictly zonal positions. The downscaled values of the PRUDENCE model were used for forecasting. PRUDENCE predicts only the changes of the average values, however the previous chapter shows that the distribution of beech is determined by short-term (4 years) extreme periods rather than long-term (30 years) averages. The magnitude and frequency of the extreme values in the future compared to the longterm average predicted by PRUDENCE will be the same, as experienced in 2000-2003 (Beniston, 2004), although many authors predict that the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events will increase (Gálos et al. 2007, Szalai 2007, Láng et al. 2007). Based on these assumptions, the expected distribution of beech was modelled and mapped in Hungary for the end of this century. The grey colour indicates the climatically unsuitable areas for beech (values of QBTI is under 10.8, see Fig.2.). Conclusions Introducing QBTI provided a simple way to effectively take into account temperature and precipitation, to characterize the humidity conditions of beech forest stands. Using the downscaled values of the PRUDENCE model we have shown that beech forests of Hungary are likely to undergo radical changes as the climate changes in the next 90 years, and many of these forests may disappear.

Demerca 1, HR-48260 Križevci, Croatia Abstract: Organic fertilizers evaluations should describe quality from productivity and environmental points of view. The aim of this paper is to describe computer model for evaluation of organic fertilizers’ impact on plant nutrition and environment and to compare plant nutritional and environmental values of different fresh and composted manures. Four different manures (dairy cow manure, horse manure, separated pig manure and chicken manure) were sampled and analyzed for macroelements (N, P, K, Na), micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Mo, Ni, Cl) and harmful metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Pb) contents in a fresh manure and after 9 months of composting. In addition to that, C/N and NH4-N/NO3-N ratios were also used for integration of manures properties into Fertilizer Index and Environmental Index. Basic value of Fertilizer Index is product of N-P-K concentrations and ratio, additional values are low C/N and NH4-N/NO3-N ratios, and higher micronutrients contents. Limiting factors are sodium, chloride and hazardous elements’ contents. Environmental index is described using contents of toxic elements as limiting factors. Fertilizer index is higher for composted manures indicating higher nutrients concentrations and maturity, but limiting factors as part of environmental index are higher for composts indicating higher heavy metal concentrations. The presented model is sensitive to changes of incorporated fertilizers’ properties taking into account thresholds regulated by directives. Keywords: environment index, heavy metal, limiting factors, macronutrients, micronutrients Introduction Organic fertilizer quality and evaluation were investigated by researchers in fields of maturity and stability (Vukobratovic et al., 2008; Matteson and Sullivan, 2006; Wu and Ma, 2001), commercial quality (Tomati et al., 2002), toxicity (Vukobratovic et al., 2008; Wong et al., 2001), heavy metal contents (Kovacs and Fuleky, 2007) etc. Since organic fertilizers impacted soil quality, numerous authors examined their effects on nutrients availability in soils (Cesoniene and Rutkoviene, 2008), but also environmentally effect like heavy metals in soils (Gyuricza et al., 2008) or heavy metals uptake (Biro et al., 2008). Numerous scientists published integrated chemical, physical and biological approach to organic fertilizer quality evaluation (Mondini et al., 2003; Campitelli and Ceppi, 2008) and increasing number of authors developed computer models (Nemati and Fortin, 2008) in parameter prediction or as decision support systems (Horn et al., 2003). The aim of this paper is to describe computer model for evaluation of organic fertilizers’ impact on plant nutrition and environment and to compare plant nutritional and environmental values of different fresh and composted manures. Materials and methods Four different manures (dairy cow manure, horse manure, separated pig manure and chicken manure) were sampled and analyzed for macroelements (N, P, K, Na), micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Mo, Ni, Cl) and harmful metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Pb)</p><p id="Pg163">Vol. 37, 2009, Suppl. Cereal Research Communications 618 contents in a fresh manure and after 9 months of composting. All the fresh and dry samples were prepared and analyzed according to TMECC methods (Thompson, 2001) using distillation (N), spectroscopy (P), ion selective electrode (Cl), AAS (K, Na, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu) or ICP-OES (Mo, Ni, Cd, Cr, Co, Pb) techniques. Also, the published results of evaluation of lumbripost (vermicomposted cattle manure) (Lončarić et al., 2005) were used for manure quality evaluation and comparison. The computer model has been developed for evaluation and comparison of organic fertilizers considering fertilization and environment points of view. Results and discussion The model of organic fertilizer quality interpretations that has been developing in Croatia integrates determination of Fertilizer Index [Fert In] and Environmental Index [Envr In]. Fertilizer Index describes values from plant nutrition point of view using NP-K content, C/N and NH4-N/NO3-N ratios, sodium and chloride, micro nutrients, heavy metals and hazardous elements concentrations. Basic formula for Fertilizer Index calculations is: [Fert In] = [Basic Value] × [Additional Value] / [Limiting Factors] Basic value of Fertilizer Index is based on N-P-K concentrations considering ratio of these nutrients. Maximum basic value is 5 points as a sum of N-score (maximum 3) and PK-score (maximum 2). Nitrogen concentration in organic fertilizer at level 20 g kg -1 DM or higher resulted with maximum N-score (as chicken manure and lumbripost, Table 1), and lower concentrations resulted in linear decreasing score. The PK-score is calculated on the basis of PK amounts in a volume of organic fertilizer containing 170 kg N (level allowed by Nitrate Directive, 91/676/EEC). For maximum PK-score the sum of P and K must be 250 kg or more. Among analyzed organic fertilizer the separated pig manure (fresh or composted) was closest to maximum PK-score (Table 1). Additional value aggregates C/N ratio, NH4-N/NO3-N ratio and concentration of 5 microelements. C/N and NH4-N/NO3-N ratios as indicators of organic fertilizer maturity can earn maximum score 1.5 each. C/N ratio at level 10 or lower resulted in additional value 1.5 and higher ratio decreased score in a way that, for example, C/N ratio 30 gives just 0.5 as additional value. The model contain very similar evaluation of NH4-N/NO3-N ratio, ratio 0.15 or lower resulted in maximum score 1.5 and ratio 10 decreased score to 0.5. Evaluated micronutrients are Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Mo; each nutrient can score maximum 0.5 if the concentrations are 10 g kg -1 Fe, 1 g kg -1 Mn or Zn, 500 mg kg -1 Cu and 50 mg kg -1 Mo. However, all 5 micronutrients together can score with maximum 2 points of additional value. Finally, additional value as a sum of C/N, NH4-N/NO3-N and micronutrients scores can result with maximum 5 points. Closest to that additional quality level were composted pig manure and lumbripost (Table 1). The model includes two limiting factors: 1. sodium and chloride contents, 2. hazardous elements contents (Cd, Cr, As, Hg, Pb). Sodium and chloride are evaluated on the basis of amounts in a volume of organic fertilizer containing 170 kg N; maximum impact of Na and Cl on limiting factors is 2.5 points if sum of Na and Cl in given fertilizer amount is 375 kg ha -1 or higher. The maximum impact of Cd, Hg, As, Cr, Pb is at level assigned as thresholds for manure application in agriculture (5, 5, 100, 300, 500 mg kg -1 , respectively); each element can contribute limiting factors with maximum 0.5 points.</p><p id="Pg164">VIII. Alps-Adria Scientific Workshop Neum, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 2009 DOI: 10.1556/CRC.37.2009.Suppl.4 619 Nevertheless, the maximum of total limiting factors is set on 2, what means that fertilization index of organic fertilizer can be reduced up to 50 % as a result of limiting factors. Simultaneously, the reason of maximum limiting factor can be just high concentrations of hazardous elements with low Na and Cl concentrations, or vice versa. Table 1.

On the other hand, lowest fertilization value has fresh cattle and horse manure because of lowest N concentrations and highest C/N ratio and chloride content. Environmental index also have basic and additional values and limiting factors. Basic value of environmental index is based on increasing soil biodiversity and elasticity, and additional values are waste-to-fertilizer conversion, soil pH regulation, heavy metals chelating and decreasing of leaching. Limiting factors are contents of toxic elements, persistent synthetic organic compounds and other contaminants with different thresholds and consequently different limiting factors for organic fertilizer application in conventional or organic agriculture. The results showed in this paper consider only limiting factor caused by heavy metals concentrations in organic fertilizer (Table 2). Table 2.

Cereal Research Communications 620 thresholds), and 5 manures have limited factors at maximum level (10) what indicate manures’ properties not allowed for organic agriculture. Conclusions Differences among quality of fresh and composted manures can be clearly described using fertilizer and environmental index. Fertilizer index is higher for composted manures indicating higher nutrients concentrations and maturity, but limiting factors as part of environmental index are higher for composts indicating higher heavy metal concentrations. The presented model is sensitive to changes of incorporated organic fertilizers’ properties taking into account thresholds regulated by directives or bylaws.
