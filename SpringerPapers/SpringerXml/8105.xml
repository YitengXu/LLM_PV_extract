Owing to ecotoxicological concerns, the discharge of the formation water without remediation of hydrocarbonaceous pollutants is not permitted. Keeping this into mind, we carried out phycoremediation of hydrocarbons in formation water so that it can be safely discharged or re-used. For this, a native algal species was isolated from formation water followed by its morphological and 18S ribosomal RNA based identification confirming the algal isolate to be <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 (NCBI GenBank Accession No. MH732950). The algal isolate exhibited high biomass productivity of 1.76 gm L<sup>−1</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> (specific growth rate: 0.21 d<sup>−1</sup>, initial inoculum: 1500 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) along with remediation of 98.63% petroleum hydrocarbons present in formation water within 14 days of incubation indicating an efficient hydrocarbon remediation process. Concomitantly, the hydrocarbon remediation process resulted in reduction of 75% Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) load and complete removal of sulfate from formation water making it suitable for safe disposal or reuse as oil well injection water respectively. The present process overcomes the bottlenecks of external growth nutrient addition or dilution associated with conventional biological treatment resulting in a practically applicable and cost-effective technology for remediation of oil field formation water.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DST | Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="doi" vocab="open-funder-registry">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-type="FundRef grant">PDF/2017/001374</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>Bhaskar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2019</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>10</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2019_Article_51806.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Formation water present in underground hydrocarbon bearing formations is brought to the surface along with crude oil during oil exploration and production. As per American Petroleum Institute, approximately 34.07 liters of formation water is produced per litre of oil produced from stripper oil well (oil well nearing the end of its economically useful life). The worldwide production of formation water is more than 77 billion barrel per year making the current oil industry looks more like a “water industry”<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. This formation water is composed of a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. The discharge of the formation water without remediation of hydrocarbonaceous pollutants is a cause of grave concern since the hydrocarbons exhibit toxic effects as carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity and failure of vital body organs of aquatic organisms as well as humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Owing to ecotoxicological concerns associated with petroleum hydrocarbons, The Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986 of Ministry of Environment and Forests, India has set a permissible limit of 10 mg L<sup>−1</sup> Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) for disposal or less than 5 mg L<sup>−1</sup> TPH for reuse (as oil well injection water) of formation water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Oil field formation water contains TPH in the range of 28 to 126 parts per million (ppm) [ppm = mg L<sup>−1</sup>, mass per volume] which well beyond the permissible limits, set by the environmental regulatory agencies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Keeping this in view, the petroleum industry requires to employ efficient and cost-effective technologies to reduce TPH in formation water below the permissible limit. Biodegradation encompassing its advantages of complete pollutant mineralization with no generation of secondary by-products that incurs additional treatment costs is currently being seen as an economic and eco-friendly technique for cleanup of hydrocarbon-polluted sites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Hydrocarbon degrading bacterial strains are commonly applied for biological treatment of hydrocarbons. However, its application as an effective remediation strategy has been rendered questionable by its requirement of long adaptation periods as well as decreased oxygen saturation levels during hydrocarbon metabolism. Algal bioremediation on the virtue of its unique self-sustaining cycle could provide an efficient solution to overcome the above-mentioned drawbacks associated with conventional bioremediation strategies. Algae oxidize organic pollutants into non-harmful metabolites as CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O by utilizing oxygen present in the surrounding environment. Algae perform photosynthesis for its growth, which requires CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. In turn, the oxygen released as a byproduct of photosynthesis could be utilized by algae for further pollutant oxidation, thus repeating the cycle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. These properties calls for significant attention to elucidate the potential of algae to serve as an effective phycoremediation strategy for removal of hydrocarbons in oil field formation water. Inspite of this, reports exploring the application of algae for treatment of hydrocarbon rich formation water is very severely limited. Talebi <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> attempted to treat diluted formation water by microalgal strain <italic>Dunaliella salina</italic>. They reported that <italic>Dunaliella salina</italic> could grow best when formation water is subjected to 1:1 dilution with sea water. <italic>Dunaliella salina</italic> could not degrade the hydrocarbons present in the diluted formation water, although removal of nitrogen (65%), phosphorus (40%) and heavy metals as Ni (90%) and Zn (80%) was achieved. It is to be noted that the algal strain <italic>Dunaliella salina</italic> was not isolated from a petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated site which may be a possible cause for its inability to remediate hydrocarbons in formation water. For an efficient bioremediation process, the microalgal strains should ideally be able to grow utilizing the hydrocarbonaceous pollutants as a carbon and energy source. This is quintessential to minimize the production of toxic degradation by-products as well as reduce the probability of isolates failing to survive at hydrocarbon contaminated samples due to lack of suitable growth substrates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. To address this, the present study attempts for the first time to isolate algal species native to oil field formation water in a bid to develop a microalgal process for remediation of petroleum hydrocarbon-rich formation water. Since the bioremediation process is based on the application of algal species native to oil field formation water, it is expected that the algal isolate will be able to meet its quintessential growth requirement of carbon and macro/micro-nutrients from the petroleum hydrocarbons and ionic composition found in formation water respectively. This implies that the present microalgal remediation process will overcome the conventional bottlenecks compromising the practical applicability of bioremediation strategies as requirement of external nutrient supplementation or dilution of the oil field formation water to maintain biomass growth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characteristics of the oil field formation water</title><p id="Par3">The physico-chemical characterization of the formation water sample obtained from Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) oil field is described in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The values obtained for various physico-chemical parameters of the formation water was compared with the environmentally permissible limits for safe disposal (on-shore or abandoned oil well disposal) or reuse as oil well injection water (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The comparison indicated that the concentration of TPH and COD in the formation water is well beyond the permissible limits prescribed by regulatory agencies for its safe disposal. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> further brings to light that the TPH and sulfate load is far above the permissible limit for reuse as oil well injection water. The formation water to be reused as oil well injection water requires to be sulfate free or contain low sulfate concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, it is clearly evident from Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> that the values of other parameters as pH as well as heavy metals (Fe, Cu, Cr, Ni) except Zn is within the permissible disposal limits. The heavy metal composition of formation water is characterized by age of the wells as well as formation geology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Apart from this, the ionic composition of formation water sample includes Na, Ca, Mg and N, all of which does not have any prescribed regulatory limit in formation water which could compromise its safe disposal or reuse. It is to be noted that the formation water exhibits the presence of significantly high concentration of Na (42.0972 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) and Ca (289.7853 mg L<sup>−1</sup>).

The morphological identification is followed by 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) based identification of the algal isolate Sample P3. The first ten sequences selected based on maximum identity score obtained from BLAST analysis of the 18S rRNA sequence of the algal isolate were: <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> genomic DNA containing 18S rRNA gene (Max Score: 1901; NCBI Accession No: FR865683.1), <italic>Chlorella chlorell</italic><italic>oides</italic> strain CB 2008/110 18S ribosomal RNA gene (Max Score: 1901; NCBI Accession No: HQ111432.1); <italic>Heynigia riparia</italic> strain CCAP 222/47 18S ribosomal RNA gene (Max Score: 1899; NCBI Accession No: GQ487225.1); <italic>Hindakia fallax</italic> strain CCAP 222/29 18S ribosomal RNA gene (Max Score: 1899; NCBI Accession No: GQ487223.1); <italic>Pseudochlorella pringsheimii</italic> 18S ribosomal RNA gene (Max Score: 1895; NCBI Accession No: KY364701.1); <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> strain KLL-G018 clone a 18S ribosomal RNA gene (Max Score: 1895; NCBI Accession No: KP726221.1), <italic>Chlorella sorokiniana</italic> 18S rRNA gene (Max Score: 1895; NCBI Accession No: LK021940.1), <italic>Chlorella singularis</italic> strain CB 2008/73 18S ribosomal RNA gene (Max Score: 1895; NCBI Accession No: HQ111435.1), <italic>Chlorella volutis</italic> strain CB 2008/69 18S ribosomal RNA gene (Max Score:1895; NCBI Accession No: HQ111434.1), <italic>Hindakia tetrachotoma</italic> strain CCAP 222/69 18S ribosomal RNA gene (Max Score:1895; NCBI Accession No: GQ867590.1). These sequences were aligned using multiple alignment software program Clustal W followed by generation of the distance matrix to estimate the evolutionary divergence between the sequences. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Kimura 2-parameter model. The number of base substitutions per site from between sequences are shown in the distance matrix with standard error estimate(s) shown above the diagonal (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). The distance matrix analysis involved 11 nucleotide sequences. The codon positions included were 1st + 2nd + 3rd + Noncoding. From the distance matrix (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>), the 18S rRNA sequence of the algal isolate (Sample P3) was found to have least evolutionary divergence with <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> (NCBI Accession No: FR865683.1). The nucleotide blast result also supported that the algal isolate is <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> by providing max score of 1901, 99% query coverage, E value of 0, 99% sequence identity with <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> (NCBI Accession No: FR865683.1). Thus, on basis of the results from the phylogenetic analysis (based on Maximum Likelihood method and Kimura 2-parameter model) and the distance matrix generated, it showed that the algal isolate is <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> and hence named as <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1. The 18S rRNA gene sequence of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 was deposited to NCBI GenBank, and an Accession No. MH732950 was obtained. The main bottleneck behind an efficient bioremediation process is to select microalgal species that is a good fit for cultivation in the oil field formation water. In this context, the algal isolate being native to the oil field formation water could be beneficial since it is already adapted to grow in oil field formation water, which is indispensible for developing an efficient remediation process.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Optical microscope image of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 at 100X magnification.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2019_51806_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Growth kinetics of the algal isolate in oil field formation water</title><p id="Par5">The rate of biodegradation is a strong function of biomass growth rate.

Along with this, Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref> depicts the specific growth rate attained by various inoculum (500–2000 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 in oil field formation water. Among the different inoculums concentrations tested, the specific growth rate increased with increase in inoculums concentration until the highest specific growth rate of 0.21 d<sup>−1</sup> was obtained at 1500 mg L<sup>−1</sup> inoculum (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). However, the specific growth rate decreases with increase in inoculum concentration beyond 1500 mg L<sup>−1</sup>. Das <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> while studying phenol degradation by <italic>Chlorella pyrenoidosa</italic> reported similar phenomena of increased specific growth rate with the increase in inoculum concentration until a maximum inoculum concentration of 200 mg L<sup>−1</sup> beyond which the specific growth rate declines. For control cultures (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>), the specific growth rate of 0.12 d<sup>−1</sup> is lower compared to that of 0.21 d<sup>−1</sup> obtained in oil field formation water (statistically significant, p &lt; 0.05). Consequently, the biomass productivity of 1.76 gm L<sup>−1</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> achieved by <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 cultivated in oil field formation water is higher compared to that of 1.25 gm L<sup>−1</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> obtained for control cultures (statistically significant, p &lt; 0.05). The chlorophyll A content of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 cultivated in oil field formation water for 14 days is 54.49% higher compared to that in control cultures which further supports the high biomass growth rate of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 in formation water (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).

Oil field formation water contains sodium, chloride and sulfate as the major ions, all of which have nutritive importance for algal cultivation. Some other constituents of oil field formation water as iron, copper, manganese and zinc are important micronutrients quintessential for algal growth. This indicates the possibility to utilize oil field formation water as a source of algal cultivation media nutrients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. As discussed above (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), the oil field formation water contains several major constituents as SO<sub>4</sub>, Fe, Cu, Zn, Na, Mn, Ca, N and Mg which are essential constituents of standard algae cultivation media like Fog’s media commonly used to cultivate <italic>Chlorella</italic> species. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> represents how the inorganic components present in the oil field formation water were consumed by the algal isolate <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 during its growth and concomitant TPH removal from oil field formation water (the biomass growth and TPH degradation profile is represented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>) resulting in no requirement of additional nutrients for TPH removal from formation water. A prominent decrease in concentrations of the inorganic components (commonly present in standard algal cultivation media) as SO<sub>4</sub> (100%), Fe (45.84%), Cu (77.27%), Cr (24.94%), Zn (41.18%), Na (72.1%), Ca (88.48%), Mn (75.24%), Mg (67.9%) and N (82.57%) in the formation water sample following cultivation of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 indicates its utilization as growth nutrients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The oil field formation water typically contains high concentrations of sulfate in the range of 2 to 1650 mg L<sup>−1</sup> <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In accordance with this, the oil field formation water was found to be sulfate-rich containing 48 mg L<sup>−1</sup> sulfate (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Sulfur is an important macronutrient for microalgal growth with its biomass content ranging from 0.15% to 1.6%. Sulfur is a key component of the amino acids cysteine and methionine; sulfolipids in cell membranes; oligopeptides (glutathione and phytochelatins); vitamins and cofactors (biotin, thiamine, CoA and S-adenosyl-Met); regulatory compounds as well as sulfur-containing secondary metabolites in microalgae<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. The sulfur requirements of microalgae are fulfilled mainly in form of sulfate. The sulfate is absorbed by cells and reduced in the plastids for the formation of cysteine and methionine and various sulfur-containing coenzymes as well as metabolites<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In accordance with this, <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 could completely utilize sulfate present in formation water within 14 days of incubation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In accordance with this, the algal strain could utilize 34.18% sulfate present in control cultures over the same incubation period of 14 days (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). The sulfate-rich formation water presents a challenge for its reuse as injection water for oil drilling activities. The high concentration of sulfate in formation water results in stimulating the growth of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the oil reservoirs subsequently resulting in H<sub>2</sub>S formation. This process of biogenic H<sub>2</sub>S production known as “reservoir souring” is a cause of grave concern to the oil industry owing to reservoir plugging, toxic and corrosive nature of H<sub>2</sub>S and increased content of sulfur in oil and gas. In order to prevent the production of H<sub>2</sub>S, biocides as glutaraldehyde are incorporated into injection water. However, the biocide treatment suffers from drawbacks as being expensive along with its reduced effectiveness owing to the growth of sulfate-reducing bacteria in biofilms and biocide inactivation after reaction with biofilm as well as minerals. The use of recalcitrant biocides is another matter of environmental concern while decomposition of biocides may yield substrates for sulfate-reducing bacteria. Nanofiltration to remove sulfate is efficient but is very costly for large-scale application. The need of the hour is to devise a cost-effective biological process for remediation of sulfate present in the formation water prior to its reinjection for oil drilling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. As discussed earlier, the ability of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 to completely utilize sulfate anion as a sulfur source indicates its promising ability to be used for removal of sulfate present in oil field formation water. Mohammadi <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> evaluated the ability of five microalgal species (<italic>Chlorella</italic> sp., <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> sp., <italic>Oocystis</italic> sp., <italic>Scenedesmus</italic> sp., and <italic>Fischerella</italic> sp.) to remediate sulfate from power plant wastewater in the batch culture system. They reported that the microalgal species could efficiently remove 22–32% sulfate within 21 days of incubation which supports the findings of the present study. Bako <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> also reported similar findings of 25.56% sulphate removal along with remediation of hydrocarbons in refinery effluents by a consortium of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Penicillium janthinellum</italic> following an incubation period of 2 weeks. However, they supplemented the refinery effluent with nutrients to maintain the growth requirements of bacterial consortia. The present study reports 100% sulfate remediation present in oil field formation water without any requirement of nutrient supplementation. This adds to practical applicability of the strain for cost-effective and faster treatment of sulfate-rich formation water making it suitable for reinjection into the oil reservoirs. The priority pollutant Ni, present in formation water sample can be utilized as growth nutrient by some algal species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In accordance with this, the algal isolate <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 reported an uptake of 73.51% of Ni during its cultivation in formation water indicating its possible utilization as a micronutrient for growth (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The ability of microalgal species to grow in presence of toxic metals as Ni is contributed by its capacity for adsorption of these ions and the role these ions play as cofactors for metalloenzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Lustigman <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> studied the effect of Ni on growth of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic>. They concluded that the growth of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> increases in presence of 10 ppm Ni which supports the findings of the present study. Thus, <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 could achieve the high biomass productivity in oil field formation water by virtue of its algal growth feasible ionic composition. This overcomes the requirement of nutrient supplementation of oil field formation water to maintain the growth requirements of the algal isolate.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Uptake profile of N, Mg, Ca, Mn, Na, Ni, Zn, Cr, Cu, Fe and SO<sub>4</sub> by <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 during its growth in oil field formation water.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2019_51806_Fig3_HTML.png"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Characteristics of oil field formation water after treatment with <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 for 14 days and its compliance with environmental standards for its disposal and reuse.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2"><p>Characteristics of oil field Formation water after treatment</p></th><th rowspan="2"><p>Values</p></th><th colspan="3"><p>Does the treated formation water satisfy the regulatory guidelines for its disposal or reuse?</p></th></tr><tr><th><p>On-shore disposal (Environment Protection Rules, 1986)</p></th><th><p>Disposal by reinjection into abandoned oil well (Environment Protection Rules, 1986)</p></th><th><p>Reuse by reinjection into oil reservoirs (Recommendation Standard and Analysis Method for the Clastic Rock Reservoir Injection Water Quality)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>pH</p></td><td><p>7.2 ± 0.18</p></td><td><p>✓</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>TPH (mg L<sup>−1</sup>)</p></td><td><p>0.04 ± 0.12</p></td><td><p>✓</p></td><td><p>✓</p></td><td><p>✓</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>SO<sub>4</sub> (mg L<sup>−1</sup>)</p></td><td><p>Not detected</p></td><td><p>✓</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>✓</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>COD (mg L<sup>−1</sup>)</p></td><td><p>79.2 ± 2.61</p></td><td><p>✓</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Fe (mg L<sup>−1</sup>)</p></td><td><p>1.232 ± 1.03</p></td><td><p>✓</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cu (mg L<sup>−1</sup>)</p></td><td><p>0.0015 ± 1.02</p></td><td><p>✓</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cr (mg L<sup>−1</sup>)</p></td><td><p>0.0295 ± 0.03</p></td><td><p>✓</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Zn (mg L<sup>−1</sup>)</p></td><td><p>0.1037 ± 0.001</p></td><td><p>✓</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ni (mg L<sup>−1</sup>)</p></td><td><p>0.0697 ± 0.004</p></td><td><p>✓</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Na (mg L<sup>−1</sup>)</p></td><td><p>11.744 ± 1.21</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mn (mg L<sup>−1</sup>)</p></td><td><p>0.0026 ± 1.06</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ca (mg L<sup>−1</sup>)</p></td><td><p>33.376 ± 0.17</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Mg (mg L<sup>−1</sup>)</p></td><td><p>3.3298 ± 0.013</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>N (mg L<sup>−1</sup>)</p></td><td><p>0.61 ± 0.04</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td><td><p>No regulatory limits</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Remediation of oil field formation water</title><p id="Par7">Considering the virtues of the algal isolate <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 of high biomass productivity (1.76 gm L<sup>−1</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>) with no requirement of external nutrient supplementation or dilution of oil field formation water brightens its potential to find a practical application for remediation of oil field formation water. <italic>Chlorella</italic> sp. could efficiently utilize petroleum hydrocarbons as carbon source through its mixotrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Considering this, the algal isolate <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 could grow by utilizing the hydrocarbons present in oil field formation water as a source of carbon. The analysis of TPH degradation in formation water by <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 in inoculum range of 500–2000 mg L<sup>−1</sup> indicates that the highest increment in degradation (%) in successive interval of 7 days and consequently the highest TPH degradation of 98.63% (after incubation of 14 days) was obtained with 1500 mg L<sup>−1</sup> inoculum (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). This may be attributed to highest specific growth rate in formation water obtained with 1500 mg L<sup>−1</sup> inoculum of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>). Das <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> reported similar phenomena while studying phenol degradation by <italic>Chlorella pyrenoidosa</italic>. They reported that the highest phenol degradation was achieved at the algal inoculum where the highest specific growth rate was obtained which supports our present findings. The residual hydrocarbon profile of the 1500 mg L<sup>−1</sup> inoculum culture which showed highest TPH degradation was analyzed by GC-MS and described in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>. The comparison of the residual hydrocarbon profile (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) with that of abiotic control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) indicated that <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 could completely degrade a range of hydrocarbonaceous compounds (C12 to C60) comprising of alkanes and polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) present in formation water (Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). The GC-MS results validate the findings of gravimetric analysis that 98.63% TPH was degraded by <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 within 14 days of incubation. The potential of microalgae to degrade petroleum hydrocarbons has been reported by a number of previous studies. Kalhor <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> reported that <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> could remediate 88% of crude oil hydrocarbon compounds within an incubation time of 14 days which supports our present findings. However, it is to be noted that the hydrocarbon degradation was studied in Konvey medium for maintenance of algal growth requirements. Similarly, the reports related to the ability of green microalgal species <italic>S</italic>. <italic>obliquus</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>vulgaris</italic> to degrade and utilize crude oil hydrocarbons as a carbon source<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> is in accordance with findings of the present study. El-Sheekh and Hamouda<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> reported the ability of <italic>Nostoc punctiforme</italic> and <italic>Spirulina platensis</italic> to utilize aliphatic compounds present in crude oil as carbon source which corroborates to the results of the present study. However, it is to be noted that all of the above-mentioned hydrocarbon degradation experiments were carried out in standard algal media for maintenance of the growth requirements of algal biomass. By far, when algae was applied for phycoremediation of real wastewater as petroleum hydrocarbon rich formation water it did not exhibit the desired hydrocarbon removal efficiency. Talebi <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> evaluated the application of algal strain <italic>Dunaliella salina</italic> to remediate diluted oil field formation water. They reported that <italic>Dunaliella salina</italic> could not degrade TPH present in the diluted produced water sample. Apart from algal bioremediation, the microbial treatment of formation water has been reported by a number of previous studies. Sharghi <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> studied the biological treatment of synthetic formation water by mixed bacterial culture in a membrane bioreactor. The synthetic formation water used contained all mineral salt medium according to the growth requirements of the mixed bacterial structure. It was reported that the bacterial consortium could degrade most of the hydrocarbon fractions in synthetic formation water except the high molecular weight compounds following 106 days of operation of the reactor. Similarly, Habibi and Babaei<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> analyzed the degradation of hydrocarbons in oil-field formation water by <italic>Candida catenulata</italic>. They found that 95% TPH degradation by <italic>Candida catenulata</italic> is possible only after supplementation of the oil field formation water with nutrient requirements of the yeast cells. On the same lines, Tellez <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> evaluated the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons in formation water generated by the southwestern US oilfield by an activated sludge treatment unit. The formation water was supplemented with macronutrients for appropriate microbial growth. They reported TPH removal efficiency of 98–99% at a solids retention time of 20 days. In contrary to the previous studies, the present study achieved 98.63% remediation of TPH in oil field formation water without any requirement of nutrient supplementation or dilution of the oil field formation water. This adds to practical applicability of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 for cost-effective and efficient remediation of petroleum hydrocarbons in formation water overcoming the bottlenecks as requirements of external growth nutrient addition and dilution associated with conventional biological treatment. The <italic>in-situ</italic> biological treatment of hazardous organic pollutants require injection of microrganisms along with nutrients for maintaining the biomass growth. The reduction of cost associated with this requirement of inorganic nutrients can go a long way to make biological treatment cost-effective and sustainable. In this context, the present phycoremediation process cuts down costs associated with supply of nutrients. This is evident from the cost-wise calculation associated with nutrient requirement as mentioned in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. As evident from Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>, the cost of nutrients supply for 1000 L control culture is INR 6114 (89.18 US Dollars). On the other hand, the present phycoremediation approach overcomes the requirements of nutrient supplementation to maintain biomass growth and hence results in a cost-effective remediation process (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The present process with no requirement of nutrient supply, could sustainably produce significantly high biomass productivity of 1.76 gm L<sup>−1</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> as against that in control (1.25 gm L<sup>−1</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>) which is indispensable for efficient remediation. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> represents a schematic diagram of the proposed phycoremediation process for oil field formation water. As schematically represented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, a specified volume of formation water to be treated is transferred from open evaporation ponds which stores formation water for natural evaporative treatment. A water delivery system transfers this required volume of formation water from evaporation ponds into sterilization chamber where it is subjected to sterilization at 121 °C for 15 minutes. Then, the sterilized formation water is flown to into a phycoremediation tank made of transparent glass for light supply. In the phycoremediation tank, the formation water is inoculated with the algal strain <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 at inoculum concentration of 1500 mg/l. The algal biomass is cultivated in the phycoremediation tank under the cultivation conditions as illumination of 3500 lux for a photoperiod of 14 hours light: 10 hours dark, mixing of the culture at 110 rpm by a rotating baffle and incubation temperature of 25 °C. For phycoremediation of the formation water, the phycoremediation tank is operated at the above mentioned cultivation conditions for a time period of 14 days. After the incubation period of 14 days, the treated effluent achieved could be safely discharged or be reused as oil well injection water. The formation water used for the present process is obtained from open evaporation ponds which are routinely employed for on site or off site treatment of formation water by evaporating the water by solar energy. However, the use of evaporative ponds for formation water is not applicable when water recovery for reuse is an objective of the water treatment strategies. In this context, the present phycoremediation process could serve as a sustainable approach by recovering a portion of the water resource from formation water evaporation ponds which would otherwise be lost to the environment.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) chromatograph of abiotic control formation water incubated for 14 days.

On the other hand, the shorter-chain fatty alcohols by virtue of its high solubility in water could penetrate the cytoplasmic membrane in relatively high concentrations resulting in disturbances in membrane permeability as well as inhibition of endogenous respiration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Hence, the accumulation of long chain fatty alcohol n-tridecan-1-ol as hydrocarbon breakdown metabolite is least likely to compromise the efficiency of the phytoremediation process. Aerobic alkane-degrading microbes activate alkane molecules using O<sub>2</sub> as a reactant. The alkane-activating monooxygenase counters the hydrocarbons with low reactivity by the production of reactive oxygen species. The alkane degradation is initiated by oxidation of terminal methyl group to primary alcohol followed by its oxidation to aldehyde and finally to a fatty acid. In the case of aromatics, the microbial biodegradation pathways result in the conversion of the aromatic compounds to ortho or paradihydroxy phenol derivatives followed by cleavage of the ring to aliphatic acids. Finally, these are processed by the β-oxidation pathway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The accumulation of the above mentioned TPH breakdown metabolites in the present study indicates the role of enzymatic pathways in conferring petroleum hydrocarbon degradation ability to <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1. Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref> represents the amount of TPH dissipated after 1 day of incubation with dead biomass (sorption) which will help verify if TPH dissipation is mainly contributed by sorption or biodegradation. Following incubation for 1 day, the dead biomass dissipated only 2.5% TPH from formation water contributed by sorption process. On the contrary, live cells could degrade significantly higher 6.52% TPH over the same incubation time period (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). Hence, on basis of accumulation of biodegradation intermediates following formation water treatment and low TPH removal by sorption, the dissipation of TPH by the algal strain is mainly due to biodegradation and not related only to sorption to algal biomass.</p><p id="Par10">The petroleum hydrocarbons are the major contributor to COD of oil field formation water. In accordance with this, the COD in the formation water sample is well beyond the permissible limit prescribed by regulatory agencies for its safe disposal (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In order to dispose of the formation water, it has to compile with the environmental regulatory standards of COD.

When algal cells are subjected to salinity stress, Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) as superoxide radicals, singlet oxygen, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radical are formed which could result in damage of biomacromolecules as DNA, lipids and proteins.

In accordance with this, the present process resulted in 98.63% remediation of TPH in oil field formation water with very minimal accumulation of breakdown metabolites indicating an efficient hydrocarbon remediation process. The microalgal remediation process resulted in 75% reduction of COD load in the formation water meeting the environmentally permissible disposal standards.

In order to analyze any loss of hydrocarbons due to abiotic factors, the oil field formation water without inoculation of the algae was incubated under the same culture conditions as mentioned above. For the abiotic control, the TPH was extracted by solvent extraction method followed by its gravimetric quantification and GC-MS analysis as described above. To verify if the algal growth is dependent on mixotrophism (utilize both hydrocarbon and inorganic carbon by photosynthesis as carbon source) or if the algal strain could utilize hydrocarbon as sole source of carbon, the algal strain was cultivalted in oil field formation water under dark condition. The growth of algal biomass, residual TPH and specific growth rate (µ) was determined as described above. To verify the role of sorption in TPH dissipation, biomass of <italic>Chlorella vulgaris</italic> BS1 was heat killed by autoclaving followed by incubation of dead biomass in formation water under the same experimental condition as described above for experiments with live cells. The residual TPH at equal intervals of 24 hours was analyzed as mentioned above. The inoculum concentration of dead biomass for the experiment was taken as 3500 mg L<sup>−1</sup> (since 3500 mg L<sup>−1</sup> biomass is obtained after incubation of 1 day with starting algal inoculum of 1500 mg L<sup>−1</sup> as mentioned in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>). This allows comparison between the amount of TPH dissipated after 1 day of incubation between dead biomass (sorption) and live cells (biodegradation) which will help verify if TPH dissipation is mainly contributed by sorption or biodegradation.</p><p id="Par34">Concomitantly with TPH remediation, any improvement in other physico-chemical parameters determining formation water quality as pH, COD, ionic content and heavy metals was analyzed for the test experiment which showed highest TPH removal from formation water.

For this, an equal volume of biomass from both the culture conditions was harvested by centrifugation at 4400 rpm for 6 minutes. This was followed by addition of methanol to the algal biomass. For cell disruption, the samples were subjected to an ultrasound bath treatment of 5 minutes and then incubated at temperature of 60 <sup>o</sup>C for 40 minutes. After this, the samples were exposed to a temperature shock at 0 °C for 15 minutes. For analysis, the samples were centrifuged followed by estimation of the absorbance of the resulting supernatant at 470 nm in UV-Visible spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu, Japan).
