In the energy utilization infrastructure, about 75% of the fossil fuel consumption is used to provide and maintain heat, leading to more than 60% waste heat of the input energy discharging to the environment. Types of low-grade waste heat recovery technologies are developed to increase the energy efficiency. However, due to the spatial and temporal mismatch between the need and supply of the thermal energy, much of the waste thermal energy is difficult to be recovered. Thermal energy storage (TES) technologies in the forms of sensible, latent and thermochemical heat storage are developed for relieving the mismatched energy supply and demand. Diverse TES systems are developed in recent years with the superior features of large density, long-term, durable and low-cost. These technologies are vital in efficient utilization of low-grade waste heat and expected for building a low or zero carbon emission society. This paper reviews the thermal storage technologies for low carbon power generation, low carbon transportation, low carbon building as well as low carbon life science, in addition, carbon capture, utilization, and storage are also considered for carbon emission reduction. The conclusion and perspective are raised after discussing the specific technologies. This study is expected to provide a reference for the TES technologies in achieving zero-carbon future.

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par35">Due to the intense carbon emission since industrial revolution, the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere rapidly increases from 280 to 420 ppm within a short period of ~ 300 years. Due to the high transmittance in the solar wavelength and low absorbance in the far infrared wavelength range, the greenhouse effect occurs and contributes to a large increment in global temperature. The global temperature increment leads to severe consequences such as glacier melting, sea level rise and climate anomaly. In order to avoid the consequences that threaten the human survival, it is necessary to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) in all sectors of the world. To ensure the global temperature rise less than 2 °C, carbon net zero emission should be achieved at the second half of the twenty-first century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213">213</xref>]. In order to make the global temperature rise less than 1.5 °C, carbon zero emissions must be achieved at around 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. According to the global GHG emissions by sector in 2016, the global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are about 49.4 billion tons, of which the GHG emissions from industrial energy consumption account for the major part, including iron &amp; steel, chemical &amp; petrochemical, food &amp; tobacco, non-ferrous metals and other manufacturing industries. The large portion of CO<sub>2</sub> emission from industrial process is due to the heavy dependence on thermal energy from fossil fuel combustion. The second largest CO<sub>2</sub> emission is from building sector, of which residential emissions account for 10.9% and commercial building emissions account for 6.6%. Among them, domestic heating, cooling and hot water supply of residential buildings account for 70% of the energy consumption of buildings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The third largest CO<sub>2</sub> emission is from the transportation sector, which mainly includes road transportation, aviation transportation and shipping transportation, accounting for 11.9%, 1.9% and 1.7% respectively. Although electric driven transportation is boosted in recent years, the combustion of fossil fuels is still the major measure for transportation energy supply.</p><p id="Par36">From the above analysis one can find that no matter in industry, building, or transportation sectors, the carbon emissions are mainly from the combustion of fossil fuel for providing thermal energy. Due to the massive demand on thermal energy in the aforementioned energy utilization sectors, the dependence on fossil fuels could not be replaced in a short period of time. However, the utilization of thermal energy would lead to severe heat loss inevitably. The heat loss appears in the forms of exhaust gas from the chimney of thermal power plant, convection and radiation heat loss from the surface of equipment and thermal pipelines, as well as the exhaust gas from gas turbine and internal combustion engines. It is reported that more than 60% of the energy consumption is lost as low-grade thermal energy. The efficient utilization of the low-grade waste thermal energy could significantly reduce the utilization of fossil fuels and contribute to the development of a carbon neutrality. Diverse technologies for recycling the low-grade waste thermal energy are developed including organic rankine cycle power generation system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">214</xref>], heat pumps (HP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR275">275</xref>], solid-state power converters (thermoelectric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], thermoelectrochemical cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], thermo-osmotic systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR255">255</xref>], thermally regenerative cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>] and so on. The utilization of the above heat recovery technologies could increase the overall efficiency of fossil fuel combustion to a certain extent. However, the thermal energy could not be recycled by these technologies in some occasions. This could be attributed to three reasons. First, the low-grade waste thermal energy is typically discontinuous. The discontinuous thermal energy supply leads to adverse operating condition for the organic rankine cycle system,Second, the location mismatch between supply and demand of thermal energy. The low-grade waste thermal energy is typically generated in industrial zone where is rich of thermal energy. However, the demand on low-grade thermal energy typically happens in urban zones. The location mismatch induces heat loss and cost-efficiency problems for waste energy recovery,Third, the timing mismatch between the supply and demand of thermal energy. For example, the low-grade waste thermal energy is typically generated in the industrial process during daytime, while the demand on waste thermal energy is typically at night for domestic heating purposes. These three reasons severely limit the wide application of waste thermal energy recovery technologies and hinder the overall conversion efficiency of the fossil fuel chemical energy. A technology ensures the highly efficient utilization of the low-grade waste thermal energy is highly desired.</p><p id="Par37">TES is considered to be a technology that can solve the problems of heat source discontinuity as well as location and timing mismatch between heat source and heat load for efficiently recover the thermal energy from both industrial and renewable resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. In the past decades, the research on TES is boosting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR260">260</xref>] but the commercialization shows a slow pace. This is mainly attributed to the issues raised from the cost, technical maturity as well as policy guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>]. The high-grade thermal energy is typically recycled in the industry with good payback period and economic benefits. As a contrary, the recycle on low-grade thermal energy is less attractive. However, with the urgent goal for achieving carbon neutrality globally, diverse policies (<italic>e.g. </italic>carbon emission tax and peak-valley price on electricity) have been made for charging excess carbon emission. These policies induce more worthwhile efforts on recycling the low-grade thermal energy.</p><p id="Par38">On the other hand, the development on renewable sources (<italic>e.g. </italic>solar and wind energy) is equally important as compared to waste energy recovering for contributing to a low-carbon emission society. However, the solar and wind energy face the same discontinuity issues as the waste energy. Storage units are essential for the efficient utilization of renewable energy. There are diverse commercial storage technologies including [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>], such as compressed air energy storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR299">299</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR300">300</xref>], flywheel energy storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], pumped hydro energy storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">202</xref>], battery energy storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], hydrogen storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], TES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">194</xref>] and the novelty carnot battery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]. The energy storage efficiency, density, cost and other parameters of common energy storage methods are shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

In addition, the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) special report on global warming of 1.5 °C states that CCUS (Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage) technology can effectively improve the global climate change, and it is clearly pointed out that CCUS technology is significant to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050. The combination of CCUS and TES will be the most effective and direct means of carbon emission reduction, with great emission reduction potential, wide application scenarios and high potential benefits. Although there have been many reviews on TES technology, most of them focus on technical aspects such as material improvement, equipment design and system optimization. None of the published review article is from the viewpoint of TES contribution in achieving a carbon neutrality. This article reviews the TES technology in achieving zero-carbon power generation, zero-carbon transportation, zero-carbon building, zero-carbon life science and zero-carbon society, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The aforementioned energy consumption sectors require different temperature range thermal storage materials and systems. The sensible, latent and thermochemical thermal storage materials and systems for diverse temperature ranges are also compared for clarifying the pros and cons. This paper firstly reviews the classification of TES and the mechanism of energy storage (Section 2). According to the type of thermal storage, the applications of using sensible heat storage (SHS) for developing a zero-carbon future is summarized in Section 3, followed by using latent heat storage (LHS) in Section 4 and thermochemical heat storage (TCHS) in Section 5. The future requirements on TES technology for achieving carbon neutrality is discussed in Section 6. Finally, the conclusions and perspectives are provided in Section 7. This review is beneficial for subsequent researchers and engineers to design a more efficient and more reasonable TES system suitable for developing a zero-carbon future.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Contribution of TES technology for building a zero-carbon society</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43979_2023_52_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Overview of TES technologies</title><p id="Par40">TES is a heat storage technology that collects, stores and releases heat with relatively large capacity.

The heat storage medium is called phase change material (PCM), and the PCM is divided into solid–solid, solid–liquid, solid–gas and liquid–gas according to the type of phase transition. Among them, the solid–solid phase transition mainly refers to the change of the internal lattice structure of the molecule, and the latent heat of phase transition is generally much lower than that of the solid–liquid phase transition process. For solid–gas and liquid–gas phase transition, the volume change before and after the phase transition is severe, thus leading to few practical applications in industry. The solid–liquid phase transition has the characteristics of large value of latent heat, small volume change during phase change, and wide range of phase transition temperature. The types of PCMs are shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> including organic PCMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR244">244</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR308">308</xref>], inorganic PCMs and eutectic PCMs. The organic PCMs can be classified as paraffins, sugar alcohols, fatty acids and esters. The inorganic PCMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>] can be classified as crystalline hydration salts, molten salts, metals and alloys. The eutectic PCMs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">235</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR296">296</xref>], can be synthesized between organic-organic, organic–inorganic, and inorganic-inorganic PCMs. Although solid–liquid PCMs have been developed for many years, have shown features of high heat storage density, and have already been put into commercial applications, there are still some problems in the process of energy storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>].

For chemical reaction energy storage, it mainly utilizes chemical bond formation and bond breaking in forward/reverse reactions of chemical reactions to achieve thermal storage or release.

The process of combining the two separately stored reactants A and B through chemical bonds to form a single product is accompanied by heat release. When the thermal energy is stored, the product AB absorbs heat and decomposes to products A and B through the decomposition reaction. The products could be kept separately for long-term storage. Common chemical reaction energy storage methods such as carbonate decomposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">178</xref>], metal hydride hydrogen production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR225">225</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR246">246</xref>], ammonia synthesis and methane reforming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] have shown large heat storage capacity and long heat storage duration. The TCHS system typically shows a 2–5 times larger specific storage capacity as compared to LHS and 8–10 times larger to SHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR307">307</xref>]. However, such systems require higher activation energy before heat storage.

Besides, the system is simple and easy to be implemented. The disadvantage is that it is greatly affected by environmental factors. Consideration on thermal insulation measures need to be taken. Only short-term heat storage can be performed, and the amount of heat storage is affected by the volume of the system. LHS has gradually begun to be used due to its advantages of high heat storage density, wide phase transition temperature range, constant phase transition temperature, and large heat storage per unit volume. The disadvantage is that the cycle stability is poor, especially the inorganic PCMs have supercooling and phase separation phenomena. The energy storage density per unit volume of TCHS is about 8 to 10 times that of SHS, and more than twice that of LHS. It also has the advantages of long heat storage duration and less heat loss.

Issues with material selection, system integration and durability are discussed.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>SHS in zero-carbon power generation</title><p id="Par49">SHS is typically employed in the concentration solar (photothermal) power (CSP) which target for a great reduction in carbon emission during the power generation process. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has set a target to generate about 630 GW of electricity by 2050 using CSP technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the main idea of a CSP system is to collect the solar energy from the arrays of heliostat for photothermal conversion. The heated receiver with a temperature of over 600 °C could be employed for power generation via either Rankine cycle or Brayton cycle. The CSP system typically operates either in a direct or indirect mode. SHS systems are vital in both the direct steam power generation (DSPG) and the indirect steam power generation (ISPG). The SHS system with storage capability is able to bring part of the photothermal energy from daytime to the night to achieve continuous power generation which is important for pursuing high energy efficiency, better load matching as well as long lifespan of the power generation system. Other than the concentration solar energy, the SHS could also be employed in industrial waste recovery power generation system, for storing and balancing the fluctuating waste heat source. In these systems, the selected SHS material is mainly high-temperature molten salt, liquid metal, heat transfer oil, concrete, rock, solid particles, steam, etc., which have the characteristics of high thermal conductivity, high boiling point, low melting point, high heat capacity, high thermal stability, low cost, and low corrosiveness to metal containers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">203</xref>].<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic diagram of a concentration solar power system, with permissions requested from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR272">272</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43979_2023_52_Fig3_HTML.png" id="MO3"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec8"><title>DSPG</title><p id="Par50">In a DSPG system, the SHS material serves both as a heat storage medium as well as a heat transfer fluid (HTF). In such systems, the tower like solar concentration system is typically employed and the receiver temperature could be greater than 500 °C. The heat transfer oil cannot be employed for its relatively low decomposition temperature (&lt; 400 °C). Under this circumstance, liquid phase SHS (molten nitrate salts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR272">272</xref>], fluidized particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>], and liquid metal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]) are typically employed.</p><p id="Par51">The dual functions of the SHS as well as HTF material are favorable for reducing the system complexity and the construction cost. The first molten salt based DSPG system was introduced in 1984 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. With a system configuration as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR254">254</xref>], the thermal energy collected from the tower-type concentration system is transferred to the molten salt. Molten salts as both HTF and SHS material, which the feed temperature is 290 °C and the molten salt is heated to over 565 °C after heat transfer with the high temperature receiver. The heated molten salt flows to the steam generator to power the Rankine cycle via a TES tank. Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b shows the two-tank molten salt TES system of the Andasol 350 MW CSP plant in Spain, which contains ~ 28,500 metric tons Solar Salt for 7.5 h storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The heat storage process using high-temperature fluidized particles as HTF is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. The solar radiation is collected and the heat is exchanged with the fluidized particles through the wall of the vertically placed tubular absorber. Silicon carbide is typically employed as the fluidized particles with the features of high-dense particle suspension and unstable fluidization to improve heat transfer in the fluidized bed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228">228</xref>], which is favorable in obtaining an increased system efficiency. In addition to silicon carbide as fluid particles, Minerva Díaz-Heras et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] also tested sand, carbo Accucast ID50 and SiC particles for CSP. The results show that the main attraction of SiC and carbo is their very high absorptivity, around 0.9 or more than 0.9, which ensures a higher ability to absorb direct solar radiation, thereby increasing the temperature and efficiency of the system. While sand is an abundant material, 4–5 times cheaper than SiC and carbo, it can be transported/fluidized at lower pumping costs. Other than the molten salts and fluidized particles, low melting point liquid metal material has become an attractive heat transfer medium widely used in CSP systems due to its unique properties such as low melting point, high thermal conductivity, high latent heat, non-flammability, and non-toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. In recent years, Salyan proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR229">229</xref>] a method of adding liquid metal Ga plug-in to the solar energy storage system to improve the heat storage capacity. Ga's high thermal conductivity, low specific heat, and its liquidus temperature facilitate Ga's use as a thermal energy carrier in the TES device, and a maximum power output of 0.64 kW was obtained during the curing cycle. In addition to liquid SHS material, steam accumulator is typically employed for waste heat recovery from industry. The steam accumulator is a heat storage device that directly stores high-temperature steam at higher pressure and releases lower pressure steam when needed. In January 2016, only two commercial tower power plants using steam accumulator thermal energy storage were in operation: PS10 and PS20, located in Spain, became the first two commercial solar towers in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>]. The first generation of CSP columns used saturated steam technology (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). The PS10 storage system provides 20 MWh of storage capacity, during plant operation steam is generated in the receiver and sent to a turbine where it expands to generate mechanical work and electricity, excess steam is stored in a steam accumulator for later use. The second generation CSP direct steam tower adopts superheated steam technology (Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b). Utilizing a second receiver to reheat the steam produced by the first receiver to reach a higher temperature, the high-temperature steam produced can reach a temperature of 540 °C and a pressure of 130 bar, compared with its predecessor PS20, the power cycle's efficiency increased by 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>].

Heat transfer oil and antifreeze fluids are typically employed as the HTF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">As compared to the DSPG, the ISPG system shows two distinct features. The first feature is that the operation temperature is relatively lower (&lt; 400 °C) than the DSPG, thus parabolic trough solar concentrators could meet the requirements for power generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">182</xref>]. Second, since the TES and HTF fluids transfer heat in an indirect way, the system is more complex than the DSPG system due to the existence of extra heat exchangers, valves and pumps as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a. The figure shows the 1 MWe CSP system in Yanqing, Beijing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>], which includes solar field, indirect heat storage double tanks, steam generation system and power generation module. The double-tank heat storage is mainly that the molten salt can store additional heat energy, and directly exchange heat with the HTF heat transfer oil to generate steam for power generation. The temperature of the low-temperature heat storage tank is 292 °C, and the temperature of the high-temperature heat storage tank is 386 °C. When the solar radiation heat is insufficient or encountered in cloudy and rainy days, it is necessary to use a high temperature heat storage tank to preheat the heat transfer oil to provide extra heat into the system. Herrmann et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>] proposed a trough solar double-tank heat storage and collector field. The high-temperature heat transfer oil absorbs heat through the trough-type collector, and the low-temperature molten salt is heated to 385 °C. During the power generation process, the high temperature molten salt and the heat transfer oil releases heat to the HTF. The temperature of the molten salt drops to 300 °C and flows into the low temperature heat storage tank. At the same time, the HTF exchanges heat to generate steam for power generation. Solid SHS material could also be employed in the ISPG since the SHS only plays a role as TES medium. Compared with the double-tank liquid SHS heat storage system, solid heat storage medium becomes more attractive due to its lower investment, lower maintenance costs, wider range of sources such as sand, gravel, concrete, etc. Using concrete block as heat storage medium, as it is easy to handle, available all over the world, and with no environmentally critical components. Laing et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>] designed and tested a ISPG system as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b. The concrete storage module consists of tube register and storage concrete. The heat transfer medium is oil, and the entire storage module is insulated with mineral wool. To improve the heat transfer effect, the charging and discharging process uses anisotropic flow to ensure a heat transfer temperature difference of 100 K. However, concrete as a thermal storage medium is affected by working temperature. When the temperature exceeds 150 °C, there will be a loss of free water and other components in concrete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>]. When the temperature continues to rise to 500 °C, the mass of cement continues to decrease, and after several cycles, the compressive strength of concrete will drop to 30–50% of its initial value, reaching the maximum usable strength of concrete. As a result, the applicable temperature of using concrete as a thermal storage medium should not exceed 500 °C.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic of molten salt based <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">I</xref>SPG in which the molten serves as TES medium, with permissions requested from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>]. <bold>b</bold> Solid phase concrete SHS based ISPG, with permissions requested from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/43979_2023_52_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p><p id="Par55">In the ISPG system, SHS material is used as the heat storage medium in the CSP system.

Operational results show that the plant can store up to 130 MWh of thermal energy for about a week and keep it constant throughout the charging cycle. Thermo-mechanical energy storage technology that uses thermoelectricity as the main output energy source and stores electrical energy as thermal energy is called Carnot batteries.

After heat exchange the chilled water temperature rises to 11–12 °C and the higher temperature water at the top of the CWS flows through the chiller again. In the discharging, chilled water at 5–6 °C from the CWS flows to the cooling coil of the buildings and then back to the CWS again at low flow rates when dealing with very low cooling load. When the cooling load demand is greater, a single CWS cannot provide sufficient cooling, so a CWS uses fresh water as storage medium which is considered environmentally friendly.

The air for forced heat exchange adopts a parallel air flow group, but the air flow group will generate axial flow around the battery due to the structure during the transportation process. The maximum cell pack temperature is 63 °C when the mass flow rate is 5 g/s, and the temperature decreases to 33.2 °C at a mass flow rate of 75 g/s. According to the temperature uniformity test, the battery pack indicates a uniformity temperature change of about 6 °C at a mass flow rate of 5 g/s, which decreases to about 1.5 °C at 75 g/s, as the air flow speed increases, the cooling performance of the battery group is improved. Using air as a HTF material for EV BTMS can not only dissipate heat at high temperature but also heat the battery pack at low temperature. Ji et al.

For regular shaped square battery packs, Panchal et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">204</xref>] compares the temperature and velocity distribution inside a micro-channel cooling plate placed on a prismatic lithium-ion battery cell using experimental and numerical technologies. The study was performed on water cooling methods at discharge rates of 1C and 2C and at different operating temperatures of 5 °C, 15 °C and 25 °C. Coolant can be used not only as heat release and heat storage medium of battery pack but also as HTF, the results show that the temperature of the microchannel fluid increases with the increase of the discharge rate, and it is experimentally also found that the heat generation at the two poles of the battery is higher than that in the middle of the battery. For the other type cylindrical battery packs, Rao et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">221</xref>] proposed a liquid-based BTMS system based on variable contact surface designed for cylindrical lithium battery packs, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref>a, by changing the size of the contact surface between the aluminum block and the battery pack. The aluminum block is used as a SHS material, which can absorb the heat of the battery pack. The microchannel in the middle of the aluminum block is filled with cold water as a HTF to take away the heat. The results show that the system with variable contact surface is better than the system with constant contact surface considering the system weight and the pump power consumption. When the inlet velocity is 0.05 m/s, the temperature difference decreases by 6%, 14% and 28% with increasing variable contact surface, while the system weight decreases by 20%, 29% and 47%, of these three slopes, the variable contact surface of 3 mm is the best design of the system.

The heat generated by the battery is transferred by the SHS medium aluminum material and exchanges heat with the fluid. The simulation result shows at high discharge rate (2.7C) and low coolant flow rate (0.01 m/s), the maximum temperature rise is kept within 7 K. In addition to the heat conduction, the aluminum material can also be used as a separator to prevent liquid leakage and short circuit.

There is an air/coolant heat exchanger in the system that transfers heat from the coolant side to the air side. In low temperature environments, grid energy can be used to heat the heat storage medium to the required temperature before departure. The heat storage medium can then partially or completely offset heating needs without the use of a power battery. At the same time, the system also has a positive temperature coefficient (PTC) heater. If the heat storage tank is not stored before departure, the coolant can be heated by the PTC and flow into the heat exchanger to heat the air.

Sharifi et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR243">243</xref>] using the first method different kinds of paraffin in gypsum board by immersion method, and showed that the use of paraffin in the building material can increase the maintenance time of indoor thermal comfort and reduced the HVAC energy demand by 17% for a full year which 6% of the heating demand and 35% of the cooling demand.

Studies have shown that the indoor temperature fluctuation (18.5–26.5 °C) of using nano-PCMs in wall panels is smaller than that without nano-PCMs (13–32 °C), and it can also delay the time to reach the peak temperature. Under the requirement of indoor thermal comfort, numerical simulation studies show that the incorporation of nano-PCMs into wall panels reduces energy consumption by 79%. Park et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR206">206</xref>] impregnated a series of PCMs into expanded perlite and vermiculite to prepare EP/EV-gypsum boards in Fig. <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">18</xref>b, and replaced the traditional gypsum boards of Korean standard residential buildings, and carried out circulating water bath tests under Korean climate conditions. The study showed that, the composite PCMs obtained by configuring n-octadecane and n-heptadecane at a mass ratio of 7:3 showed the greatest energy-saving effect when cooled in the thermal comfort range, and the phase transition temperature was 23–24 °C. Although the use of micro-encapsulated PCMs can prevent the leakage and improve thermal conductivity, it still faces problems such as high cost and cumbersome process in practical application. In response to this, the use of a macro-encapsulation PCM is proposed. Ramakrishnan et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">219</xref>] used a numerical simulation method to simulate the addition of macro-encapsulated Bio-PCM™ mat-like PCMs with fatty acids as the main component to the walls and ceilings of a single-storey residential building in Melbourne in summer. Under heat wave conditions, the period of severe discomfort is reduced by 65% reducing indoor thermal stress. The application of PCM to actual construction projects not only needs to consider the requirements of its reliability on the thermal comfort of the indoor environment, but also needs to consider the economic cost. Taking a Chinese city as an example, Mi et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">183</xref>] studied five cities in different geographical locations, and simulated the filling of PCM with a phase transition temperature of 27 °C and a latent heat value of 230 kJ/kg.

During the daytime, the ventilation was operated as a pure cycle to direct the warm room air into the PCM, at night the PCM was regenerated using outdoor air. It is able to reduce the maximum room temperature by 2 °C during the daytime in summer, but cooling at night must take into account the inability of cold air to enter the ceiling for PCM regeneration.

The cold storage process is that when the ambient temperature at night is lower than the phase transition temperature of the PCM, the cooling capacity is carried by an electric fan. When the heat of the PCM is taken away, the PCM solidifies. When the cold energy is released during the day, the hot air in the room exchanges heat with the PCM, and the melting process of the PCM reduces the indoor air temperature. Solar energy, as a renewable energy source, has been used for household daily heating and domestic hot water.

There have been many large-scale industrial applications, carbonates which can store and release the heat through endothermic calcination and exothermic carbonation processes. It can be used as high-temperature thermochemical storage materials. The most common carbonates material is the calcium carbonate, which is in abundance on earth and widely used in power plants due to its low cost and high operating temperature (&gt; 550 °C).

The global storage exergy efficiency and power efficiencies can reach 37.60% and 48.04%, respectively, under optimal operation conditions. However, conventional CaCO<sub>3</sub> pellets suffer from slow reaction kinetics, poor stability, and low solar absorption. To improve the heat storage capacity and enhance the mechanical, optical, and thermal properties of CaL, novel SiC/Mn co-doped CaO particles were prepared by extrusion-spheronization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>].

Those MHs that have been primarily investigated to date for high-temperature energy-storage applications are MgH<sub>2</sub>, TiH<sub>2</sub>, and CaH<sub>2</sub>. Figure <xref rid="Fig26" ref-type="fig">26</xref>b illustrates a CSP plant coupled with an MH-TES system to run the steam power plant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref>]. This system comprises of three sections: solar concentration section, MH-TES system, and steam power plant based on the Rankine cycle. The TES system shown uses LTMH and HTMH. Excess solar energy during the day is stored in HTMH via HTF. HTMH can absorb a large amount of high-temperature solar energy through the endothermic reaction of releasing hydrogen. LTMH, on the other hand, absorbs the hydrogen released by HTMH through an endothermic reaction. The chemical process can be reversed when solar energy is not available and advanced thermal energy is required to run the power plant. The hydrogen stored in the LTMH can flow from the LTMH reactor (using waste heat desorption) to the HTMH reactor for high-grade heat output. The absorption of hydrogen by HTMH results in the generation of high-temperature heat required by steam generators through an exothermic reaction. The biggest problem of using metal hydrides for heat storage is to solve the problem of hydrogen storage. According to the experimental and modeling results, Jensen et al.

Calcium cycle technology uses the carbonation and calcination cycle reaction of CaO to capture CO<sub>2</sub>, which is one of the promising large-scale CO<sub>2</sub> capture technologies. CaL is an attractive reaction that has been extensively studied in CCSU as a means of TCHS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR265">265</xref>].</p><p id="Par123">In recent years, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR266">266</xref>] simulating direct concentrated radiative heating from solar energy sources at the laboratory scale, TCHS and CCUS were experimentally compared using the integration between CSP and CaL, as seen in Fig. <xref rid="Fig30" ref-type="fig">30</xref>a. The results show that under the condition of CaL-TCHS, the heat storage density is in the range of 960–1130 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>. Correspondingly, the energy storage density under CCSU conditions is about 780–960 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>. The energy storage density are all higher than the SHS density of solar energy using molten salts in the range of 290–565 °C. Additionally, the CaL option has better long-term storage stability and higher temperature levels compared to molten salt. The CaL-TCHS is able to guarantee the maximum energy storage density, however, the CaL-CCSU scheme takes full advantage of the overall reduction of the carbon footprint of the integrated process, capturing concentrated CO<sub>2</sub>. To increase the share of renewable energy and reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, Claudio Tregambi et al.

In the end, the plant has an overall efficiency of 20–22%, while capturing carbon dioxide, harnessing renewable energy solar and producing methane from carbon dioxide. Although CaL can be used for both TCHS and CCUS, a significant disadvantage is that at the required high temperature and high partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub>, the sintering of CaO grains leads to gradual deactivation during cycling.
