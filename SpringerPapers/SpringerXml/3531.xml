such a way that the inherent properties of graphene are maintained within material structures or devices. This will involve chemistries for the most part that enable efficient graphene integration with a host polymer, and that result in formulations with rheological properties that allow the use of fabrication tools such as fiber spinning or printing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> This report is a chemist’s perspective on the methods developed for the production of graphene and graphene precursors, their integration into polymers and their fabrication into useful structures.</p><p id="Par13">The impressive properties of this atom-thick sheet of aromatic carbons have created enormous interest in utilizing graphene in a wide variety of areas since Geim and Novoselov first demonstrated the mechanical exfoliation of graphene from graphite using Scotch tape, groundbreaking work that led to their award of the 2010 Nobel Prize in Physics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> Although this and other types of physical methods readily give sheets of graphene that can be used for fabricating various laboratory scale devices, it is chemical exfoliation methods that present the most likely opportunities for large-scale graphene production. As outlined in the resulting large number of reviews produced over the past 5 years, a wide variety of chemical methods for the production of graphene have been developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Reviews on graphene produced by chemical oxidation, the potential of such methods for production and its possible commercial applications have been prepared by Park <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and Kaner and co-workers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> Chemical exfoliation methods for the production of graphene have also been reviewed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> However, chemistries leading to scalable quantities of graphene in a form amenable to subsequent fabrication with or without integration into host polymer structures have not been adequately covered in reviews.</p><p id="Par14">The properties of graphene needed for a specific application require a tailored approach to processing and fabrication. For example, chemical vapor deposition has predominantly been used to produce thin, highly conducting films for electronic/optoelectronics or bioelectronics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> or for optically transparent films.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> Chemically converted graphene (CCG) has been used to form electrodes for energy conversion (solar cells) and storage (batteries/capacitors),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> industrial catalysis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> chemical and bio-sensing applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> as well as polymer composites with improved mechanical and electrical properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> The difference in the kinds of applications suitable for each type of graphene preparation largely reflects the graphene sheet or platelet size produced, with mechanical or thermal exfoliation typically resulting in large single or several layer sheets that are challenging to handle and fabricate into devices, whereas chemical exfoliation produces smaller dispersible platelets that can be more readily processed and produced on a large scale. Chemical processing can also be used to produce large sheets of graphite oxide as stable dispersions. Such dispersions are amenable to fabrication and subsequent reduction to graphene.</p><p id="Par15">Within each of these approaches, there is a wide variety of preparation conditions. The key parameters that influence the steps involved in producing graphene from graphite and the processing as well as fabrication strategies that can be used to produce graphene containing composites or devices will be reviewed here.</p><p id="Par16">The chemical production of dispersible graphenes is generally achieved through oxidation of natural or synthetic graphite to give graphite oxide that must be exfoliated to generate dispersible single sheets of graphene oxide (GO) (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Reduction of this GO dispersion under carefully chosen conditions allows the reformation of the aromatic graphene sheets without aggregation to a graphitic-type multilayered structure. This dispersed chemically converted graphene or CCG can then be utilized to fabricate devices directly or via composite formation. While this approach generally produces an integrated graphenic material that is reasonably defect-free, a more common approach to composite and device formation has been to fabricate composites and devices with GO followed by a reduction step to produce the graphenic material (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). In this regard, the use of highly dispersed liquid crystalline GO (LCGO), a graphene precursor that can be readily processed and fabricated into a wide variety of structures using a number of different 3D fabrication methods, offers significant advantages.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> The LCGO nanoplatelets are more than 10 times larger than the typical GO nanoplatelets affording highly ordered structures in solution and thus more viscous solutions for processing and fabrication. These larger nanoplatelets result from oxidation of natural graphite.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Steps involved in forming graphene composites or devices.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41427_2015_Article_BFam201547_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par17">In the following sections, we discuss the differences in natural and synthetic graphite and the steps necessary to convert them into the graphene, and finally convert them into composites or other devices. We first explore the steps to enable processing and fabrication of the graphene form. Then we discuss the steps involved that enable processing and fabrication of GO, specifically LCGO, dispersions with subsequent reduction to graphene.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Source material: natural vs synthetic graphite</title><p id="Par18">Naturally occurring graphite is a mineral whose morphology can vary from micro-crystalline to macro-crystalline depending on its source and formation conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> It consists of graphitic carbon regardless of its crystalline perfection. The most common source of graphite used for chemical reactions, including its oxidation, is flake graphite, which is a naturally occurring mineral that is purified to remove heteroatomic contamination. The graphite content in the ore from which this material is obtained varies and range from 5 to 98% carbon depending on the source. The purity can be raised to 99.5% carbon, by means of mechanical separation and flotation. In order to achieve purities of &gt;99.9% carbon that are a prerequisite for some applications like batteries, chemical (either acid or alkaline) or high-temperature treatment is required.</p><p id="Par19">In contrast, synthetic graphites are all normally prepared by heating unstructured carbon at temperatures above 2500 °C. For example, Bay Carbon grade SP-1 graphite (Bay Carbon, Inc., Bay City, MI, USA) is obtained by the high temperature treatment of natural graphite. This heat treatment induces order into a graphitic structure and provides the high purity required for some specific applications. The characteristic of the synthetic graphite varies depending on the raw material and the heat treatment process used.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup></p><p id="Par20">The selection of graphite and subsequent processing depends on the final properties of the graphene required. Typically, processable and stable aqueous and organic dispersions of graphene platelets with sheet sizes⩽1 μm are obtained by processing synthetic graphite or high purity micro-crystalline natural graphite using chemical oxidation and mechanical exfoliation route. In contrast, dispersions of larger sheets of GO and LCGO (20–50 μm) can be obtained from macro-crystalline natural graphite.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Chemical intercalation</title><p id="Par21">In order to obtain single carbon layers, graphite must be intercalated to render it susceptible to exfoliation. Graphene layers in natural/synthetic graphite are stacked parallel on top of each other with a separation of 3.35 Å.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> Although attraction between layers is not strong enough to prevent sliding in the direction of the <italic>c</italic> axis, they are sufficient to make it hard to exfoliate them as a single graphene sheet. Overcoming the van der Waals interactions is crucial for separation of the layers to produce single-layer graphene. Increasing the separation between adjacent graphene sheets by intercalation helps achieve this. The most successful strategy to exfoliate graphite is to weaken the van der Waals interactions by chemical intercalation followed by exfoliation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup></p><p id="Par22">Intercalation of graphite can be achieved by exposing it to appropriate atoms or molecules that enter in between the graphene layers to form a graphite intercalation compound (GIC).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> In this complex material, the intercalated compounds form a spacer layer. The number of graphene layers between two intercalated layers is called the stage, which is the most important and characteristic ordering property of GIC. The first report on the synthesis of GIC was in the early 1840s but the first systematic investigations did not begin until after the introduction of X-ray diffraction methods in the early 1930s. However, it was only in the past few decades that the research on GICs has become a field of intense activity in both academia and industry. The synthesis and characterization of GICs has been the subject of several review articles, where a large number of intercalators (&gt;100) are discussed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> Generally, the intercalants can be classified based on their interaction with graphite, whether they form donor compounds such as alkali metals or acceptor compounds such as sulphuric and nitric acids.</p><p id="Par23">Intercalation of graphite with potassium, KC<sub>8</sub>, has been achieved by reacting stoichiometric amounts of potassium with graphite overnight at 200 °C.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> The product which is a bright gold powder was used to produce graphite nanoplatelets on the order of 2–150 nm thickness. The other most common intercalation method, is stirring natural graphite with a mixture of concentrated sulphuric acid and nitric acid (4:1, v/v) for 16 h at room temperature to obtain graphite bisulphate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> Reacting graphite with strong acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) and strong oxidant (KMnO<sub>4</sub>), known as the modified Hummers method, is another common method used to obtain predominantly stage 1 GIC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup> In the graphite bisulphate, the graphite structure remains mainly intact because the guest molecules are only located in between the carbon layers, whereas chemical intercalation with a strong oxidant negatively affects the graphite’s electronic properties as its conjugated sp<sup>2</sup> structure is disrupted. Intercalation is also possible using milder conditions through co-intercalation with iron chloride (FeCl<sub>3</sub>) and nitromethane (CH<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> In this method, iron chloride, a mild oxidant, facilitates the intercalation of nitromethane between the graphite layers without degrading the integrity of the graphene sheet in contrast to the stronger oxidative conditions in which strong acid and oxidant are employed for intercalation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Oxidation of graphite</title><p id="Par24">Chemical intercalation of graphite using strong oxidant to produce graphite oxide is the most common method for graphite intercalation. There have been a wide variety of different approaches reported for the oxidation of graphite including chemical and electrochemical oxidation. Two approaches have been typically used to obtain processable CCG, the most common being the oxidation of graphite to give graphite oxide (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Graphite oxide, after purification is exfoliated to give GO as a stable dispersion and is subjected to reduction to give a CCG dispersion. The use of strong chemical oxidants leads to a high degree of defects in the graphitic structure resulting in a highly oxidized GO. Subsequent selective reduction of GO results in the removal of the majority of basal plane defects with retention of the peripheral anionic functionalities that ensure dispersion of the CCG. Alternatively, careful selective oxidation of graphite using considerably milder oxidation conditions can result in the introduction of just enough anionic functionalities on the graphenic structure to allow dispersion of the CCG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup></p><p id="Par25">The oxidation of graphite reported by Brodie in 1859 and modified by Staudenmaier <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> in 1899 used KClO<sub>3</sub>, nitric acid (&gt;90%) sulphuric acid, and was time consuming and hazardous.

As summarized in <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, a myriad of approaches to graphite oxidation have emerged.
