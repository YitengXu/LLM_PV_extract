id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Worldwide, passenger and freight railway systems are moving together with the broader transportation sector to consider, evaluate, develop, and deploy alternative means of propulsion based on clean energy technologies in efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to continually evolving environmental regulations. Options for electrification and alternative propulsion technologies (i.e., versus diesel and diesel-electric) in railway systems include overhead catenary and third-rail electrification, battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell (or more typically hydrogen hybrid, incorporating fuel cells and batteries) and alternative fuels in combustion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par3">It is important to note that there are already many long-standing overhead catenary (and third-rail) systems in operation, with approximately 25% of the world’s railway lines electrified in this way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This stands in contrast with (for example) passenger road vehicles in which electric vehicles (EVs) remain a relatively new development in mainstream use. Overhead catenary electrification remains the most energy-efficient approach in railways and has locally zero emissions (with net emissions being entirely dependent on the mode of power generation at the electricity plant). However, overhead catenary system deployment (e.g., as a replacement for diesel locomotives) involves substantial up-front investment and as such does not lend itself particularly well to stepwise deployment or use on low-traffic lines that will extend the payback horizon. In the context of this paper, it is also important to note that the fraction of railway lines that are electrified varies widely by geography internationally, with the proportion in North America being particularly small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Battery-electric systems are a more recent development, involving on-train batteries in combination with recharging lines and/or stations. These systems have been enabled by recent developments in nickel- and lithium-based battery technologies, yielding substantial reductions in weight and volume alongside improvements in robustness over many cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Currently, battery-electric systems are at an advantage over hydrogen-based alternatives with respect to maturity, emissions, and total cost of ownership; however, hydrogen hybrid systems have the potential for significantly longer autonomous operating ranges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus far, testing and deployment of battery-electric systems have been largely limited to passenger rail systems; however, testing in the North American freight environment is now underway, particularly on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The FLXdrive battery-electric system deployed on BNSF’s GECX 3,000 locomotive is a lithium-ion cell-based system, expected to deliver 3,275 kW of tractive power, with the capacity to dispatch 2,400 kWh of energy from a full charge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is predicted that the locomotive will be capable of delivering its full tractive output for approximately 30 min, and as such it is anticipated that the locomotive will be used in consist with regular diesel-electric units to deliver power in targeted locations where reduced emissions and noise levels are particularly desirable.</p><p id="Par5">Progress in developing and evaluating hydrogen fuel cell-based approaches for railway systems has largely been enabled by continued advances in the efficiency and energy density of proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). As described later in this paper, these types of systems tend to be deployed in a hybrid arrangement together with battery-electric storage, in order to allow for optimal efficiency in operating the fuel cell-based subsystem. In addition to these fuel cell-based approaches, the development of alternative and blended fuels provides a prospective means to incorporate hydrogen into the locomotive energy spectrum through more traditional combustion-based architectures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This is also discussed in detail in the paper.</p><p id="Par6">Despite these developments, it should be remembered freight rail is already a highly efficient means of transportation, e.g., as measured in terms of fuel consumed per tonne-km. This presents a significant hurdle for newer alternative technologies in demonstrating clear advantages without sacrificing payload efficiency or operating costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Additionally, in the case of hydrail, there is not yet mass-produced hydrogen available for transportation applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and the argument could be made that other (intrinsically less efficient modes of transportation) should be a higher priority for development and deployment. Beyond the technical considerations, however, are many non-technical and human factors that play a highly important role in motivating forward progress.</p><p id="Par7">The remainder of this paper places hybrid, hydrogen, and alternative fuel developments in the general context of North American road and rail transportation systems, followed by a discussion of hybrid and hydrogen-related developments in North American heavy haul freight operations specifically.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Developments in hybrid and hydrogen technologies for transportation systems</title><p id="Par8">This section provides an overview of hybrid and hydrogen propulsion developments in both road and rail transportation systems, mainly focusing on the North American setting. For clarity, this section is subdivided into a discussion on hybrid powertrains, followed by hydrogen fuel cell powertrains (with road and rail transportation covered in each). In practical terms, there is overlap between these subsections as hydrogen fuel cells are often utilized as a subsystem within hybrid powertrain architectures.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hybrid powertrains</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Hybrid powertrains in road transportation</title><p id="Par9">Light-duty vehicles have been the leading application for hybrid powertrains in road transportation. This growth responded to regulatory requirements for low-emission vehicles, slower than expected development of purely electric vehicles, and increasing customer demand to reduce fuel costs through lower fuel consumption. Various manufacturers, led by Honda and Toyota introduced mass-produced HEVs in North America (Honda Insight, 1999; Toyota Prius, 2000). By 2019, HEVs (including plug-in hybrids) accounted for approximately 2.9% of total light vehicle sales, down from a peak of 3.5% in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Full electric vehicles accounted for another 1.5% in 2019, having grown from less than 0.1% in 2010. With 500,000 vehicle sales spread over ~15 different manufacturers and more than 50 different models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], it is clear that HEVs remain a niche market.</p><p id="Par10">Hybrid drive technologies cover a wide range, from integrated starter-generators that avoid idling by stopping the internal combustion engine (ICE) when a vehicle is stationary, to full battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) equipped with a small engine to provide additional battery charging capacity (e.g., BMW I3). A detailed review of light-duty hybrid technology is outside the scope of this paper; however, many good references are available (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). As with many technologies, HEVs experience a typical trade-off between improved efficiency achieved with increased technical complexity vs. increasing capital costs relative to an equivalent non-hybrid light-duty vehicle (in North America, predominantly gasoline-fuelled ICEs).</p><p id="Par11">HEVs are particularly well suited to low-load, transient cycles where there are significant opportunities for energy recovery and where idling and low-speed driving form a significant portion of the total duty cycle. This makes them particularly well suited for light-duty automotive applications, especially in ‘city’ driving. The added vehicle mass from the hybrid system, combined with reduced energy-recovery opportunities, results in a smaller benefit for HEVs in ‘highway’ driving. This is a driving factor behind a relatively low uptake of hybrid drive systems in long-haul commercial trucking, where HEVs have not made significant penetration.</p><p id="Par12">To drive efficiency improvements in long-haul commercial trucking in North America, the US Department of Energy (DOE) partnered with major commercial vehicle OEMs in the SuperTruck program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The first phase, which ran from 2010 to 2015, saw 20 million USD provided to each of four OEMs (Daimler, Cummins, Navistar and Volvo) to investigate technologies to improve “freight efficiency” (ton-miles of freight transported per gallon of fuel consumed) by at least 50% compared to each OEM’s 2009 best-in-class vehicle. All four exceeded the target, with Daimler achieving a 115% improvement, Cummins/Peterbilt 86%, and Volvo 88% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These results equate to fuel consumption reductions between 45% and 55% while transporting an equivalent payload compared to the 2009 baseline. A second phase (SuperTruck 2, 2016–2022) added PACCAR and targets an improvement in “freight efficiency” of 100% relative to that OEM’s 2009 best-in-class vehicle. A key further requirement was that the technologies needed to have commercially viable payback periods of 2–3 years. Technology improvements have ranged from improved engine efficiency to reduced vehicle weight and low-rolling-resistance tires. Of relevance to rail applications, the engine and powertrain technologies have focused on improving engine efficiency, recovering energy from the waste heat in the engine exhaust and cooling system, and the potential to include a hybrid-electric powertrain.</p><p id="Par13">In both SuperTruck programs, hybridization and energy recovery have been a key feature. While more advanced hybridization technologies were evaluated in SuperTruck, it was identified as a long-term technology (5 + years to commercialization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]) that offered limited efficiency gains. A principal factor limiting HEV efficiency for long-haul trucks was that the typical duty cycle involves relatively few opportunities for dynamic energy recovery (regenerative braking). Further limitations include a need for the powertrain to provide near full load for extended durations, limiting the scope for efficiency gains by using a lower peak power ICE. Finally, the added weight of energy storage and electrified drivetrain and associated energy storage negatively impacted both economic viability and payload capability. This agrees with various European studies that concluded that hybridization for long-haul trucking offered limited CO<sub>2</sub> benefit (2%–4% lower, or an equivalent fuel consumption saving) at the highest cost per unit CO<sub>2</sub> saved for all the technologies assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">In SuperTruck 2, all the OEM teams have converged on what would be considered a ‘mild’ hybrid approach. This is based on a 48 V DC electric system with a small (~ 5–15 kWh) battery. Electrification of auxiliaries (e.g., power steering pump, coolant pump, fan, air compressor) combined with an integrated starter-generator (ISG) reduces parasitic load and engine idling. Most are installing the ISG at the power-take-off on the vehicle transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], such that powertrain energy can be recovered, but the ability to apply electric energy directly to the driveshaft is limited. Critically, in all cases, the 48 V system is coupled with waste energy recovery using various exhaust heat recovery systems (primarily organic rankine cycle (ORC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). Estimates suggest that brake thermal efficiency (BTE) improvements of 3–5 percentage points (i.e., 6%–10% reduction in energy use) are possible from these combined systems. As such, they are a key contributor to the total engine system efficiency target for all the teams of 55% peak BTE; of the teams, Cummins/Peterbilt is already claiming 53.5% BTE on the engine system and are projecting to achieve a 170% improvement in “freight efficiency” (i.e., a reduction in fuel consumption exceeding 60%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Most studies in both Europe and North America on hybridization for long-haul transport find that hybrid technology is not sufficiently beneficial. Some European interest in “last-mile” full-electric drive capability remains, primarily in response to restrictions on diesel-fueled vehicles in city centers. More generally, technology in heavy-duty on-road trucking is advancing rapidly, with new trucks from major OEMs on track to achieve “freight efficiencies” 100% better than they were in 2010: these represent a reduction in fuel consumption (and associated CO<sub>2</sub> emissions) on the order of 50%. These are achieved through higher engine fuel economy (peak BTE’s are likely to exceed 50%) and improved vehicle systems. These improvements may pose a substantial challenge to rail, as advances in long-haul trucking efficiency might erode the efficiency benefit that is one of the major advantages of rail transport for goods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Hybrid powertrains in rail transportation</title><p id="Par16">Locomotive hybridization has held a long history within the North American rail industry and has evolved in many forms. A significant example which altered the industry has been the conversion from steam to diesel-electric locomotives which is still the primary means of motive power today [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Notable efforts in hybridization have been employed in order to increase the efficiency of diesel-electric locomotives. Locomotive “gensets” have been developed and employ multiple prime mover (engine) configurations which are activated and deactivated based on power demand. Gensets have been utilized in both yard and road power operations. A configuration utilizing multiple engines of varying power outputs is used to reduce fuel consumption and emissions by matching engine operating and power requirements to actual locomotive duty cycles. This is practical given that switcher and road locomotives in North America are idling between 70% and 80% and using full power between 0.3% and 1.7% of total operating time. Calculated duty cycles by throttle notch (i.e., N1–N8) for switcher and road locomotives are provided in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. <fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Typical diesel-electric road locomotives (two head-end 3,275 kW AC units shown) in mainline usage on Canadian Pacific</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40534_2021_242_Fig1_HTML.jpg" id="MO1"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Calculated duty cycles by throttle notch for switcher and road locomotives in North American freight railway usage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Locomotive</p></th><th align="left"><p>Idle (%)</p></th><th align="left"><p>N1 (%)</p></th><th align="left"><p>N2 (%)</p></th><th align="left"><p>N3 (%)</p></th><th align="left"><p>N4 (%)</p></th><th align="left"><p>N5 (%)</p></th><th align="left"><p>N6 (%)</p></th><th align="left"><p>N7 (%)</p></th><th align="left"><p>N8 (full power) (%)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Switcher</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>80.7</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>7.3</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>6.3</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>3.1</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>1.4</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.5</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.3</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.1</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.3</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Road</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>71.4</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>7.7</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>6.9</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>4.8</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>2.8</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>1.5</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.8</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>0.5</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>1.7</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par17">More recent hybrid locomotives have employed the use of batteries as opposed to increasing the number of onboard diesel engines to balance and support varying power demands. A notable example is known as the “Green Goat” or Railpower GG20B developed in September 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although not designed for high horsepower applications, this locomotive utilizes a diesel generator in unison with a large battery bank to create a total of 1490 kW tractive power which is equivalent to a typical North American locomotive switcher. The locomotive has also been used in local over the road switching operations. The expansion of the GG20B concept using fuel cells and improved battery technology are discussed later in the paper. Also discussed are the challenges in the evolution of hybridization in rail beyond diesel generators which have been primarily limited by several factors including, but not limited to, fuel cells, battery technology, DC/DC conversion and other electrical components.

Some studies have suggested this benefit compared to diesel in medium duty and regional service, even if the H<sub>2</sub> is produced from natural gas via steam methane reforming (SMR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This was mainly due to higher efficiency of FCETs over urban cycles with significant transient operation, where modelling results suggested FCET energy efficiencies were ~1.7 times those of diesel. At loaded cruise (90–105 km/h), the efficiency benefit of FCETs was only ~1.2 times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; although not reported, this likely means an increase in GHGs for long-haul applications if the H<sub>2</sub> is sourced from SMR. This agrees with a European case study, which showed that while FCETs could replace any diesel-powered truck in Switzerland, the GHG impacts depended on H<sub>2</sub> production: renewable, low-carbon sources generated GHG savings, but the use of SMR or grid electricity increased net GHG emissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">H<sub>2</sub> fuelled FCETs remain an emerging technology for on-road goods transport in North America.

Typically, low-fraction blends of biodiesel are the primary focus: blends up to 5% by mass are equivalent to diesel and meet the ASTM D975 diesel fuel specification, while blends between 5% and 20% can be used with minor modifications to engine and fuel systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

To achieve acceptable volumetric energy densities, it is normally stored as cryogenic liquified natural gas (LNG). Potential fuel cost savings have long been recognized (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]); these were a driving factor for Caterpillar and Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) to pursue NG fuelling in 2010–2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

The CI calculated by CARB assumes an ~20% fuel economy penalty for an NG engine compared to an equivalent to diesel, as well as relatively high methane emissions from both engine exhaust and crank-case ventilation. Technologies that more closely match diesel efficiency have been developed, and the most recent NG on-road commercial vehicle engines use closed crank-case ventilation and high-efficiency exhaust catalysts that can reduce vehicle CH<sub>4</sub> emissions by 75% or more compared to the circa. 2010 engines used in the CARB life-cycle analysis.</p><p id="Par30">Substantially greater GHG reductions can be achieved through renewable natural gas (RNG, derived from biological sources such as landfill or manure).

Executives must balance economic factors with research and development initiatives around clean energy. Some of the challenges and motivations within the North American Heavy Haul systems are discussed in the following sections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Motivations for moving to hydrogen and hybrid technologies in North American heavy haul operations</title><p id="Par47">North American Class I railroads are progressively aligning emissions reductions goals to limit climate change with the Paris Agreement. In Canada, Class I railroads are also aligning with the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change. These initiatives seek to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Recent studies suggest that development of hydrogen uses is necessary in achieving these goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>].</p><p id="Par48">Relative to traditional electrification of locomotive propulsion using catenaries and/or third rails, hydrogen fuel cell systems for North American Heavy Haul systems are cited as more cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] with the highest potential for clean energy. Some studies suggest that the initial capital costs of installing catenary systems in North America can exceed 27B USD per railroad (or over 200B USD for all North American railroads) when adjusted to 2020 values. These estimates do not include short lines. Given the capital costs and span of the transcontinental rail networks, overall catenary systems are seen as impractical for heavy haul operations without government subsidies as suggested in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">Factors such as, but not limited to, foreign investment in “green” or “B” corporations, increases in domestic carbon taxes, young workforce interests in green technologies, and adoption of fuel cells by the trucking industry (Alberta Zero Emissions Truck Electrification Collaboration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]), are encouraging North American Class I railways to plan and invest sustainably. In Canada alone, carbon taxes are expected to rise 566% by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. With increasing investor and government pressures, railroads need to adopt greener technologies at accelerated rates.</p><p id="Par50">Fuel reduction technologies to automate operator functions and improve engine components have been developed and implemented for decades within the North American rail industry to create more efficient diesel-fueled locomotives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Although these technologies have improved fuel economies of heavy haul locomotives up to 20%, emissions are still generated due to the use of diesel fuels and internal combustion as the primary means of electrical power generation for propulsion. Due to increasing regulation, alternative means such as hydrogen are required in order to avoid heavy penalties due to emissions generation. These penalties will ultimately result in unsustainable business costs negatively impacting railroad operating ratios.</p><p id="Par51">Improvements in hydrogen fuel cells and batteries have provided promising alternatives to using diesel fuel and combustion. These technologies can also be used to convert existing platforms similar to modernization programs which are ongoing within the industry. Modernizations provide a viable business case for hydrogen versus electrification by enabling railroads the ability to extend sustainable amounts of capital over time through re-use of locomotive cores.</p><p id="Par52">Hydrogen also provides the advantage of similar refueling times as compared to diesel refueling at similar costs. The average cost of diesel fuel within the North American rail industry is 0.71 USD/L, or 2.67 USD per US gallon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. One (1) kg of hydrogen is equivalent to approximately one (1) US gallon (3.78 L) of fossil fuel in energy content. Generation of hydrogen through oil and gas costs approximately 1.00–1.80 USD/kg. As discussed above, hydrogen generation from oil and gas can also be include carbon capture (i.e., “blue” hydrogen) costing 1.40–2.40 USD/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Hydrogen derived through electrolysis using a renewable energy source (i.e., “green” hydrogen) can cost 2 to 3 times per kg versus oil and gas methods; however, these costs are dropping annually. It is important to note that the costs do not include the hydrogen infrastructure that would be needed for deployment in heavy haul operations. However, given the limited number of freight rail terminals, those located near refineries can have practical access to hydrogen through partnerships. Other benefits of moving toward clean energy sources within the industry include but are not limited to decarbonization of urban areas, noise reduction and mobile power sources.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Status and trajectory of hydrogen and hybrid systems in North American heavy haul operations</title><p id="Par53">Development of hydrogen fuel cell-powered locomotives specific to the North American freight rail industry began as early as 1999 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The initial locomotive demonstrators developed for the mining industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] use a non-hybrid architecture consisting of a PEMFC without the use of onboard batteries. Batteries have been incorporated in later design iterations to increase power and range while decreasing refueling times.</p><p id="Par54">Deployments of mining locomotive demonstrators ultimately led into exploration of hydrogen-powered freight locomotives within the North American Class I railways. The first notable project started in 2003, is a “switcher” locomotive built in collaboration between the United States (US) Department of Defense, US Department of Energy, and the BNSF Railway (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Switcher locomotives have been selected for initial fuel cell exploration based on analysis of duty cycles from locomotive event recorder downloads. On average, the power consumption of a switcher locomotive in North American operation is 75 kW (computed over a 20-h interval) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] which aligns with the power output capabilities of fuel cell and battery combinations available on the market in 2003. Line-haul (road power) locomotives require up to 2.5 times more power than switcher locomotives. An important consideration when determining the feasibility of a freight locomotive hydrogen conversion is available space. Given the size versus power output of fuel cells and batteries in 2003, a line-haul locomotive conversion would not have been feasible.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Hydrogen hybrid switcher locomotive (RailPicture.net photo Nathan Zachman)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/40534_2021_242_Fig5_HTML.jpg" id="MO5"/></fig></p><p id="Par55">Advances in power output of fuel cells and batteries versus physical footprint have enabled companies such as Canadian Pacific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>], to explore alternatives to diesel fuel for powering freight line-haul locomotives. The conversion pilot initially targets locomotives which utilize DC-powered traction motors. Unlike switcher locomotives, these motors require significantly higher voltages and currents which increases power management complexity. The main limiting factor in conversions due to the higher voltage and current requirements is revealed through DC-DC converters which are vital components in the power management process. As an example, off-the-shelf DC-DC converters are designed primarily for the automotive industry and regulate voltage on a DC-link (or DC-bus) limited to a maximum voltage output at 850 V and current draw of 400 A in most cases. Larger corporations which specialize in technology integration must integrate using components from other industries such as solar power in order to achieve the power requirements for line-haul locomotives.</p><p id="Par56">Another reason the North American industry is exploring DC-powered line-haul locomotives first is due to internal knowledge. Typically, North American locomotive vendors support locomotives under contract maintenance. These agreements significantly limit the intellectual property (IP) sharing between the locomotive vendors and the associated Class I railroads. There is an abundance of knowledge around DC-powered locomotives in both literature and in the industry, which reduces the learning curve and initial costs for performing conversions. Future partnerships with AC-powered locomotive vendors may exist; however, as described above, there is a greater urgency being placed on the Class I railways for meeting emissions reductions targets. As such, the developments and deployments of these conversions are being driven by the Class I’s.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Summary and conclusions</title><p id="Par57">Transportation systems in general, and railways specifically, are working to evaluate, develop and deploy alternative propulsion technologies in pursuit of improved efficiencies, reduced GHG emissions, and compliance with environmental regulations that are evolving and tightening in response to climate change. In addition, fundamental energy efficiency will remain a competitive factor between transportation modes.</p><p id="Par58">While much of the world’s railway infrastructure is already electrified through overhead catenary or third-rail systems, there are significant portions of railway networks (particularly in North American freight operations) for which this type of electrification is not feasible. Other alternatives to diesel combustion that are being considered for locomotive propulsion in railway systems include battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell hybrid (i.e., hydrail), and alternative fuels including replacements for diesel (such as biodiesel or natural gas), as well as blended fuels in which renewable alternatives are introduced alongside diesel in the combustion process.</p><p id="Par59">Both hybrid powertrains and hydrogen fuel cell-based technologies have seen substantial improvement and development in recent years, driven in part by the fundamental technological platforms (high density batteries, and PEM fuel cells), as well as major projects and market developments in road vehicles (both light-duty passenger and heavy-duty freight). While these developments have helped to narrow the feasibility gap for use in railway systems, the specific and unique challenges associated with heavy haul rail operations require substantial additional development to realize the voltages, currents, powers and torques needed for line-haul deployment.</p><p id="Par60">Alternative fuels provide a wide range of alternatives with respect to the underlying combustion technology, cost, energy density, and net GHG emissions. While energy density remains a fundamental challenge in many cases, there is a good chance that this approach will provide a viable interim solution for both road and rail transportation that helps to meet near-term and long-term emissions reduction targets. Within this domain, blended fuels also provide another approach through which hydrogen might be integrated into locomotive propulsion systems in heavy haul freight rail.</p><p id="Par61">Presently there are battery-electric and hydrogen hybrid prototype systems in active development and evaluation within North American heavy haul railways. In the space of battery-electric drives, BNSF is testing a lithium-ion cell-based system capable of delivering full tractive power for approximately 30 min, which is expected to enable targeted and specific use in reducing emissions and noise. In the domain of hydrogen and hybrid systems, Canadian Pacific is developing a hydrogen fuel cell-based hybrid system for evaluation, integrated into a standard diesel-electric locomotive platform. In the short term, the initiative will make use of a DC traction motor system, allowing for rapid development due to simplicity and an established knowledge base. Depending on the outcomes of initial evaluation, this platform may provide a path toward wider spread development and deployment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Petrunic J, Campbell R, Ludwig B, Gerster C, Hydrail: The future of rail electrification worldwide (2020) Canadian Smart Rail Technology Conference 2020 – CUTRIC, November 23–24, 2020, virtual, online</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zenith</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Isaac</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoffrichter</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomassen</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Møller-Holst</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Techno-economic analysis of freight railway electrification by overhead line, hydrogen and batteries: Case studies in Norway and USA</article-title><source>Proc Inst Mech Eng Part F J Rail Rapid Transit</source><year>2020</year><volume>234</volume><fpage>791</fpage><lpage>802</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1177/0954409719867495</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Thorne R, Amundsen A H, Sundvor I (2020) Battery electric and fuel cell trains: maturity of technology and market status.
