In this article, energy sustainability is described and examined, as are methods and technologies that can help enhance it. As a key component of sustainability, the significance and importance of energy sustainability becomes clear. Requirements to enhance energy sustainability are described, including low environmental and ecological impacts, sustainable energy resources and complementary energy carriers, high efficiencies, and various other factors. The latter are predominantly non-technical, and include living standards, societal acceptability and equity. The outcomes and results are anticipated to inform and educate about energy sustainability, to provide an impetus to greater energy sustainability.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Energy is utilized pervasively to provide energy services of all types. These include the provision of electricity, transportation, lighting, heating, cooling, industrial processes (e.g., refining and manufacturing) and many more. The full life cycle of energy is complex, and includes obtaining energy sources, converting them to useful forms, transporting, distributing, storing energy, and utilizing energy (Karunathilake et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2019</xref>). The services provided by energy allow for good living standards and support societal development.</p><p id="Par3">Most countries today use energy in a manner that is not sustainable (Baleta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2019</xref>). This applies to countries of all kinds (developing, industrialized, etc.) (Kumar and Majid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2020</xref>). Despite this general view, it is observed that wealthy countries appear to be using energy in a manner that is more sustainable today than before 1970. This phenomenon is illustrated in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. For G7 countries, for instance, energy use per capita and real gross domestic product per capita both rose in step by about 60% between 1960 and 1973, but between 1973 and 2015, energy use per capital remained roughly constant while real gross domestic product per capita continued to rise, by roughly 100% (World Bank Group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2021</xref>). These data suggest that energy usage and GDP growth per capita became in part decoupled, implying countries can continue to generate wealth without necessarily using increasing amounts of energy through a higher energy intensity. Note that, as the data in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> are just for the G7 countries, the rest of the world may not follow this behavior. G7 countries have outsourced portions of their heavy industry, which tends to be energy intensive, to developing and recently developed countries (e.g., Mexico). Hence, the net effect globally in terms of reducing energy consumption is likely less that that observed for G7 countries.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Change in energy use and real gross domestic product per capita for G7 countries between 1960 and 2015</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Parameter</p></th><th align="left"><p>1960–1973 (%)</p></th><th align="left"><p>1973–2015 (%)</p></th><th align="left"><p>1960–2015 (%)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Real gross domestic product per capita</p></td><td align="left"><p> + 65</p></td><td align="left"><p> + 95</p></td><td align="left"><p> + 325</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Energy use per capita</p></td><td align="left"><p> + 60</p></td><td align="left"><p>− 2</p></td><td align="left"><p> + 51</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data source: World Bank Group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2021</xref>)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par4">Energy sustainability involves the use of energy during all aspects of its life cycle in a manner that supports the various facets of sustainable development. Energy sustainability is, therefore, a comprehensive concept that reaches beyond the use of sustainable energy resources, and can be viewed as a component of overall sustainability.</p><p id="Par5">A universally accepted definition for energy sustainability does not exist, even though some definitions have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2017a</xref>; Zvolinschi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2007</xref>; Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020a</xref>; Razmjoo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2020</xref>; Suganthi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2020</xref>; Kumar and Majid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2020</xref>). A general definition can perhaps be developed by extending definitions of sustainability or sustainable development. For instance, Kutscher et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2019</xref>) define sustainable energy as energy produced and used in such a way that it “meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” Grigoroudis et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2019</xref>) suggest that “energy sustainability is related with the provision of adequate, reliable, and affordable energy, in conformity with social and environmental requirements.” Nonetheless, defining energy sustainability is challenging due to the multidisciplinary and complex nature of energy sustainability. The present author defines energy sustainability as the provision of energy services for all people now and in the future in a manner that is sustainable, i.e., adequate to meet basic necessities, not unduly environmentally detrimental, affordable by all, and acceptable to people and their communities. Note that the author’s definition has a temporal persistence element, and that it includes communities, which adds a collective element such as can be represented by culture. Note also that the concept ‘basic necessities’ has an element of vagueness as do other aspects of definitions of energy sustainability or overall sustainability. This can be problematic, although it also provides room for interpretation by individual countries or regions. Since overall sustainability is often viewed as the simultaneous attainment of environmental, economic and societal sustainability, it is clear that energy processes affect each these facets of sustainability. This highlights the importance of energy sustainability to sustainability overall. The relevance of these ideas is increasingly in the fore, as many countries and cities are seeking to become more sustainable, and view energy sustainability as a component of this objective.</p><p id="Par6">Notable environmental, economic and societal challenges are associated with energy. These need to be addressed adequately as part of achieving energy sustainability, although the process can be complex and challenging. Some of the notable challenges relate to societal inequities, excessive resource consumption, climate change and the environmental and ecological affects of other emissions, and limited energy affordability. These are made more challenging by the fact that energy prices are skewed by taxes and incentives, and political factors affect energy issues, sometimes greatly. In addition, wealth and living standards as well as population, culture and level of urbanization often vary among countries, further affecting energy sustainability. The challenges are often greater for developing and non-industrialized countries, due to lack of wealth, education, technology and many other factors. The objective of this article is to assist in addressing these challenges, by informing about energy sustainability and enhancing efforts supporting energy sustainability.</p><p id="Par7">It is noted that this extends earlier work by the author, including an effort to develop a pragmatic approach to energy sustainability with relevant illustrations (Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2009</xref>). The first illustration considers a thermal energy storage that receives and holds heat (or cold) until it is required, while the second assesses a heat pump that uses electricity to extract heat from a low-temperature region and to deliver it to a region of higher temperature for heating. The third illustration is cogeneration of thermal and electrical energy as well as trigeneration of electricity, heat and cold, while the final illustration considers hydrogen production based on thermochemical water decomposition driven by nuclear or solar energy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Energy</title><p id="Par8">Energy resources are obtained from the environment. Some energy resources are renewable and some are finite in quantity and thus non-renewable. Energy systems in most countries today are principally driven by fossil fuels, but renewable energy utilization is increasing (Karunathilake et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2019</xref>; Hansen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2019</xref>; Mehrjerdi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2019</xref>; Kumar and Majid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2020</xref>). Renewable energy resources are listed with details on the main basis from which they are derived in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, while non-renewable energy resources grouped by resource type are given in Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Data from the IEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2021</xref>) on global production of the energy resources are also provided for the most significant resources in terms of quality. It is seen that many types of renewable energy are derived from solar energy, including hydraulic, biomass, wind and geothermal energy (as ground energy at ground temperature) (Rosen and Koohi-Fayegh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2017</xref>). Constraints on long-term energy supplies help to determine the sustainability of the energy resources and have been discussed by Weisz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2004</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Renewable energy resources</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Energy resource</p></th><th align="left"><p>Main basis</p></th><th align="left"><p>Global production in 2018 (ktoe)<sup>a</sup></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Solar radiation (beam and scattered)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Solar energy (direct)</p></td><td align="left"><p>90,048 (includes other solar derived resources, except where listed separately)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Hydraulic</p></td><td align="left"><p>Solar energy (indirect)</p></td><td align="left"><p>362,332</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Wind</p></td><td align="left"><p>Solar energy (indirect)</p></td><td align="left"><p>196,329</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Wave</p></td><td align="left"><p>Solar energy (indirect)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Very small, but included under solar radiation where measured</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Ocean current</p></td><td align="left"><p>Solar energy (indirect)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Very small, but included under solar radiation where measured</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Ocean thermal</p></td><td align="left"><p>Solar energy (indirect)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Very small, but included under solar radiation where measured</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Biomass (utilized slower than it is regenerated)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Solar energy (indirect)</p></td><td align="left"><p>1,324,214 (biofuels and waste)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Geothermal (ground source)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Solar energy (indirect)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Included in geothermal (high temperature)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Geothermal (high temperature)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Heat generated deep within the earth</p></td><td align="left"><p>2062</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Tidal</p></td><td align="left"><p>Gravitational forces between earth and moon</p></td><td align="left"><p>Very small</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Data source: IEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2021</xref>)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Non-renewable energy resources</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Energy resource type</p></th><th align="left"><p>Energy resource</p></th><th align="left"><p>Global production in 2018 (ktoe)<sup>a</sup></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Fossil fuels</p></td><td align="left"><p>Natural gas</p></td><td align="left"><p>3,293,124</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left"><p>Oil</p></td><td align="left"><p>4,552,548</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left"><p>Coal</p></td><td align="left"><p>3,893,679 (includes peat and oil shale)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left"><p>Other fossil fuels (oil sands, oil shales)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Included in coal</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left"><p>Fossil fuel alternatives (oil sands, peat, wood)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Included in coal</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Nuclear energy</p></td><td align="left"><p>Uranium (for fission reactors)</p></td><td align="left"><p>706,814</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left"><p>Plutonium (for fission reactors)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Very small</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left"><p>Other nuclear fuels (for fission reactors)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Very small</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left"><p>Fusion fuels (tritium, etc.)</p></td><td align="left"><p>Very small</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Biological matter-based fuels</p></td><td align="left"><p>Biomass (utilized faster than it is regenerated)</p></td><td align="left"><p>1,324,214 (biofuels and waste)</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left"><p>Wastes</p></td><td align="left"><p>Included in biomass</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left"><p>Peat</p></td><td align="left"><p>Included in biomass</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"/><td align="left"><p>Wood</p></td><td align="left"><p>Included in biomass</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>Data source: IEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2021</xref>)</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par9">Energy carriers are the forms of energy that are utilized in processes and systems, and include fuels, electricity and heat (Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2018</xref>).

Sustainability is often viewed as multidimensional with economic, social and environmental facets (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Achieving sustainability is a challenge as these three facets are often opposing, e.g., economic sustainability may necessitate sacrificing environmental sustainability, and vice versa. Jose and Ramakrishna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2021</xref>) point out the multidisciplinary nature of sustainability in their assessment of the comprehensiveness of research in the field.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par13"><bold>Carrying capacity</bold>. Sustainability can be considered in terms of carrying capacity, i.e., the maximum population supportable, given the ability of the environment to provide resources and receive wastes. This involves an environmental perspective, but is focused more on limitations. The demand and supply of resources affects carrying capacity significantly. For example, Park et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2020</xref>) have evaluated the carrying capacity as a measure of sustainability, for Jeju Island, South Korea.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par14"><bold>Temporal</bold>. Sustainability is usually understood as temporally lasting. The temporal scale to be considered is subjective, although a period of 50–100 years is fairly often viewed as reasonable for many sustainability considerations (Graedel and Allenby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2010</xref>). Yet, this time frame can be disputed, especially for energy issues that can straddle centuries or more. For example, the lifetimes in terms of reserve base for fossil fuels have been estimated to be 51 years for oil, 53 years for natural gas and 114 years for coal, based on annual consumption rates (BP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>). Thus coal-burning could be viewed as sustainable for the next 100 years or so based on the available resources, but then they would be practically exhausted clearly making them coal use not sustainable (and that is not considering the pollution and climate change effects from coal combustion). This contrasts with solar and wind energy, which have no date to exhaustion (until the sun ‘dies’ through running out of hydrogen, in about 5 billion years). Clearly, too short a period for evaluating sustainability is not helpful since most activities are sustainable for years, but too long a period is intractable.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par15"><bold>Goals</bold>. Sustainability can be described in terms of aims or goals.

Adopted at the 70th Session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2015, the UN Sustainable Development Goals form part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

These effects and others have recently been quantitatively assessed (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020b</xref>). By disrupting the earth–sun–space energy balance, these emissions lead to increases in mean global temperatures and consequential changes in climates.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an effective methodology for analyses (Graedel and Allenby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2010</xref>). LCA has been applied extensively to a broad range of activities (Ben-Alon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2019</xref>; Lodato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020</xref>; Lu and Halog <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2020</xref>), including energy processes (Sadeghi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2020</xref>; Mendecka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2020</xref>) and communities (Karunathilake et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sustainable Energy Resources and Complementary Energy Carriers</title><p id="Par28">Sustainable energy resources are crucial to energy sustainability, as are complementary energy carriers that allow those energy resources to be exploited or facilitate sustainable energy options. On the one hand, fossil fuels (see Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), the most common non-renewable energy resources, are finite in nature. On the other hand, renewable energy sources, including solar, hydraulic, wind, biomass, and geothermal energy (see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), can be sustained for extremely long. Renewable energy resources also mitigate greatly or avoid greenhouse gas emissions, among other advantages. Some special cases are worth noting:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par29">Uranium (nuclear energy fuel) is a non-renewable energy resource but it does not contribute significantly to climate change, and the lifetimes of nuclear fuel assuming their use in advanced breeder reactors is thought to exceed 1000 years, so it is often viewed as a sustainable energy option (Al-Zareer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020a</xref>). For example, Fetter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2009</xref>) estimated the extraction of uranium from seawater would make available 4.5 billion metric tons of uranium, representing a 60,000-year supply at present usage rates, while fuel-recycling fast-breeder reactors could match today’s nuclear output for 30,000 years, based on data of the Nuclear Energy Association (NEA). But this is contentious, as these very long nuclear fuel lifetimes remain hypothetical, while current actual nuclear power plants consume uranium at a much faster rate relative to reserves, in the process generating significant amounts of waste with half-lives that are significantly longer than 1000 years. The supply was estimated at 230 years in 2009 (Fetter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2009</xref>), based on identified uranium resources of total 5.5 million metric tons and an additional 10.5 million metric tons still undiscovered and the consumption rate at that time. Moreover, only very few nuclear plants are “fast breeder reactors”.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par30">Biomass may or may not be considered a renewable energy option, depending on its rates of utilization and replenishment. Regardless of the classification, decisions on using various types of biomass depend on both their costs (in terms of energy use quantity and rate, net quantity of carbon used, economics), and their benefits (net quantity of carbon emissions avoided, financial savings, etc.). The potential for biomass use to be sustainable often includes energy return on investment (EROI), which is the ratio of the amount of usable energy delivered from a particular energy resource to the amount of energy used to obtain that energy resource (Hall et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2014</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2021</xref>). This value has ranged from 0.64 (below the breakeven value of 1) for early biomass uses for producing ethanol to as high as 48 for some particular processes involving molasses, and typical values today are 4–5. Biomass is generally not sustainable when EROI values are near or below 1. In addition, it is noted that biomass typically has a low-energy conversion efficiency (relative to values for fossil fuels) and its production sometimes displaces food production, reducing in those cases its prospects as a sustainable energy resource.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31">Wastes, which can include some forms of biomass, are sometimes viewed as a renewable energy resource and sometimes are not, given people can modify behaviors to reduce wastes greatly.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par32">Much research on energy resources has been reported, including electricity generation from food waste through anaerobic digestion (Ali et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2019</xref>; Rezaie and Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2020</xref>) and hydroelectric generation (Udayakumara and Gunawardena <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2018</xref>), and solar energy applications (Hachem-Vermette et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2019</xref>; Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2019</xref>).

Before they can be utilized, energy resources often require conversion to other energy forms or carriers, e.g., solar photovoltaic panels to produce electricity for renewable energy resources, petroleum refineries for non-renewable energy resources, and hydrogen production from both types of energy resources. The latter example supports the idea of a hydrogen economy, in which hydrogen and electricity are the two main energy carriers (Scott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2007</xref>; Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2017b</xref>; Gnanapragasam and Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2017</xref>; Moharamian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2019</xref>; Abe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2019</xref>; Endo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>; Fonseca et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>; Chapman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>; Al-Zareer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020a</xref>; Mehrjerdi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2019</xref><bold>)</bold>.

High efficiency supports energy sustainability by expanding the benefits of energy technologies, whether renewable or not, although the benefits are more pronounced for non-renewable energy resources. High efficiency elongates the lives of finite-energy resources and lowers the capacities needed for energy devices. High efficiencies often can improve societal metrics such as standard of living, quality of life, and satisfaction. For instance, the US and Sweden have similar gross domestic products (per capita), but the latter exceeds the US in most social indicators and utilizes 40% less energy (per capita) through more efficient buildings, smaller automobiles and better public transit, and higher gasoline taxes (Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2018</xref>). Advanced methods are available to help attain high efficiencies, e.g., exergy analysis provides insights not available via conventional energy methods (Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2012</xref>; Dincer and Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2021b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>) and has been applied widely (Morosuk and Tsatsaronis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2019</xref>; Sciubba <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2019</xref>; Veiga and Romanelli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2020</xref>; Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Economic Sustainability and Affordability</title><p id="Par41">Energy sustainability necessitates that the energy services required for basic needs be economically affordable by most if not all people and societies (Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2011</xref>). However, the economics of energy sustainability measures usually need to be reasonably competitive with conventional approaches to find acceptance and adoption, although it is noted that some efficiency measures, like some environmental impact mitigation measures, can over time sometimes pay for themselves or save money. Government incentives also can enhance affordability.</p><p id="Par42">Of course, many other factors affect economic sustainability and affordability. First, the economic “externalities” associated with fossil fuel combustion, i.e., the environmental costs that are not accounted for in the cost of production, are normally not counted. When externalities are properly accounted for, the economics improve for non-polluting energy forms such as wind and solar, and can become more favorable than the economics for fossil fuels. For example, Bielecki et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>) show that the costs of externalities for fossil fuels and peat are typically 10–100 times greater than those for sustainable energy forms such as hydraulic, solar, wind, biomass and nuclear. Furthermore, economies of scale are an important factor in lowering economic costs, thereby making energy sources more sustainable. In addition, the economics of energy often fluctuates in response to energy resource scarcity or abundance, political instability for the case of finite-energy resources such as oil, natural gas, and uranium. Finally, the intermittency of some renewable energy forms such as wind and solar can raise their costs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Others</title><p id="Par43">Other needs exist for energy sustainability and need to be addressed, and a great number of these are non-technical.

This involves trade offs. Concerns about energy access developed and developing countries raises issues of fairness and other trade offs, e.g., is it reasonable for countries that became wealthy in large part through extensive use of fossil fuels to ask developing and poorer nations to forego the use of fossil fuels and to use more sustainable energy forms, even if the costs are higher.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45"><bold>Increasing population, energy demands and living standards.</bold> Increasing global population must be accounted for in energy sustainability measures and strategies, as it places stresses on the carrying capacity of the planet and the environment.

Energy sustainability can be assisted by measures involving transformations in lifestyles and reductions in energy demands, although this is usually very challenging in general and especially for policy makers.

Appropriately high-efficiency devices and systems facilitate and contribute to energy sustainability, e.g., heaters, chillers and air conditioners, pumps and compressors, motors and fans, and lighting have higher efficiencies today than in the past, the latter due to more efficient bulbs, lower lighting intensities, task lighting, and lighting occupancy sensors. Efficiency can also be improved by preventing losses, e.g., with better insulation, and by recovering energy wastes, e.g., by waste heat recovery.</p><p id="Par53">Exergy analysis and other advanced tools can support energy sustainability. Thermodynamic performance can be better assessed, improved and optimized with exergy analysis rather than energy analysis, since the former evaluates more meaningful efficiencies and better pinpoints inefficiencies. Based on exergy, a measure of energy usefulness or quality or value (Dincer and Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2021b</xref>), exergy methods have been applied increasingly in recent years (Dincer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2017</xref>; Moharamian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2019</xref>). In addition, quality matching of energy supply and demand can also support energy efficiency. It is usually more efficient to supply an energy quality better matched to energy demand instead of supplying an exceedingly high-quality energy form, and thus having a quality mismatch, a result well illustrated with exergy analysis. For example, supplying heating for aquaculture at 20 °C with a natural gas combustor capable of heating to 1000 °C is mismatched compared to using simple solar thermal collectors operating at 40 °C.</p><p id="Par54">Governments can also apply incentives (technically and/or societally directed) and enforcement activities to support energy measures.

Of course the methods can be applied to technologies, but the focus of the prior section was on methods and techniques.<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Selected technologies for enhancing energy sustainability</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41748_2021_217_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p><p id="Par56">Utilizing renewable energy sources (e.g., hydraulic, solar, wind, geothermal, biomass, wave, tidal and ocean thermal energy) can contribute to energy sustainability, as they can be sustained for long time periods and have low environmental emissions and impacts. These sources have been extensively investigated, e.g., the amplitudes and phases of tides near power stations (Madah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2020</xref>) as well as the impacts of potential sea-level rise on tides (Lafta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020</xref>). Energy storage can also support energy sustainability, in part by offsetting the intermittency of some renewable energy resources (Krishan and Suhag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2019</xref>). Energy storage can also store energy until it is economic to deploy, and enhance efficiency and energy management (Al-Zareer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020b</xref>). There are various types of energy storage (Koohi-Fayegh and Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2020</xref>), including thermal energy storage (Dincer and Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2021a</xref>), underground storage using borehole heat exchangers (Sliwa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2019</xref>) and batteries (Al-Zareer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020b</xref>). Energy storage is increasingly being employed in building and HVAC systems (Dincer and Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>), and in renewable energy systems involving hybrid energy schemes (Rekioua <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2020</xref>) and microgrids (Al-Ghussain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par57">Integrated energy systems, based on renewable and/or non-renewable energy technologies, can enhance energy sustainability and efficiency, e.g., polygeneration systems (Rosen and Koohi-Fayegh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2016</xref>; Calise et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2019</xref>; Rokni <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2020</xref>; Mendecka et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2020</xref>; Kasaeian et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>), and linking separate systems advantageously such as in cascading energy systems (Campana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2019</xref>; Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2020</xref>; Rokni <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par58">Building energy systems can be modified to enhance energy sustainability, e.g., using active systems such as renewable energy resources and passive technologies such as Trombe walls, multiple glazing windows and selective window coatings, daylight harvesting, insulation, weatherstripping and caulking. Note that behavior, culture and lifestyle also can affect the success of energy efficiency measures in buildings, as was illustrated for China (Zhang and Wang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2013</xref>). Energy sustainability can also be enhanced via district energy systems, in which thermal energy can be generated in heating or cooling facilities, using renewable energy or conventional resources, and transported to users. District energy systems are used in many cities and traverse a wide range of distances (Rosen and Koohi-Fayegh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2016</xref>). Buildings in many cities are connected through district energy systems that provide space and water heating and space cooling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Illustration</title><p id="Par59">In this illustration, we consider net-positive energy buildings. A net-positive energy building over an average year generates more energy from renewable energy sources than it uses, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, and can support energy sustainability (Rosen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2015</xref>; Endo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2019</xref>; Delavar and Sahebi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>; Tumminia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2020</xref>; Singh and Das <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2020</xref>). A net-positive energy building uses energy for a variety of tasks and generates energy from various renewable energy resources, and achieves net-positive energy status through advanced design and exploitation of technologies such as advanced automation, controls, component integration, energy storage, lighting and HVAC. One of the main upcoming “other energy uses” for electricity in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> will likely be for vehicle energy (e.g., for electric automobiles). Such utilization of energy is likely to prove both cost effective and environmentally friendly. A net-positive energy building generates more electrical plus thermal energy from renewable energy sources than it uses over an average year, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>. Such buildings are net energy generators, rather than net energy users, like most buildings today. Research on net-zero and net-positive energy buildings has been reported (Athienitis and O’Brien <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2015</xref>; Mehrjerdi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2019</xref>; Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2019</xref>), while the International Energy Agency included an annex on “Towards Net-zero Energy Solar Building” and Canada launched in 2011 the Smart Net-zero Energy Buildings Strategic Research Network (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.solarbuildings.ca" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.solarbuildings.ca</ext-link>). The net-zero and net-positive energy building concepts can be expanded to include transportation devices that are part of the building (Garmsiri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2016</xref>; Sun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2019</xref>) and to net-zero and net-positive energy communities (Rad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2017</xref>; Hachem-Vermette et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2019</xref>; Karunathilake et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2019</xref>; Nematchoua et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2021</xref>).<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Net-positive energy building, in which energy generation from renewable energy resources exceeds energy use over a typical year</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41748_2021_217_Fig8_HTML.png" id="MO8"/></fig><fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 9</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Imbalance of a net-positive energy building, highlighting how energy use over a typical year is less than energy generation from renewable energy resources</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41748_2021_217_Fig9_HTML.png" id="MO9"/></fig></p><p id="Par60">As a numerical example that correlates with the qualitative presentation in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, a performance assessment by Zomer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2020</xref>) of PV systems installed at a positive energy building is considered here. The building is the Fotovoltaica/UFSC solar energy laboratory (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.fotovoltaica.ufsc.br" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.fotovoltaica.ufsc.br</ext-link>) in Florianópolis, Brazil (27° S, 48° W). Although originally designed as a zero-energy building with PV systems on rooftops and façades, additional PV systems were installed on the same location on a carport and an electric bus (eBus) shelter and charging station, and ground-mount PV systems with single-axis solar tracking installed. The system then had a peak PV generation capacity of 111 kW. Energy generation and consumption were analyzed on monthly bases, and the key results are listed in Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>. The total PV generation in the period could supply 97% of the building (including eBus) energy consumption, accounting for actual performance and downtime for R&amp;D activities. In that case, the building was almost a net-zero energy building (for which the energy supply would meet 100% of the consumption). However, when the systems operate all the time at their optimal performance, the PV system can supply 134% of the building (including eBus) energy consumption, making it a positive energy building.<table-wrap id="Tab7"><label>Table 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Energy generation and consumption for Fotovoltaica/UFSC solar energy laboratory</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>System operation mode</p></th><th align="left"><p>Ratio of energy generation from PV system to building energy need (including eBus)</p></th><th align="left"><p>Status regarding net energy use</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Actual over test period, including downtime events (for research activities)</p></td><td align="left"><p>0.97</p></td><td align="left"><p>Near net-zero energy building</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Optimal performance all the time</p></td><td align="left"><p>1.34</p></td><td align="left"><p>Positive energy building</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par61">Energy sustainability is described, with a focus on environmental perspectives, as are methods and technologies to enhance it. In essence being a key component of sustainability, the significance and importance of energy sustainability becomes clear. Requirements to increase energy sustainability are discussed, including low environmental and ecological impacts, sustainable energy resources and complementary energy carriers, high efficiencies, low environmental impacts, and various other predominantly non-technical factors. The latter include living standards, societal acceptability and equity. Interrelations among these are examined. Examples and illustrations are described that help to indicate the benefits of enhancing energy sustainability. The illustrations also indicate the complexity of energy sustainability and the factors that contribute to it, showing how challenging it can be to enhance energy sustainability. Net-positive energy buildings in particular illustrate the benefits and challenges. The outcomes and results serve to inform and educate about energy sustainability, to provide an impetus to move people in particular and civilization in general towards it.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The author is grateful for support provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and the contributions
