CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> and mixed halide variants, have recently become a commercially relevant material for photovoltaic (PV) and light emission applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. With photovoltaic solar to electrical power conversion efficiencies (PCE) surpassing 20% on laboratory-type cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, they are already promising to emerge as a close competitor to crystalline silicon solar cells. Easy fabrication of polycrystalline perovskite thin films with high crystallinity has been central to the rapid advancement of the solar cell performance. However, there still remains much scope for further improvement since there exists significant heterogeneity in the polycrystalline films<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, and little is known about the defect chemistry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Impurities and defects introduced during the fabrication process could potentially act as non-radiative recombination centres and subsequently harm the photophysical properties of the perovskite films. High-performance semiconductor devices generally require high purity and low-defect materials to deliver the best performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Passivation of electronic defects at grain boundaries has been central to the advancement of thin-film solar technologies based on copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> and CdTe<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, in addition to polycrystalline silicon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. The energetic potential barrier at perovskite grains has been shown to be low, in the region of thermal energy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, recent reports of large crystalline domains delivering enhanced charge-carrier lifetimes point towards the detriment of grain boundaries and grain surfaces are additionally likely to be the source of mobile ionic species responsible for hysteresis in the solar cells current-voltage curves<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. More recently still, deQuilettes <italic>et al</italic>. have examined polycrystalline perovskite thin films and observed fast photoluminescence (PL) quenching at grain boundaries, which is attributed to a large densities of non-radiative centres in these regions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. If we compare polycrystalline thin films to single crystals of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>), then single crystals grown very slowly from solution have been shown to have defect densities of as low as 10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>10</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup>. In comparison, polycrystalline thin films general have defect densities in the order of 10<sup>16</sup> cm<sup>−3</sup> indicating much room for improvement<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. We do note that provided the defect density is lower than the density of free carriers generated under photovoltaic operation under sunlight, their impact on the electronic operation will be minimal. However, this is likely to require reducing the density to the order of 10<sup>14</sup> or lower in the polycrystalline thin films. Hence understanding what parameters in the film preparation influence defect generation, and what means can be devised to reduce defect density will be central to advancing the performance and large-area reproducibility of perovskite solar cells.</p><p id="Par4">To date, several techniques have been developed for making perovskite thin films including one-step solution coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, sequential deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, vapour phase deposition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> or any combination thereof<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Among these, one-step solution coating is relatively advantageous, since it relies on inexpensive deposition equipment and is versatile on controlling the deposition conditions and the composition of perovskite materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, fabrication of the perovskite thin films is greatly influenced by the composition of precursor solution since the excess organic compound or the by-products generated during the perovskite crystallization may directly or indirectly influence the crystallization kinetics and also the as-crystallized film morphology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Several techniques have been established to improve the perovskite thin-film morphology by introducing additives in the precursor solution, such as methylammounium chloride (MACl)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The role of these additives has been mainly attributed to tuning the crystallization kinetics, whilst their effect on the stoichiometric composition and defect density of perovskite films remains unclear. Our recent work also demonstrated that the crystallization kinetics could be easily tuned by replacing conventional lead halide (lead iodide or lead chloride)-based precursor with lead acetate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>, and ‘ultrasmooth’ and pin-hole free perovskite thin films are easily obtained without use of any further additives or post treatment, leading to improved device performance in the planar heterojunction architecture.</p><p id="Par5">In addition to the perovskite thin-film morphology, recent reports have shown that the perovskite solar cell performance is very sensitive to the stoichiometry of organic halide/lead salt, due to the presence of colloids, rather than a true solution, in the starting salt/solvent mixture<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This latter observation adds a further level of complexity to the single-step solution coating method for producing perovskite thin films, since the nature of the final film is not only sensitive to the casting and curing conditions, but may already be largely predetermined by the nature of the colloids in the precursor solution. It is also well known that organic iodides such as methylammonium iodide (MAI), are hygroscopic, not very stable in air and under light irradiation, especially after long-term storage, with the instability attributed to the oxidation of I<sup>−</sup> into I<sub>2</sub> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>). When it is used to prepare perovskite precursor solution, the accurate stoichiometric ratio of organic halide to lead salt may not be achieved, which will potentially introduce defects in perovskite material and can be detrimental to device performance. In addition, if there exist polyiodide complexes ([PbI<sub>4</sub>]<sup>2−</sup>, [PbI<sub>5</sub>]<sup>3−</sup> or [PbI<sub>6</sub>]<sup>4−</sup>) and/or colloids in the starting solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, then the precise complex and colloid thereof may be extremely sensitive to the stoichiometry of the I/Pb in solution and we could envisage that halide vacancies or other defects induced by non-stoichiometry could be ‘locked in’ to the material, even from solution. Furthermore, during the crystallization on heating, oxidization of I<sup>−</sup> may occur, which could result in the generation of bulk defects within the crystal. The best way to address this issue would be to use extremely pure MAI by avoiding any light, heat and moisture exposure. In addition I<sup>−</sup> ions in aprotic solvent, under oxidizing conditions, may form I<sub>2</sub> in the precursor solution, introducing another source of violation in I/Pb stoichiometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Taking note of the above considerations, here we show the addition of a strong reducing agent, hypophosphorous acid (HPA), which is commonly added as a stabilizer in commercial hydroiodic acid (HI) solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> into the precursor solution in an attempt to retard such oxidation of iodide. We demonstrate that the resultant CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite films have greatly enhanced emissive properties by reducing the non-radiative recombination centres. This additive however does not appear to be present in the perovskite crystal after the crystallization process, but simply assists in the crystallization of high quality perovskite thin films, leading to a substantial increase in the PL quantum efficiency (PLQE) and subsequently greatly improved solar cell performance and reproducibility.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Morphological and crystallographic characterization</title><p id="Par7">In this work we employed the lead acetate trihydrate (PbAc<sub>2</sub>·3H<sub>2</sub>O) based precursor route, which is processed from a 3:1 molar ratio of MAI:PbAc<sub>2</sub>·3H<sub>2</sub>O, as we have previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In contrast to our previous work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> where we employed lab-made MAI, here we employed commercially available MAI to ensure a high level of purity in the starting material and easier reproducibility for others. Concerning the lab-made MAI, we have noticed that significant differences in perovskite film formation and crystallization exist depending upon which batch of MAI is employed, and precisely how the MAI has been synthesized and purified. For our previous ‘standard’ lab-made MAI we found best solar cell results were obtained if the MAI was dried, but not purified via recrystallization following the synthesis. This indicates that an ‘impurity’ may be present in the as-synthesized MAI which could have a beneficial influence upon the crystallization and optoelectronic properties of the perovskite. As a means to investigate the impurities present in the MAI we performed X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on recrystallized and as-synthesized MAI. We show the XPS spectra in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1364">supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, where we can observe a trace signal of phosphorous. MAI is synthesized by mixing MA with HI, and a stabilizer present in the HI is the reducing agent, HPA. Hence HPA is a likely culprit for the phosphorous signal.</p><p id="Par8">We therefore investigate whether adding the reducing agent, HPA, to the perovskite precursor solution can have a beneficial influence on the as deposited perovskite films when employing purified MAI. Below we perform a morphological and crystallographic characterization of the perovskite thin films obtained from the perovskite precursor solution with and without HPA (control).</p><p id="Par9">In <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a,b</xref> we show the SEM images of the perovskite thin films. We observe that both samples show full coverage on the substrate with the absence of pin-holes. From the high-magnification images which we show in the insets, the perovskite grain size appears to be significantly enlarged by the addition of HPA, increasing from an average value of 168 to 769 nm for control and HPA-modified samples, respectively.

However, it is still not clear as to how this is occurring. This reduction in defect density could either be due to the enlarged perovskite grain domains and hence a reduction of the defect density by simply reducing the grain boundary density, or by reducing the density of non-radiative recombination sites, which could be present within the bulk or at the surface of each grain, or at the grain boundaries.</p><p id="Par16">From the SEM images, we know that the grains do enlarge when the films are processed with HPA, but to further elucidate the microstructural changes controlling the photophysical properties, we use fluorescence microscopy to spatially resolve the PL intensity and PL decay dynamics. In <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref> we show a 10 × 10 μm confocal fluorescence image of a control film. In the image histogram (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3b</xref>) we observe a fairly narrow distribution of uniformly dark domains (average PL counts ∼2,800). We measured the local time-resolved PL decay curves of three different regions (red square, green triangle and blue circle in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a,b</xref>) of the film and observe fast PL dynamics across these separate regions (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3c</xref>). We also collected a fluorescence image of a 10 × 10 μm area of a film processed with HPA (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d</xref>) under the same excitation fluence and in contrast, we observe an order of magnitude higher average PL intensity (average PL counts ∼26,000), a larger distribution of PL intensities (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>), and slower recombination kinetics (<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>). Interestingly, we observe two distinct sets of domains in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3e</xref>. As we show clearly in the histogram in <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3f</xref>, grains falling under the dark tail of the distribution (blue circle, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d,e</xref>) have the fastest PL decay, grains close to the centre of the distribution (green triangle, <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3d,e</xref>) have a slightly slower PL decay, which explains the fast component observed in the macroscopic PL, and the bright regions (red square) have the slowest decay.

The slightly faster microscopic PL decays compared with the macroscopic PL decays can be attributed to the differences in excitation fluences. We interpret these measurements as indicative of non-radiative recombination sites within the perovskite films being reduced by processing with HPA, but cannot identify if this preferentially reduces sites within the grains, at their surfaces or boundaries. We note that there exists significant heterogeneity in the PL from the HPA-processed films, indicating that the HPA is not necessarily a remedy for this specific issue, or that our processing routine here has not enabled the HPA to homogeneously enhance the perovskite film, clearly there remains much scope for further improvement.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Fluorescence microscopy analysis.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A 10 × 10 μm fluorescence image (FI) of a control perovskite film on glass and (<bold>d</bold>) a perovskite film formed with HPA additive.

This is consistent with defects responsible for non-radiative recombination predominately existing at the surfaces and grain boundaries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. To bring more clarity on the nature of the non-radiative recombination sites here, we performed kelvin probe based measurements to acquire surface photovoltage of both control and HPA-processed perovskite films coated on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass.</p><p id="Par18">We performed Kelvin probe measurements under dark and light condition (at different light intensities) to gauge the band bending near the surface of the perovskite film. We show a schematic band diagram for the generation of surface photovoltage at the perovskite surface in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>. When the trap states are spatially located at the surface of a semiconductor thin film, accumulation of a particular type of charge can occur on the surface of the material. If the surface states are of acceptor type, then they are neutral when empty and will accumulate electrons; if they are donor type they will accumulate holes. This phenomenon gives rise to surface band bending due to the local depletion of the carriers from within the perovskite semiconductor, which become localized in the surface states (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). The higher the density of surface states is, the greater the depletion and the larger the magnitude of the band bending are. The direction of the band bending depends on the type of charge that is accumulated at the surface. The band bending which we illustrate in the <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>, occurs due to trapping of electrons in acceptor type surface states<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> where negative charges accumulate on the surface leaving behind a positive space charge region close to the surface. Under illumination, the band-to-band (or trap to band) transition generates excess carriers. Due to the electric field created by the surface space charge region, photogenerated holes are swept towards the surface, which act to screen the trapped electron thus reducing the degree of band bending<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Under sufficient intensity of illumination, flat band condition can be achieved when the photogenerated hole density near the surface matches the density of trapped surface charge. We illustrate the situation under moderate illumination by the dotted lines in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>. The difference in surface work-function (measured by a kelvin probe) in the dark and under illumination (known as surface photovoltage, SPV) represents change in the magnitude of the band bending at the surface of the semiconductor, and thus is indicative of the density of surface states. In <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref> we show SPV measurements of the perovskite films. Both control perovskite and HPA treated films on FTO-coated glass show a continuous decrease in the work function as the light intensity is increased. The sign of the SPV signal suggests that the predominant surface states are acceptor type, which is manifested by a downward-bent band (from the perspective of the surface moving into the film) as we have illustrated in (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4a</xref>). We found that the difference on SPV between dark and illuminated of the control and HPA-processed films were 430 and 210 mV, respectively (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>). The lower magnitude of SPV signal which we observe on the HPA-processed film suggests that HPA addition lowers the density of acceptor type trap states at the surface. We note here that a buried interface (FTO:perovskite herein) can also affect the SPV signal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> if selective transfer of one type of photogenerated carriers occurs at that heterojunction interface, or if there is a significant density of trap sites at the buried interface. However, we have shown in our previous work that in steady-state condition zero photocurrent is obtained for devices with FTO:perovskite interface, consistent with a non-selective nature of the interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, unlike the compact TiO<sub>2</sub>:perovskite interface. In addition, we observe non-zero SPV signals at low light intensities (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4b</xref>) where the HPA-processed films have higher SPV value compared with the control films and the SPV signals do not change sign with higher intensities consistent with the SPV signal being dominated by the front surface.

We do not observe a signal for phosphorous in the film (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1364">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), indicating that HPA is not present above 0.1% concentration in the perovskite film after processing, notably with the detection limited to the surface region of the film. Hence, this implies that HPA does not physically participate in passivation of surface defects in the film. We note that from these measurements we cannot exclude the possible presence of phosphorous throughout the bulk of the film. From the XPS spectra of the signals for Pb 4f and I 3d, we estimate the I/Pb ratio in the film to be 2.19 and 2.50 for the control sample and sample with HPA, respectively. This stoichiometry indicates there is iodide deficiency in the surface region of both films (we expect a 3:1 ratio in the stoichiometric crystal). However, this deficiency is more exaggerated in the control film, implying that HPA partially restores the I/Pb stoichiometry in the perovskite film. We present another important observation in high-resolution spectra of binding energy pertaining to Pb in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>. There are two main peaks in Pb 4f spectra: the Pb 4f<sub>7/2</sub> and Pb 4f<sub>5/2</sub> peaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. We attribute the small peaks at around 136.3 and 141.2 eV to the presence of unsaturated Pb which has recently been assigned to metallic Pb (Pb<sup>0</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>, marked star in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5a</xref>. This could simply be due to the fact that highly unsaturated Pb may show metallic characteristics. The presence of a substantial amount of unsaturated Pb is a further indication of the existence of iodide deficiencies in the perovskite lattice of the control sample, and the metallic lead species in the film are likely to act as recombination centres<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. However, in the HPA-modified perovskite film, there seems to be a substantial reduction in the peak assigned to the unsaturated lead, and the peak area ratio of Pb<sup>0</sup>/Pb4f decreases from 10.9% (control) to 5.6% (with HPA). All of the experimental evidence presented thus far points towards there being much lower possibility of iodide vacancies in the in the crystal lattice of the HPA-processed films combined with a lower fraction of metallic lead in the films.

The champion cell with HPA gives a SPO of 14.1%, which is also much higher than the champion control device in the absence of HPA showing a SPO of 10.6% (see also in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1364">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).</p><p id="Par24">To determine whether this ‘HPA effect’ is ubiquitous, we added HPA to a precursor solution utilizing lead chloride as the lead salt. We observed a similar increase in both scanned and stabilized power conversion efficiencies (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1364">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), which suggests that there is likely to be a universal effect of HPA on improving device performance, independent on thin-film deposition technique.</p><p id="Par25">Before we conclude that the reducing character of HPA is the sole reason for retaining the I/Pb stoichiometry in the perovskite, we used non-reducing acids, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) and acetic acid (HAc) or water (H<sub>2</sub>O; since HPA used in this work is a 50 wt% aqueous solution) as additives and we followed similar procedures to fabricate the perovskite films. We show the device performance in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1364">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>. In contrast to the addition of HPA, the device performance drops sharply by addition of other additives in the precursor solution. This experiment is consistent with the function of HPA acting as a reducing agent, rather than as an acid, and also rules out the possible positive contribution of the water in HPA solution on the properties of the perovskite thin film and device performance.</p><p id="Par26">Considering all the facts discussed so far, we attribute the reduction of the electronic defect density to the combined effect of reducing the non-stoichiometric defect sites, most particular a lower fraction of metallic lead, and the formation of larger grains. We attribute the latter to the slower crystallization rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1364">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>), which we observe in perovskite films processed with the HPA additive.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par27">We have demonstrated that the addition of hypophosphorous acid (HPA) to the perovskite precursor solution can greatly improve the quality of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite thin films by reducing the energetic defects in the crystal and enhancing the polycrystalline grain morphology. This leads to the enhanced photoluminescence and solar cell device performance with improved reproducibility. A key observation is that the relative fraction of metallic lead in the perovskite films is greatly reduced via processing with HPA. This work identifies a specific crystallization enhancement additive, which improves the quality of the semiconductor, but it also highlights that much further scope remains to achieve entirely electronically homogeneous polycrystalline thin films. Understanding the subtleties of crystallization from the composition of the solutions to the final crystallized films is still in its infancy, and we expect that the discovery of other ‘impurity’ additives to be important for the ongoing advancement of the perovskite technology. More directly, our work is likely to motivate other groups employing purified MAI to further boost their champion device performance beyond current world record efficiencies by adding HPA in their precursor solution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Perovskite solution preparation</title><p id="Par28">Methylamine iodide (MAI) was purchased from Dyesol and used as received.

Using an optical fibre and lens, light beam fall on the perovskite surface at an angle of 45° (with respect to the sample surface) to illuminate the whole surface area. This configuration allowed us to do the illumination and probing from the same side, that is, perovskite:air interface side.
