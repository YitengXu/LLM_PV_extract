In order to examine the state of renewable energy (RE) in Mazowieckie Voivodeship (Poland), a literature review was carried out, anonymous surveys were conducted, a SWOT (Strenghts, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) and TOWS analysis were carried out and the potential of RE in Mazowieckie voivodship was estimated. The total capacity of all installations is equal to 712 MW. In recent months, number of prosumers have increased to 11,742 in the Voivodeship, and the capacity of their installations is estimated at 66 MW. Simplification of legal regulations and educating society is strongly recommended. Respondents in the survey and SWOT analysis on the future of the energy sector in Mazowieckie Voivodeship show that solar energy (35.5% of respondents) and wind energy (24.5% of respondents) have the greatest chances for the development. Development of the RE sector in the Voivodeship means new jobs, both in this sector and around it. Significant RE potential together with large project financing possibilities may cause Mazowieckie Voivodeship to be a leader in RE production in Poland. It is this Voivodeship (with its capital Warsaw) that can serve as an example of the energy transformation towards 100% RE.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Renewable

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Energy is one of the most important factors determining the development of civilization, because each management process must be powered by energy. The uninterrupted supply of energy is essential for the functioning of the modern economy, households and, consequently, the quality of life (Corral-Verdugo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>). At the same time, its production from fossil raw materials is the largest source of emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases—GHG (Greenhouse Gases), mainly CO<sub>2</sub>, which leads to climate change (Foguesatto et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>; Irman &amp; Shrestha, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par3">The development of renewable energy (RE) sources is associated not only with the development of technology and reduction of GHG emissions (Piwowar &amp; Dzikuć, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2019</xref>), but also contributes to creation of new jobs, called green jobs (Rutkowska-Podołowska et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2016</xref>). Clean energy is most often based on the energy potential, which is why it is also generated and consumed in the close distances (Yadav et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2020</xref>). This offers opportunities for direct or indirect benefits to the consumers themselves, as new jobs are created and the outflow of funds to fossil fuel countries is eliminated (Paska &amp; Surma, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">The Polish energy sector is currently facing serious challenges. High demand for energy, inadequate level of development of fuel and energy production and transport infrastructure, considerable dependence on external supplies of natural gas and almost full dependence on external supplies of crude oil, and obligations in the field of environmental protection, including climate protection, necessitate taking decisive measures to prevent deterioration of fuel and energy consumers’ situation (Brodny et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020a</xref>; Michalak &amp; Dziugiewicz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">A fair transformation, the construction of a parallel, zero-emission energy system and good air quality are the three main elements of the draft of Poland's Energy Policy until 2040 (Poland's energy policy until <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2040</xref> (project),Warsaw<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2020</xref>). An additional target provides a 30% reduction in energy poverty, and the creation of 300 thousand new jobs, thanks to the development of RE, including offshore wind, nuclear and electromobility, through appropriate prioritization in energy policy. Poland is a country in which RE sector has been developing for over 20 years. The wind energy (aeroenergy), combustion and co-firing of solid biomass have been developing the fastest. However, there has been an increasing interest in geothermal energy, heat pumps, solar collectors and photovoltaics (PV) panels recently. Each month, the number of energy prosumers increases (The Energy Regulatory Authority, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">The aim of the article is to present the current state, potential and development prospects of the RE in the Mazowieckie Voivodeship (Province). There is no such article in the literature, and due to the energy transformation of the Voivodeship and Poland, it should be presented to a wider audience. The article presents the SWOT (Strenghts, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) and TOWS analysis and a survey on the future of RE in the largest Voivodship in Poland—Mazowieckie Voivodeship. It should be emphasized, that country capital, Warsaw, is located there. It is worth adding that Mazowieckie Voivodeship is one of the most dynamically developing regions in Poland, situated at the crossroads connecting Eastern and Western Europe. This region, with Warsaw in particular, is developing very dynamically. Mazowieckie Voivodeship generates 20% of total Polish income. Mazowieckie Voivodeship should be an example how to switch to RE in a sustainable way.</p><p id="Par7">The article is a continuation of RE research in various regions of Poland; so far, the analysis of RE has been presented for Kujawsko-Pomorskie (Igliński et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2010</xref>), Zachodniopomorskie (Igliński et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2013</xref>), Wielkopolskie (Igliński, Buczkowski, et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2015</xref>), Pomorskie (Igliński, Piechota, et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>) and Łódzkie (Igliński et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>) Voivodeships.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Short description of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship</title><p id="Par8">Poland is administratively divided into 16 Voivodeships (Provinces). Each voivodeship has a capital city and a local government, and thus has a local policy, including an energy strategy. Mazowieckie Voivodeship is the largest Polish Voivodeship. With the area of 35.6 thousand km<sup>2</sup>, it constitutes 11.4% of the country area (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In terms of population, it also occupies the first place—the Voivodeship population is 5.1 million people, which represents 13.4% of the Polish population (Statistical Yearbook of the Regions of Poland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2017</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Mazowieckie Voivodeship location in Poland (own elaboration)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10668_2021_1490_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">In terms of altitude, the vast area of the Voivodeship belongs to lowland areas. The plains are cut by river valleys and valley depressions (sometimes with dunes) filled with sandy sediments of river accumulation (Mazovia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2018</xref>; Statistical Yearbook of the Regions of Poland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">Mazowieckie Voivodeship climate is spatially diverse and has a transitional character, from maritime to continental one. Greater influence of the continental climate is noted in the eastern part of the Province which is characterized by lower temperatures in winter period, higher temperature amplitudes and shorter growing season. Mazowieckie Voivodeship is located in the part of the country characterized by the average and low annual rainfall (totals). In central and western part of the Voivodeship the lowest precipitation occurs, in the range 450–500 mm, in northern and southern fringe areas, annual precipitation totals around 550–600 mm. In the summer and autumn, the west winds dominate, in spring winds from the north, whereas in the winter—south-eastern winds. The average wind direction distribution in the Voivodeship is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> (Mazovia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2018</xref>; Statistical Yearbook of the Regions of Poland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2017</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Average distribution of wind directions in Mazowieckie Voivodeship (own elaboration based on (Statistical Yearbook of the Regions of Poland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2017</xref>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10668_2021_1490_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par11">In Mazowieckie Voivodeship, light brown, podzolic and rusty soils prevail. According to the bonitation value, the arable soils of weak and medium quality predominate, with the advantage of the IVa and IVb bonitation classes, which cover over three-quarters of the province area. Agricultural land constitutes 69.6% of the province area. Forests, coppices and bushes cover only 23% of the province area, with almost the lowest rate in the country (Mazovia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2018</xref>; Statistical Yearbook of the Regions of Poland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par12">Mazowieckie Voivodeship area is located in the Vistula River basin and includes the central course of the Vistula, together with central and estuary sections of its largest tributaries. In the Province area, the Vistula River receives the waters of the largest right-bank tributary—the Narew River—and the left-hand tributaries—the Pilica and Bzura Rivers. River network in the province is well developed, the total length of watercourses, including ditches, exceeds 15 thousand km (Mazovia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2018</xref>; Statistical Yearbook of the Regions of Poland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par13">The total capacity of all RE installations in Poland exceeds 9500 MW, however the installation spacing is un even throughout the country. The largest total power is installed in Pomorskie Voivodeship (1600 MW), and the smallest one in Opolskie Voivodeship (174 MW).

Currently, the investor is struggling with many documents, permits—and a significant part of them can be liquidated or reduced. The law should be investor-friendly. The act on RE resources is being constantly changed, which leads to chaos on the RE market in Poland and in Mazowieckie Voivodeship. Several respondents also wrote that they are eager to increase their investments in RE, but are still waiting for regulations “normalization” (Survey—a vision of the development of renewable energy in the Mazowieckie Voivodeship, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par34">81% of respondents believe that it is necessary to educate Mazowieckie Voivodeship society on RE. For many Poles, RE is still something new and unknown, so they approach it with respect or reluctance. In energy education, primary schools or even kindergartens play an important role. Educating these pupils, very often means getting the message across to the parents. Respondents also emphasize that the existing RE installations in Mazowieckie Voivodeship should also play an important role in educating the public. Seeing with one's own eyes how an agricultural biogas plant works will decrease the reluctance towards this type of facilities (Ocetkiewicz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par35">79% of respondents believe that more financial incentives or tax remissions should be introduced for RE investors in Mazowieckie Voivodeship (Standar et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2021</xref>). The respondents emphasize that it is not just about introducing very high subsidies, but rather about clear accounting principles, market access, and trouble free connection to the power grid. Investment capacities should be popularized, including the possibility of deduction of amounts invested in RE sources from the PIT tax by the investor (Survey—a vision of the development of renewable energy in the Mazowieckie Voivodeship, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2018</xref>).</p><p id="Par36">Participant of the study almost unanimously (92% of respondents) believe that the development of RE will positively affect the reduction of harmful substances to the environment.

Respondents emphasize that the development of RE technologies means new, well-paid jobs. Importantly, further jobs are also created around the RE sector. It is estimated that there are 2–3 places associated with this sector per 1 employee in the RE sector: mainly industry, but also construction, services, etc. Participants of the study believe that the development of the RE industry is a great opportunity for both the economy of the region and for Poland (Rutkowska-Podołowska et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2016</xref>). When we create a law that is favorable (or at least not interfering) to low-energy construction, prosumers, energy cooperatives, intelligent networks and other future technologies; then new companies will be established, providing well-paid jobs, gaining roots, growing up and starting to supply their products and provide services to international market.</p><p id="Par38">Several people have pointed out that smart energy networks should be developed. Smart network is a solution that enables the implementation of an important mechanism related to energy security, which is demand management. The supply of energy with the use of intelligent network is associated with the flow of information allowing both continuous monitoring of demand and the control of this demand through impacts on energy receivers.

Beneficiaries may apply for a significant co-financing/loan/loan from EU funds, Voivodeship funds or funds from a given borough. It is in Warsaw or in its vicinity that companies which produce RE installations should be established. Schools and universities also have the opportunity to train employees in the RE sector.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>), estimate the potentials for heat extraction and disposal for the main lakes and rivers of Switzerland based on acceptable temperature changes in the waterbodies, and compare them to regional demands. In most cases, the potentials considerably exceed the demand, and minor impacts on the thermal regime of the waterbodies are expected. There are, however, critical situations: rivers crossing densely-populated areas, where demand often exceeds the potential, and heat disposal in summer into lowland rivers and shallow lakes, where temperatures may exceed ecological criteria. To assess the impacts of a realistic thermal use, authors model the temperature effects in two lakes: Upper Lake Constance, a large lake with relatively low population density, and Lower Lake Zurich, a smaller lake with high regional demand. The estimated mean temperature alterations are − 0.05 to + 0.02 ºC for Lake Constance, and − 0.60 to + 0.22 ºC for Lake Zurich. The analysis demonstrates that waterbodies provide real alternatives for heat/cold production in many regions of the world.</p><p id="Par152">The paper (Klijajić et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>) examines the integration of local geothermal potential in the northern part of the Republic of Serbia and assesses the implications of using geothermal heat pump technology in a district heating system. The main benefit of the geothermal heat pump system is the reduction of the inlet primary energy by at least 30% by avoiding the use of almost a 22 million cubic meters of natural gas per year. This also results in a competitive energy cost of 23 EUR/MWh, an investment with internal rate of return of up to 38%, and a discounted payback period of 4.9 years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec47"><title>Geoenergetics and heat pumps SWOT analysis</title><p id="Par153">Geoenergetics and heat pumps SWOT analysis in Mazowieckie Voivodeship is presented in Table <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Geoenergetics and heat pumps SWOT analysis in Mazowieckie Voivodeship (own elaboration)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Strengths</p></th><th align="left"><p>Weaknesses</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Low failure rate</p><p>Very high social acceptance</p></td><td align="left"><p>High investment costs</p><p>LONG costs return period</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Opportunites</p></th><th align="left"><p>Threats</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Development of balneology and swimming pools</p><p>Development of a low-emission economy</p></td><td align="left"><p>Lack of effective promotional policy towards geothermal energy</p><p>Limited experience of some installation companies</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><sec id="Sec48"><title>Strengths</title><p id="Par154">Well-designed geothermal installation or heat pump works almost without failure.</p><p id="Par155">Strengths include the fact that heat pumps, like solar installations, are very popular among Poles.

Its strategy should be to take advantage of these opportunities while reducing or improving weaknesses within the sector. In the Mazowieckie Voivodeship, the situation of WO is aeroenergy and geoenergy. As of today, the biggest weakness of aeroenergy is the “distance Act”, which almost stopped the development of this technology in Poland. Even in this difficult situation, aeroenergy should develop based on its strengths and opportunities. In turn, in the case of geoenergy, the greatest weakness is the high cost of the installation. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the development of balneotherapy and thermal baths, which would allow to obtain external funds for financing the investment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec56"><title><italic>ST situation</italic>—<italic>maxi-mini strategy</italic></title><p id="Par167">The source of RE development difficulties for this sector is the unfavorable system of external conditions (predominance of threats). You can oppose it with great internal potential and try to overcome the threats using your strengths to the maximum. In the Mazowieckie Voivodeship, hydropower is in the situation of ST. The biggest threat is the low interest of investors.

In the case of Mazowieckie Voivodeship, no RE sector is in the situation of WT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec58"><title>Future perspectives of RE development in the Mazowieckie Voivodeship and Poland</title><p id="Par169">In the Mazowieckie Voivodeship, an energy mix should be developed, mainly based on bioenergy, aeroenergy and helioenergy. The mix of different RE will ensure the energy self-sufficiency of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship. The conducted SWOT analysis allows a rather optimistic view of the further development of RE sources in the Mazowieckie Voivodeship. Solid biomass, wind and PV energy will be used for electricity production, solid biomass and heat pumps for heat production. The Mazowieckie Voivodeship should further develop the RE mix. Heat and power plants should be built in areas rich in waste biomass, wind farms in areas with high winds, etc. Only the sustainable development of the RE will allow the energy transformation of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship. In 2021 or 2022, the first biomethane plant in the Mazowieckie Voivodeship is to be opened. Biomethane is to be used as automotive fuel and/or as gas injected into the gas grid.</p><p id="Par170">The SHP potential in Mazowieckie voivodship calculated on the basis of stacking amounts to 32.7 MW. Building dams as part of “Small Retention” may increase the hydropower potential in the Province. Aeroenergy is currently developing very poorly in the Mazowieckie Voivodeship (as well as in the whole of Poland) due to the “distance Act”. It must be liberalized. In recent months, prosumer PV has been developing very quickly in the Province. Further rapid development of pro-consumer PV in the Voivodship is expected, which results from the decline in prices of PV panels, increased efficiency and more and more incentives, such as the “My Current” Program (Current &amp; Program, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2020</xref>). “My Current” program allows to obtain a subsidy for the construction of PV micro installations (from 2 to 10 kW) in the form of a subsidy of up to 50% of eligible costs, but not more than PLN 5 thousand per project. It is a prosumer energy sector, PV installations are most often installed on the roofs of the investor's buildings (Stadniczeńko, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2020</xref>). Bioenergy has a very good chance for development—the Voivodeship has a great potential of forest and agricultural waste. Solid biomass will be incinerated/co-incinerated in combined heat and power plants, and biogas will be produced from “wet” waste. The inhabitants of the Province are more and more willing to choose heat pumps as the main/additional source of heat.</p><p id="Par171">PEG (Polish Energy Group), the largest energy company in Poland, headquartered in Warsaw, published a new strategy in autumn 2020 (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.gkpge.pl/biuro-prasowe/komunikatyprasowe/korporacyjne/strategia-grupy-pge-neutralnosc-klimatyczna-w-2050-roku" ext-link-type="uri">www.gkpge.pl/biuro-prasowe/komunikatyprasowe/korporacyjne/strategia-grupy-pge-neutralnosc-klimatyczna-w-2050-roku</ext-link>). The company presented the Group's transformation plan and the way to decarbonise production, and announced the goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. Firstly, to the end of 2030, PGE Group intends to build 2.5 GW of new capacity in offshore wind farms, 3 GW in PV and expand the portfolio of onshore wind farms by at least 1 GW. Recognizing the interest of customers, PGE Group will prepare for them the opportunity to participate in the energy transformation for them. Large-scale projects will be accompanied by a complementary storage program of at least 0.8 GW, which will support the safe and flexible operation of the power system (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.gkpge.pl/biuro-prasowe/komunikatyprasowe/korporacyjne/strategia-grupy-pge-neutralnosc-klimatyczna-w-2050-roku" ext-link-type="uri">www.gkpge.pl/biuro-prasowe/komunikatyprasowe/korporacyjne/strategia-grupy-pge-neutralnosc-klimatyczna-w-2050-roku</ext-link>).</p><p id="Par172">The development of domestic RE installations, their assembly and conservation works are a huge impulse for the economic development of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship. And we should start with the fact that the development of RE sources means new, relatively well-paid jobs in rural regions with relatively high unemployment. A power plant/RE installation means not only jobs, but also great financial benefits, as it pays various types of taxes, VAT, transfers money to the Labor Fund and the Guaranteed Employee Benefits Fund, tax on natural persons and legal persons, as well as various maintenance fees; supports local culture. The commune and the State Treasury gain.</p><p id="Par173">Sustainable use of RE resources in the Mazowieckie Voivodeship will radically reduce the emission of harmful compounds, including dust responsible for smog (Dzikuć &amp; Adamczyk, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2015</xref>). RE also generates less waste than conventional fuels. Improving air quality will have a positive effect on the health of the inhabitants as well as attract more tourists.</p><p id="Par174">The development of RE is conducive to a decentralized society, powered by a network of smaller and safer power plants and strengthening local communities. Much of the energy production (biogas, biomass, the Sun, etc.) will be transferred to agricultural land, with economic benefits. The development of RE sources means that rural residents will be the beneficiaries—they will supply waste to biogas plants, for example, solar farms will work on their premises. They will find work in new plants producing energy from RE. Farmers' income will be diversified. Own energy production will also improve the quality of rural infrastructure and the quality of life. The development of the RE mix will allow the Voivodeship and Poland to gradually transform towards 100% RE. This is expected to happen in 2050 at the latest.</p><p id="Par175">It should also be noted here that the increase in electricity obtained from RE sources, in addition to the lower negative impact on the natural environment compared to conventional energy sources, may translate into improvement of the country's energy security. Thus, the actual increase in the share of electricity from RE in consumption may contribute to the gradual implementation of sustainable development idea (Gue et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020</xref>) in the socio-economic life of the Voivodeship. In recent months, prosumer PV has been developing very quickly in the Mazowieckie Voivodeship. Further rapid development of pro-consumer PV in the Province is expected, which results from the decline in prices of PV panels, increased efficiency and more and more incentives, such as the “My Current” Program (Current &amp; Program, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2020</xref>).</p><p id="Par176">The EU climate and energy policy, including its long-term vision of striving for EU climate neutrality by 2050 and regulatory mechanisms stimulating the achievement of effects in the coming decades, have a significant impact on shaping the national energy strategy (Sovacool et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2021</xref>). Achieving the EU's 2020 and 2030 climate and energy targets is key to a low-carbon energy transition. According to the Polish Energy Policy until 2040 (Ministry of Climate &amp; Environment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2020</xref>), the transformation of the Polish energy sector is to be based on three pillars:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par177">The First Pillar—transformation of coal regions, reducing energy poverty and new industries related to the RE and nuclear energy.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par178">Second Pillar—offshore wind energy, nuclear energy as well as local and community energy.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par179">Third Pillar—transformation of heating, electrification of transport and passive constructions (Ministry of Climate &amp; Environment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2020</xref>).</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par180">Poland’s Energy Policy (Ministry of Climate &amp; Environment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2020</xref>) provides a departure from burning coal in households by 2030 in cities and by 2040 in rural areas. In 2040, more than half of the installed capacity will be zero-emission sources. The implementation of offshore wind energy into the Polish power system and the commissioning of a nuclear power plant will play a special role in this process. There will be two strategic new areas and industries that will be built in Poland.</p></sec><sec id="Sec59"><title>Policy and Managerial Implications</title><p id="Par181">The conducted research indicates that in order to develop the RE in the Mazowieckie Voivodeship (as well as in Poland), bureaucracy should be reduced. Currently, the RE investor in Poland has to prepare a lot of documents, permits, and often an environmental impact assessment. It is time-consuming and capital-intensive. Therefore, the number of necessary documents should be reduced to a minimum, and those that remain as much as possible simplify. A sensible solution is to delegate a person/persons in each commune who will help RE investors in preparing the necessary documentation.</p><p id="Par182">The “Distance Act” regulation must be changed as soon as possible—this is probably the most stringent regulation for building turbines/wind farms on land. The rules on offshore wind energy need to be simplified.</p><p id="Par183">Knowledge about the RE in the Mazowieckie Voivodship (as well as in the whole of Poland) is still at a fairly low level. This needs to be changed by introducing the basics of RE at every level of education. It is worth preparing educational films about RE, doing workshops, organizing conferences and study trips at the RE facilities. Adults, including politicians, should also be educated. The increase in knowledge in the society should result in greater support for the RE and a decrease in protests against the construction of the RE installations.</p><p id="Par184">The Mazowieckie Voivodeship (as well as the whole of Poland) is struggling with the problem of poor air quality, and with smog during the heating season. The development of RE installations (geothermal energy, heat pumps, biomass) can improve air quality, so the amount of subsidies, loans, low-interest loans or tax exemptions for investors who are switching to low- or zero-emission heat sources should be increased.</p><p id="Par185">The energy transformation of the Voivodeship, just like the whole of Poland, requires cooperation with conventional energy companies. Adequate support programs for renewable energy workers should be provided so that they can change industries and start a new job. Also companies producing mining equipment should be able to change the structure of production and the possibility of producing, for example, components for wind energy.</p><p id="Par186">Legal provisions should allow for the sustainable development of the energy mix. Only the energy mix will ensure energy security in the Voivodeship and Poland.</p></sec><sec id="Sec60" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par187">It should be summarized that RE in the Mazowieckie Voivodeship is developing well. At present, biomass and wind energy dominate. The Voivodeship has a significant potential for RE. The SWOT analysis carried out allows us to be optimistic about the further development of the RE in this region. Moreover, the possibility of financing RE investments may contribute to the fact that the Voivodeship will be the RE leader in Poland.
