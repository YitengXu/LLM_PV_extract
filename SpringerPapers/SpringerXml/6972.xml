sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen, including singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>), superoxide anion radical (O<sub>2</sub><sup>−•</sup>), hydroxyl radical (•OH), and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. At low concentrations, ROS play an essential role in adjusting cell functions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, mismanagement and/or overproduction of ROS would subject a biosystem to cause oxidative stress. Excess ROS result in irreversible oxidative damage to the biomacromolecules (e.g., lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins), induce a variety of deleterious cellular responses (e.g., apoptosis and necrosis), and trigger a myriad of pathologies (e.g., atherosclerosis, neurodegeneration, inflammation, aging, hemochromatosis, and even cancer)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Therefore, to remit its detrimental effect, tight ROS regulation is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis.</p><p id="Par5">Under normal circumstance, the intracellular redox equilibrium to resist oxidative stress is sustained by a collection of enzymatic antioxidants, primarily consisting of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), thiol peroxidase (TPx), glutathione peroxide (GPx), etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. However, natural enzymes generally involve proteins and RNA molecules, which are susceptible to environmental factors and become inactive under pathological conditions. To circumvent these drawbacks, artificial enzymes termed as “nanozyme” with intrinsic enzyme-like characteristics have been designed and constructed as alternatives to exert enzyme functionality. Owing to their exceptional properties (facile preparation, high stability, tunable activity, etc.), nanozymes garner great attention and enable a broad spectrum of biomedical applications. Recently, exciting paradigms can be found in the emerging field of nanozymes, such as iron-based nanoparticles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, copper-based nanoreactors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, carbon-based nanoplatforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, nanoceria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, noble metal-based nanomaterials (e.g., Au, Pt, and Pd)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, organic nanoenzymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, etc. Thereinto, vanadium, one of the 40 essential micronutrients, possesses a regulatory role in the biological system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. As a consequence of the intrinsic catalytic activities toward classical peroxidase substrates and long-term anti-biofouling abilities, vanadium-based nanomaterials have increasingly aroused considerable interest in the field of nanozymes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Despite the high prospect, to the best of our knowledge, very few vanadium-based nanozymes have been developed so far<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. These nanozymes, in particular, mainly concentrate on the single enzymic function in vitro and almost neglect the in vivo effect. More importantly, an artificial enzyme simply with a single function is incapable of mimicking the natural intracellular antioxidant system in combating oxidative stress. The current trend in nanozyme development has focused on constructing a nanoreactor to simulate the sophisticated intracellular enzyme-participated ROS defense system. Accordingly, it is necessary to develop more robust vanadium-based nanomaterials that can functionally mimic the sophisticated cellular antioxidant enzymes. Recent advances in transition metal carbides and/or nitrides (MXenes) suggest that MXenes have been regarded as a thriving class of two-dimensional (2D) materials in numerous potential applications ranging from energy storage to biomedicine, attributed to their versatile compositions, physicochemical diversity, and tailorability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Even though some impressive preliminary results have been achieved in theranostics, biosensing, bioimaging, and antibacterial, the exploration of other scenarios of MXenes in vitro and in vivo are still urgently required.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we report 2D vanadium carbide (V<sub>2</sub>C) MXene as a successful paradigm of guiding nanozymes to implement antioxidative behaviors for ROS elimination under pathophysiological conditions. The interdependent relationship between MXene and enzyme inspires us to propose the concept of “MXenzyme”: MXenzyme is in analogy to the nomenclature of nanozyme, highlighting enzyme-mimicking characteristics of the MXenes. We make the interesting discovery that 2D V<sub>2</sub>C MXenzyme is a kind of artificial nanozyme conducting intrinsic multiple enzyme-like activities, including SOD, CAT, POD, TPx, GPx, and haloperoxidase (HPO), which are in a position to catalyze ROS. Our results demonstrate that 2D V<sub>2</sub>C MXenzyme effectively catalyzes O<sub>2</sub><sup>−•</sup> into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, decomposes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O and gets rid of •OH, as well as restrains ROS elevation by in vivo tests. Intelligent cytoprotection against oxidative stress-induced inflammation and neurotoxicity can be achieved by the concerted catalysis of multifunctional MXenzymes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>). This strategy not only sheds light on a type of nanozymes with multiple enzyme-mimicking properties and excellent ROS-removal efficacy but also paves an avenue toward broadening the bioapplications of MXenes into catalytic nanomedicine.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Schematic illustration of ROS-scavenging activities of V<sub>2</sub>C MXenzyme with multiple enzyme-mimicking properties.</title><p>V<sub>2</sub>C MXenzyme effectively catalyzes O<sub>2</sub><sup>−•</sup> into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, decomposes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, and gets rid of •OH.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2021_22278_Fig1_HTML.png"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthesis and characterization of 2D V<sub>2</sub>C MXene</title><p id="Par7">2D V<sub>2</sub>C MXene was synthesized via a facile exfoliation and intercalation procedure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. In a typical synthesis, the interlaced aluminum layers were selectively extracted from the corresponding MAX phase precursors V<sub>2</sub>AlC through wet-chemical etching using hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution. Then, the as-etched multilayered (ML) V<sub>2</sub>C MXene was delaminated by employing tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH) as an intercalant to reduce the interaction between individual layers and subsequently obtain few-layered (FL) V<sub>2</sub>C MXene. As visualized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images, pristine V<sub>2</sub>AlC exhibits closely compacted layered platelet morphology (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). After HF treatment, the compact layers expanded and became loose accordion-shape ML structure (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), demonstrating the successful exfoliation.

In addition, a trimodal configuration of V, Al, and C in the hierarchical nanoflake structure is further revealed by linear-scanning EDX spectra along the lateral-section of the sample (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>), which shows that the signal areas of V and C are similar while the signal pattern of Al appears opposite to V and/or C.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Synthesis and characterization of V<sub>2</sub>AlC MAX and V<sub>2</sub>C MXene.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic diagram of selective etching and interlayer expansion route to fabricate V<sub>2</sub>C MXene from the parent V<sub>2</sub>AlC MAX phase. <bold>b</bold> FESEM images (Inset depicts the corresponding high-magnification SEM image) and structural model of V<sub>2</sub>AlC before HF treatment, displaying a typical compact layer structure. <bold>c</bold> FESEM images (Inset depicts the corresponding high-magnification SEM image) and structural model of V<sub>2</sub>AlC after HF treatment to fabricate multilayer V<sub>2</sub>C MXene with a typical exfoliated layer topology.

In order to investigate more details with the crystallographic structure and chemical composition, the atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) in high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) mode was performed, which is sensitive to the element atomic number. It is worthwhile to mention that the larger atomic number V (<italic>Z</italic> = 23) elements scatter the electrons more strongly than Al (<italic>Z</italic> = 13) elements, therefore, V atoms appear brighter contrast in this HAADF images<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Cross-sectional HRSTEM images of V<sub>2</sub>AlC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e, f</xref>), as obtained along the [001] zone axis, signify a purity phase and highly-ordered lamellar arrangement with alternating dark and bright contrast, as schematically depicted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>. Furthermore, the corresponding EDX elemental mapping of V, Al, and C atoms in the sample reveals that the layer stacking order, excluding C, is V–V–Al–V–V, where Al layer is sandwiched between two V<sub>2</sub>C layers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>).

After that, a small hole was drilled at the following coordinates: lateral (L) = 2.3 mm, anteroposterior (AP) = 0.8 mm, ventral (V) = −3.5 mm from the bregma point. The V<sub>2</sub>C MXenzyme dispersion (10 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>, 4 μL) or sterile saline solution (4 μL) was injected unilaterally into the striatum at the rate of 1 μL min<sup>−1</sup> and a 5 min lag was allowed before needle extraction to avoid brain damage.</p><p id="Par68">After 2 weeks, the mice were deeply anesthetized with 5% chloride hydrate. The obtained 18 brains (6 per group) were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Brains in each group were randomly assigned to two subgroups: three brains were subsequently cut into 4-μm-thick serial coronal sections and the other three brains were serially cut into 4-μm-thick transverse sections using a pathology slicer (Leica RM2016, Germany). For immunohistochemical staining, these sections were put into xylene three times for 15 min to remove paraffin, rehydrated via a gradient of ethanol (100%, 100%, 95% and 70% ethanol) for 5 min in each concentration, and then rinsed using DI water. After that, they were brought to a boil in sodium citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval in a microwave oven (Galanz P70D20TL-P4, China), maintained at just below the boiling temperature for 8 min, cooled to room temperature, placed in PBS (pH 7.4) and shaken on the decolorization shaker (Servicebio TSY-B, China) 3 times for 5 min each. Subsequently, the samples were placed in 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 25 min and washed with PBS three times for 5 min each. To prevent antibody nonspecific binding, 3% BSA solution was added to cover the samples for 30 min at room temperature. After removing the blocking solution, the sections were incubated with anti-IBA-1 antibody (1:100 dilution), anti-TH antibody (1:200 dilution), or anti-4-HNE antibody (1:100 dilution) at 4 °C overnight, and then washed by shaking 3 times for 5 min each. After covering with secondary horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:500 dilution), they were incubated for 50 min at room temperature and washed 3 times for 5 min each. Diaminobenzidine (DAB) color developing solution as newly prepared was added and 5 min generally provided an acceptable staining intensity, which could be controlled under the microscope (Nikon E100, Japan). Next, the sections were counterstained with hematoxylin for 3 min, washed with water, and subsequently located in 75% ethanol for 5 min, 85% ethanol for 5 min, 100% ethanol for 5 min,100% ethanol for 5 min, n-butanol for 5 min and xylene for 5 min. Finally, the samples were mounted onto gelatine-coated microscope slides with coverslips using the mounting medium, and the slides were visualized on a microscope (Nikon DS-U3, Japan).</p><p id="Par69">For immunofluorescence staining, these sections were put into xylene two times for 15 min to remove paraffin, rehydrated via a gradient of ethanol (100%, 100%, 95%, and 70% ethanol) for 5 min in each concentration, and then rinsed using DI water. After that, the sections were brought a boil in ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid buffer (1 mM, pH 8.0) for antigen retrieval, maintained at just below the boiling temperature for 8 min, cooled to room temperature, and washed with PBS (pH 7.4) 3 times for 5 min each. Subsequently, the liquid was removed and the samples were marked using a hydrophobic pen. In order to prevent nonspecific binding, 3% BSA solution was added to cover the marked tissue for 30 min, followed by removing the blocking solution slightly. The slides were incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C and then washed with PBS (pH 7.4) 3 times for 5 min each, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:200 dilution), Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:200 dilution), and Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:200 dilution) at room temperature for 50 min in dark condition. After rinsing three times with PBS (pH 7.4) for 5 min each, the samples were treated with DAPI solution for 1 min at room temperature and washed 3 times for 5 min each. Spontaneous fluorescence quenching reagent was added and kept for 5 min. Next, the sections were mounted onto the gelatine-coated microscope slides with coverslips using an anti-fade mounting medium.</p><p id="Par70">For the immunohistochemical staining analysis, the cell counting percentage of TH+, IBA-1+, or 4-HNE+ cells was quantified in a blind manner, which was conducted by analyzing the treatment conditions with randomly allocated groups through the unbiased method using an image analysis program Image J (Fiji). Quantification was performed by averaging five fields per section, and five different sections were independently quantified for each mouse. Subsequently, the result was expressed as (experimental group/control group) × 100%. Quantitative comparisons were carried out on image sets collected under the same imaging and acquisition conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par71">All quantitative results were shown as mean ± standard deviation.
