Each mutant strain overproduced one specific commodity product, i.e. ethanol or lactic acid, to such an extent that the majority of the incoming CO<sub>2</sub> in the organism was directly converted into the product.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2"><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">In total, 267 proteins have been identified with a significantly up- or down-regulated expression level. In the ethanol-producing mutant, which had the highest relative direct flux of carbon-to-product (&gt;65%), significant up-regulation of several components involved in the initial stages of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation for cellular metabolism was detected. Also a general decrease in abundance of the protein synthesizing machinery of the cells and a specific induction of an oxidative stress response were observed in this mutant. In the lactic acid overproducing mutant, that expresses part of the heterologous <sc>l</sc>-lactate dehydrogenase from a self-replicating plasmid, specific activation of two CRISPR associated proteins, encoded on the endogenous pSYSA plasmid, was observed. RT-qPCR was used to measure, of nine of the genes identified in the proteomics studies, also the adjustment of the corresponding mRNA level.</p></sec><sec id="ASec3"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par3">The most striking adjustments detected in the proteome of the engineered cells were dependent on the specific product formed, with, e.g. more stress caused by lactic acid- than by ethanol production. Up-regulation of the total capacity for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation in the ethanol-producing strain was due to hierarchical- rather than metabolic regulation. Furthermore, plasmid-based expression of heterologous gene(s) may induce genetic instability. For selected, limited, number of genes a striking correlation between the respective mRNA- and the corresponding protein expression level was observed, suggesting that for the expression of these genes regulation takes place primarily at the level of gene transcription.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Synthetic

id="Par22">The steep increase in the use of fossil carbon during the past 200Â years has generated worries about the increasing CO<sub>2</sub> content of the earthâs atmosphere and its presumed consequences, like global warming and ocean acidification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For this reason it is of utmost importance to develop new methodology and systems that will allow substitution of fossil carbon for renewable carbon, preferably driven by renewable, solar, energy so that in due time the global carbon cycle can be brought close(r) to a closure. Such systems indeed are under development and are mostly referred to as solar biofuel production systems, although much more than only liquid fuel (carriers) can be produced: for many chemical commodities and fine chemicals proof of principle for their production, based on the same approach, meanwhile has also been provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">This development has taken place through first- to fourth-generation approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], driven by increasing concerns about sustainability, and more and more supported by life cycle analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Whereas the first generation approach would use key products from the food sector, like sucrose or starch, to produce ethanol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], in the fourth generation approachâalso referred to as âdirect conversionââone aims at the direct conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> into the desired product, without the need to form biomass (and all the minerals required to form it) as an obligatory intermediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This latter approach preferably uses cyanobacteria, to engineer them towards highly efficient âproduction systemsâ for the desired product, because these organisms combine the highest efficiency in oxygenic photosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] with straightforward application of synthetic systems biology, both in terms of molecular genetic intervention and in terms of the required computational analyses (e.g. review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]).</p><p id="Par24">Indeed, for such engineering several successful examples have meanwhile been documented, like, e.g. for ethanol, iso-butanol, and lactic acid, with product titres ranging from several tens of mM up to 0.1Â M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Engineered strains that can carry out a particular conversion efficiently, so that more than 50% of the fixed carbon is directly channelled into product, are referred to as âcell factoriesâ for that particular substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Such engineering, however, may impose quite some stress on the producing organism, which occasionally is visible as an increased genetic instability of a production strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This stress may originate from two different factors: first the massive re-direction of the carbon flow through the cellâs intermediary metabolism may cause metabolic adjustment that may have the characteristics of as a stress response. Second, the product titre may increase to levels that change the physico-chemical conditions of the growth medium and/or the cell, such that it causes growth inhibition.</p><p id="Par25">The effect of the latter type of stress on cyanobacteria has already extensively investigated through transcriptomics and proteomics studies of the effect of the extracellular addition of an end product, e.g. ethanol and butanol, to batch cultures of particularly <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC6803 (hereafter <italic>Synechocystis</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Multiple stress response mechanisms were reported upon addition of either of these end products, including up-regulation of heat shock proteins, modification of the cell membrane and cell mobility, as well as induction of the oxidative stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It should be noted, however, that the highest product titres so far obtained with cyanobacterial cell factories (see above) hardly cause any stress on the wild-type organisms in terms of growth retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. But one has to keep in mind that this type of end-product stress may differ between situations in which the stressor is produced intracellularly, or added in the extracellular compartment. Notably, a recent transcriptome study of prolonged ethanol production in <italic>Synechocystis,</italic> yielding a final level of 4.7Â g/L ethanol (i.e. 2.5-fold less than the concentration of ethanol used in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] to stress the cells), showed that this product formation causes only minor changes in the level of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Significantly fewer studies have been published on the physiological consequences, i.e. stress, of major rechanneling of intermediary metabolism in the âcell factoriesâ. One consequence of the engineering of a high-capacity carbon sink in cyanobacteria, however, has already been noted, i.e. the increased rate of cellular CO<sub>2</sub> fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Here we explore the consequences of this approach (i.e. engineering of a high-capacity product-forming pathway into cyanobacteria) with a detailed proteomics analysis for cell factories for ethanol (with the two necessary heterologous genes integrated in the hostsâ chromosome) and lactic acid (with partial expression of the <italic>ldh</italic> gene from an exogenous plasmid). These two mutants were selected because they represent the cell factories for which we have achieved the highest carbon partitioning coefficient (between new cells and product). The results obtained show that for the ethanol-producing mutant, diverting up to 60â70% of the fixed carbon into product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] causes little notable stress response, but rather a physiological accommodation in the form of an induction of the carbon concentrating mechanism, the CO<sub>2</sub>-fixing enzyme RuBisCO, and additional enzymes involved in the Calvin cycle. The highest levels achievable of carbon partitioning into lactic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] did not lead to a similar increase in abundance of Calvin cycle enzymes. This high lactate productivity required introduction of a plasmid encoded lactate dehydrogenase. In this strain this elicits next to some physiological adaptation, a significantly increased expression of CRISPR associated proteins.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Physiological analysis of product formation, i.e. ethanol and lactic acid, on <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp.

Maximum specific growth rates (<italic>Âµ</italic>) of SAA012 and SAW041 were reduced to 71 and 58% of the value of WT, respectively. The ethanol production observed in SAA012 was 9.88Â Â±Â 0.16Â mM over 19Â days, representing a maximum production rate of 1.33Â Â±Â 0.12Â mmolÂ l<sup>â1</sup> day<sup>â1</sup>, while in the same period the lactic acid accumulated up to 6.19Â Â±Â 0.12Â mM, with a rate of 0.36Â Â±Â 0.01Â mmolÂ l<sup>â1</sup> day<sup>â1</sup> (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). From these physiological data the total carbon fixation rate (<italic>q</italic><sub>CO2</sub>) was calculated (i.e. for conversion into biomass and into product).

During exponential growth of the cells, when OD<sub>730</sub>Â &lt;Â 1 (i.e. up to approximately 0.2 gDW l<sup>â1</sup>), SAA012 exhibits a higher <italic>q</italic><sub>CO2</sub> than both WT and SAW041. The average increase in the <italic>q</italic><sub>CO2</sub> calculated was ~1.5-fold higher than the rate of CO<sub>2</sub> fixation in the WT.

Accordingly, cells of the WT, SAA012 and SAW041 were harvested at OD<sub>730</sub>Â =Â 0.7, 0.7, and 0.4, respectively (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a).

This has resulted in a total of 1,039 unique protein ratios (and thus 716 and 633 proteins that were identified in both product-forming strains and among the three strains, respectively). The list of proteins and their respective ratio(s) quantified in this study are provided in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Table S2, together with their mascot scores.</p><p id="Par31">The distribution of the normalized protein abundance of the three biological replicates of WT, SAA012, and SAW041 is depicted in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. As shown, the protein isotopic ratio of the WT is normally distributed around 1, further emphasizing the reproducibility of the measurements with the reference- and the WT cultures. This allows calculation of significant changes in relative protein expression level of the two product-forming strains, by using the <italic>z</italic> test and the protein ratio distribution of the WT as a reference, followed by Bonferroni correction. This resulted in significance thresholds for the two product-forming strains as described in: â<xref rid="Sec12" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>â; â<xref rid="Sec18" ref-type="sec">Statistical analysis of the protein quantifications</xref>â. Using these boundary conditions a total number of 168 and 153 proteins, respectively, showed a significantly altered abundance in mutant strains SAA012 and SAW041. The two lists of these proteins, including their calculated <italic>p</italic> value, can be found in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: TablesÂ S4, S5, respectively. The numbers of differentially expressed proteins listed in these tables are visualized in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Furthermore, to establish the connection between the up-regulated proteins and the down-regulated proteins of the two product-forming strains, STRING v9.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] plus KEGG pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] enrichment analysis was used to predict the underlying protein interaction network. The protein interaction networks that have resulted from this analysis were reconstructed by Cytoscape v3.1.1.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and are shown in Figs.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, for strain SAA012 and SAW041, respectively. The results of the KEGG pathway enrichment analyses showed that in SAA012, the up-regulated pathways were syn00710âcarbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, and syn00480âglutathione metabolism, while the down-regulated pathways found were syn03010âribosome, and syn00196âphotosynthesis-antenna proteins (<italic>p</italic>Â &lt;Â 0.05). In contrast to SAA012, the enrichment analysis of SAW041 did not reveal specific up-regulated pathways, but only down-regulated pathways. Amongst others, photosynthesis (syn00195), photosynthesis-antenna proteins (syn00196), and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (syn00010) were identified.

As reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], engineering a high-capacity carbon sink in a cyanobacterium is able to stimulate the overall rate of CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation in such organisms. Accordingly, we have observed that our ethanol-producing strain, SAA012, showed a higher <italic>q</italic><sub>CO2</sub> than the WT strain ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; see also Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). A remaining question is whether this higher rate of total carbon fixation is the result of an increase in the activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO, e.g. by release of product inhibition) or that more RuBisCO enzyme is expressed in response to functional expression of the ethanol biosynthetic pathway (i.e. the carbon sink). The proteomic data suggest that the higher <italic>q</italic><sub>CO2</sub> is not exclusively a result of the up-regulation of the RuBisCO enzyme only (which is ~1.4-fold; see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>: Table S4), because some of the downstream enzymes involved in the Calvin cycle, including phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase class 1 (Fda), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase class 1 (Slr0952), and glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (Zwf), that functions in pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), are also (slightly) up-regulated (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). In addition, carbonic anhydrase (encoded by <italic>slr0051</italic>), and the proteins involved in the CO<sub>2</sub> concentrating mechanism, including CcmM and CcmK1, that assist to increase the intracellular CO<sub>2</sub> level, were also considerably increased. This leads to the conclusion that the CO<sub>2</sub>-flux in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> upon engineering of a carbon sink is regulated hierarchically, i.e. by changes of gene expression that adjust enzyme capacities (Vmax), rather than metabolically by interactions of enzymes with substrates, products, or allosteric effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Significantly, we found that phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase (ThiC) which is involved in the biosynthesis of thiamine pyrophosphate (TTP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], was also up-regulated. Pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) catalyses the first step in the metabolic pathway towards ethanol and is one of several enzymes that use TPP as a cofactor. An increase in TPP biosynthesis can be anticipated because of the high-level constitutive expression of the exogenous PDC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intracellular ethanol production reduces expression of the protein synthesis machinery and the phycobilisomes, but activates an oxidative stress response</title><p id="Par34">A large number of ribosomal proteins and the 10Â kDa and 60Â kDa chaperonins are down-regulated in the ethanol-producing strain SAA012, as is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a. This presumably is the result of the growth retardation that is observed in SAA012 (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a) as a consequence of the dramatic rechanneling of intermediary metabolites in these cells. Besides a reduction in the expression of the protein synthesis machinery, also the components of the phycobilisome light harvesting complex, including the structural genes CpcA, CpcB, CpcC1, CpcC2, and CpcG2 (Sll1471), as well as PbsA1 (heme oxygenase 1), HemE and HemF [i.e. the latter three all involved in chromophore (tetrapyrrole) biosynthesis], were decreased in relative abundance. Reduction in the abundance of the phycobilisome complexes in these cells was independently confirmed via recording of whole cell absorption spectra (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2">2</xref>: Figure S1). Significantly, none of the key functional components of the two photosystems were down-regulated in the ethanol-producing strain. A slight (0.7-fold) down-regulation was observed for Psb27, but this component has a role in PS-II repair.

We, therefore, tentatively conclude that significant low-pH stress is not among the consequences of redirection of a major part of the flux of carbon in <italic>Synechocystis</italic> towards <sc>l</sc>-lactic acid. Some of the up-regulated proteins in this strain, like DapB, Asd, ArgF and PurA, function in amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis (see Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Furthermore, three proteins with unknown function, including serum resistance locus BrkB, Slr5088 and Slr0106, were observed to be strongly (i.e. &gt;8-fold) up-regulated. Slr5088, encoded on pSYSM, was recently annotated as a short-chain dehydrogenase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In the SAW041 strain, the NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio is presumably decreased due to the high constitutive expression of the exogenous NADH-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

The expression of these proteins, and their probable function, has recently been characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. They have been described as âCRISPR2- or CRISPR3-system associated proteinsâ. Significantly, two of them, i.e. Sll7065 (CRISPR2-associated protein csm3, Cas7) and Sll7087 (CRISPR3-associated protein Cmr4) were also quantified in SAA012, but did not show any up-regulation in that mutant. Sll7065 was even significantly down-regulated in the ethanol-producing strain. Sll7090 (CRISPR3-associated protein Cmr2, cas10) could only be quantified in SAW041. Little is known about the exact function of these two CRISPR systems in <italic>Synechocystis</italic>, except that the CRISPR3 system is the most abundantly expressed CRISPR system in WT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The CRISPR/Cas systems are often referred to as adaptive immune systems in bacteria and archaea (see reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]), which confer resistance to horizontal gene transfer, including phage transduction, transformation, and conjugation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. It is relevant to note that the lactic acid-producing mutant has been transformed with a self-replicative plasmid, to allow for the required amount of LDH expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. It is still unclear whether the CRISPR/Cas system contributes to decreased genetic stability of the SAW041 strain. Decreased production of lactic acid was occasionally observed after re-culturing this strain from a frozen stock (data not shown).

Data-dependent Q-selected peptide ions were fragmented in the hexapole collision cell at an Argon pressure of 6Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â6</sup> mbar (measured at the ion gauge) and both precursor and fragment ions were detected in the FTICR cell at a resolution of up to 60.000 (m/Îm) with a maximum MS/MS rate of about 2Â Hz. Instrument mass calibration was better than 1.5Â ppm over the m/z range from 250 to 1,500. This yielded more than 9,000 MS/MS spectra over the 125Â min LCâMS/MS chromatogram. Raw FTâMS/MS data of the 9 protein gel fractions were processed as multi-file (MudPIT) with the MASCOT DISTILLER program, version 2.4.3.1 (64 bits), MDRO 2.4.3.0 (MATRIX science, London, UK), including the Search toolbox and the Quantification toolbox. Peak-picking for both MS and MS/MS spectra was optimized for a mass resolution of up to 60.000 (m/Îm). Peaks were fitted to a simulated isotope distribution with a correlation threshold of 0.7 and with a minimum signal to noise ratio of 2. The processed data were searched with the MASCOT server program 2.3.02 (MATRIX science) against a complete <italic>Synechocystis</italic> sp. PCC6803 proteome database obtained from the UniProt consortium (May, 2014; 3,506 entries in total) plus the appropriate additional protein sequences for the two mutant strains. The database was further complemented with its corresponding decoy data base for statistical analyses of peptide false discovery rate (FDR). Trypsin was used as the hydrolytic enzyme and 1 missed cleavage was allowed in peptide identification. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was used as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine as a variable modification. The peptide mass tolerance was set to 10Â ppm and the peptide fragment mass tolerance was set to 0.03 Dalton. The quantification method was set to the metabolic <sup>15</sup>N labeling method to enable MASCOT to identify both <sup>14</sup>N and <sup>15</sup>N peptides. The MASCOT MudPIT peptide identification score was set at a cut-off of 20. At this cut-off, and based on the number of assigned decoy peptide sequences, a peptide false discovery rate of ~2% for all analyses was obtained. Using the quantification toolbox, the isotopic ratios for all identified proteins were determined as weighted average of the isotopic ratios of the corresponding light over heavy peptides. Selected critical settings were: require bold red: on, significance threshold: 0.05: protocol type: precursor; correction: element <sup>15</sup>N; value 99.4; report ratio L/H; integration method: Simpsons; integration source: survey; allow elution time shift: on; elution time delta: 20Â s; Std err.
