A small number of such satellites can provide full sky coverage and complement, or in some cases replace the existing gamma-ray missions in detection of transient gamma-ray events. The aim of this study is to test gamma-ray detection using a novel commercially available CeBr<sub>3</sub> scintillator combined with SiPM readout in a near-space environment and inform further technology development for a future space mission. A prototype gamma-ray detector was built using a CeBr<sub>3</sub> scintillator and an array of 16 J-Series SiPMs by ON Semiconductor. SiPM readout was performed using SIPHRA, a radiation-tolerant low-power integrated circuit developed by IDEAS. The detector was flown as a piggyback payload on the Advanced Scintillator Compton Telescope balloon flight from Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility. The payload included the detector, a Raspberry Pi on-board computer, a custom power supply board, temperature and pressure sensors, a Global Navigation Satellite System receiver and a satellite modem. The balloon delivered the detector to 37 km altitude where its detection capabilities and readout were tested in the radiation-intense near-space environment. The detector demonstrated continuous operation during the 8-hour flight and after the landing. It performed spectral measurements in an energy range of 100 keV to 8 MeV and observed the 511 keV gamma-ray line arising from positron annihilation in the atmosphere with full width half maximum of 6.8%. During ascent and descent, the detector count rate peaked at an altitude of 16 km corresponding to the point of maximum radiation intensity in the atmosphere. Despite several engineering issues discovered after the flight test, the results of this study confirm the feasibility of using CeBr<sub>3</sub> scintillator, SiPMs, and SIPHRA in future space missions.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Gamma-ray

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Gamma-ray space missions including the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and INTEGRAL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] observed and discovered many new sources, including transient sources such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs; e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]), soft gamma-ray repeaters (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]), and terrestrial gamma flashes (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]). The need for gamma-ray telescopes was recently heightened with the beginning of the gravitational wave era in 2015 with the direct detection of gravitational waves from a binary black hole (BBH) merger by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], followed by the detection of additional nine BBH mergers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The detection of the gravitational wave signal from a binary neutron star merger, GW170817 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] by the LIGO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and Virgo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] experiments in coincidence with a short gamma-ray burst, GRB 170817A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] was another breakthrough discovery which led to a large follow-up campaign by space and ground based telescopes and highlighted the importance of gamma-ray missions to the future detection and localisation of GRBs in the context of multi-messenger astronomy.</p><p id="Par3">A challenge for future gamma-ray astronomy is the potential lack of future missions for transient follow-up. All current gamma-ray missions have already exceeded the nominal mission lifetimes. Future large missions include SVOM which is a mission with limited sky coverage due for launch in 2021 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. While other mission proposals are under review, e.g. THESEUS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and AMEGO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], no follow-on mission is firmly in the pipeline from any of the large space agencies opening up a gap in capabilities in the coming years. This coincides with the timeline for major upgrades of the gravitational wave facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] which will likely lead to the discovery of more gravitational wave sources including binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, generally believed to be the progenitors of short GRBs. The simultaneous discovery of gravitational wave and electromagnetic signatures requires dedicated and coordinated observations by large communities of both ground and space-based observatories.</p><p id="Par4">Even if the current missions were to remain operational, they do not provide full sky coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. One way to improve coverage at low cost is via CubeSats with instrumentation capable of detecting gamma rays, such as BurstCube [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], MoonBEAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], GRID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and HERMES [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The requirements to adequately detect and localise GRBs in the multimessenger era can be achieved with the existing fleet of GRB detecting instruments by support from such CubeSat programs.</p><p id="Par5">All the mentioned CubeSat missions employ either silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) or silicon drift detectors (SDDs) for detection of scintillation light produced by gamma rays. Although SiPMs have replaced traditional photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) in many terrestrial applications, this technology is still very new in the space industry. Several small missions have been designed to space-qualify SiPMs together with new scintillator materials, including the Strontium Iodide Radiation Instrument (SIRI) launched in December 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] which used a europium-doped strontium iodide (SrI<sub>2</sub>:Eu) scintillator, and the Gamma-ray Module (GMOD) to be flown on board the 2U EIRSAT-1 CubeSat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Based on previous developments using novel lanthanum bromide (LaBr<sub>3</sub>) and cerium bromide (CeBr<sub>3</sub>) scintillators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], GMOD will comprise a 25mmÃ25mmÃ40mm CeBr<sub>3</sub> crystal and an array of 16 J-Series SiPMs by ON Semiconductor (formerly SensL). The readout will be performed using Silicon Photomultiplier Readout ASIC, a low-power radiation-tolerant application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) recently developed by Integrated Detector Electronics AS (IDEAS), Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">This paper presents the Gamma-ray Module Demonstrator (GMoDem), a self-contained development model of GMOD which was flown on a high-altitude balloon flight in order to test in a near-space environment the technologies that will be used in the GMOD detector. GMoDem was hosted as a piggyback payload on Advanced Scintillator Compton Telescope (ASCOT) balloon flight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] launched from Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility (CSBF) in Texas. The paper describes the payload design, flight preparations, data analysis and reports the results of the flight test.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>GMoDem hardware</title><p id="Par7">The components being evaluated in GMoDem are those which will comprise the GMOD detector assembly: a CeBr<sub>3</sub> scintillator coupled to an SiPM array with readout via the SIPHRA ASIC. For the purposes of operating these components in GMoDem, a SIPHRA evaluation board is used, connected to an IDEAS Galao board designed for evaluation of IDEAS readout ASICs. The Galao board is in turn connected via ethernet to a single-board computer (SBC) which processes and records events from the detector. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> gives an overview of the GMoDem components which are described in detail below.

Optical gel was applied to the quartz window to improve light transmission to the SiPMs.

This configuration is informed by the SIPHRA readout requirements and the short development time available for GMoDem. The SIPHRA current mode input stage (CMIS) requires negative charge input which therefore requires a connection to the SiPM cathode. Ideally, a custom 16-SiPM common anode array such as that planned for GMOD would have been used, however the individual J-series SiPMs are provided in Through Silicon Via (TSV) packages which would have required an outsourced soldering process which could not be completed in the available time frame. J-series 6 mm tileable SiPMs with factory-attached connectors were sought instead but these are unfortunately only available as 2 Ã 2 or 4 Ã 4 common cathode arrays. While these arrays can be used with SIPHRA, only a single input channel can be used for the entire array rather than one input per SiPM. A compromise of using as many of SIPHRAâs input channels as possible and using commercially available socketed SiPMs led to this configuration of a 4 Ã 4 SiPM array which was actually a 2 Ã 2 common-anode array of 2 Ã 2 common-cathode arrays.</p><p id="Par10">A carrier printed circuit board (PCB) was designed and assembled in-house to accommodate the four ON Semiconductor arrays using suitable sockets. The sockets were positioned to provide the correct 0.2 mm spacing between the arrays, matching the SiPM spacing used within the arrays, giving a uniform spacing between all sixteen SiPMs. The carrier PCB also featured the power and readout connectors, four low-pass filters to filter the bias supply to each of the common-anode arrays, and a series of mounting holes used to attach a light-tight shroud over the assembly and to mount the assembly within GMoDem. The light-tight shroud was 3D-printed using a design that had previously performed well in the laboratory environment and was attached to the carrier PCB using a neoprene gasket to maintain a light-tight seal.</p><p id="Par11">The SiPM array was operated at a fixed overvoltage above the SiPM breakdown voltage to maintain a constant gain. As the breakdown voltage is temperature dependent, a DS18b20 temperature sensor was attached to the underside of the carrier PCB to allow the flight computer to determine the array temperature and apply the appropriate bias voltage using the programmable PSU (see SectionÂ <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">2.5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Silicon photomultiplier readout</title><p id="Par12">The SIPHRA ASIC was designed specifically for the purpose of readout and digitisation of SiPM sensors in space applications. It was therefore designed with latch-up immunity, single event upset mitigation and error correction, and low-power considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As SIPHRA will be used in GMOD, it is one of the main components being evaluated in GMoDem.</p><p id="Par13">SIPHRA has sixteen SiPM input channels and an internal seventeenth summing channel which provides a sum of the sixteen inputs. As described in SectionÂ <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">2.1</xref>, only four of the sixteen input channels are used in GMoDem.</p><p id="Par14">SIPHRA is highly configurable via a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) and in GMoDem it is used as a pulse height spectrometer. Each of the four SiPM outputs is connected to a CMIS which provides programmable input attenuation. Each CMIS is connected to an independent current integrator, pulse shaper, and track and hold unit. The current integrator, pulse shaper, and track and hold unit chain is also replicated for the summing channel whose current integrator is connected to all sixteen CMISs. The track and hold units are connected to a single 12-bit analogue to digital converter (ADC) via an analog multiplexer. The digitised signals are clocked out over a serial output which is synchronised to SIPHRAâs input clock source.</p><p id="Par15">The SIPHRA used in GMoDem was a chip on board (CoB) version featuring a silicon die wire-bonded directly to a large 129 mm Ã 124 mm evaluation PCB with 0.1-inch pin-headers and SMA sockets for connection to the SiPMs and with a large board-to-board connector to connect to the IDEAS Galao evaluation platform. An aluminium chip cover is bolted to the PCB to protect the SIPHRA silicon die.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data processing and storage</title><p id="Par16">A Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ SBC is used for the on-board computer (OBC). The interface between the OBC and SIPHRA is via the Galao board which is connected to the OBC using ethernet. Configuration of SIPHRA is performed over SPI by Galao in response to commands from the OBC.

The primary storage for the experiment data was a rugged USB flash drive which was connected to the OBC via a short USB extension cable and mounted inside the GMoDem enclosure in a location which was easily accessible to the balloon recovery team in the event that not all of the experiment could be recovered.</p><p id="Par18">The flight software was written to be completely autonomous requiring simply that power be connected to GMoDem and the Remove Before Flight (RBF) pin removed for data acquisition to begin. A process control system was used to ensure that any processes which ended during the flight were automatically restarted.</p><p id="Par19">In addition to automatic configuration and data acquisition from SIPHRA, the flight software logged housekeeping data from a number of sources connected to the OBC. Three DS18b20 â1-wireâ temperature sensors were used to monitor the internal temperature inside the GMoDem enclosure, the external temperature, and the temperature of the SiPM array. An MS5611 I<sup>2</sup>C barometric pressure sensor was used to monitor pressure. A u-blox M8 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver was used to give positional data. The u-blox receiver was chosen because it can easily be configured in âairborneâ mode which will continue to give valid position data at altitudes up to 50 km while many other brands of GNSS receiver will deactivate at high altitudes in an excessively cautious effort to comply with International Traffic in Arms Regulations. The temperatures, pressure, latitude, longitude, and altitude were recorded every 10 s as housekeeping data throughout the flight. As with the experiment data, the housekeeping data was also stored on both the SD card and USB flash drive.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Communication</title><p id="Par20">As GMoDem was a piggyback payload, the communications systems provided by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) were not used in order to have as little an impact as possible on the operations of the ASCOT host. Instead, GMoDem included a RockBLOCK 9603 transceiver based on the Iridium 9603 modem allowing for Short Burst Data (SBD) satellite communication which was advantageous as it did not require any local ground infrastructure. The transceiver was connected to the on-board computer using a USB to serial adapter and the flight software controlled the modem using a simple AT command interface.</p><p id="Par21">Iridium SBD is analogous to SMS on cell phones, it is not capable of transferring a lot of data such as experiment data, but was useful for monitoring of housekeeping data. The flight software was programmed to attempt to transmit housekeeping data every 5 minutes throughout the flight. During these transmissions, messages from the ground could also be downloaded from the satellite. The flight software had a small command set that could be parsed from incoming messages to modify parameters or manually reset various flight software components.</p><p id="Par22">The network access provider, RockBLOCK, provided a web interface to send messages to and display messages from GMoDem.

Each battery contained twelve G62 lithium sulfur dioxide (LiSO<sub>2</sub>) cells in series providing a nominal unloaded voltage of 36 V and capacity of 34 Ah. The batteries were connected in parallel using a wiring harness and then connected to the GMoDem PSU to extend the available running time of the experiment. The power input to GMoDem from the batteries was via a Neutrik twist-lock-latching powerCON connector, which was chosen to provide a very easy way for CSBF technicians to disconnect power to the experiment during recovery.</p><p id="Par25">The PSU took advantage of having such a high voltage available from the batteries to bias the SiPMs directly without having to use a boost converter. The positive terminal of the battery was used as GMoDemâs ground reference, allowing the negative terminal to be used as a â 36 V rail. The battery was also connected to a JTD2048S05 isolated 5 V voltage regulator. The negative output of the regulator is connected to GMoDemâs ground, creating 5 V, GND and ââ36 V rails. The 5 V is used to power the on-board computer (and USB connected components) and Galao. SIPHRA was powered from the voltage and current sources included on the Galao board. An inhibit on the 5 V voltage regulator is used as an RBF pin switch, powering down the on-board computer, Galao and SIPHRA when the pin is present, providing a very easy way to power on and off GMoDem.</p><p id="Par26">As the SiPM gain is related to the overvoltage, the voltage at which the SiPM is biased above the breakdown voltage, the detector gain can be adjusted by adjusting the SiPM bias voltage. Conversely, maintaining a constant gain requires maintaining a constant overvoltage. The J-series SiPMs offer good temperature stability but the breakdown voltage does have a temperature dependence of 21.5 mV/Â°C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To maintain a constant gain, the bias voltage needs to be continuously adjusted to compensate for variations of the SiPM temperature.</p><p id="Par27">A series of voltage references and high voltage, high current OP551 op-amps were used to regulate the ââ36 V battery voltage to the desired SiPM bias voltage. The first stage op-amp in an inverting configuration generated a â 15 V output from a 2.5 V reference. This output and the 0â5 V output from an SPI digital to analogue converter (DAC) connected to the on-board computer were used in a second stage inverting op-amp with a gain of 1.75 to generate an SiPM bias voltage range of between ââ26.25 V and ââ30 V which could be set by the flight software.</p><p id="Par28">Galao and SIPHRA were powered through a solid state relay which was controlled by a general purpose input/output (GPIO) pin on the on-board computer. This allowed the detector to be power-cycled by telecommand or automatically by the flight software in response to communication errors between the on-board computer and Galao.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Structure / enclosure</title><p id="Par29">The internal structure (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) consisted of a stack of components mounted on two custom aluminium plates. The overall size of the plates were dictated by the size of the Galao and SIPHRA boards which were mounted securely between the two plates using M3 stand-offs through all available mounting holes on the PCBs. The detector assembly and data handling components were mounted to the top plate, typically via M3 stand-offs and screws though in some cases the components had no mounting holes and so friction-fit brackets were 3D printed and secured to the aluminium plate with adhesive tape. This stack arrangement is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The bottom plate included six mounting tabs which were used to bolt the assembly down onto M5 stand-offs on the bottom of the enclosure. The tabs extended out beyond the top layer so that the entire assembly could be easily removed and reinstalled in the enclosure quickly.

The insides of the plastic panels were insulated with 25 mm of extruded polystyrene insulation. With this construction, the edges of all faces of the enclosure had continuous T-slots into which T-slot nuts could be inserted and brackets attached, allowing a very flexible mounting solution.</p><p id="Par31">The ASCOT gondola included two plywood decks, one either side of the detector, which were used to carry batteries and the GMoDem payload. The GMoDem enclosure was bolted to one of the plywood decks using six brackets.

Over the following three months, the GMoDem hardware and flight software were finalised and a mission-readiness review was conducted by CSBF. The flight hardware assembly was shipped to University of New Hampshire, Durham, USA (UNH) by courier to be transported to CSBF along with ASCOT and its ground support equipment. GMoDem was picked up from University College Dublin, Ireland (UCD) on 16 May 2018 but, due to a customs delay upon entering the United States, did not arrive at UNH until 24 May.</p><p id="Par33">The UCD team members arrived at CSBF on 3 June. Over the following days, GMoDem was carefully unpacked and check-out tests of the instrument were conducted. These tests included the pre-flight test and calibration of the gamma-ray instrument itself, testing of the housekeeping sub-systems including GPS and satellite communication, and ensuring that the PSU worked correctly with the CSBF batteries. Following satisfactory check-out of GMoDem and of the ASCOT instrument by the team from UNH, GMoDem was mechanically integrated into the ASCOT gondola. The fully integrated gondola then underwent a âhangâ test and a flight-readiness review was conducted.</p><p id="Par34">Unfortunately, the successful flight-readiness review was followed by several weeks of unsuitable weather conditions caused by a tropical storm forming in the Gulf of Mexico. Due to prior commitments, it was not possible for the UCD GMoDem team to remain at CSBF beyond 25 June. The UNH ASCOT team very kindly offered to prepare and, if necessary, deactivate GMoDem for the upcoming launch attempts while the UCD team remotely operated GMoDem via the Iridium satellite communication system.</p><p id="Par35">Following several launch attempts in early July cancelled due to unfavourable weather conditions, the balloon was successfully launched on the morning of 5 July 2018. A summary of the balloon flight is given in TableÂ <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Two hours after the launch the balloon reached its float altitude of 37 km. The float period lasted just over five hours, with the balloon travelling a distance of about 700 km from the launch site (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). After that the ground crew sent the command to separate the gondola from the balloon terminating the flight. Deploying a parachute, the gondola experienced a rapid descent which lasted about 40 minutes. It landed near the New Mexico border, close to the town of Pecos where it was recovered the next day. The total duration of the flight was just over eight hours.

The power was disconnected upon recovery of the payload, ending the acquisition of data. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> shows various parameters monitored throughout the experiment. We note that before launch the temperature inside the GMoDem enclosure reached approximately 48Â°C. This high temperature was mainly caused by relatively high power dissipated by the Galao board and OBC combined with good enclosure insulation and warm weather. After launch the internal temperature dropped by 8Â°C due to much colder environment at the float altitude and remained relatively stable during the float stage. As illustrated in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, the pressure sensor was able to accurately record small changes in the atmospheric pressure tracing altitude variations during the float stage.

Unfortunately upon its arrival it was discovered that the plastic housing of the scintillator had warped, with two of the sides bowing inwards and firmly clamping the scintillator inside the housing. The screws holding the housing to the SiPM array were found to be loose, also likely due the housing deformation as they had been well torqued before the balloon campaign. The housing deformation and loose attachment to the array may have caused an air gap or bubble between the scintillator and SiPMs. This problem can explain a sudden shift in the detector calibration observed between 2 July and 3 July (SectionÂ <xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">5.1</xref>). The housing deformations is believed to have been caused by the high temperature inside the GMoDem enclosure rising to 51Â°C during the launch attempt on 2 July.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Analysis</title><p id="Par38">The data were analysed in Python using a variety of packages including Pandas, SciPy, NumPy, and Matplotlib. All data were imported to various Pandas data frames and indexed by time stamp allowing efficient binning based on time.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>SIPHRA data</title><p id="Par39">The data generated by SIPHRA include a trigger-type flag, and the ADC values for each of the enabled channels. To record when each trigger has occurred, Galao prepends the SIPHRA data with the elapsed cycles of the SIPHRA clock. Correlation between the clock cycles and UTC is achieved in the flight software by inserting a standard UTC Unix time stamp into the recorded data after every 10 triggers.</p><p id="Par40">The clock cycle count is represented as a 32-bit number by Galao and therefore rolls over at a value of 4,294,967,295. As the SIPHRA clock was run at 2.5 MHz, the clock count rolls over approximately once every 28 minutes and 38 seconds. The data are first processed by replacing the clock cycle count with a monotonically increasing clock cycle number which does not roll over. A linear relationship between the monotonically increasing clock count and the Unix time stamp can then be established which is used to reconstruct a Unix time stamp for each SIPHRA trigger.</p><p id="Par41">Following time stamp reconstruction, the data are then separated by trigger type. The trigger-type flag can be used to determine if triggers are internally or externally generated. The internally generated triggers are pulses from the SiPMs corresponding to events or interactions of gamma rays in the scintillator while the externally generated triggers are forced readouts initiated by Galao at a fixed rate. These forced readouts are used to measure the baseline signal throughout the flight. Separate Pandas data frames are used to store the event data (internally generated triggers) and baseline data (externally generated triggers).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Baseline subtraction</title><p id="Par42">The first step in processing the event data is to subtract from each pulse-height measurement the baseline value corresponding to the zero signal. The baselines for all SIPHRA channels are sampled during short dedicated runs using periodic externally forced readouts. In addition, external triggers are generated at a 2 Hz rate during normal data taking to determine if the baseline signal shows any evolution throughout the flight. The triggers are then sorted into bins each representing 5 minutes of time throughout the flight. Within these time-bins, the triggers are sorted into a histogram by ADC value to generate a spectrum of the baseline values. The baselines for the four SIPHRA channels connected to the SiPM subarrays (labeled AâD) are shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>.

The baseline spectra are very well described by a Gaussian distribution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Response linearisation</title><p id="Par45">The SiPM response is not strictly proportional to the number of incident photons. This non-proportionality becomes noticeable when the number of photons is large enough to fire a significant fraction of SiPM microcells (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]). GMoDem also suffers from additional non-linearity caused by the SIPHRA ASIC which completely saturates at a level of about 3800 ADC channels (out of 4096 channels for the 12-bit ADC). To correct for SiPM and SIPHRA non-linearity, a set of four correction functions were developed, one for each subarray connected to a single SIPHRA input. These functions are applied to the data after baseline subtraction.</p><p id="Par46">The correction functions are based on measurements of the response of GMoDemâs SiPM array to light pulses produced by a light emitting diode (LED). The measurements were performed in a light-tight box using a set-up shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>. The SiPM array was placed at a distance of 40 cm opposite a 430 nm blue LED which was equipped with a light diffuser to provide uniform illumination on the SiPM array surface. The LED was pulsed with 40 ns square pulses generated by an Aim-TTi TG5011 function generator with 2 kHz frequency. The light intensity was controlled by changing the pulse amplitude between 1.38 â 3.00 V. The SIPHRA ASIC and SiPM biasing was configured as during the balloon flight.

The PMT was equipped with a tapered voltage divider to improve pulse linearity and biased to 1000 V. It was positioned such that the reflected light from the SiPM array was directed towards the PMT, thereby reducing the amount of light detected and preventing PMT response non-linearity. The PMT signal was sampled and digitally integrated using a CAEN V1720 waveform digitiser (12-bit, 250 MS/s).</p><p id="Par48">The SiPM and PMT responses were recorded in terms of digitised pulse height as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>. The PMT demonstrated a nearly linear signal dependence on the LED pulse amplitude (voltage setting of the function generator), indicating that the number of photons emitted by the LED has an almost linear relationship with the pulse amplitude, although deviations from the linear behaviour can be seen below 2 V. At the same time, the SiPMs with SIPHRA readout showed apparent non-linearity and saturation for strong light pulses. By relating the signals from the four SiPM subarrays to the response of the PMT (assumed to be proportional to the number of emitted photons), linearisation corrections were generated across the range of ADC channels. A plot of the relationship between PMT and GMoDem SiPM response is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref> for all four SiPM channels. The PMT response data has had a re-scale factor applied to give a near match of the SiPM response values. The re-scale factor was calculated by fitting a linear function to the relationship between the PMT and SiPM response in a low signal range (&lt;â2000 channels for SiPM response). This re-scale factor is not particularly important, as although the PMT response is linear, the units of measurement are essentially arbitrary. For each SiPM subarray, the response correction function was generated by cubic spline interpolation between the SiPM subarray and PMT response data as shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref>. Above 3600 ADC channels the GMoDem response becomes saturated and cannot be reliably corrected, as a small error in the measured SiPM response corresponds to a large change in the linearised signal. At this point it is only possible to determine the lower limit for the linearised signal.

A typical light yield of an encapsulated CeBr<sub>3</sub> crystal is about 40 ph/keV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which gives 26480 photons for a 662 keV gamma ray fully absorbed by the crystal, or 11383 photoelectrons assuming PDE = 0.37 for CeBr<sub>3</sub> emission (<italic>Î»</italic><sub>peak</sub> = 380 nm) and CT = 0.13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Comparing the number of photoelectrons to a mean observed signal of 2018 linearised ADC channels from a fully absorbed 662 keV gamma ray (SectionÂ <xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">5.1</xref>), the conversion factor is estimated to be around 5.6 photoelectrons per channel. The maximum signal of an SiPM subarray in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref> is about 5000 linearised ADC channels, which corresponds to 28000 photoelectrons.

It should be noted, however, that the SiPM response also depends on the SiPM overvoltage (excess bias voltage above the breakdown voltage). Therefore, linearisation functions are only valid for a specific overvoltage; it was essential that the non-linearity measurements were performed at the same overvolatge as used during the balloon flight. In addition, the SiPM response non-linearity depends on the duration of the light pulse: it decreases for long pulses that are comparable or longer than the SiPM recovery time. The scintillation decay time constant for CeBr<sub>3</sub> is about 20 ns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which is smaller than the 40 ns pulse duration used in the LED measurements. This means that the correction functions generated from the LED measurements may undercorrect the non-linearity of the GMoDem detector. This effect is not expected to be large, as in both cases the light pulse duration is smaller than the SiPM recovery time (50 ns specified by the manufacturer but possibly longer as the recovery time can be affected by the readout impedance).</p><p id="Par52">No correction for scintillator non-proportionality is used in this work.

However, the detector signal dropped approximately by a factor of 1.6 between 2 July and 3 July and further reduced by launch on 5 July, rendering the pre-flight calibration invalid for in-flight measurements. This sudden reduction in the detector signal is associated with the damage to the plastic detector housing discovered after the flight which probably resulted in poor optical coupling between the scintillator and SiPMs. After GMoDem was shipped back to UCD and the scintillator was recoupled to the SiPM array, the detector response to 511 keV gamma rays from a <sup>22</sup>Na source was found to be consistent with the pre-flight calibration.

As the temperature increases, the gain of the detector decreases and so too does the position of the 511 keV line. This behaviour can be well explained by the 21.5 mV/Â°C temperature dependence of the breakdown voltage of the J-series SiPMs. As the temperature increases, the breakdown voltage of the SiPMs also increases. For a fixed bias voltage, an increased breakdown voltage gives a decreased overvoltage and therefore a reduced SiPM gain.</p><p id="Par70">As detailed in SectionÂ <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">2.5</xref>, GMoDem was designed with an adjustable power supply specifically for the purpose of adjusting the bias voltage in order to maintain a constant overvoltage and therefore constant gain, compensating for variations in the temperature of the SiPMs. During the flight, the GMoDem flight software was constantly adjusting the bias voltage of the SiPM array based on the SiPM array temperature in order to correct for the breakdown voltage temperature dependence and was programmed to do so at a rate of 21.5 mV/Â°C. The negative correlation between temperature and gain which is obtained from the flight data suggests that the bias power supply was under-correcting for the expected temperature dependence.

This effectively corrects for the incorrect bias voltage that was applied during the flight.</p><p id="Par72">The first approach to doing so parametrises the detector scale factor as a function of the SiPM array temperature utilising the linear fit between the temperature and the 511 keV position. FigureÂ <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">22</xref> shows a time-resolved spectrum of the 511 keV line overplot with the SiPM array temperature having been transformed to channel-space according to the fit between temperature and the 511 keV line position shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig21" ref-type="fig">21</xref>.

Either method works well and results in a relatively stable position of the line throughout the flight. The advantage of the second method is that it can correct any changes in the detector energy scale whether they are temperature related or not. However, it requires a constant observation of the 511 keV line (or another calibration source) and also needs relatively long time bins to accumulate a sufficient number of events.

Prior to launch, the plastic housing of the detector was significantly damaged by the relatively high temperature inside the payload enclosure, which resulted in poor coupling of the scintillator and SiPMs. This reduced the detector signal by a factor of 1.6 and caused a loss in the energy resolution. The second problem was a significant dependence of the detector signal on temperature. It is attributed to a temperature dependent deviation of the SiPM bias voltage generated by the PSU from the requested value. This is a power supply issue that can be remedied by using a voltage monitor for the generated bias voltage. It is also possible to track and correct for variations in the signal scale using the position of the 511 keV line in a time-resolved spectrum.</p><p id="Par81">The balloon test did not reveal any other problems or concerns for detector operation in space. The results of this study confirm the feasibility of using CeBr<sub>3</sub> scintillator, SiPMs, and SIPHRA readout circuit in future space missions.</p><p id="Par82">The effects of SiPM radiation damage on the detector performance have been assessed in a follow-up study, where the same SiPMs were irradiated with 101.4 MeV protons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Depending on orbit and mission lifetime, the SiPM dark current and noise can increase by orders of magnitude, increasing the power requirements and limiting the ability of the detector to detect low energy gamma rays. However, a configuration using a bright CeBr<sub>3</sub> scintillator together with a relatively small array of 16 SiPMs should still be able to detect 60 keV gamma rays after 6 years in a 550 km orbit with 40Â° inclination.</p><p id="Par83">The same technology will be employed for the GMOD detector for the EIRSAT-1 satellite being built at UCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The main difference is that GMOD needs to be more robust and compact enough to fit into the 2U CubeSat. It will use a longer CeBr<sub>3</sub> crystal and a custom-built 16-SiPM array composed of the same J-Series sensors. It will also have a small custom SIPHRA board adapted to the size of the detector. To reduce the power requirements of the detector, the Galao board based on the Zynq-7000 system on chip will be replaced by a low-power microcontroller solution. The detector housing will be made of aluminium, therefore it will not be prone to thermal damage observed in the balloon experiment. GMOD will also include a monitor for the SiPM bias voltage to prevent any discrepancy between the programmed voltage and the actual output.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to the ASCOT team (Peter Bloser, Mark McConnell, Jason Legere, Colin Frost, Tejaswita Sharma, and James Ryan) and staff of Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility for their invaluable support preparing and conducting the balloon flight.
