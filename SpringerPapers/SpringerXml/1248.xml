For organic–inorganic halide perovskites that have yielded highly efficient photovoltaic devices, however, it remains unclear whether the photon recycling effect is significant enough to improve solar cell efficiency. Here we quantitatively evaluate the re-absorption and re-emission processes to determine photon recycling efficiency in hybrid perovskite with its single crystals by measuring the ratio of the re-emitted photons to the initially excited photons, which is realized by modulating their polarization to differentiate them. The photon recycling efficiencies are revealed to be less than 0.5% in CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub> single crystals under excitation intensity close to one sun, highlighting the intrinsically long carrier recombination lifetime instead of the photon-recycling-induced photon propagation as the origin of their long carrier diffusion length.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Fang<italic>et al</italic>. develop a method to determine the photon recycling efficiency for organic-inorganic hybrid single crystal perovskites by differentiating between emitted and re-absorbed photons based on their polarization difference.

This is already higher than that of the commercial multicrystalline Si solar cells and is approaching that of single crystal ones. One contribution of the high PCE of OIHP solar cells is from its small open-circuit voltage (<italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>) deficiency, that is, (<italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub>–<italic>eV</italic><sub>OC</sub>)/<italic>e</italic>, where <italic>E</italic><sub>g</sub> is the optical band gap, and <italic>e</italic> is the elementary charge. We have demonstrated that by mitigating the energy disorder in the organic electron transport layer via solvent annealing, the <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> deficiency of planar-structured CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> (MAPbI<sub>3</sub>) perovskite solar cells can be reduced to as low as 0.42 V. <italic>Bi et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> also reported that by optimizing the composition of the perovskite layer to enhance the electroluminescence yield of the solar cells, the <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> of the best device with a PCE of 20.8% can reach 1.15 V. This corresponds to a <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> deficiency of 0.40 V, which is much lower than that of organic solar cells and is comparable to those of copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and single crystal Si solar cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. However, the present <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> deficiency in OIHP solar cells is still larger than that of the best GaAs solar cells, which is around 0.30 V, while in the latter case it was proposed that the photon recycling effect contributes to the high <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub>. So a hypothesis that naturally arises is that the photon recycling effect may also exist in OIHP materials giving rise to high <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> in perovskite solar cells. There are two kinds of definitions of photon recycling in literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. One only considers one-cycle of photon re-absorption, which refers to the radiatively emitted photons after external light excitation can be absorbed again by the photoactive layer itself. In this case, the photon recycling efficiency is the ratio of re-absorbed photons versus the total emitted photons. As shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(a)</xref>, for a 1 mm thick CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub> (MAPbBr<sub>3</sub>) single crystal, most of the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum falls in its own absorption spectrum, leading to a re-absorption ratio of 94.2% calculated by dividing the integrated intensity of the self-filtered PL by that of the original PL. The other definition considers the multiple cycles of photon re-emission and re-absorption processes, and thus the way to characterize the photon-recycling efficiency is to measure the final emission intensity after multiple cycles. As a result of the repeated re-absorption and re-emission processes, the photon recycling effect allows the building up of charge carriers in the active layer to increase the quasi-Fermi-level splitting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Since we are more concerned on whether the photon-recycling effect is strong enough to impact the <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> of perovskite solar cells, we focused on the measurement of emission intensity after multiple cycles of re-absorption and re-emission.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Scheme of the photon recycling measurement method.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of a 1 mm thick CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbBr<sub>3</sub> (MAPbBr<sub>3</sub>) single crystal (SC) measured with photomask (red curve), its normalized transmission spectrum (green curve), and the calculated transmitted PL spectrum (blue curve) by multiplying the PL spectrum by the transmission spectrum; (<bold>b</bold>) The schematic drawing of the photon recycling process in perovskite single crystals; The PL excited on the surface of the single crystal is absorbed during its transmission through the crystal and re-excite photons again, so that the emission from the bottom of the single crystal includes both the filtered photons (<italic>PL</italic><sub>F</sub>) and recycled photons (<italic>PL</italic><sub>R</sub>); (<bold>c</bold>) The schematic diagram of the measurement setup of photon recycling efficiency in perovskite single crystals; The <italic>PL</italic><sub>R</sub> and <italic>PL</italic><sub>F</sub> components can be differentiated based on their polarization difference, and the ratio of <italic>PL</italic><sub>R</sub> to incident PL (<italic>PL</italic><sub>I</sub>) defines the photon recycling efficiency; (<bold>d</bold>) The schematic diagram of the measurement setup to determine the ratio of optical birefringence induced unblocked <italic>PL</italic><sub>F</sub> after transmission through perovskite single crystal by illuminating it with a 650 nm light emitting diode (LED); The intensity ratio of birefringence effect induced unblocked light (<italic>I</italic><sub>B</sub>, when P1⊥P2) and transmitted light through the single crystal (<italic>I</italic><sub>T</sub>, when P1||P2) defines the contribution of the unblocked <italic>PL</italic><sub>F</sub> to the <italic>PL</italic><sub>R</sub> spectrum.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2017_Article_BFncomms14417_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par4">Materials with high photon recycling efficiency generally meet two criteria: (1) large overlapping of its PL spectrum with the absorption spectrum, that is, the materials should have a small Stokes shift or even an anti-Stokes shift, so that the self-absorption of light can be efficient; and (2) a high-internal PL quantum yield (higher than 80% for GaAs under strong illumination intensity of 100 sun)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. As demonstrated above, the re-absorption probability is very high in MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> single crystals. Yamada <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> also observed a similar re-absorption phenomenon in MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystals from a two-photon PL measurement. Such a large self-absorption ratio in perovskite materials meets the prerequisite for efficient photon recycling. It should be noted that the Stokes shift is usually positive for perovskite thin film, that is, the emission peak is red-shifted compared with the absorption edge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The overlapping of the absorption curve and PL emission curve for a thick perovskite single crystal is purely a thickness effect, as thicker perovskite can absorb more band tail light, leading to a gradual red-shift of the absorption edge with the increase in perovskite thickness. Moreover, a high-PL quantum yield above 90% has been reported in some OIHP nanomaterials, which, however, does not make efficient solar cells because of a poor charge transport property<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The photon recycling scenario was further promoted by the observation of unique double PL peaks in the PL spectra of many perovskite single crystals of different compositions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>, despite the additional lower energy peak also assigned to the emission of excitons bound to the surface defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> or the excess PbBr<sub>2</sub> (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>). Recently, Pazos-Outón <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> first reported experimental evidence for the photon recycling effect in lead triiodide perovskite polycrystalline thin films being that charge generation was observed in a region longer than 50 μm away from the light absorbing region. Though this length has not reached the reported longest carrier diffusion length in single crystal perovskite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, it is far beyond the diffusion length of polycrystalline films along the lateral direction where a lot of grain boundaries present.</p><p id="Par6">In this study, we quantify the photon recycling effect in perovskite materials with their single crystals by directly measuring its efficiency. The origin of the double peaks in the PL spectra of a variety of perovskite single crystals is also investigated to determine whether they are caused by the photon recycling effect. The photon recycling efficiency in perovskite single crystals is quantitatively evaluated by measuring the ratio of the re-emitted photons to the incident exciting photons, which are differentiated from each other by modulating their polarization. The results reveal that the photon recycling efficiency is below 0.5% in both MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> and MAPbI<sub>3</sub> single crystals under light excitation intensity close to one sun, which excludes its contribution to carrier transport in perovskite single crystals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Quantifying the photon recycling efficiency</title><p id="Par7">We directly measured the photon recycling efficiency in perovskite single crystals based on the mechanism schematically shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(b)</xref>. After PL is generated on the top surface of a single crystal by the short wavelength light excitation, half of the PL emission transmits through the crystal and is filtered by the crystal itself. In addition, during its transmission, the high-energy portion of the PL is absorbed by the crystal itself, which yields re-emission with the PL peak shifting with respect to the absorption edge defined by the Stokes shift. Therefore, PL emitting out from the bottom of the crystal may be composed of both the filtered PL (<italic>PL</italic><sub>F</sub>), and PL generated by multiple cycles of self-absorption and re-emission, that is, recycled PL (<italic>PL</italic><sub>R</sub>). By measuring the ratio of <italic>PL</italic><sub>R</sub> and <italic>PL</italic><sub>F</sub> with respect to the total transmitted PL (<italic>PL</italic><sub>T</sub>), one can determine the photon recycling efficiency in the single crystals.</p><p id="Par8">We developed a method to separate these two types of PL emissions, with the setup schematically shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(c)</xref>. We used the surface PL emission from one perovskite single crystal (SC1), excited by a 405 nm laser with light intensity close to one sun, to excite the other single crystal (SC2). This mimicked the PL excited by a short wavelength laser at the SC2 surface but allowed us to accurately know the emission spectrum and excitation light intensity from the surface of the SC1. A long-pass filter with a 450 nm cutoff was inserted between SC1 and SC2 to eliminate the scattered 405 nm laser light. During the transmission of PL in SC2, it was partially absorbed by SC2 and caused re-emission (photon recycling). To exclude the influence of the light which leaked out from the edges of the SC2, two photomasks were attached to its top and bottom surfaces, respectively, which effectively prevented the double PL peak formation, as explained below. When we modulated the polarization of PL from SC1 by a linear polarizer (P1), we expected it to retain this polarization after transmission through SC2. In contrast, the recycled PL was assumed to be nonpolarized. Therefore, these two types of PL could be readily differentiated from each other by a second linear polarizer (P2) with a perpendicular polarization direction to P1 (P1⊥P2), which was expected to completely block the <italic>PL</italic><sub>F</sub> while transmitting 50% <italic>PL</italic><sub>R</sub>. If there was re-emission of a large amount of photons after re-absorption, we expected to see a similar shape and intensity of the P1||P2 spectrum and P1⊥P2 spectrum, as schematically shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1732">Supplementary Fig. 1(a)</xref>. In contrast, if the intensity of the P1⊥P2 spectrum was much smaller than that of the P1||P2 spectrum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1732">Supplementary Fig. 1(b))</xref>, it would indicate that only a small amount of photons were re-emitted after re-absorption and, hence, a low photon recycling efficiency.</p><p id="Par9">It was found that the optical birefringence of the MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> single crystal could slightly change the polarization of the transmitted light, which was evidenced by its polarized microscopy image<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Therefore, <italic>PL</italic><sub>F</sub> cannot be crossed out up to the polarizer’s light extinction limit (0.05%). The transmission light spectrum for P1⊥<italic>P</italic>2 is actually the sum of <italic>PL</italic><sub>R</sub> and unblocked <italic>PL</italic><sub>F</sub>. So the <italic>PL</italic><sub>F</sub> that has not been crossed out after transmission through P2 needs to be subtracted to more accurately determine <italic>PL</italic><sub>R</sub>, which can be measured with the setup schematically shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(d)</xref>. Specifically, the emission of a 650 nm light emitting diode (LED), whose photon energy is far below the band gap of MAPbBr<sub>3</sub>, was used to replace the PL from SC1 to pass SC2. Since the below-bandgap light was not expected to induce the photon recycling effect in perovskite single crystals, the intensity ratio of the optical birefringence-induced unblocked light (<italic>I</italic><sub>B</sub>) to the light transmitted through the single crystal (<italic>I</italic><sub>T</sub>) represents the portion of the unblocked <italic>PL</italic><sub>F</sub>.</p><p id="Par10">We first verified that the polarization of PL from SC1 after transmitting through P1 was linearly polarized. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1732">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>, the polarized PL emission from SC1 after transmission through P1 was almost completely blocked by the P2 (P1⊥P2), for a blocking ratio of about 99.95% which represents the upper limit for the polarizers used. Also, the polarization of the PL emission from SC2 was investigated with both the reflection and transmission mode measurements. In the reflection mode, the PL excitation and detection were on the same side of the single crystals; while for the transmission mode, the PL detection was on the opposite side of the crystals with the excitation, as schematically shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1732">Supplementary Fig. 3(a) and 4(a)</xref>, respectively. The corresponding PL spectra shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1732">Supplementary Fig. 3(b) and 4(b)</xref>, proved that the PL emission from SC2 was nonpolarized, despite the excitation light being 100% polarized. Therefore, half of <italic>PL</italic><sub>R</sub> can transmit through P2, as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(c)</xref>.</p><p id="Par11">We measured the spectra of <italic>PL</italic><sub>R</sub> and <italic>PL</italic><sub>T</sub> of a 1.3 mm thick MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> single crystal to determine its photon recycling efficiency by adjusting the polarization direction of P1 and P2 to be P1⊥P2 or P1||P2, respectively. The MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> single crystals used for the measurements were grown from solution by a modified antisolvent crystallization method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, and the high quality of these crystals was evidenced by excellent transparency, a record high mobility lifetime product, and the high sensitivity of the X-ray detectors made from them, as previously reported by us<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. To improve the surface quality of the single crystals, a ultraviolet-ozone treatment was performed on them for 10 min, which has been proven to reduce surface recombination velocity to be comparable with the best passivated silicon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. As shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2(a)</xref>, only the long wavelength tail of the incident PL (<italic>PL</italic><sub>I</sub>) from SC1 transmitted through the SC2, regardless of the polarization direction of P2.

We measured the PL spectrum of MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> single crystals with both the reflection mode and transmission mode and with the measurement geometry schematically shown in <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(a)</xref>, so that we could distinguish the transited and scattered fluorescence. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4(b)</xref> shows a typical PL spectrum of a 1 mm thick MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> single crystal excited by a 405 nm laser measured in the reflection mode., which shows a small shoulder at around 570 nm (Peak 2) with the main peak at 538 nm (Peak 1). However, when a photomask was applied on the excitation surface of the crystal to block the emission from areas surrounding the excitation spot and from the crystal edges (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(a)</xref>), Peak 2 was significantly suppressed (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(b)</xref>). The PL spectrum of the same crystal under the transmission mode showed only one peak with the same peak position as Peak 2 (<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4(b)</xref>). Since the PL captured in the transmission mode mainly consisted of the PL transmitting through the whole crystals, it underwent self-absorption; and hence only the long wavelength emission emitted out of the crystal, as shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(a)</xref>. Based on the above results, it was concluded that the double peak observed in the PL reflection mode was a combination of the PL generated on the top surface (Peak 1), as well as the filtered PL leaking out from the top surface and edge of the crystal after self-absorption and multiple reflection (Peak 2).

We measured the radiative carrier recombination lifetime of a 3 mm thick high quality MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> single crystal grown by a modified antisolvent crystallization method, which we recently demonstrated to show improved crystal quality and hence further increased sensitivity of X-ray detectors made of them (unpublished). This further verified the low photon recycling efficiency demonstrated above. The measurement was carried out both under reflection mode and transmission mode and with the application of a photomask. The PL measured under the reflection mode with a photomask mainly came from the crystal surface, while the PL measured under the transmission mode included both the filtered surface PL and the photon recycling PL. So if the photon recycling efficiency was high in the perovskite single crystals, the PL lifetime measured under the transmission mode would be much longer than that measured under the reflection mode. Since the PL lifetime of perovskite materials was wavelength dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, while the PL spectra measured under the reflection mode and transmission mode were quite different from each other, a 568 nm band-pass filter with a 10 nm band width was placed in front of the detector to restrict the detection wavelength range to be identical for these two measurement modes. As shown in <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, the PL decay measured under the reflection mode exhibited a fast decay within the first 100 ns, followed by slow recombination dynamics with a decay time constant of about 1.2 μs. The fast decay component may come from the carrier inward diffusion because of the high carrier mobility of single crystals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Carrier recombination near the surface region may also have contributed to this decay process, while the slow component was generally assigned to the bulk recombination. The long decay time constant indicated the high quality of the single crystals. The PL decay curve measured under transmission mode almost overlapped with that measured with the reflection mode. This clearly indicates that the PL measured under the transmission mode was mainly from the surface-generated PL filtered by the crystal itself instead of the photon recycling PL. Hence its decay dynamics generally followed the trend of the surface PL decay process, which further confirmed that the photon recycling effect is not significant in these perovskite single crystals.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Time-resolved PL decay of a high quality MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> single crystal.</title><p>The time-resolved PL decay curves of a 3 mm thick high quality MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> single crystal (SC) measured under reflection mode with photomask (black dot) and transmission mode (red dot); The inset shows the schematic of the measurement geometry of the reflection mode (left panel) and transmission mode (right panel); During the measurement, a 568 nm band-pass filter with band width of 10 nm was placed in front of the detector, in order to restrict the measurement wavelength range.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2017_Article_BFncomms14417_Fig5_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par18">The low photon recycling efficiency of perovskite materials might be caused by its low PL quantum yield, which is reported to be highly dependent on excitation light intensity and is below 20% under one sun illumination at room temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.

The maximum photon recycling efficiency of 0.5% we measured in perovskite single crystals translates into an increase in the radiative recombination lifetime of only 0.5%. The corresponding <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> increment was calculated to be only about 0.26 mV if the initial <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> was assumed to be 1.1 V, which is basically in agreement with the measured no-change of PL recombination lifetime. For the current most emissive photovoltaic material, GaAs, it is reported that the radiative recombination lifetime could be increased by 4–6 times as a result of photon recycling<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>, which corresponds to a photon recycling efficiency of between 75 and 83%. However, its contribution to the <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> enhancement in GaAs solar cells is still small. Even for the best GaAs solar cell, the open-circuit voltage increment as a result of photon recycling is only 4 meV under 1 sun condition<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, probably because of the overwhelming nonradiative recombination in the current high-efficiency solar cells under operating conditions.</p><p id="Par22">Note that the photon recycling efficiency measurement reported here was performed on perovskite single crystals rather than the polycrystalline thin films which are widely used in current high efficiency perovskite solar cells. It is not feasible to use it for photon recycling efficiency measurement, because the film thickness in polycrystalline solar cells is comparable to the light attenuation length, and thus re-emission/re-absorption does not occur as much in the out-of-plane direction. Nevertheless, since photon recycling in thin film devices refers to the light transport along the in-plane direction and/or across the film after multiple instances of reflection/scattering by the surface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, the light recycling across the single crystal is similar to thin film devices, from geometry aspects. On the other hand, the single crystals may exhibit a different PL property in comparison to the polycrystalline thin films, which means that the measurement results here cannot exclude the strong photon recycling efficiency in polycrystalline films. For instance, it was reported that the PL in CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> might come from defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, which could explain lower PL quantum efficiency in CsPbBr<sub>3</sub> single crystals. Besides, the quicker carrier diffusion in single crystal samples as compared with polycrystalline thin films may also result in a lower PL quantum efficiency. However, we did not see obviously weaker PL from the MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> single crystals as compared with the polycrystalline films, and the difference in reported results may be caused by an unawareness of the sensitivity of MAPbBr<sub>3</sub> to environmental gases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. The perovskite grain size in the high-efficiency polycrystalline films was already over ten times larger than the exciton Bohr radius in these materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, and thus the optical property of polycrystalline films approached that of the single crystals, though the photon recycling efficiency in polycrystalline films still needs to be determined by other independent characterization. Nevertheless, our results should still be relevant to the perovskite single-crystal-based solar cells, which have recently drawn increased research attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup> and may achieve comparable or better efficiency than the polycrystalline thin film based ones because of the orders of magnitude smaller trap density in single crystals. Finally, even if the photon recycling efficiency of perovskite polycrystalline thin films could be higher than that of the single crystals, its contribution to the <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> enhancement would still not be significant with the present dominating device structures. The electron and hole transport layers always quench the PL from the perovskite films at a faster rate than PL emission, which results in a very low internal PL quantum yield. So the high <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> of perovskite solar cells is mainly attributed to other factors, such as the unique defect-tolerant properties of perovskite materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>. In order to utilize the photon recycling effect to further increase the <italic>V</italic><sub>OC</sub> of perovskite solar cells, the nonquenching selective electrodes need to be explored to realize the high internal PL quantum yield and hence a high internal light intensity.</p><p id="Par23">In summary, the photon recycling effect in perovskite single crystals was quantitatively evaluated by measuring the ratio of the recycled photons to the initially excited photons based on their polarization difference, which exhibited a low photon recycling efficiency &lt;0.5% under one sun excitation intensity.
