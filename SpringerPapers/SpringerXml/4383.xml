ML can accelerate the solution of intricate chemical problems and even solve problems that otherwise would not be tractable. However, the potential benefits of ML come at the cost of big data production; that is, the algorithms demand large volumes of data of various natures and from different sources, from material properties to sensor data. In the survey, we propose a roadmap for future developments with emphasis on computer-aided discovery of new materials and analysis of chemical sensing compounds, both prominent research fields for ML in the context of materials science. In addition to providing an overview of recent advances, we elaborate upon the conceptual and practical limitations of big data and ML applied to materials science, outlining processes, discussing pitfalls, and reviewing cases of success and failure.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Materials discovery</kwd><kwd>Big data</kwd><kwd>Machine learning</kwd><kwd>Deep learning</kwd><kwd>Evolutionary algorithms</kwd><kwd>Chemical sensors</kwd><kwd>Internet of Things</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2021</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/43939_2021_Article_12.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>ReviewPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Materials Science, general</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Structural Materials</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Biomaterials</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Metallic Materials</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Characterization and Evaluation of Materials</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Materials</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Chemistry and Materials Science</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par11">The ongoing revolution with artificial intelligence has the potential to transform society well beyond applications in science and technology. A key ingredient is machine learning (ML), for which increasingly sophisticated methods have been developed, thus bringing an expectation that within a few decades, machines may be able to outperform humans in most tasks, including intellectual tasks. Two converging movements are responsible for the revolution. The first may be referred to as “data-intensive discovery” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], “e-Science”, or “big data” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], a movement wherein massive amounts of data are transformed into knowledge. This is attained with various computational methods, which increasingly engage ML techniques, in a movement characterized by a transition in which data move from a “passive” to an “active” role. What we mean by an “active” role for data is that it is not considered solely to confirm or refute a hypothesis but also to assist in raising new hypotheses to be tested at an unprecedented scale. The transition into a fully active role for data will only be complete when the computational methods (or machines) are capable of generating knowledge themselves. Within this novel paradigm, data must be organized in such a way as to be machine-readable, particularly since computers at present cannot “read” and interpret. Attempts to teach computers to read are precisely within the realms of the second movement, in which natural language processing tools are under development to process spoken and written text. Significant advances in this regard have been recently achieved upon combining ML and big data, as may be appreciated by the astounding progress in speech processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and machine translation. Computational systems are still far away from the human ability to interpret text, but the increasingly synergistic use of big data and ML allows one to envisage the creation of intelligent systems that can handle massive amounts of data with analytical ability. Then, beyond the potential to outperform humans, machines would also be able to generate knowledge–without human intervention.</p><p id="Par12">Regardless of whether such optimistic predictions will become a reality, big data and ML already have a significant impact owing to the generality of their approaches. To understand why this is happening, we need to distinguish the contributions of the two areas. Working with big data normally requires proper infrastructure, with major difficulties being associated with the gathering and curation of much data. In Materials Science, for instance, access to large databases and considerable computational power are essential, as exemplified in this review paper in the discussion of sensor networks. Standard ML algorithms, on the other hand, can operate on small datasets and in many cases require only limited computational resources. Furthermore, there are major limitations in terms of what ML can achieve by virtue of fundamental conceptual difficulties.</p><p id="Par13">The goals of ML fall into two distinct types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]: (i) classification of data instances in a large database, as in image processing and voice recognition; (ii) making inferences based on the organization and/or structuring of the data. Needless to say, the second goal is much harder to achieve. Let us consider, as an example, the application of ML to identify text authorship. In a classification experiment with tens of English literature books modeled as word networks, book authors were identified with high accuracy using supervised ML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Nonetheless, it would be impossible with current technology to make a detailed analysis of writing style and establish correlations among authors, which would represent a task of the second type. This will require considerable new developments, such as teaching computers to read. Today, the success of ML stems mostly from applications focused on the first goal, which encompasses most of its applications in materials science. Nonetheless, much more can be expected in the next few decades, as we shall comment upon in our conclusive Sect. <xref rid="Sec20" ref-type="sec">5</xref>.</p><p id="Par14">Considerable work has been devoted to addressing the challenges that arise when materials science meets big data and ML. The evolution in computing resources allows scientists to produce and manipulate unprecedented data volumes to be stored and managed via algorithms with embedded intelligence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Data processing has become a much more complex endeavour than just storage and retrieval, as concepts such as data curation and provenance come into play, particularly if the data are to be machine-readable. Materials scientists already employ substantial amounts of machine-readable data in at least two major fields: in exploring protein databanks and in crystallography. These are illustrative examples of machine-readable content that require artificial intelligence.</p><p id="Par15">In this review paper, we discuss two areas in Materials Science that are fundamental on their own but that also complement each other: ML-based discovery of new materials and ML-based analysis of chemical sensing compounds. The first presents the latest techniques to search the space of possibilities given by molecular interactions; the second reviews analytical methods to understand the properties of materials when used for sensing. They are complementary since new materials can lend sensing capabilities that, in turn, can produce more data to feed algorithmic methods for materials discovery. In addition to the acronym ML, we will use the acronyms AI for artificial intelligence, DL for deep learning, and DNN for deep neural networks - the latter two used interchangeably.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>New trends in big data and machine learning relevant to materials sciences</title><p id="Par16">Concepts and methodologies related to big data and ML have been employed to address many problems in materials sciences, as emphasized by the illustrative examples that we will discuss in the next sections. A description of the concepts and myths targeted at chemists and related professionals is given in the review by Richardson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In this section, we briefly introduce such concepts as background to assist the reader in following the paper.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Big data</title><p id="Par17">The broadly advertised term “big data” has gained attention as a direct consequence of the rapid growth in the amount of data being produced in all fields of human activity. The magnitude of this increase is often highlighted even to the general public, as in a recent news piece by Forbes, which states that “There are 2.5 quintillion bytes of data created each day at our current pace, but that pace is only accelerating with the growth of the Internet of Things (IoT)” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the term <italic>big data</italic> is not just about massive data production, a perspective that has popularized it as a jargon filled with expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Big data also refers to a collection of novel software tools and analytical techniques that can generate real value by identifying and visualizing patterns from disperse and apparently unconnected data sources. Nevertheless, to grasp the genuine virtues and potential of big data in materials science, its meaning must be interpreted in connection with the specificities of this particular domain. Big data might be understood as a movement driven by technological advances that accelerated data generation to a pace sufficiently fast to move it beyond the capacity of existing resources centralized in a single company or institution. Although this accelerated pace raises many computational problems, it also introduces potential benefits, as innovations induced by big data problems will certainly lead to a range of entirely new scientific discoveries that would not be possible otherwise.</p><p id="Par18">In Materials Sciences, big data can be exploited in many ways: in computer simulations, miniaturized sensors, combinatorial synthesis, in the design of experimental procedures and protocols with increased complexity, in the immediate sharing of experimental results via databases and the Internet, to name a few. In quantum chemistry, for example, there exists the ioChem-BD platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], a tool to manage large volumes of simulation results on chemical structures, bond energies, spin angular momentum, and other descriptive measures. The platform provides inspection tools, including versatile browsing and visualization for a minimum level of comprehension, in addition to techniques and tools for systematic analysis. In data-driven medicinal chemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], investigators must face critical issues and factors that scale with the data, such as data sharing, modelling molecular behaviour, implementation and validation with experimental rigor, and defining and identifying ethical considerations.</p><p id="Par19">Big data have often been characterized in terms of the so-called five Vs: volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although it is not a strong definition, this description somehow captures the characteristic properties of the big data scenario. As far as <bold>volume</bold> is concerned, size is relative across research fields – what is considered big in Materials Science may be small in computer science; what matters is to what extent the data is manageable and usable by those who need to learn from it. Materials Science produces big data volumes by means of techniques such as parallel synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], high-throughput screening (HTS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and first-principle calculations as reported in notorious efforts on quantum chemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], molecules in general as in the AFLOW project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and organic molecules as in the ANI-1 project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Big data volumes in materials science also originate from compilations of the literature and patent repositories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Closely related is <bold>velocity</bold>, which refers to the pace of data generation and may affect the capability of drawing conclusions and identifying alternative experimental directions, demanding off-the-shelf analytical tools to support timely summarization and hypotheses validation. <bold>Variety</bold> refers to the diversity of data types and formats currently available. While materials science has the advantage of an established universal language to describe compounds and reactions, many problems arise when translating this language into computational models whose usage varies across research groups and even across individual researchers. <bold>Veracity</bold> in Materials Science is closely concerned with the potential lack of quality in data produced by imprecise simulations or collected from experiments not conforming to a sufficiently rigid protocol, especially when biological organisms are involved. Finally, <bold>value</bold> refers to the obvious urge for data that are trustworthy, precise, and conclusive.</p><p id="Par20">The importance of big data for materials science is highlighted in several initiatives, such as the BIGCHEM project described by Tetko et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Their work is illustrative of the issues in handling big data in chemistry and life sciences: it includes a discussion on the importance of data quality, the challenges in visualizing millions of data instances and the use of data mining and ML for predictions in pharmacology. Of particular relevance is the search for suitable strategies to explore billions of molecules, which can be useful in various applications, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, to reduce the massive cost of identifying new lead compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Machine learning (ML)</title><p id="Par21">In computer science, the standard approach is to use programming languages to code algorithms that “teach” the computer to perform a particular task. ML, in turn, refers to implementing algorithms that tell the computer how to “learn”, given a set of data instances (or examples) and some underlying assumptions. Computer programs such as those deployed over the DL frameworks can then execute tasks that are not explicitly defined in the code. As the very name implies, it depends on learning, a process that in humans takes years, even decades, and that often happens based on the observation of both successes and failures. It is thus implicit that such learning depends on a large degree of experimental support. In its most usual approach, ML depends on an extensive set of successful and unsuccessful examples that will mold the underlying learning algorithm. This is where ML and big data collide. The abundance of both data and computing capacity has brought feasibility to approaches that would not work otherwise due to a lack of sufficient examples to learn from and/or processing power to drive the learning process. In fact, specialists argue that data collection and preparation in ML can demand more effort than the actual design of the learning algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, solving the issues to build effective learning programs is worthwhile; computers handle datasets much larger than humans can possibly do, as they are not susceptible to fatigue; and, unless mistakenly programmed, they hardly ever make numerical errors.</p><p id="Par22">ML is a useful approach to problems for which designing explicit algorithms is difficult or infeasible, as in the case of spam filtering or detecting meaningful elements in images. Such problems have a huge space of possible solutions; thus, rather than searching for an explicit solution, a more effective strategy is to have the computer progressively learn new patterns directly from examples. Many problems in materials science conform to this strategy, including protein structure prediction, virtual screening of host-guest binding behaviour, material design, property prediction, and the derivation of models for quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). This last one is, itself, an ML practice based on classification and regression techniques; it is used, for example, to predict the biological activity of a compound having its physicochemical properties as input.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>An overview of deep learning</title><p id="Par23">The latest achievements in ML are related to techniques broadly known as deep learning (DL) achieved with deep neural networks (DNNs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which outperform state-of-the-art algorithms in handling problems such as images and speech recognition (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). DL algorithms rely on artificial neural networks (ANNs), a biology-inspired technique in which the underlying principle is to approximate complex functions by translating a large number of inputs into a proper output. The principles behind DL are not new, dating back to the introduction of the perceptron neural network in 1958. After decades of disappointing results in the 1980 and 1990 s, ANNs were revitalised with impressive innovations in 2012 in the seminal paper by Krizhevsky et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and their AlexNet architecture for image classification, inspired by the ideas of LeCun et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The driving factors responsible for this drastic change in the profile of a 50-year research field were significant algorithmic advances coupled with huge processing power (thanks to GPU advances [24]), big data sets, and robust development frameworks.</p><p id="Par24">Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> illustrates the evolving popularity of DL and its applications. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a shows the rate of improvement in the task of image classification after the introduction of DL methods. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b shows the increasing interest in the topic in the number of indexed publications by the Institute for Scientific Information, while the increasing popularity of the major software packages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], Torch, Theano, Caffe, TensorFlow, and Keras, is demonstrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c.</p><p id="Par25"><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Facts about deep learning. <bold>a</bold> The improvement of the image classification rate after the introduction of the AlexNet deep neural network. <bold>b</bold> The increasing number of publications as indexed by ISI (International Scientific Indexing). <bold>c</bold> The popularity (Google Trends Score) of major deep learning software packages in the current decade: Torch, Theano, Caffe, TensorFlow, and Keras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

They work by approximating a function <italic>f*</italic>, as in the case of a classifier <italic>y = f*</italic> that maps an input vector <bold><italic>x</italic></bold> to a category <italic>y</italic>. Such mapping is formally defined as <bold><italic>y</italic></bold> <italic>= f(</italic><bold><italic>x</italic></bold>;<bold><italic>θ</italic></bold><italic>)</italic>, whereas the network must learn the parameters <bold><italic>θ</italic></bold> that result in the best function approximation. One can think of the network as a pipeline of interconnected layers of basic processing units, the so-called neurons, which work in parallel; each neuron is a vector-to-scalar function. The model is inspired by neuroscience findings according to which a neuron receives input from many other neurons; each input is multiplied by a weight – the set of all the weights corresponds to the set of parameters <bold><italic>θ</italic></bold>. After receiving the vector of inputs, the neuron computes its activation value, a process that proceeds up to the output layer.</p><p id="Par27">Initially, the network does not know the correct weights. To determine the weights, it uses a set of labelled examples so that every time the classifier <italic>y = f*</italic> misses the correct class, the weights are adjusted by back-propagating the error. During this back-propagation, a widely used method to adjust the weights is named gradient descent, which calculates the derivative of a loss function (e.g., mean squared error) for each weight and subtracts if from that weight. The adjustment repeats for multiple labelled examples and over multiple iterations until approximating the desired function. All this process is called the <italic>training phase</italic>, and the abundance of labeled data produced currently has drastically changed the domains in which ML can work upon.</p><p id="Par28">With an appropriately designed and complex architecture, possibly consisting of dozens of layers and hundreds of neurons, an extensively trained artificial neural network defines a mathematical process whose dynamics are capable of embodying increasingly complex hierarchical concepts.

In such an optimization process, it is important to balance the fit to the training data: overfitting and the model will make correct mappings only to the training examples; underfitting and the model will miss even previously seen examples. For sensor networks, for example, overfitting produces a very low error in the training set because the model encompasses both the noise and the real signal. This often results in a system that generalizes poorly, as the noise is random. Therefore, a compromise is required that involves using several different training sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and, most importantly, regularization techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The flow path towards data‐based scientific discovery in materials science</title><p id="Par30">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> illustrates the standard flow path from data production to the outcome of ML. The first step concerns methods to produce sufficient data to feed computational learning methods. Such data must initially be analysed by a domain expert, who will classify, label, validate, or reject the results of an experiment or simulation. The preprocessing step can be quite laborious and critical in that, if not taken rigorously, it might invalidate the remainder of the process or compromise its results. Once the data are ready, it is necessary to iterate it over an ML method; such methods require a stage of learning (or training) in which the computer learns from the known results provided by the domain expert. During the training step, knowledge is transferred from the training data to the computer in the form of algorithmic settings that are specific to each method. A model is then learned, i.e., a mathematical abstraction that, if computationally executed, can be applied to new, unseen data and produce accurate classifications/regressions and correct inferences as final outcomes of the process.</p><p id="Par31"><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p> The standard flow path of ML, from data production to classification or inference.

For instance, DENDRAL, the first documented project on computer-assisted organic synthesis, dates back to 1965 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. According to Szymkuc et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The early enthusiasm observed in the initial attempts waned with successive failures to obtain reasonable predictive power that could be used to plan organic synthesis, so much so that teaching a computer to perform this task was at some point considered a “mission impossible” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, renewed interest has emerged with the enhanced capability afforded by big data and novel ML approaches, particularly since one may envisage–for the first time–the possibility of exploring a considerable amount of the space of possible solutions defined by the elements in the periodic table and the laws of reactivity. In doing so, the number of possible material structures is estimated to be 10<sup>100</sup>, which is larger than the number of particles in the universe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In this vastness, the discovery of new materials must face resource and time constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Expensive experiments must be well planned, ideally targeting lead structures with a high potential of generating new materials with useful properties. The power of ML in materials science offers the greatest potential in this scenario. Of course, this comes at a cost; these complex spaces must be mathematically modelled, and a significant number of the representative patterns must be available as examples for the ML system to learn from. ML classifiers can then be trained to predict material properties, as demonstrated for magnetic materials without requiring first-principles calculations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">Predicting material properties from basic physicochemical properties involves exploring quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPRs), analogous versions of QSAR for nonbiological applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. There are many examples of ML applied in this domain. For example, the reaction outcomes from the crystallization of templated vanadium selenites were predicted with a support vector machine (SVM)-based model where the training set included a “dark” portion of unsuccessful reactions compiled from laboratory notebooks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Briefly, SVM refers to a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane, a widely used technique in ML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The prediction of the target compound was attained with a success rate of 89 %, higher than that obtained with human intuition (78 %) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. For inorganic solid-state materials, atom-scale calculations have been a major tool to help understand material behaviour and accelerate material discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Some of the relevant properties, however, are only obtained at a very high computational cost, which has stimulated the use of data-based discovery.

This has been achieved with a virtual high-throughput experimentation facility involving a national network of labs for synthesis and characterization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and partnerships between academia and industry for tackling specific applications. For example, the <italic>Center for Hierarchical Materials Design</italic> is developing databases for materials properties and materials simulation software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and alliances have been established to tackle topics such as <italic>Materials in Extreme Dynamic Environments</italic> and <italic>Multiscale Modeling of Electronic Materials</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. There are also studies of composite materials to improve aircraft fuel efficiency and of metal processing to produce lighter weight products and vehicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Regarding the integration of experiment, theory, and computer simulation, perhaps the most illustrative example is an automated system designed to create a material, test it and evaluate the results, after which the best next experiment is chosen in an iterative procedure. The whole process was conducted without human intervention. The system is already in use to speed up the development process of high-performance carbon nanotubes for use in aircraft [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Another large-scale program at the University of California, Berkeley, used high-performance computing and state-of-the-art theoretical tools to produce a publicly available database of the properties of 66,000 new and predicted crystalline compounds and 500,000 nanoporous materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">There are cases that require combining different levels of theory and modelling with experimental results, particularly for more complex materials.

This component of the “Make digital data accessible” goal of MGI has already provided extensive datasets, e.g., for compounds (~ 1,500 compounds) to be used in electrodes for ion-lithium batteries and over 21,000 organic molecules for liquid electrolytes. These programs ensure immediate access by the industry to data that may help to accelerate material development in applications such as hydrogen fuel cells, pulp, and paper industry and solid-state lighting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

This is the case for the genetic algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] inspired by Charles Darwin’s ideas of evolution, which mimic the “survival of the fittest” principle to set up an optimization procedure. In these algorithms, known functional compounds are crossed over along with a mutation factor to produce novel compounds; the mutation factor introduces new properties into the mutations. Novel compounds with no useful properties are disregarded, while those displaying useful properties (high fitness) are selected to produce new combinations. After a certain number of generations (or iterations), new functional compounds emerge with some properties inherited from their ancestors, supplemented with other properties acquired along their mutation pathway. Of course, this is an oversimplified description of the process, which depends on accurate modelling of the compounds, a proper definition of the mutation procedure, and a robust evaluation of the fitness property. The latter may arrive by means of calculations, as in the case of conductivity or hardness, reducing the need for expensive experimentation.</p><p id="Par45">In genetic algorithms, each compositional or structural characteristic of a compound is interpreted as a gene. Examples of chemical genes include the fraction of individual components in a given material, polymer block sizes, monomer compositions, and processing temperature. The genome refers to the set of all the genes in a compound, while the resulting properties of a genome are named a phenotype. The task of a genetic algorithm is to scan the search space of the gene domains to identify the most suitable phenotypes, as measured by a fitness function. The relationship between the genome and the phenotype gives rise to the fitness landscape (see Tibbetts et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] for a detailed background). Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> illustrates a fitness landscape for two hypothetical genes, say, block size and processing temperature of a polymer synthesis process whose aim is to achieve high rates of hardness. Note that when exploring a search space, the fitness landscape is not known in advance and rarely only bidimensional; instead, it is implicit in the problem model defined by the genes’ domains and in the definition of the fitness function. The modelling of the problem is correct if the genes permit gainful movement over the fitness landscape, while the fitness function correlates with interesting physical properties. In the example in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the genetic algorithm moves along the landscape by producing new compounds while avoiding compounds that will not improve the fitness. The mechanism of the genetic algorithm, therefore, grants it a higher probability of moving towards phenotypes with the desired properties.

The aim was to optimize the composition space given by two volatile solvents (tetrahydrofuran and dichloromethane) and four nonsolvent additives (water, 2-propanol, acetone, and 1-hexanol). This system was modeled as a genome with eight variables corresponding to a search space of 9 × 10<sup>21</sup> possible combinations, which could not be exhaustively scanned regardless of the screening method. The solution was to employ a genetic algorithm driven by a fitness function defined by the membrane retention and permeance.

Nevertheless, Goh et al. state that such methods will eventually be applied massively for quantum chemistry, owing to their observed superiority in comparison to traditional ML approaches – an opinion we entirely support. For example, DNNs applied to massive amounts of data could be combined with QM approaches to yield accurate QM results for a considerably larger number of compounds than is feasible today [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p id="Par62">Though the use of DNNs in quantum chemistry may still be at an embryonic stage, it is possible to identify significant contributions. Tests have been made mainly with the calculation of atomization energies and other properties of organic molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] using a portion of 7,000 compounds from a library of 10<sup>9</sup> compounds, where the energies in the training set were obtained with the PBE0 (Perdew–Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange energy and Hartree-Fock exchange energy) hybrid function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. DNN models yielded superior performance compared to other ML approaches since a DNN could successfully predict static polarizabilities, ionization potentials and electron affinity, in addition to atomization energies of the organic molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Significantly, the accuracy was similar to the error of the corresponding theory employed in QM calculations to obtain the training set. Applying DNNs to the dataset of the Harvard Clean Energy Project to discover organic photovoltaic materials, Aspuru-Guzik et al.

Huge amounts of data have been gathered over the last few decades with a range of experimental techniques, which may contain additional information on the material properties. This is the case for mass spectrometry datasets that may contain valuable hidden information on antibiotics and other drugs. In the October 2016 issue of <italic>Nature Chemical Biology</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>], the use of big data concepts was highlighted in the discovery of bioactive peptidic natural products via a method referred to as DEREPLICATOR. This tool works with statistical analysis via Markov chain-Monte Carlo to evaluate the match between spectra in the database of Global Natural Products Social infrastructure (containing over one hundred million mass spectra) with those from known antibiotics. Crucial for the design of new drugs are their absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties, on which the pharmacokinetic profile depends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Determining ADMET properties is not feasible when such a large number of drug candidates are to be screened; therefore, computational approaches are the only viable option. For example, prediction results generated from various QSAR models can be compared to experimentally measured ADMET properties from databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]. These models are limited in that they may not be suitable to explore novel drugs, which motivates an increasing interest in ML methods, which can be trained to generate predictive models that may discover implicit patterns from new data used to determine more accurate models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Indeed, ML predictive models have been used to identify potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs, particularly viral proteins as targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>], and to evaluate drug toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">Pires and Blundell developed the approach named pkCSM (<ext-link xlink:href="http://structure.bioc.cam.ac.uk/pkcsm" ext-link-type="uri">http://structure.bioc.cam.ac.uk/pkcsm</ext-link>), in which the ADMET properties of new drugs can be predicted with graph-based structural signatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. In pkCSM, the graphs are constructed by representing atoms as nodes, while the edges are given by their covalent bonds. Additionally, the labels used to decorate the nodes and edges with physicochemical properties are essential, similar to the approach used in embedded networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].

DNN models applied to the Tox21 challenge provided the highest performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>], with 99 % of neurons in the first hidden layer displaying significant association with toxicophore features. Therefore, DNNs may be used to discover chemical knowledge by inspecting the hidden layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Virtual screening is also relevant to complement docking methods for drug design, as exemplified with DNNs to predict the activity of molecules in protein binding pockets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. In another example, Xu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>] employed a dataset with 475 drug descriptions to train a DNN to predict whether a given drug may induce liver injury.

Indeed, the first FDA-approved means for noninvasive glucose monitoring, namely, Glucowatch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">162</xref>], relied on interstitial fluid sampling extracted using reverse iontophoresis with subsequent electrochemical detection. This pioneering development from 2001 offered multiple measurements per hour and provided its wearer with an easy-to-use watch-like interface. Although ultimately hampered by skin irritation and calibration issues, it nonetheless signified a milestone in minimally invasive glucose measurements. Continuing with this approach, in 2017, the FDA approved device Abbott Freestyle Libre, which enables the wireless monitoring of blood sugar via analysis of the interstitial fluid. On application, the device punctures the skin and places a 0.5 cm fibre wick through the outer skin barrier so that interstitial fluid can be sampled and monitored for glucose in real time for up to two weeks, at which point it is replaced. Data are accessed using a wireless mobile phone-like base station.</p><p id="Par89">In addition to delivering acceptable analytical performance in the relevant sample media, there are a number of challenges for on-body sensors related to size, rigidity, power, communication, data acquisition, processing, and security [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>], which must be overcome before they can realize their full potential and play a pivotal role in applications of the IoT in healthcare services.</p><p id="Par90">A similar scenario is faced in the environmental arena, in that (bio)chemical sensing is inherently more expensive and complex than monitoring physical parameters such as temperature, light, depth, or movement. This is strikingly illustrated in the Argo Project, which currently has ca. A total of 3,000–4,000 sensorized ‘floats’ are distributed globally in the oceans, all of which track location, depth, temperature, and salinity. These were originally devised to monitor several core parameters (temperature, pressure, and salinity) and share the data from this global sensor network via satellite communications links to provide an accurate in situ picture of the ocean status in real or near real time. Temperature and pressure data are accurate to ± 0.002 °C, and uncorrected salinity is accurate to ± 0.1 psu (can be improved by relatively complex and time-consuming postacquisition processing). Interestingly, an increasing number of floats now include ‘Biogeochemical’ sensors (308, ca. 10 %, April 2018) for nitrate (121), chlorophyll (186), oxygen (302) and pH (97); see <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.argo.ucsd.edu" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.argo.ucsd.edu</ext-link> and the maps in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. Of these, nitrate is measured by direct UV absorbance, and chlorophyll is measured by absorbance/fluorescence at spectral regions characteristic of algal chlorophyll. These are optical measurements rather than conventional chemical sensor measurements. Moreover, it is likely that most, if not all, of the pH measurements are performed using optically responsive dyes rather than the well-known glass electrode. This strikingly demonstrates that chemical sensors are avoided when long-term, reliable and accurate measurements are required from remote locations and hostile environments. It is also striking that more complex chemical and biological measurements (i.e. ; that require analysers incorporating reagents, microfluidics, etc.) are not included in the Argo project. These autonomous analyzer platforms for tracking key parameters such as nutrients, concentration of dissolved oxygen (COD), pH, heavy metals, and organics typically cost €15 K or more per unit to buy, not including service and consumable charges. For example, the Seabird Electronics dissolved oxygen sensors used in the Argo project cost $60 K each [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>], and Microlab autonomous environmental phosphate analysers cost ca. €20K per unit; i.e. they are far too expensive to use as basic building blocks of larger-scale deployments for IoT applications.</p><p id="Par91"><fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Distribution of sensorised floats monitoring the status of a variety of ocean parameters that encompass core parameters (temperature, velocity/pressure, salinity) and biogeochemical sensing (e.g., oxygen, nitrate, chlorophyll, pH).

The purpose was to stimulate innovation in the sector, as participants had to deliver nutrient analysers capable of 3 months of independent in situ operation at a maximum unit cost of $5,000. The ACT estimated that the global market for these devices is currently ca. 30,000 units in the USA, and ca. 100,000 units globally (i.e. ca. $500 million per year). This is set to expand further as new applications related to nutrient recovery grow in importance (e.g., from biodigester units and wastewater treatment plants), driven by the need to meet regulatory targets and business opportunities linked to the rapidly increasing cost of nutrients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Prospects for scalable applications of chemical sensors and biosensors</title><p id="Par93">From the discussion so far, it is clear that there are substantial markets in personal health and environmental monitoring and other sectors for reliable chemical sensors and biosensors that are fit for purpose with an affordable use model. While progress has been painfully slow over the past 30–40 years, since the excitement of early promising breakthroughs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>], the beginnings of larger-scale use and a tentative move from single-use or centralised facilities towards real-time continuous measurements at point of need are now apparent. As this trend develops, the range and volume of data collected will rise exponentially, and new types of services will emerge, most likely borrowing ideas and models from existing applications, such as the myriad of products for personal exercise tracking, merged with new tools designed to deal with the more complex behaviour of molecular sensors.</p><p id="Par94">In the health sector, this will support an expansion in the rollout of remote services due to the increasing availability of wearable/implantable diagnostic and autonomous drug delivery platforms that operate in a closed-loop control mode with real-time tracking of key biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>]. Of course, these services will be linked to an overarching personalized health informatics framework that enables healthcare professionals to monitor individual status remotely and triggers escalations in response if thresholds are breached or a future issue is predicted from data trends. Machine learning has already played a role in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>].</p><p id="Par95">Likewise, in the environmental sector, unit costs for autonomous chemical analysers for water monitoring remain stubbornly high, constituting a significant barrier to scale up, particularly when coupled with a high cost of ownership due to frequent service intervals. This is a frustrating situation, as the tremendous benefits of long-term autonomous sensing of key status indicators in the health and water sectors are clear. For example, low-cost, reliable water quality analysers would revolutionise the way drinking, waste, and natural waters are monitored. Combining in situ, real-time water sensing with satellite/flyover remote sensing represents an immensely powerful development due to the tremendous enhancement of the integrated information content when the global scale of satellite sensing is coupled with the detailed molecular information generated by in situ deployed sensors and analyzers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref>]. The scale of data generation from satellite remote sensing is already staggering, already reaching 21.1 PBs (petabytes) by 2015 and continuing to grow exponentially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>]. As Kathryn Sullivan, NOAA<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> Administrator and Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, and former NASA astronaut commented recently, “<italic>NOAA observations alone provide some 20 terabytes every day—twice the data of the Library of Congress</italic>’ <italic>entire print collection</italic>”. She also commented on the importance of developing new tools and collaborations to realise the value of the encoded information: “<italic>Just 20 years ago, we were piecing together data points by hand. Five years ago, 90 % of today’s data had yet to be generated. Now we’re innovating in the cloud, experiencing Earth with a wider lens and in fresh new ways. NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) is partnering with Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, Google, and the Open Commons Consortium to tap that potential.</italic>” The global coverage acquired with an increasingly fine spatial resolution, multiple spectral band sensors, and increasing numbers of satellites is driving this tremendous increase in the scale of data production. However, the benefits are already being realized, for example, through studies that couple highly localised data with large-scale coverage. For example, ecological models have been tested and used to visualize stratification dynamics in 2,368 lakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>] and daily temperature profiles for almost 11,000 lakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>]. In the latter case, the models have also been used to predict future water temperatures. In the near future, we are certain to see larger-scale in situ sensing networks, as new technologies emerge that combine lower unit cost with much longer service intervals. New data analysis and visualization tools will be required to enable these highly complementary information sources to be combined to maximize the effect.</p><p id="Par96">Similarly, real-time tracking of disease markers could be coupled with smart drug delivery platforms. However, significant fundamental barriers still exist and must be surmounted if this revolution in sensing is to be realised. The most formidable is how to maintain and validate system performance during extended use (typically a minimum of 3 months for water monitoring and at least several years, preferably 10 years or more for implantables) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">173</xref>]. In situ performance validation involves calibration, requiring fluidics and storage of standards/reagents. All components and solutions must function reliably for the service interval. Progress in water monitoring systems is easier as the interval is shorted and systems are more accessible, with a larger footprint. For implantables, however, the challenges are daunting, and in recent years, researchers have therefore focused on noninvasive/minimally invasive on-body use models as described above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>].</p><p id="Par97">If devices capable of meeting the challenge of long-term reliable chemical/biological sensing could be realised, it will represent a keystone breakthrough upon which multiple applications with revolutionary impact on society could be built. It will require informatics systems and tools to process, filter, recognise patterns and events, and communicate with related data from personal, group and, ultimately, to societal levels, from a single location to global scale. Perhaps when this happens, we will witness at last the emergence of true internet-scale sensing and control via chemical sensors and biosensors, effectively creating a continuum between the molecular and digital worlds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Concluding remarks: limitations and future prospects</title><p id="Par98">Throughout this review, we adopted an optimistic tone regarding the recent advances and prospects for the use of big data and ML in materials science and related applications. We believe such optimism is justified by the proliferation of projects – in academia and industry–dedicated to developing artificial intelligence applications in several fields, including materials science. We take the view that, with massive investment and with so much at stake in the economy of corporations and countries, this ongoing AI-based revolution is unlikely to stop, with many positive prospects for the near future focused on materials science. Before discussing them, let us concentrate on the limitations and challenges to be faced by chemists and their collaborators in the short- and long-term futures of this revolution.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>The state of the art</title><p id="Par99">In describing the potential and effective use of big data and ML in Sect. <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">3</xref>, we did not conduct a critical analysis of the examples from the literature. Apart from a few exceptions, we restricted ourselves to highlighting the potential usefulness of these methodologies for several areas of materials science, with emphasis on materials discovery. We considered that identifying limitations (or even deficiencies) in the approaches adopted in specific cases has limited value in view of the underlying conceptual difficulties to be faced in paving the way for more expressive advances in materials science supported by big data and ML.</p><p id="Par100">In particular, in the Introduction to this paper, when considering the two types of goals in applying ML, we emphasized that one of them is much harder to reach. According to Wallach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], the two categories of goals are related to “prediction” and “explanation”. In the prediction category, observed data are employed to reason about unseen data or missing information. For the explanation category, the aim is to find plausible explanations for observed data, addressing “why” and “how” questions. As Wallach puts it, <italic>“models for prediction are often intended to replace human interpretation or reasoning, whereas models for explanation are intended to inform or guide human reasoning”</italic>. Regardless of all the recent results attained with ML, as we may recapitulate from Sect. <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">3</xref>, the examples found in chemistry are not necessarily useful to guide human reasoning. Despite the quality and usefulness of the results obtained in various studies conducted for “prediction” purposes, the application of ML to generalize and bring entirely new knowledge to materials science is still to be realized, as confirmed from a quick inspection of the examples discussed in this paper and in a recent review paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref>].</p><p id="Par101">Furthermore, even in the state of the art of AI and ML, there are no clear hints as to whether and how uses will be possible within the “explanation” category, not only for materials science but also for other areas. These limitations have been discussed in a proposal to employ AI and uncertainty quantification to obtain correctable models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>] and in identifying domains where ML is applicable more efficiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">177</xref>]. One may speculate that the answer may result from the convergence of the two big movements mentioned in the Introduction – big data and natural language processing–but the specifics of the solutions are far from established. It is likely, for instance, that a theoretical framework is required to guide experimental design for data collection and to provide conceptual knowledge and effective predictive models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>]. On the other hand, current limitations mean that the full potential of ML in materials science has yet to be realized.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Pitfalls</title><p id="Par102">Critical issues also stem from the combination of ML with big data. That is, to what extent having much data to learn from is an actual benefit? The overall principle common to big data and ML is that of abandoning physical-chemical simulations that might be infeasible due to the demands of a molecule-to-molecule relationship computation. The workaround is to use formulations and/or high-level material properties to feed ML techniques and teach them to identify patterns; in summary, a trained ML algorithm will work by mapping known physical properties into unknown physical properties. From this perspective, ML may be taken as a curve fitting technique capable of exploring search spaces way larger than those that could be handled by noncomputational approaches. This course of action has actual potential in predicting useful chemical compounds, but some ML techniques, notably DL methods, are not readily interpretable with respect to their mechanism of action. This fact raises two concerns. First, a chemist learns little or nothing about what caused a given set of outputs, which does not contribute to advancing the field as a principled science. Second, unlike computer vision or speech recognition problems, in which the outputs are directly verifiable, the outputs of ML in materials science may be biased by a limited training set or even totally distorted by an ill-defined model. Nevertheless, the chemist might take them for granted or, otherwise, take a long time before actually identifying the flaws. Again, such problems are not exclusive to the interplay between materials science and ML; in fact, they raise growing concerns and motivate ongoing investigations on how to enhance the interpretability of the representations created by these algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">178</xref>].</p><p id="Par103">Other limitations stem from practical issues in connection with big data. Such methodologies do not apply to a variety of problems in materials science, where the need to collect and curate high-quality data and the computational infrastructure required may pose major challenges. Critical problems have been mentioned in the discussion of sensors and biosensors in Sect. <xref rid="Sec16" ref-type="sec">4</xref>. To work efficiently, most learning algorithms require a reasonably large set of known examples. While the cost of collecting, e.g., thousands of images and/and millions of comments in a social network, is nearly negligible, experiments in Materials Science might demand reagents, enzymes, compounds, combined with significant protocolled labour, and time to observe and annotate the results. As a possible consequence, computational techniques may lack the minimum amount of data necessary to produce trustful models. Rather than saving time and resources, the reverse may happen, leading to increased costs due to unwittingly applied erroneous procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Challenges and prospects</title><p id="Par104">In an additional challenge, many societal issues must be addressed to ensure the proper use of big data, including important ethical and privacy preservation questions. Take, for instance, the case of computer-assisted clinical diagnosis, which relies heavily on data from sensors and biosensors. As pointed out by Rodrigues-Jr et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], an important obstacle to the thorough integration of databases is not related to the lack of technology but, rather, to commitments from individuals and institutions to work together in establishing acceptable procedures for data curation and privacy preservation and to avoid abusive or inadequate usage of medical data. The same holds in Materials Science.</p><p id="Par105">In contrast to our approach regarding the uses of big data and ML in materials science, in reviewing the importance of sensors and biosensors to developing IoT and similar applications, we provided a critical analysis of the advances and limitations in the field. The prospects for the future depend on behavioral issues as well as scientific challenges. We hope that the acquired popularity of big data and ML may raise the awareness of researchers and developers on the importance of how they treat, preserve and analyze their data. We advocate that ML and other computational tools should already be in routine use not only by those working on sensors and biosensors but also in topics not traditionally considered sensing. The latter include various types of spectroscopy and imaging– which generate massive amounts of data. We believe there is a gap between the wide range of techniques available for data management and analysis and their actual use in the daily practice of many research and development facilities. This may be due to a combination of factors, such as a slow pace of dissemination of novel techniques, lack of a theoretical framework to guide the choice of techniques, and limited availability of accessible and usable implementations. Regardless of the reasons, increased awareness of this issue and more informed use of existing methodologies is an important step to reinforce progress.</p><p id="Par106">As for the prospects for big data and ML for Materials Science in the next few years, it is self-evident that considerable advances can be attained by extending research efforts on predicting material properties, database-supported material design, identification of suitable compounds with genetic algorithms, synthesis prediction using DL, computer-aided drug design, and the determination of density-functional properties using alternative machine learning algorithms instead of calculations. One may, for instance, envisage searching for drugs and drug targets by harnessing the whole body of medical literature as a complement to applying those almost entirely chemistry-oriented approaches. An example of such a system is already being tested with a version of the Watson supercomputer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">179</xref>], which deals with text in scientific papers and patents, in addition to considering pharmacological, chemical, and genomics data. The rationale behind the Watson approach is to establish connections in millions of text pages in a huge database of molecular properties. A similar approach was used to process toxicity data to predict the activity of chemical compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref>]. Cases of enhanced prediction with clinical chemistry data were illustrated by Richardson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], who employ ML methods with large datasets for diseases such as hepatitis B and C. Nonetheless, the major goal of reaching truly intelligent systems to solve problems in chemistry beyond those of classification types will require the convergence of big data and ML within schemes that allow one to interpret and explain the results. This is a major challenge not only for materials science but also for any area of science and technology.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work received support from Brazilian agencies FAPESP (2016/17078-0, 2018/22214-6, 2013-14262-7, 2018/17620-5), CNPq (305580/2017-5, 406550/2018-2) and CAPES (Finance Code 001).
