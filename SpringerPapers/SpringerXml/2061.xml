T-Ge is a two-dimensional material with unique electronic properties, including zero band gap and two Dirac points. The electronic properties of T-Ge can be influenced by bias voltage, which can open its band gap and convert it to a semiconductor due to its buckling structure. The tunable band gap of biased T-Ge, makes it a a promising option for electronic and optoelectronic devices. The band structure of T-Ge is split by the magnetic field, leading to an increases its band edges due to the Zeeman Effect. The findings demonstrate that the thermoelectric properties of T-Ge are highly sensitive to external parameters and modifications of the band structure. The thermal and electrical conductivity of T-Ge increase with increasing temperature due to the rise in thermal energy of charge carriers. The thermoelectric properties of T-Ge decrease with bias voltage due to band gap opening, increase with the magnetic field due to a modifications of the band structure, and increase with chemical potential due to increasing density of charge carriers. By manipulating the band structure of T-Ge through bias voltage and chemical doping, the electrical conductivity can be optimized to achieve higher figure of merit (ZT) and improved thermoelectric performance. The results demonstrate the potential of T-Ge for use in electronic and magnetic devices, opening up new possibilities for further research and development in this field.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Portfolio</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>12023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature Limited</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>23</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2023_Article_39318.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Two-dimensional (2D) materials, which consist of a single layer or a few layers of atoms, have a wide range of potential applications in future electronics and energy storage devices due to their unique electronic and optical properties. In this regard, numerous studies have been investigated the applications of different well-known nano-sheet structures such as Graphene, BN, SiC, GeC, Germanene and Silicene, in various fields of science and engineering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">One of the first and most famous structures from these family structures is Graphene which has a hexagonal structure with two carbon atoms in the unit cell. Graphene has been widely used in various fields including sensors, batteries, and transistors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In the Graphene, the valence and conduction bands meet each other at a single point known as the Dirac point, resulting in several distinct electronic properties such as zero band gap with linear dispersion relations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. These features play a crucial role in electronic properties of Graphene and make it an excellent candidate for optoelectronics applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Aside from graphene, there are a number of 2D materials such as Germanene and Silicene, that exhibit zero band gap and linear dispersion, similar to graphene. These materials have also emerged as attractive candidates for applications in future technologies due to their intrinsic electronic properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Germanene is a single layer of germanium atoms arranged in a buckled honeycomb lattice which shows massless Dirac fermions and a high electron mobility due to its zero band gap at the Dirac points<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. These structures exhibit a tunable band gap in the presence of a bias voltage, due to their buckling parameters and their band gap can increased with higher bias strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Hexagonal graphene is not the only structure that exhibits gapless Dirac cone features. In addition, the new allotrope of graphene with tetragonal structure which called T-Graphene, is also a metal with two Dirac points in its band structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Note that unlike conventional graphene, which has a hexagonal lattice structure, tetragonal graphene has a square lattice structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. T-Graphene, shows interesting properties which are useful for electronic device applications. For example, at low concentration levels, the substitution of transition metal (TM) can tune the Fermi level and induce magnetic moments in the T-graphene network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Also, the magnitude of the magnetic moment increases as the atomic weight of the dopant atom increases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Also, the non-toxic boron (B)-nitrogen (N) pair substitution on tetragonal graphene (TG) nanodots can be useful for CO gas sensing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">In addition to T-Graphene, materials with the same tetragonal structure, such as T-Germanene (T-Ge), T-Silicene (T-Si) and T-SiC have been predicted and investigated using DFT calculations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. T-Ge and T-Si are 2D materials composed of a single layer of Ge/Si atoms arranged in a squared lattice structure and they have two Dirac cones in their electronic band structures. The electronic and mechanical properties of these materials have been explored, revealing their potential use in electronic and optoelectronic applications. T-Silicene has two Dirac points in its band structure, resulting in a zero band gap which can be tuned with the application of an electric field and it exhibits elastic properties that are comparable to those of Silicene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In addition, the T-Si has an anisotropic optical response and when it is converted into nanoribbons, its optical properties and thermoelectric properties can be modified by varying the edge width and geometry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The stability and electronic properties of T-SiC are dependent on the arrangement of its constituent atoms and it exhibits a range of electronic properties, including semiconductor, semi-metal, and metal behavior due to the arrangement of their atoms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The predicted properties of T-SiC suggest that it could be highly valuable in a variety of applications, including solar cells, nano-devices, transistors, and phototransistors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The optimized structure for the T-Ge exhibits buckled geometry and it shows interesting properties such as double Dirac points, zero band gap and better thermoelectric behavior than graphene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Due to the buckling structure, the T-Ge structure shows tunable electronic properties with bias voltage and its band gap increases linearly with the strength of the bias voltage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">The thermoelectric properties of 2D materials can be tuned through various methods, such as chemical doping, strain engineering, and surface modification. Optimizing these methods can lead to the development of 2D materials with high ZT values, which can be used to create more efficient and cost-effective thermoelectric devices for a variety of applications including power generation, refrigeration, and thermal management in electronic devices.</p><p id="Par8">Modifying the thermoelectric properties of 2D Germanene structures is essential for the development of more efficient thermoelectric devices that can be used for energy conversion and waste heat recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Thermal conductivity in 2D Germanene increases with temperature and is influenced by the bias voltage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Strain engineering can modify the thermal properties of Germanene and the highest power factor for p-type and n-type doping was achieved in hydrogenated monolayer Germanene under biaxial strain of + 3% and − 6%, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par9">The thermal conductivity in monolayer Germanene is influenced by magnetic fields, with an increase in thermal conductivity as magnetic field strength increases at a fixed temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The efficiency of thermoelectric devices is determined by a dimensionless figure of merit, ZT, which depends on the electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and Seebeck coefficient. Germanene exhibits a high ZT value at room temperature, making it a promising candidate for thermoelectric applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">In addition to Germanene, the thermal properties of T-Ge have also been studied. It has been shown that the thermoelectric figure of merit and power of T-Ge increase increase with electric field strength, reaching a maximum value of 0.625 V Å<sup>− 1</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. The thermoelectric properties of T-Ge are dependent on the chemical potential and its electrical conductivity and power factor exhibit increases with both positive and negative values of µ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par11">Until now, unlike intense studies on the mechanical and electronic properties of Germanene, a limited amount of research has been devoted to investigate the thermal properties of T-Ge. This study uses a tight binding model based on previous DFT calculations to investigate the effects of electric and magnetic fields on the properties of T-Ge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Model and formalism</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Electronic structure</title><p id="Par12">In this section, the Hamiltonian (H) matrix is obtained using the nearest neighbor tight binding model.

The band structure exhibits several valence and conduction subbands on both sides of the Fermi level. Without external fields, T-Ge is metallic because the lowest and highest bands touch at the Fermi level, and there are double Dirac points present in the ΓX and MΓ directions. The band dispersion around these points is linear with respect to the wave vector [Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a1]. In the presence of a bias voltage U = 0.3 eV, the band gap opens at both Dirac points, and the band structure exhibits a parabolic behavior around these points [Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a2]. As the bias voltage strength increases to U = 0.7 eV, the vertical distance between the valence and conduction bands at the Dirac points increases, leading to an increase in the band gap. These findings are consistent with previous studies of T-Si with different electric field strengths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, and they agree with the findings of Ref.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> for T-Ge.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The band structure of the T-Ge (<bold>a1</bold>)–(<bold>a3</bold>) without magnetic field and in the presence of the bias voltages U = 0, 0.35 and 0.7 eV and (<bold>b1</bold>)–(<bold>b3</bold>) without bias voltage and in the presence of the magnetic fields Π = 0.1, 0.15 and 0.25, respectively.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2023_39318_Fig2_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par31">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b1, b2 and b3, when a magnetic field Π = 0.1, 0.15 and 0.25 is applied to T-Ge, the magnetic moments of the electrons in the structure align with the field, causing a splitting of each valence and conduction band into two subbands with spin up and down. This feature is known as the Zeeman Effect. At any magnetic field strength, the highest and lowest subbands touch at four points on the Fermi level, resulting in a zero band gap. As a result of applying the magnetic field, the band edges and flatting the subbands change with the magnetic field strength Π. in the MΓ direction, the subbands become flattened in energy at around E =  ± 1 eV. As the magnetic field strength increases, the distance between neighboring subbands also increases. Monolayer phosphorene exhibits a similar pattern of splitting the valence and conduction subbands due to the presence of a Zeeman magnetic field<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par32">As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref>, when a magnetic field Π = 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 is applied to a biased T-Ge with U = 0.7 eV, each energy level splits into two sublevels due to the Zeeman Effect. The splitting distance between the sublevels increases with increasing Π. Additionally, the non-zero band gap of biased T-Ge with U = 0.7 eV decreases with magnetic field until it vanishes at a critical value of Π = 0.35.</p><p id="Par33">It can be concluded that the bias voltage and magnetic field have opposing effects on the electronic structure of T-Ge. The bias voltage increases the band gap and decreases electronic transport, while the magnetic field has a contrasting effect, decreasing the band gap and enhancing the electronic transport. Understanding the sensitivity of the electronic properties of T-Ge to external fields is important for design and optimizing of electronic devices based on T-Ge, such as transistors and sensors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Effects of the temperature on thermal properties</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Thermal conductivity</title><p id="Par34">Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a shows thermal conductivity κ(T) for undoped T-Ge with different values of bias voltages, in the absence of the magnetic field. In the unbiased case, the κ(T) value is zero at absolute temperature T = 0 K, because there are no free carriers available for heat transfer. However, as the temperature increases, the κ(T) of the T-Ge exhibits a linear increase due to the excitation of charge carriers to higher energy levels.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The thermal conductivity of the T-Ge structure in terms of the temperature in the presence of the (<bold>a</bold>) bias voltage with Π = 0 and (<bold>b</bold>) magnetic field without bias voltage.

This is because the non-zero band gap acts as a potential barrier for the excitation of charge carriers. For the biased T-Ge, at low temperatures, there exists a temperature range called the "TZ region" where κ(T) remains zero due to the band gap opening. In this region, the thermal energy is insufficient to excite electrons from the valence to the conduction bands. The width of the TZ region depends on the magnitude of the bias voltage U, and it is about 150 K for U = 0.175 eV and increases to 500 K for U = 0.7 eV. However, as the temperature continues to increases beyond the TZ region, the κ(T) begins to increase and becomes non-zero because the charge carriers obtain enough energy to transition to higher energy levels. The strength of the bias voltage also affects the behavior of κ(T) in T-Ge. A stronger electric field leads to a smaller κ(T), because the thermal transition rate of electrons decreases due to the increasing band gap and fewer electrons are available to conduct to higher energy levels.

In agreement with biased T-Ge, monolayer InSe also exhibits a similar dependence of κ(μ) on μ<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par65">Figure <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>c and d illustrate the impact of the magnetic field on the thermal conductivity of unbiased T-Ge at different temperature values of 300 K, 600 K, and 900 K. Across all cases, the thermal conductivity, κ(µ), has a maximum values at µ = 0 and decreases as µ changes. This behavior occurs because the unbiased T-Ge has a zero band gap and when the magnetic field increases, more charge carriers are excited to higher energy levels which in turn increases scattering and decreases their mobility. Notably, the thermal conductivity κ(µ) reaches its maximum value for a smaller magnetic field strength, regardless of the temperature value [Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>c and d for Π = 0.2]. Conversely, the intensity of κ(µ) is the smallest for Π = 0.6 across all values of µ. It is worth mentioning that the thermal conductivity increases with temperature at a constant Π, with the highest values observed at T = 900 K.</p><p id="Par66">Similar to thermal conductivity, the electrical conductivity is sensitive to doping parameter μ. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>, the bias voltage and magnetic field also influence its strength at different temperature values.<fig id="Fig11"><label>Figure 11</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Electrical conductivity as a function of µ in the presence of (<bold>a</bold>)–(<bold>c</bold>) bias voltage and (<bold>d</bold>)–(<bold>f</bold>) magnetic field for the different temperatures T = 300 K (red), 600 K (blue) and 900 K (green).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2023_39318_Fig11_HTML.png" id="MO11"/></fig></p><p id="Par67">The temperature directly affects the electrical conductivity, with higher temperatures leading to larger values of σ(µ) across all values of µ. In the absence of external fields, the σ(µ) exhibits a minimum value at µ = 0 and increases as |µ| increases up to 0.16 eV, after which it decreases again. The enhancement temperature directly affects the σ(µ), with higher temperature T = 900 K leading to higher strength across the full range of µ. The results are in good agreement with previous DFT calculation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. When the bias voltage is applied, the σ(µ) remains close to zero in |µ|&lt; 0.1 eV due to band gap opening caused by the bias voltage. For |μ| above this range, σ(μ) increases with further negative/positive increases in µ. When the bias voltage is increased to U = 0.7 eV, the σ(µ) remains zero for |µ|≤ 0.25 eV. Outside this range, as |µ| increases, the σ(µ) becomes non-zero and increases. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>b and c, beyond the zero region µ, higher temperature result in larger σ(µ) and this behavior continues until |µ| reaches ± 0.21 eV and ± 0.4 eV, where the trend is reversed. It can be concluded that electrical conductivity of biased T-Ge exhibits several notable behaviors including: (i) symmetric behavior of σ(µ) with respect to positive and negative µ values, (ii) increasing the intensity of σ(µ) with temperature in all µ region and (iii) increasing the zero intensity region for σ(µ) as the bias voltage increases.</p><p id="Par68">Figure <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>d, e and f show that the electrical conductivity of T-Ge is significantly affected by the application of a magnetic field. This is due to the distinct metallic properties of T-Ge at different Π values. At a temperature of 300 K and a Π value of 0.2, the σ(µ) exhibits two minimum values at µ = 0 and 0.2 eV, with a maximum value at µ = 0.1 eV [Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>d]. However, when the magnetic field is raised to Π = 0.4 and 0.6, the σ(µ) remains at a minimum at µ = 0 and then reaches its maximum value at µ = 0.12 eV [Fig. <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref>e and f]. For each selected temperature, the intensity of σ(µ) is approximately the same for Π = 0.2 and 0.4, with negligible differences and both are greater than the intensity for Π = 0.6.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par69">This study investigates the thermoelectric properties of the 2D T-Ge, using the Kubo-Greenwood formula and a tight binding model with a Green function approach. The results show that the electrical/thermal conductivity, figure of merit, and power factor of T-Ge are significantly influenced by the bias voltage, magnetic field, and chemical potential. T-Ge exhibits a unique electronic structure with two Dirac points and a zero band gap, making it sensitive to external fields. We found that T-Ge remains metallic in the presence of a magnetic field, but the bias voltage opens and increases its band gap. In addition, the application of an external magnetic field leads to band splitting and the creation of additional band edge states, which can be attributed to the Zeeman Effects. Moreover, as temperature increases, the thermal and electrical conductivity of T-Ge also increase due to the increase in thermal energy of charge carriers. Modifying the band structure, particularly reducing the band gap, has a significant impact on the thermoelectric properties of T-Ge. The finding results demonstrate that the thermoelectric properties of T-Ge are highly dependent on the external parameters such as magnetic field, bias voltage and chemical potential. Specifically, we found that the thermoelectric properties of T-Ge decrease as the bias voltage increases, increase with the magnetic field due to the modification the band structure, and increase with the chemical potential due to the higher density of charge carriers. Tuning the band structure of T-Ge through external parameters can optimize its electrical conductivity, leading to an enhanced figure of merit (ZT), and improved thermoelectric performance. Controlling the thermoelectric properties of materials using bias and doping is crucial in industry as it can lead to the development of more efficient thermoelectric devices. The findings also demonstrate the potential of T-Ge for use in electronic and magnetic devices, opening up new possibilities for further research and development in this field.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><p>R.C. carried out the idea and performed the calculations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The datasets used and analyzed during the current study available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Competing interests</title><p id="Par70">The author declares no competing interests.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Coello-Fiallos</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Tene</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Guayllas</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Haro</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Haro</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Vacacela Gomez</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">DFT comparison of structural and electronic properties of graphene and germanene: Monolayer and bilayer systems</article-title><source>Mater.
