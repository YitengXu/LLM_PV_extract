The construction of a well-defined, intimate interface is vital for efficient charge carrier separation, however, it remains a challenge in synthesis. Here we synthesize a junction bearing intimate interface, composed of plasmonic Ag nanoparticles and matrix with silver node via a facile one-step approach. The plasmonic effect of Ag nanoparticles on the matrix is visualized through electron energy loss mapping. Moreover, charge carrier transfer from the plasmonic nanoparticles to the matrix is verified through ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and in-situ photoelectron spectroscopy. The system delivers highly efficient visible-light photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> generation, surpassing most reported metal-organic framework-based photocatalytic systems. This work sheds light on effective electronic and energy bridging between plasmonic nanoparticles and organic semiconductors.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">The integration of plasmonic structures with photoactive matrices offers a promising means to enhance solar-to-fuel conversion.

The grand challenge in the photocatalytic area is the relatively low efficiency, suffering from the narrow light absorption and severe photogenerated hole and electron recombination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Thus achieving extensive visible-light absorption and efficient solar-to-chemical energy conversion is a sought-after goal. Plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) featuring surface plasmon resonance (SPR) are ideal photocatalytic candidates to extend the photo-responsive range and increase exciton generation of semiconductors by enhanced electromagnetic near fields<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, which has attracted broad interest. Integrating plasmonic NPs into semiconductors has two prominent advantages: (i) the formation of a Schottky junction, which contributes to charge separation and transfer; (ii) localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR), which is beneficial to the extended photon absorption range and the excitation of active charge carriers.</p><p id="Par4">Compared with most reported inorganic semiconductors, metal-organic matrix (MOM, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs)) semiconductors, formed by coordination-driven self-assembly between metal or metal cluster centers and photoactive organic ligands, shows great potential in photocatalysis due to excellent structural designability and the power of regular porous structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Therefore, a hybrid made of plasmonic NPs and photoactive MOM would be of significant interest for photocatalytic applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, one of the biggest challenges in constructing such a junction is preparing a well-defined and surfactant-free, ‘intimate’ interface: surfactants at the interface can act as a barrier and result in poor charge transport between the components, thus suppressing the photocatalytic activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Realizing a well-defined, barrier-free interface is thus essential for understanding the fundamental interplay between the two constituents and for the realization of practical photocatalytic applications. For instance, Ag (I) cluster-based nodes could allow an effective ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) or metal/cluster-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT/CLCT), which would help the photocatalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, very few Ag ion cluster-containing MOMs have been reported because they tend to suffer from poor stability due to the weak Ag-ligand coordination bond<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In this work, we develop a facile one-step approach to construct a hybrid structure of plasmonic AgNPs and Ag-porphyrin MOM, denoted as Ag–AgMOMs. The in-situ growth strategy enables the AgNPs and AgMOM to share the Ag atoms at the interface, which appears essential for an intimate interface between the two compounds (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). A “clean” metal-MOM interface with few surfactants is demonstrated by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and related control experiments. The lack of surfactants (polyvinylpyrrolidone, PVP) at the inner NP/MOM interface allows the efficient interfacial charge transfer, while PVP on the outer surface of Ag–AgMOMs imparts the excellent dispersibility and stability of the latter in aqueous solution. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) spectra and mapping offer the observation of the plasmonic effect of AgNPs on the AgMOM. The plasmonic AgNPs significantly enhance the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution of the AgMOM, reaching high values of 1025 and 3153 μmol h<sup>−1</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> under visible-light and full-spectrum light irradiation, respectively. These values are comparable with those of the state-of-the-art metal-organic-based photocatalytic systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The underlying charge transfer from the plasmonic AgNPs to AgMOM, exciton-plasmon coupling and associated dynamics under light irradiation are further revealed by in-situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. This work may guide the design of plasmonic nanoparticles coupled with organic semiconductors for effective electronic and energy communication.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Morphology characterizations of Ag–AgMOM.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic diagram of the one-step synthesis of Ag–AgMOM using in-situ solvothermal method. <bold>b</bold> Typical low magnified TEM image of Ag–AgMOM with reaction time 28 h.

The (111) crystal plane is preferrentially exposed   due to its lowest surface energy (ca. 0.76 J/m<sup>2</sup>) compared with other crystal planes in cubic-structured Ag crystals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Moreover, the fast Fourier-transform (FFT) pattern (inset in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>) of the NP presents the characteristic diffraction pattern of the face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure of silver crystal (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>).

In this work, the size of AgNPs in the Ag–AgMOM systems was tuned via the reaction time, feeding ratio and regulating agent during the one-step synthesis. As displayed in Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>, the average diameter of AgNPs could be reduced from 14.7 nm to 3.2 nm, 7.9 nm and 12.5 nm when the reaction time was decreased from 28 h to 20 h, 4 h and 1 h, respectively, when maintaining all other synthetic parameters. When the reaction time was extended to 36 h, the average diameter of AgNPs reached up to ~19.3 nm (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>). The use of stoichiometric  excess of Ag ions (weight ratio of Ag salt/TCPP from 1:1 to 2:1) led to a dramatically increased coverage density of NPs with a slightly larger average diameter of 15.2 nm (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>). In contrast, decreasing the ratio of Ag salt/TCPP to 1:4 resulted in a lower coverage and a smaller size (8.5 nm) of AgNPs (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>). A moderate coverage density of AgNPs with an average diameter of 7.2 nm was obtained using <italic>m</italic><sub>Ag+</sub>/<italic>m</italic><sub>TCPP</sub> = 1:2 at the 4 h reaction (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>).

In all the cases, no observed free AgNPs suggests that AgNP nucleation happens in the AgMOM rather than in the homogeneous reaction solution (mixture of dimethylformamide (DMF) and ethanol).</p><p id="Par10">To gain more tunability on the NP’s size and heterostructure’s morphology, we further introduced a modulator (trifluoroacetic acid, TFA). As shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>, a fiber-like Ag–AgMOM structure with ultrasmall AgNPs of 2.8 nm in diameter was formed by adding an additional 100 μL TFA into the reaction system (<italic>m</italic><sub>Ag+</sub>/<italic>m</italic><sub>TCPP</sub> = 1:1, 28 h), manifesting that TFA suppresses the growth of AgNPs and influences the formation of Ag–AgMOM.

The different shape of Ag nanocubes compared with the AgNPs in the Ag–AgMOM indicates the restricted growth of AgNPs during the preparation of Ag–AgMOM.

The stronger coordination bonding of Cu<sub>2</sub>(COO)<sub>4</sub> compared to Ag<sub>2</sub>(COO)<sub>4</sub> possibly interrupted the formation of Cu-porphyrin MOM rather than Ag-porphyrin MOM in the above condition, as evidenced by EDS analysis of Ag-CuMOM in the varied areas (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">23</xref>).

Firstly, the dissolved Ag ions undergo the metal-organic coordination with the TCPP ligand, forming AgMOM. Then the Ag ion nodes in the AgMOM act as nucleation sites to induce the heterogeneous growth of AgNPs. In turn, the AgNPs stabilized the AgMOM by presumably sharing the Ag atoms at the interface.

A short distance between the AgNP and semiconductor is thus required in order to fully benefit from the near-field effect.</p><p id="Par14">For a better understanding of the SPR effects on photocatalysis, it is desirable to study the plain MOM with Ag ion coordination but without any AgNP as a control sample. However, we found that it was challenging to synthesize the plain AgMOM without AgNPs because of the relative instability of Ag ion coordinated TCPP itself in the absence of AgNPs. Therefore, we introduced a MOM with Cu<sup>2+</sup> node (CuMOM) as a control sample to better interpret the electronic structure of the Ag–AgMOM. The UV–Vis spectra of the Ag–AgMOM film displayed an absorption edge at 856 nm and an extended light-harvesting range with respect to the AgNP-free CuMOM (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">25</xref>), in line with the solution absorption spectra. The optical band gap (Eg) of CuMOM was determined to be 1.87 eV from the Tauc plot (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>), consistent with the literature reported values<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

Mott-Schottky plots of Ag–AgMOM under different frequencies were employed to determine their conduction band minimum (CBM) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref> and Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">26</xref>). Higher CBM (−1.01 V vs. NHE) of Ag–AgMOM than 0 V vs. NHE of water reduction potential implies the feasiblity of Ag–AgMOM for photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> generation.

As expected, no H<sub>2</sub> was detected in the dark for the same sample. As a control, only very low H<sub>2</sub> generation rate ~ 4 μmol h<sup>−1</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> was detected from TCPP itself (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">27</xref>). Considering almost no plasmonic peak was observed in Ag-AgMOM (1 h) from the UV–Vis absorption spectra due to the very small AgNPs loading (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">28</xref>), Ag–AgMOM (1 h) was also used as a control sample. The visible-light photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> generation rate of Ag–AgMOM (1 h) was tested to be only 57 μmol h<sup>−1</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>. Meanwhile, few H<sub>2</sub> (15 μmol h<sup>−1</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>) was detected for pure CuMOM due to severe charge recombination and relatively narrow absorption range; Ag-CuMOM with small AgNPs (&lt;3 nm) (and no detectable plasmonic effect) presented a slightly higher but still low H<sub>2</sub> generation rate of 73 μmol h<sup>−1</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">29</xref>). We recognize that the small AgNPs in our system may contribute to photocatalytic activity by acting as a co-catalyst. However, the much higher photocatalytic rate (1025 μmol h<sup>−1</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>) for the Ag–AgMOM (28 h) compared with 57 μmol h<sup>−1</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> for the Ag–AgMOM (1 h) and 73 μmol h<sup>−1</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> for the Ag-CuMOM, which already had many tiny AgNPs on the surface, highlights the vital role of the plasmonic effect in the optimal sample of the Ag–AgMOM (28 h). The AgNPs in our optimal sample not only increase the light absorption but also promote the exciton generation of AgMOM by the intense electromagnetic near field. It should be noted that it is the interplay of all related factors (such as plasmonic effect, size and percentage) that determines the final photocatalytic performance. Of note, we cannot exclude the possibility that sacrificial agents, besides H<sub>2</sub>O, may also yield H<sub>2</sub>. But since our materials cannot fully split water by themselves, as noticed for most MOFs and MOMs, we have to involve the use of the sacrificial agent. However, we would like to emphasize that herein we focus on comparing photocatalytic performance of plasmon-enabled Ag–AgMOM with plasmonic effect-free pure CuMOM and Ag–AgMOM (1 h) during the photocatalysis process. The observed dramatic increase of photocatalytic efficiency of the plasmonic sample cannot be explained by the sacrificial agent.

This is primarily due to slightly varied lattice sizes resulting from different linkage sizes (bond lengths between Ag–O and Cu–O/Zn–O). It should be noted that introducing PVP into the MOM synthesis can increase the water dispersion ability, but decrease the crystallinity of MOMs, regardless of different metal centers (Cu or Zn), explaining our relatively low crystallinity of the Ag–AgMOM.</p><p id="Par20">N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption measurement was used to examine the porosity and surface area of Ag–AgMOM at 77 K.

The BET surface area of the Ag–AgMOM after photocatalysis under full-spectrum light irradiations without a 420 nm filter was further assessed. It was found that the N<sub>2</sub> adsorption-desorption isotherm of Ag–AgMOM after photocatalysis remained similar to that of the pristine one (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">45</xref>). However, the specific surface area (151 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>) of Ag–AgMOM after light irradiation was a bit lower than that (223 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>) of the pristine one, maybe due to slight decreased crystallinity of the Ag–AgMOM (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">32</xref>) or slight agglomeration after photocatalysis.</p><p id="Par21">The band structure and spin-resolved density of states calculations (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">46</xref>) of the AgMOM obtained from DFT calculations in the range-separated hybrid functional HSE06 indicates a bandgap of 0.62 eV with VBM at −5.47 eV (−0.97 eV vs. RHE) and CBM at −4.85 eV (−0.35 eV vs. RHE). The larger observed optical bandgap may be attributed to the lack of HOMO-LUMO orbital overlap (oscillator strength for HOMO-LUMO excitation in time-dependent (TD)DFT calculation of the porphyrin-carboxylate fragment is less than 0.001). Indeed, the band structure EK plot of the pristine 2D AgMOM reveals relatively flat bands with large effective masses (&gt;50 m*<sub>h/e</sub>), showing the lack of π-conjugation in the Ag-carboxylate bridges of AgMOM without additional AgNPs.</p><p id="Par22">The Raman spectra of TCPP, PVP and Ag–AgMOM were taken using a 520 nm laser as the excitation source. As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref> (bottom panel), DFT calculated Raman spectra of TCPP and simplified PVP (repeating unit = 4, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">47</xref>) are basically in line with their experimental spectra (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, top panel). The enhanced Raman signal of organic TCPP ligands in Ag–AgMOM, with respect to pure TCPP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>, featureless purple line), is attributed to surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) originating from the electromagnetic field enhancement due to the presence of plasmonic AgNPs nearby. Specifically, the significantly enhanced Raman signals (1200~1700 cm<sup>−1</sup>) of porphyrin in AgMOM suggest an intimate interface, with only a few PVP molecules between AgNPs and porphyrin AgMOM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Since the near-field decays fast with the distance from the AgNP’s surface (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), the presence of large ligands will significantly decrease the positive contribution of the near field to the Raman signal. To verify our hypothesis of the clean interface, we further synthesized AgNPs of a similar size of ~20 nm and capped with the same PVP ligand (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S48</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S49</xref>).

In this case, we could mainly detect the PVP signal but relatively weak TCPP signal due to the inevitable presence of PVP at the interface of AgNPs and CuMOM (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Indeed, usually it is challenging to remove surfactants from the surface of NPs prepared via traditional synthesis methods, which entail a separate preparation of 2D MOM and NPs, followed by their coupling.</p><p id="Par23">Moreover, the strong Raman band of Ag–AgMOM ranging from 3000 to 3100 cm<sup>−1</sup>, ascribed to PVP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>), likely implies that the rest of AgNPs’ surface (not in contact with porphyrin MOM) is wrapped by the PVP surfactants, which enable the colloidal stability of composites in water. It is worth pointing out that, the considerably increased PVP Raman signals in the composite compared to pure PVP highlight the SERS effect due to AgNPs.</p><p id="Par24">XPS was used to analyze Ag–AgMOM samples synthesized at the reaction time of 1 and 20 h. We found that they both contained Ag ion and metal Ag<sup>0</sup> (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">52</xref>). The Ag ion signal at 373.8 eV (or 373.6 eV) and 367.8 eV (or 367.6 eV) is derived from Ag, which is a crucial constituent part of AgMOM and Ag ion species on the surface of AgNPs, whereas the Ag<sup>0</sup> at 374.2 eV and 368.2 eV is attributed to AgNPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.

It should be noted that such a –COOAg- motif is generally not very stable due to the weak coordination bonding; to the best of our knowledge, porphyrin MOFs with Ag ion node has rarely been reported. Unfortunately, we failed to attain the pristine AgMOM without the simultaneous formation of AgNPs on the surface despite our considerable attempts. To understand how AgNPs co-exist on the 2D AgMOM, we calculated the binding energy in DFT via energy decomposition analysis (M062X/DZP) of the Ag<sub>3</sub>-AgMOM fragment. We find that there is an additional stabilization of −13.9 kcal/mol resulting from this association, which supports our experimental observation. We thus hypothesize that the in-situ one-step synthesis brings a significant stabilization to the hybrid structure. As a result of the strong interfacial bonding, the AgNPs could not be detached from the porphyrin AgMOM even after strong sonication. Such a strong binding between two ingredients is unusual in nanoparticle-loaded MOM composites but is highly desired for their applications. This junction with the surfactant-free interface enabling charge transfer across the interface is promising for photocatalysis. The Nyquist plot of the Ag–AgMOM hybrid photocatalyst shows a much smaller semicircle radius than that of the TCPP precursor (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">55</xref>), revealing a lower charge-transfer resistance and faster transport of photogenerated charges of the former, which may also benefit from the pristine interface<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

It was found that the plasmon resonance peak of AgNPs on the AgMOM displayed lower energy at ca. 2.82 eV compared with that (3.17 eV) of pure AgNPs, suggesting the effect of dielectric environment variation (due to the AgMOM’s presence) on the LSPR of AgNPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.

In contrast, the negative (bleaching) signals of Ag–AgMOM samples at 460 nm, which is related to plasmonic excitation of AgNPs therein, decay in a few ps timescales. The bleaching signal for the Ag–AgMOM (3 h) sample decays very fast (~100 fs), followed by a slow growth (~4 ps) of a positive signal that persists until 20 ps, similar to the pure AgNPs. However, the Ag–AgMOM (28 h) sample shows a slower single-exponential decay (~2 ps) of the bleach to zero (without any obvious positive signal that corresponds to the charge induced by free AgNPs). This possibly indicates a more efficient charge carrier (electron and/or hole) transfer from the AgNPs to AgMOM in the Ag–AgMOM (28 h) than in the Ag–AgMOM (3 h). This is also the underlying reason for a stronger bleaching signal at 460 nm relative to the main bleaching signal (~419 nm) in the Ag–AgMOM (28 h) sample (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">59</xref>).

Moreover, charge transfer from the plasmonic AgNPs to AgMOM is evidenced by ultrafast TA measurements, in-situ XPS and DFT calculations. Interestingly, the generally unstable Ag node-based porphyrin MOM is stabilized by AgNPs through sharing Ag atoms. Combining all the advantages of this system, i.e., the broadened light-harvesting range of plasmonic AgNPs, efficient charge/energy transfer, elevated reduction energy levels, and fast mass diffusion in thin AgMOM, the developed Ag–AgMOM yielded significantly enhanced visible-light photocatalytic H<sub>2</sub> generation rate (1025 μmol h<sup>−1</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>) and an even higher rate of 3153 μmol h<sup>−1</sup> g<sup>−1</sup> under the full-spectrum irradiation.

In a typical process, 5 mg of the photocatalysts were dispersed in 45 mL of water (with or without 5 mL ethanol) and 2 mL triethanolamine (TEOA) was used as a hole scavenger. The solution was irradiated under a PLS-SXE300/300UV with a power of 300 W from Perfect Light Ltd with or without a 420 nm filter.

Using a low emission current of the cold field emission gun (FEG), a narrow FWHM of 375 meV could be reached and used for low-loss spectrum imaging. Low-loss spectra were acquired with a dispersion of 15 meV, a convergence semi-angle of 12.9 mrad and a collection semi-angle of 31.2 mrad. The background tail of the zero-loss was removed by fitting a power law to the spectra. Plasmonic maps were created by choosing an energy integration window of 0.5 eV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Ultrafast transient absorption measurements</title><p id="Par42">A custom-built TA setup from Newport, as described elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, was used in this work. Briefly, a multi-pass Ti:Sapphire amplifier laser system (Libra HE+, Coherent Inc.) was employed to generate ~100 fs laser pulse at 800 nm (with 1 kHz). A fraction of the 800 nm pulse was frequency-doubled to produce a 400 nm pump pulse used in the current experiment. Another fraction (~1 μJ) of the 800 nm pulse was used to generate a broad white light probe pulse by focusing on the CaF<sub>2</sub> crystal. The pump pulse was allowed to pass through a 0.5 kHz optical chopper to read out the changes in probe transmission for each cycle, while a motorized delay was placed in the probe path to provide the time delay between the two pulses. The samples dispersed in ethanol were used for the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements</title><p id="Par43">All the electrochemical and photoelectrochemical measurements were performed on a CHI 660 C electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments) in a typical three-electrode setup using a Pt as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) covered by samples with loading mass of 3~5 mg cm<sup>−2</sup> as a working electrode. The electrolyte was 0.1 M of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (pH = 6.8) aqueous solution, N<sub>2</sub> bubbled for ca. 0.5 h to remove O<sub>2</sub> before testing. Ohmic resistance curves were scanned from 100 kHz to 10 MHz, and the scanning bias voltage was 0.2 V. For photocurrent response experiments, an AM1.5 G solar simulator (LCS-100, Newport) served as the light source, and a photochopper was used to control the light.

Due to the natural difference between the Ag foil and the samples the photoelectron energy origin correction (∆<italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub>) determined for the foil could not be used for the samples and had to be fitted again independently. One Debye–Waller factor (σ<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>) was fitted for all the contributions to reduce the number of variables. The coordination numbers (N<sub>i</sub>) and distances (R<sub>i</sub>) were adjusted freely and independently for each sample and each path.
