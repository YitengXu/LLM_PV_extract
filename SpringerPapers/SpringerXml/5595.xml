Emphasis is placed on (relatively) simple dynamo models that are nonetheless detailed enough to be comparable to solar cycle observations. After a brief overview of the dynamo problem and of key observational constraints, we begin by reviewing the various magnetic field regeneration mechanisms that have been proposed in the solar context. We move on to a presentation and critical discussion of extant solar cycle models based on these mechanisms. We then turn to the origin of fluctuations in these models, including amplitude and parity modulation, chaotic behavior, and intermittency. The paper concludes with a discussion of our current state of ignorance regarding various key questions, the most pressing perhaps being the identification of the physical mechanism(s) responsible for the generation of the Sun’s poloidal magnetic field component.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Flux Rope</kwd><kwd>Meridional Circulation</kwd><kwd>Dynamo

sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Scope of review</title><p>The cyclic regeneration of the Sun’s large-scale magnetic field is at the root of all phenomena collectively known as “solar activity”. A near-consensus now exists to the effect that this magnetic cycle is to be ascribed to the inductive action of fluid motions pervading the solar interior. However, at this writing nothing resembling consensus exists regarding the detailed nature and relative importance of various possible inductive flow contributions.</p><p>My assigned task, to review “dynamo models of the solar cycle”, is daunting. For my own survival — and that of the reader — I will interpret my task as narrowly as I can get away with. This review will not discuss in any detail solar magnetic field observations, the physics of magnetic flux tubes and ropes, the generation of small-scale magnetic field in the Sun’s near-surface layers, hydromagnetic oscillator models of the solar cycle, or magnetic field generation in stars other than the Sun. Most of these topics are all worthy of full-length reviews, and do have a lot to bear on “dynamo models of the solar cycle”, but a line needs to be drawn somewhere. I also chose to exclude from consideration the voluminous literature dealing with prediction of sunspot cycle amplitudes, including the related literature focusing exclusively on the mathematical modelling of the sunspot number time series, in manner largely or even sometimes entirely decoupled from the underlying physical mechanisms of magnetic field generation.</p><p>This review thus focuses on the cyclic regeneration of the large-scale solar magnetic field through the inductive action of fluid flows, as described by various approximations and simplifications of the partial differential equations of magnetohydrodynamics. Most current dynamo models of the solar cycle rely heavily on numerical solutions of these equations, and this computational emphasis is reflected throughout the following pages. Many of the mathematical and physical intricacies associated with the generation of magnetic fields in electrically conducting astrophysical fluids are well covered in a few recent reviews (see Hoyng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2003</xref>; Ossendrijver, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2003</xref>), and so will not be addressed in detail in what follows. The focus is on <italic>models</italic> of the solar cycle, i.e., constructs seeking primarily to describe the observed spatio-temporal variations of the Sun’s large-scale magnetic field.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>What is a “model”?</title><p>The review’s very title demands an explanation of what is to be understood by “model”. A model is a theoretical construct used as thinking aid in the study of some physical system too complex to be understood by direct inferences from observed data. A model is usually designed with some specific scientific questions in mind, and researchers asking different questions about a given physical system will come up in all legitimacy with distinct model designs. A well-designed model should be as complex as it needs to be to answer the questions having motivated its inception, but no more than that. Throwing everything into a model — usually in the name of “physical realism” — is likely to produce results as complicated as the data coming from the original physical system under study. Such model results are doubly damned, as they are usually as opaque as the original physical data, and, in addition, are not even real-world data<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref>!</p><p>The solar dynamo models discussed in this review all rely on severe simplifications of the set of equations known to govern the dynamics of the Sun’s turbulent, magnetized fluid interior. Yet most of them are <italic>bona fide</italic> models, as defined above. Since direct numerical simulations of the solar dynamo in the appropriate parameter regime are not forthcoming, the simplified models discussed in this review are likely to remain our primary interpretative tool for solar and stellar cycles in years to come.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>A brief historical survey</title><p>While regular observations of sunspots go back to the early seventeenth century, and discovery of the sunspot cycle to 1843, it is the landmark work of George Ellery Hale and collaborators that, in the opening decades of the twentieth century, demonstrated the magnetic nature of sunspots and of the solar activity cycle. In particular, Hale’s celebrated polarity laws established the existence of a well-organized toroidal magnetic flux system, residing somewhere in the solar interior, as the source of sunspots. In 1919, Larmor suggested the inductive action of fluid motions as one of a few possible explanations for the origin of this magnetic field, thus opening the path to contemporary solar cycle modelling. Larmor’s suggestion fitted nicely with Hale’s polarity laws, in that the inferred equatorial antisymmetry of the solar internal toroidal fields is precisely what one would expect from the shearing of a large-scale poloidal magnetic field by an axisymmetric and equatorially symmetric differential rotation pervading the solar interior. However, two decades later T.S. Cowling placed a major hurdle in Larmor’s path — so to speak — by demonstrating that even the most general purely axisymmetric flows could not, in themselves, sustain an axisymmetric magnetic field against Ohmic dissipation. This result became known as Cowling’s antidynamo theorem.</p><p>A way out of this quandary was only discovered in the mid-1950’s, when E.N. Parker pointed out that the Coriolis force could impart a systematic cyclonic twist to rising turbulent fluid elements in the solar convection, and in doing so provide the break of axisymmetry needed to circumvent Cowling’s theorem (see Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This groundbreaking idea was put on firm quantitative footing by the subsequent development of mean-field electrodynamics, which rapidly became the theory of choice for solar dynamo modelling. By the late 1970’s, concensus had almost emerged as to the fundamental nature of the solar dynamo, and the <italic>α</italic>-effect of mean-field electrodynamics was at the heart of it.

First, it was realized that because of buoyancy effects, magnetic fields strong enough to produce sunspots could not be stored in the solar convection zone for sufficient lengths of time to ensure adequate amplification. Second, numerical simulations of turbulent thermally-driven convection in a thick rotating spherical shell produced magnetic field migration patterns that looked nothing like what is observed on the Sun. Third, and perhaps most decisive, the nascent field of helioseismology succeeded in providing the first determinations of the solar internal differential rotation, which turned out markedly different from those needed to produce solar-like dynamo solutions in the context of mean-field electrodynamics. Fourth, the ability of the <italic>α</italic>-effect and magnetic diffusivity to operate as assumed in mean-field electrodynamics was also called into question by theoretical calculations and numerical simulations.</p><p>It is fair to say that solar dynamo modelling has not yet recovered from this four-way punch, in that nothing remotely resembling concensus currently exists as to the mode of operation of the solar dynamo. As with all major scientific crises, this situation provided impetus not only to drastically redesign existing models based on mean-field electrodynamics, but also to explore new physical mechanisms for magnetic field generation, and resuscitate older potential mechanisms that had fallen by the wayside in the wake of the <italic>α</italic>-effect — perhaps most notably the so-called Babcock-Leighton mechanism, dating back to the early 1960’s (see Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These post-helioseismic developments, beginning in the mid to late 1980’s, are the primary focus of this review.

In addition to the obvious cyclic pattern, two features of the diagram are particularly noteworthy:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Sunspots are restricted to latitudinal bands some ≃ 30° wide, symmetric about the equator.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Sunspots emerge closer and closer to the equator in the course of a cycle, peaking in coverage at about ±15° of latitude.</p></list-item></list>
Sunspots appear when deep-seated toroidal flux ropes rise through the convective envelope and emerge at the photosphere. Assuming that they rise radially and are formed where the magnetic field is the strongest, the sunspot butterfly diagram can be interpreted as a spatio-temporal “map” of the Sun’s internal, large-scale toroidal magnetic field component. This interpretation is not unique, however, since the aforementioned assumptions are questionable. In particular, we still lack even rudimentary understanding of the process through which the diffuse, large-scale solar magnetic field produces the concentrated toroidal flux ropes that will later give rise to sunspots upon buoyant destabilisation. This remains perhaps the most severe missing link between dynamo models and solar magnetic field observations. On the other hand, the stability and rise of toroidal flux ropes is now fairly well-understood (see, e.g., Fan, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2004</xref>, and references therein). In fact, from the point of view of solar cycle modelling this represents perhaps the most significant advance of the past two decades.

Note on Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> the poleward drift of the surface fields, away from sunspot latitudes. This pattern can be given two interpretations:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It reflects the existence of a mid-to-high-latitude dynamo “branch” that, somehow, fails to produce full-blown sunspots.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The surface fields originates from the transport of magnetic flux released by the decay of sunspots at low latitudes.</p></list-item></list>
Observational evidence currently favors the second of these possibilities (but do see Petrovay and Szakály, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">1999</xref>).

The concluding Section <xref rid="Sec65" ref-type="sec">6</xref> offers a somewhat more personal (i.e., even more biased!) discussion of current challenges and trends in solar dynamo modelling.</p><p>A great many review papers have been and continue to be written on dynamo models of the solar cycle, and the solar dynamo is discussed in most recent solar physics textbooks, notably Stix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2002</xref>) and Foukal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2004</xref>). The series of review articles published in Proctor and Gilbert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">1994</xref>) and Ferriz-Mas and Núñez (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2003</xref>) are also essential reading for more in-depth reviews of some of the topics covered here.

At the next level of “sophistication”, a solar dynamo model should also be able to exhibit amplitude fluctuations, and reproduce (at least qualitatively) the many empirical correlations found in the sunspot record. These include an anticorrelation between cycle duration and amplitude (Waldmeier Rule), alternance of higher-than-average and lower-than-average cycle amplitude (Gnevyshev-Ohl Rule), good phase locking, and occasional epochs of suppressed amplitude over many cycles (the so-called Grand Minima, of which the Maunder Minimum has become the archetype; more on this in Section <xref rid="Sec49" ref-type="sec">5</xref> below). One should finally add to the list torsional oscillations in the convective envelope, with proper amplitude and phasing with respect to the magnetic cycle.

Most solar dynamo modelling work has thus relied on simplification — usually drastic — of the MHD equations, as well as assumptions on the structure of the Sun’s magnetic field and internal flows.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Kinematic models</title><p>A first drastic simplification of the MHD system of equations consists in dropping Equation <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">(2)</xref> altogether by specifying a priori the form of the flow field <bold>u</bold>.

Given the low amplitude of observed torsional oscillations in the solar convective envelope, and the lack of significant cycle-related changes in the internal solar differential rotation inferred by helioseismology to this date, the kinematic approximation is perhaps not as bad a working assumption as one may have thought, at least for the differential rotation part of the mean flow <bold>u</bold>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Axisymmetric formulation</title><p>The sunspot butterfly diagram, Hale’s polarity law, synoptic magnetograms, and the shape of the solar corona at and around solar activity minimum jointly suggest that, to a tolerably good first approximation, the large-scale solar magnetic field is axisymmetric about the Sun’s rotation axis, as well as antisymmetric about the equatorial plane.

The production of a mean electromotive force proportional to the mean field is called the <italic>α</italic>-effect. Its existence was first demonstrated in the context of turbulent MHD, but it also arises in other contexts, as discussed immediately below. Although this is arguably a bit of a physical abuse, the term “<italic>α</italic>-effect” is used in what follows to denote any mechanism producing a mean poloidal field from a mean toroidal field, as is almost universally (and perhaps unfortunately) done in the contemporary solar dynamo literature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Hydrodynamical shear instabilities</title><p>The tachocline is the rotational shear layer uncovered by helioseismology immediately beneath the Sun’s convective envelope, providing smooth matching between that latitudinal differential rotation of the envelope, and the rigidly rotating radiative core (see, e.g., Spiegel and Zahn, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">1992</xref>; Brown <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1989</xref>; Tomczyk <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">1995</xref>; Charbonneau <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1999a</xref>, and references therein). While the latitudinal shear in the tachocline has been shown to be hydrodynamically stable with respect to Rayleigh-type 2D instabilities on a spherical shell (see, e.g., Charbonneau <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1999b</xref>, and references therein), further analysis allowing vertical displacement in the framework of shallow-water theory suggests that the latitudinal shear can become unstable when vertical fluid displacement is allowed (Dikpati and Gilman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2001</xref>). These authors also find that vertical fluid displacements correlate with the horizontal vorticity pattern in a manner resulting in a net kinetic helicity that can, in principle, impart a systematic twist to an ambient mean toroidal field. This can thus serve as a source for the poloidal component, and, in conjunction with rotational shearing of the poloidal field, lead to cyclic dynamo action. This is a self-excited <italic>T</italic> → <italic>P</italic> mechanism, but it is not entirely clear at this juncture if (and how) it would operate in the strong-field regime (more on this in Section <xref rid="Sec36" ref-type="sec">4.5</xref> below).

These stability studies have also revealed the existence of regions of weak instability, in the sense that the growth rates are numbered in years. The developing instability is then strongly influenced by the Coriolis force, and thus develops in the form of growing helical waves travelling along the flux rope’s axis. This amounts to twisting a toroidal field in meridional planes, as with the Parker scenario, with the important difference that what is now being twisted is a flux rope rather than an individual fieldline. Nonetheless, an azimuthal electromotive force is produced. This represents a viable <italic>T</italic> → <italic>P</italic> mechanism, but one that can only act above a certain field strength threshold; in other words, dynamos relying on this mechanism are not self-excited, since they require strong fields to operate.

Once again it is the Coriolis force that ends up imparting a net twist to the rising, arching structures that are produced in the course of the instability’s development (see Thelen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">2000a</xref>, and references therein). This results in a mean electromotive force that peaks where the magnetic field strength varies most rapidly with height.

This is basically an electromagnetic skin-depth effect; the cycle period is such that the poloidal field cannot diffuse as deep as the peak in radial shear in the course of a half cycle. The dynamo then runs on a weaker shear, thus yielding a smaller field strength ratio and weaker overall cycle (cf. Panels C and D of Figure <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>; on the energetics of interface dynamos; see also Ossendrijver and Hoyng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">1997</xref>)</p><p>Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">2003a</xref>) have presented results for a fully three-dimensional <italic>α</italic><sup>2</sup>Ω interface dynamo model where, however, dynamo solutions remain largely axisymmetric when a strong shear is present in the tachocline.

All of the uncertainties regarding the calculations of the <italic>α</italic>-effect and magnetic diffusivity carry over from <italic>α</italic>Ω to interface models, with diffusivity quenching becoming a particularly sensitive issue in the latter class of models (see, e.g., Tobias, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">1996a</xref>).</p><p>Interface dynamos suffer acutely from something that is sometimes termed “structural fragility”. Many gross aspects of the model’s dynamo behavior often end up depending sensitively on what one would normally hope to be minor details of the model’s formulation.

Once again the culprit is the latitudinal shear. Each of these minor variations on the same basic model has the effect that a parallel mid-latitude dynamo mode, powered by the latitudinal shear within the tachocline and envelope, interferes with and/or overpowers the interface mode. This interpretation is not inconsistent with the robustness claimed by Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">2003a</xref>), since these authors have chosen to omit the latitudinal shear throughout the convective envelope in their model. Because of this structural sensitivity, interface dynamo solutions also end up being annoyingly sensitive to choice of time-step size, spatial resolution, and other purely numerical details.

Like conventional <italic>α</italic>Ω models relying on meridional circulation to set the propagation direction of dynamo waves (see Section <xref rid="Sec35" ref-type="sec">4.4.2</xref>), the meridional flow must remain unaffected by the dynamo-generated magnetic field at least up to equipartition strength, a potentially serious difficulty also shared by the Babcock-Leighton models discussed in Section <xref rid="Sec44" ref-type="sec">4.8</xref> below.</p><p>The applicability of shallow-water theory to the solar tachocline notwithstanding, the primary weakness of these models, in their present form, is their reliance on a linear stability analysis that altogether ignores the destabilizing effect of magnetic fields. Gilman and Fox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">1997</xref>) have demonstrated that the presence of even a weak toroidal field in the tachocline can very efficiently destabilize a latitudinal shear profile that is otherwise hydrodynamically stable (see also Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">2003b</xref>). Relying on a purely hydrodynamical stability analysis is then hard to reconcile with a dynamo process producing strong toroidal field bands of alternating polarities migrating towards the equator in the course of the cycle, especially since latitudinally concentrated toroidal fields have been found to be unstable over a very wide range of toroidal field strengths (see Dikpati and Gilman, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1999</xref>). In the MHD version of the shear instability studied by P. Gilman and collaborators, the structure of the instability planforms is highly dependent on the assumed underlying toroidal field profile, so that the kinetic helicity can be expected to (i) have a time-dependent latitudinal distribution, and (ii) be intricately dependent on 〈<bold>B</bold>〉, in a manner that is unlikely to be reproduced by a simple amplitude-limiting quenching formula such as Equation <xref rid="Equ24" ref-type="disp-formula">(24)</xref>.

Their revival was motivated not only by the mounting difficulties with mean-field models alluded to earlier, but also by the fact that synoptic magnetographic monitoring over solar cycles 21 and 22 has offered strong evidence that the surface polar field reversals are indeed triggered by the decay of active regions (see Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">1989</xref>; Wang and Sheeley Jr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">1991</xref>, and references therein). The crucial question is whether this is a mere side-effect of dynamo action taking place independently somewhere in the solar interior, or a dominant contribution to the dynamo process itself.</p><p>The mode of operation of a generic solar cycle model based on the Babcock-Leighton mechanism is illustrated in cartoon form in Figure <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>. Let <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> represent the amplitude of the high-latitude, surface (“A”) poloidal magnetic field in the late phases of cycle <italic>n</italic>, i.e., after the polar field has reversed. The poloidal field <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> is advected downward by meridional circulation (A→B), where it then starts to be sheared by the differential rotation while being also advected equatorward (B→C). This leads to the growth of a new low-latitude (C) toroidal flux system <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub><sub>+1</sub>, which becomes buoyantly unstable (C→D) and starts producing sunspots (D) which subsequently decay and release the poloidal flux <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub><sub>+1</sub> associated with the new cycle <italic>n</italic> +1. Poleward advection and accumulation of this new flux at high latitudes (D→A) then obliterates the old poloidal flux <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>, and the above sequence of steps begins anew. Meridional circulation clearly plays a key role in this “conveyor belt” model of the solar cycle, by providing the needed link between the two spatially segregated source regions.

The implementation developed by Durney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">1995</xref>) is probably closest to the essence of the Babcock-Leighton mechanism (see also Durney <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1993</xref>; Durney, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">1997</xref>); whenever the deep-seated toroidal field exceeds some preset threshold, an axisymmetric “double ring” of vector potential is deposited in the surface layer, and left to spread latitudinally under the influence of magnetic diffusion.</p><p>In all cases the poloidal source term is concentrated in the outer convective envelope, and, in the language of mean-field electrodynamics, amounts to a positive <italic>α</italic>-effect, in that a positive dipole moment is being produced from a positive deep-seated mean toroidal field.

At any rate, Babcock-Leighton dynamo solutions often do tend to produce strong polar branches, a consequence of both the strong radial shear present in the high-latitude portion of the tachocline, and of the concentration of the poloidal field taking place in the high latitude-surface layer prior to this field being advected down into the tachocline by meridional circulation (viz.

While this difficulty can be fixed by increasing the magnetic diffusivity in the outermost layers, in the context of the Babcock-Leighton models this then leads to a much weaker poloidal field being transported down to the tachocline, which can be problematic from the dynamo point-of-view.

It is a peculiar fact that the last full-fledged attempts to do so go back some some twenty years, to the simulations of Gilman and Miller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">1981</xref>); Gilman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">1983</xref>); Glatzmaier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">1985a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">b</xref>), despite the remarkable advances in computational capabilities having taken place in the intervening years.</p><p>These epoch-making simulations did produce cyclic dynamo action and latitudinal migratory patterns suggestive of the dynamo waves of mean-field theory. However, the associated differential rotation profile turned out non-solar, as did the magnetic field’s spatio-temporal evolution. In retrospect this is perhaps not surprising, as limitations in computing resources forced the simulations to be carried out in a parameter regime far removed from solar interior conditions. Since then and until recently, efforts on the full-sphere simulation front have gone mostly into the purely hydrodynamical problem of reproducing the large-scale flows in the solar convective envelope, as inferred by helioseismology (see, e.g., Miesch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2005</xref>, and references therein). However, the recent numerical simulations of Brun <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2004</xref>) have reached a strongly turbulent regime, and have managed to produce a reasonably strong mean magnetic field, but without equatorward migration or polarity reversals. These authors suggest that these failings can be traced to the absence of a tachocline-like stable region of strong shear at the bottom of their simulation domain. If this is the case, then direct numerical simulation of the solar cycle will turn out to be even more demanding computationally than hitherto believed.</p><p>A number of attempts have also been made to reproduce some salient features of the solar cycle by carrying out high-resolution, local simulations in parameters regimes closer to solar-like (see, e.g., Nordlund <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">1992</xref>; Tobias <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">2001</xref>; Ossendrijver <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2002</xref>). One issue that has received much attention in the past decade is the interaction of a turbulent, convecting fluid (“convection zone”) with a shear flow concentrated in an underlying stably stratified “tachocline” region (see, e.g., Brummell <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2002</xref>). Such simulations have shown that magnetic fields can be pumped into the stable regions by convective downdrafts, and produce elongated structures reminiscent of magnetic flux tubes aligned with the flow. The recent simulations of Cline <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2003</xref>) are particularly interesting in this respect, as they have managed to produce sustained, reasonably regular cyclic activity with occasional polarity reversals for extended periods of simulation time. At first sight this may look superficially like an <italic>α</italic>Ω dynamo, but the turbulent flow has no net helicity since rotation is not included in the simulations; the poloidal field is not being regenerated by a mean-field-like turbulent <italic>α</italic>-effect, but rather by the interaction between buoyancy and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the shear layer.

The 11-year sunspot cycle is the most obvious feature of this time series, although the period of the underlying magnetic cycle is in fact twice that (sunspot counts being insensitive to magnetic polarity). Since sunspots are a surface manifestation of the toroidal magnetic flux system residing in the solar interior, cycle-to-cycle variations in sunspot counts are usually taken to indicate a corresponding variation in the amplitude of the Sun’s dynamo-generated internal magnetic field. As reasonable as this may sound, it remains a <italic>working assumption</italic>; at this writing, the process via which the dynamo-generated mean magnetic field produces sunspot-forming concentrated flux ropes is not understood.

We then turn to stochastic forcing (Section <xref rid="Sec58" ref-type="sec">5.5</xref>), which leads naturally to the issue of intermittency (Section <xref rid="Sec59" ref-type="sec">5.6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec51"><title>Fossil fields and the 22-yr cycle</title><p>The presence of a large-scale, quasi-steady magnetic field of fossil origin in the solar interior has long been recognized as a possible explanation of the Gnevyshev-Ohl rule (see Panel E of Figure <xref rid="Fig19" ref-type="fig">19</xref>). The basic idea is quite simple: The slowly-decaying, deep fossil field being effectively steady on solar cycle timescales, its superposition with the 11-yr polarity reversal of the overlying dynamogenerated field will lead to a 22-yr modulation, whereby the cycle is stronger when the fossil and dynamo field have the same polarity, and weaker when these polarities are opposite (see, e.g., Boyer and Levy, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1984</xref>; Boruta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1996</xref>). The magnitude of the effect is directly related to the strength of the fossil field, versus that of the dynamo-generated magnetic field. All of this, however, presumes that flows and dynamical effects within the tachocline still allow “coupling” between the deep fossil field below, and the cyclic dynamo-generated field above. It is far from obvious that this coupling could indeed take place in the simple manner implicitly assumed in dynamo models, that typically incorporate the effect of fossil fields via the lower boundary condition.</p><p>One strong prediction is associated with this explanation of the Gnevyshev-Ohl rule: While the pattern may become occasionally lost due to large amplitude fluctuations of other origin, whenever it is present even-numbered cycles should always be of lower amplitudes and odd-numbered cycles of higher amplitude (under Wolf’s cycle numbering convention). Evidently, this prediction can be tested observationally, provided one can establish a measure of sunspot cycle amplitude that is truly characteristic of the strength of the underlying dynamo magnetic field. Taken at face value, the analysis of Mursula <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2001</xref>), based on cycle-integrated group sunspot numbers, indicates that the odd/even pattern has reversed between the time periods 1700–1800 and 1850–1990 (see their Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This would then rule out the fossil field hypothesis unless, as argued by some authors (see Usoskin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">2001</xref>, and references therein), a sunspot cycle has been “lost” around 1790, at the onset of the so-called Dalton minimum.

This is a basic physical effect that should be included in any dynamo model. It is not at all trivial to do so, however, since in a turbulent environment both the fluctuating and mean components of the magnetic field can affect both the large-scale flow components, as well as the small-scale turbulent flow providing the Reynolds stresses powering the large-scale flows. One can thus distinguish a number of (related) amplitude-limiting mechanisms:

The <italic>α</italic>-quenching formulae introduced in Section <xref rid="Sec23" ref-type="sec">4.2.1</xref> is a particularly simple — some would say simplistic — way to model the backreaction of the magnetic field on the turbulent fluid motions producing the <italic>α</italic>-effect<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn11">11</xref>. In the context of solar cycle models, one could also expect the Lorentz force to reduce the amplitude of differential rotation until the <italic>effective</italic> dynamo number falls back to its critical value, at which point the dynamo again saturates<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn12">12</xref>. The third class of quenching mechanism listed above has not yet been investigated in detail, but numerical simulations of MHD turbulence indicate that the effects of the small-scale turbulent magnetic field on the <italic>α</italic>-effect can be profound (see Pouquet <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">1976</xref>; Durney <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1993</xref>).</p><p>Introducing magnetic backreaction on differential rotation is a tricky business, because one must then also, in principle, provide a model for the Reynolds stresses powering the large-scale flows in the solar convective envelope (see, e.g., Kitchatinov and Rüdiger, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">1993</xref>), as well as a procedure for computing magnetic backreaction on these. This rapidly leads into the unyielding realm of MHD turbulence, although algebraic “Λ-quenching” formulae akin to <italic>α</italic>-quenching have been proposed based on specific turbulence models (see, e.g., Kitchatinov <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">1994</xref>).

Two dimensionless parameters appear in Equation <xref rid="Equ37" ref-type="disp-formula">(37)</xref>. The first (Λ) is a numerical parameter measuring the influence of the Lorentz force, and which can be set to unity without loss of generality (cf. Tobias, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">1997</xref>; Phillips <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2002</xref>). The second, P<sub>m</sub> = <italic>ν</italic>/<italic>η</italic>, is the <italic>magnetic Prandtl number</italic>. It measures the relative importance of viscous and Ohmic dissipation. When P<sub>m</sub> ≪ 1, large velocity amplitudes in <bold>U</bold>′ can be produced by the dynamo-generated mean magnetic field. This effectively introduces an additional, long timescale in the model, associated with the evolution of the magnetically-driven flow; the smaller P<sub>m</sub>, the longer that timescale (cf. Figures <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref> in Brooke <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1998</xref>).</p><p>The majority of studies published thus far and using this approach have only considered the nonlinear magnetic backreaction on differential rotation. This has been shown to lead to a variety of behaviors, including amplitude and parity modulation, periodic or aperiodic, as well as intermittency (more on the latter in Section <xref rid="Sec59" ref-type="sec">5.6</xref>). Knobloch <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">1998</xref>) have argued that amplitude modulation in such models can be divided into two main classes. Type-I modulation corresponds to a nonlinear interaction between modes of different parity, with the Lorenz force-mediated flow variations controlling the transition from one mode to another. Type-II modulation refers to an exchange of energy between a single dynamo mode (of some fixed parity) with the flow field. This leads to quasiperiodic modulation of the basic cycle, with the modulation period controlled by the magnetic Prandtl number. Both types of modulation can co-exists in a given dynamo model, leading to a rich overall dynamical behavior.</p><p>Figure <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref> shows two butterfly diagrams produced by the nonlinear mean-field interface model of Tobias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">1997</xref>) (see also Beer <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1998</xref>). The model is defined on a Cartesian slab with a reference differential rotation varying only with depth, and includes backreaction on the differential rotation according to the procedure described above. The model exhibits strong, quasi-periodic modulation of the basic cycle, leading to epochs of strongly reduced amplitude. Note how the dynamo can emerge from such epochs with strong hemispheric asymmetries (top panel), or with a different parity (bottom panel).

The analysis of Knobloch <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">1998</xref>) suggests that generic behaviors do exist. On the other hand, a number of counterexamples have been published, showing that even in a qualitative sense, the nonlinear behavior can be strongly dependent on what one would have hoped to be minor modelling details (see, e.g., Moss and Brooke, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2000</xref>; Phillips <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2002</xref>).</p><p>The differential rotation can also be suppressed indirectly by magnetic backreaction on the <italic>small-scale</italic> turbulent flows that produce the Reynolds stresses driving the large-scale mean flow. Inclusion of this so-called “Λ-quenching” in mean-field dynamo models, alone or in conjunction with other amplitude-limiting nonlinearities, has also been shown to lead to a variety of periodic and aperiodic amplitude modulations, provided the magnetic Prandtl number is small (see Küker <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">1999</xref>; Pipin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">1999</xref>). This type of models stand or fall with the turbulence model they use to compute the various mean-field coefficients, and it is not yet clear which aspects of the results are truly generic to Λ-quenching.</p><p>To date, dynamical backreaction on large-scale flows has only been studied in dynamo models based on mean-field electrodynamics. Equivalent studies must be carried out in the other classes of solar cycle models discussed in Section <xref rid="Sec20" ref-type="sec">4</xref>. In particular, it is essential to estimate the effect of the Lorentz force on meridional circulation in models based on the Babcock-Leighton mechanism and/or hydrodynamical instabilities in the tachocline, since in these models the circulation is the primary determinant of the cycle period and enforces equatorward propagation in the butterfly diagram. Even though meridional circulation in the convective envelope is a “weak” flow, in the sense of being much slower than differential rotation, it arises from a small imbalance between forces that are in themselves quite large; the importance of magnetically-mediated backreaction on meridional circulation is likely to be a complex affair.</p></sec><sec id="Sec54"><title>Dynamical <italic>α</italic>-quenching</title><p>A number of authors have attempted to bypass the shortcomings of <italic>α</italic>-quenching by introducing into dynamo models an additional, physically-inspired partial differential equation for the <italic>α</italic>-coefficient itself (e.g., Kleeorin <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">1995</xref>; Blackman and Brandenburg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2002</xref>, and references therein). The basic physical idea is that magnetic helicity must be conserved in the high-Rm regime, so that production of helicity in the mean field implies a corresponding production of helicity of opposite sign at the scales of the fluctuating components of the flow and field, which ends up acting in such a way as to reduce the <italic>α</italic>-effect. Most investigations published to date have made used of severely truncated models, and/or models in one spatial dimensions (see, e.g., Weiss <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">1984</xref>; Schmalz and Stix, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">1991</xref>; Jenning and Weiss, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">1991</xref>; Roald and Thomas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">1997</xref>; Covas <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1997</xref>; Blackman and Brandenburg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2002</xref>), so that the model results can only be compared to solar data in some general qualitative sense.

These authors found, perhaps not surprisingly, both quantitative and qualitative differences between solutions computed using dynamical rather than algebraic <italic>α</italic>-quenching, with the nonlinear behavior in the former case depending sensitively on model parameters, so it is not clear which class of models can be considered “more realistic”.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec55"><title>Time-delay dynamics</title><p>The introduction of <italic>ad hoc</italic> time-delays in dynamo models is long known to lead to pronounced cycle amplitude fluctuations (see, e.g., Yoshimura, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">1978</xref>). Models including nonlinear backreaction on differential rotation can also exhibit what essentially amounts to time-delay dynamics in the low Prandtl number regime, with the large-scale flow perturbations lagging behind the Lorentz force because of inertial effects. Finally, time-delay effects can arise in dynamo models where the source regions for the poloidal and toroidal magnetic components are spatially segregated. This is a type of time delay we now turn to, in the context of dynamo models based on the Babcock-Leighton mechanism.</p><sec id="Sec56"><title>Time-delays in Babcock-Leighton models</title><p>It was already noted that in solar cycle models based on the Babcock-Leighton mechanism of poloidal field generation, meridional circulation effectively sets — and even regulates — the cycle period (cf.

In doing so, it also introduces a long time delay in the dynamo mechanism, “long” in the sense of being comparable to the cycle period. This delay originates with the time required for circulation to advect the surface poloidal field down to the core-envelope interface, where the toroidal component is produced (A→C in Figure <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>). In contrast, the production of poloidal field from the deep-seated toroidal field (C→D), is a “fast” process, growth rates and buoyant rise times for sunspot-forming toroidal flux ropes being of the order of a few months (see Moreno-Insertis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">1986</xref>; Fan <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">1993</xref>; Caligari <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1995</xref>, and references therein).

Ample observational evidence now exists that a substantial portion of the Sun’s surface magnetic flux is continuously being reprocessed on a timescale commensurate with convective motions (see Schrijver <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">1997</xref>; Hagenaar <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2003</xref>). The culprit is most likely the generation of small-scale magnetic fields by these turbulent fluid motions (see, e.g., Cattaneo, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1999</xref>; Cattaneo <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2003</xref>, and references therein). This amounts to a form of zero-mean “noise” superimposed on the slowly-evolving mean magnetic field. These mechanisms can be thought of as <italic>physical noise</italic>. In addition, the azimuthal averaging implicit in all models of the solar cycle considered above will yield dynamo coefficients showing significant deviations about their mean values, as a consequence of the spatio-temporally discrete nature of the physical events (e.g., cyclonic updrafts, sunspot emergences, flux rope destabilizations, etc.) whose collective effects add up to produce a mean electromotive force. Such time-dependent, statistical deviations about the mean can be dubbed <italic>statistical noise</italic>.</p><p>Physical noise is most readily incorporated into dynamo models by introducing, on the right hand side of the governing equations, an additional zero-mean source term that varies randomly from node to node and from one time step to the next. Statistical noise can be modeled in a number of ways. Perhaps the most straightforward is to let the dynamo number fluctuate randomly in time about some pre-set mean value. By most statistical estimates, the expected magnitude of these fluctuations is quite large, i.e., many times the mean value (Hoyng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">1993</xref>). This conclusion is also supported by numerical simulations (see, e.g., Otmianowska-Mazur <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">1997</xref>; Ossendrijver <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2001</xref>). One typically also introduces a <italic>coherence time</italic> during which the dynamo number retains a fixed value. At the end of this time interval, this value is randomly readjusted. Depending on the dynamo model at hand, the coherence time can be related to the lifetime of convective eddies (<italic>α</italic>-effect-based mean-field models), to the decay time of sunspots (Babcock-Leighton models), or to the growth rate of instabilities (hydrodynamical shear or buoyant MHD instability-based models). Perhaps not surprisingly, the level of cycle amplitude fluctuations is found to increase with both increasing noise amplitude and longer coherence time (Choudhuri, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1992</xref>).</p><p>Figure <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">22</xref> shows some representative results for three <italic>α</italic>Ω dynamo solutions with fluctuation in the dynamo number <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>α</italic></sub> ranging from ±50% (blue) to ±200% (red). While the correlation time amounts here to only 5% of the half-cycle period, note in Panel A of Figure <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">22</xref> how modulations on much longer timescales appear in the magnetic energy time series. As can be seen in Panel B of Figure <xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">22</xref>, the fluctuations also lead to a spread in the cycle period, although here little (anti)correlation is seen with the cycle’s amplitude. Both the mean cycle period and amplitude increase with increasing fluctuation amplitude.

A particularly interesting consequence of random variations of the dynamo number, in mean-field models at or very close to criticality, is the coupling of the cycle’s duration and amplitude (Hoyng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">1993</xref>; Ossendrijver and Hoyng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">1996</xref>; Ossendrijver <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">1996</xref>), leading to a pronounced anticorrelation between these two quantities that is reminiscent of the Waldmeier Rule (cf.

However, this behavior does not carry over to the supercritical regime, so it is not clear whether this can indeed be accepted as a robust explanation of the observed amplitude-duration anticorrelation. In the supercritical regime, <italic>α</italic>-quenched mean-field models are less sensitive to noise (Choudhuri, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1992</xref>), unless of course they happen to operate close to a bifurcation point, in which case large amplitude and/or parity fluctuations can be produced (see, e.g., Moss <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">1992</xref>).</p><p>In the context of Babcock-Leighton models, Charbonneau and Dikpati (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2000</xref>) have presented a series of dynamo simulations including fluctuations in the dynamo number (statistical noise) as well as fluctuations in the meridional circulation (a form of noise both physical and statistical). Working in the supercritical regime with a form of algebraic <italic>α</italic>-quenching as the sole amplitude-limiting nonlinearity, they find the model solutions to be quite robust with respect to the introduction of noise, and succeed in producing a solar-like weak anticorrelation between cycle amplitude and duration for fluctuations in the dynamo numbers in excess of 200% of its mean value, with coherence time of one month. They also find that the solutions exhibit good phase locking, in that shorter-than-average cycles tend to be followed by longer-than-averaged cycles, a property they trace to the regulatory effects of meridional circulation, the primary determinant of the cycle period in these models (cf.

Intermittency thus requires at least two distinct dynamical states available to the system, and a means of transiting from one to the other.</p><p>In the context of solar cycle model, intermittency refers to the existence of quiescent epochs of strongly suppressed activity randomly interspersed within periods of “normal” cyclic activity. Observationally, the Maunder Minimum is usually taken as the exemplar for such quiescent epochs. It should be noted, however, that dearth of sunspots does not necessarily mean a halted cycle; as noted earlier, flux ropes of strengths inferior to ∼ 10 kG will not survive their rise through the convective envelope, and the process of flux rope formation from the dynamo-generated mean magnetic field may itself be subjected to a threshold in field strength. The same basic magnetic cycle may well have continued unabated all the way through the Maunder Minimum, but at an amplitude just below one of these thresholds. This idea finds support in the <sup>10</sup>Be radioisotope record, which shows a clear and uninterrupted cyclic signal through the Maunder Minimum (see Panels B and C of Figure <xref rid="Fig19" ref-type="fig">19</xref>; also Beer <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1998</xref>). Strictly speaking, thresholding a variable controlled by a single dynamical state subject to amplitude modulation is <italic>not</italic> intermittency, although the resulting time series for the variable may well look quite intermittent.</p><p>Ossendrijver and Covas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2003</xref>) list 21 papers reporting empirical observation of intermittency-like behavior in one or another dynamo model, a bibliographical list that would not be particularly useful to replicate here. Research is also underway to categorize the observed behavior in terms of the various types of intermittency known to characterize dynamical systems (see, e.g., Covas and Tavakol, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1999</xref>; Brooke <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2002</xref>; Ossendrijver and Covas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2003</xref>). In what follows, we attempt to pin down the physical origin of intermittent behavior in the various types of solar cycle models discussed earlier.</p></sec><sec id="Sec61"><title>Intermittency from stochastic noise</title><p>Intermittency has been shown to occur through stochastic fluctuations of the dynamo number in mean-field dynamo models operating at criticality (see, e.g., Hoyng, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">1993</xref>). Such models also exhibit a solar-like anticorrelation between cycle amplitude and phase. This mechanism for “on-off intermittency” is not as gratuitous a procedure as it may first appear. As argued in Section <xref rid="Sec58" ref-type="sec">5.5</xref>, important stochastic fluctuations are indeed likely in the turbulent environment in which the solar dynamo operates. However there is no strong reason to believe that the solar dynamo is running just at criticality, so that it is not clear how good an explanation this is of Maunder-type Grand Minima.</p><p>Mininni and Gómez (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2004</xref>) have presented a stochastically-forced 1D (in latitude) <italic>α</italic>Ω mean-field model, including algebraic <italic>α</italic>-quenching as the amplitude-limiting nonlinearity, that exhibits a form of intermittency arising from the interaction of dynamo modes of opposite parity. The solution aperiodically produces episodes of markedly reduced cycle amplitude, and often showing strong hemispheric asymmetry. This superficially resembles the behavior associated with the type I amplitude nonlinear modulation discussed in Section <xref rid="Sec53" ref-type="sec">5.3.1</xref> (compare the top panel in Figure <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref> herein to Figure <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref> in Mininni and Gómez (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2004</xref>)). However, here it is the stochastic forcing that occasionally excites the higher-order modes that perturb the normal operation of the otherwise dominant dynamo mode.</p></sec><sec id="Sec62"><title>Intermittency from nonlinearities</title><p>Another way to trigger intermittency in a dynamo model is to let nonlinear dynamical effects, for example a reduction of the differential rotation amplitude, push the effective dynamo number below its critical value; dynamo action then ceases during the subsequent time interval needed to reestablish differential rotation following the diffusive decay of the magnetic field; in the low P<sub>m</sub> regime, this time interval can amount to many cycle periods, but P<sub>m</sub> must not be too small, otherwise Grand Minima become too rare (see, e.g., Küker <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">1999</xref>). Values P<sub>m</sub> ∼ 10<sup>−2</sup> seem to work best. Such intermittency is most readily produced when the dynamo is operating close to criticality. For representative models exhibiting intermittency of this type, see Tobias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">1996b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">1997</xref>); Brooke <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1998</xref>); Küker <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">1999</xref>); Brooke <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2002</xref>).</p><p>Intermittency of this nature has some attractive properties as a Maunder Minimum scenario. First, the strong hemispheric asymmetry in sunspots distributions in the final decades of the Maunder Minimum (Ribes and Nesme-Ribes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">1993</xref>) can occur naturally via parity modulation (see Figure <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref> herein). Second, because the same cycle is operating at all times, cyclic activity in indicators other than sunspots (such as radioisotopes, see Beer <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1998</xref>) is easier to explain; the dynamo is still operating and the solar magnetic field is still undergoing polarity reversal, but simply fails to reach the amplitude threshold above which the sunspot-forming flux ropes can be generated from the mean magnetic field, or survive their buoyant rise through the envelope.</p><p>There are also important difficulties with this explanatory scheme. Grand Minima tend to have similar durations and recur in periodic or quasi-periodic fashion, while the sunspot and radioisotope records, taken at face value, suggest a pattern far more irregular. Moreover, the dynamo solutions in the small P<sub>m</sub> regime are characterized by large, non-solar angular velocity fluctuations. In such models, solar-like, low-amplitude torsional oscillations do occur, but for P<sub>m</sub> ∼ 1. Unfortunately, in this regime the solutions then lack the separation of timescales needed for Maunder-like Grand Minima episodes. One is stuck here with two conflicting requirements, neither of which easily evaded.</p><p>Intermittency has also been observed in strongly supercritical model including <italic>α</italic>-quenching as the sole amplitude-limiting nonlinearity. Such solutions can enter Grand Minima-like epochs of reduced activity when the dynamo-generated magnetic field completely quenches the <italic>α</italic>-effect. The dynamo cycle restarts when the magnetic field resistively decays back to the level where the <italic>α</italic>-effect becomes operational once again. The physical origin of the “long” timescale governing the length of the “typical” time interval between successive Grand Minima episodes is unclear, and the physical underpinning of intermittency harder to identify. For representative models exhibiting intermittency of this type, see Tworkowski <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec63"><title>Intermittency from threshold effects</title><p>Intermittency can also arise naturally in dynamo models characterized by a lower operating threshold on the magnetic field. These include models where the regeneration of the poloidal field takes place via the MHD instability of toroidal flux tubes (Sections <xref rid="Sec41" ref-type="sec">4.7</xref> and <xref rid="Sec18" ref-type="sec">3.2.3</xref>). In such models, the transition from quiescent to active phases requires an external mechanism to push the field strength back above threshold. This can be stochastic noise (see, e.g., Schmitt <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">1996</xref>), or a secondary dynamo process normally overpowered by the “primary” dynamo during active phases (see Ossendrijver, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2000a</xref>). Figure <xref rid="Fig23" ref-type="fig">23</xref> shows one representative solution of the latter variety, where intermittency is driven by a weak <italic>α</italic>-effect-based kinematic dynamo operating in the convective envelope, in conjunction with magnetic flux injection into the underlying region of primary dynamo action by randomly positioned downflows (see Ossendrijver, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2000a</xref>, for further details).

As discussed at some length in Section <xref rid="Sec20" ref-type="sec">4</xref>, current models relying on distinct mechanisms all have their strengths and weaknesses, in terms of physical underpinning as well as comparison with observations.</p><p>Modelling of the evolution of the Sun’s surface magnetic flux has abundantly confirmed that the Babcock-Leighton mechanism is operating on the Sun, in the sense that magnetic flux liberated by the decay of tilted bipolar active regions does accumulate in the polar regions, where it triggers polarity reversal of the poloidal component (see Wang and Sheeley Jr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">1991</xref>; Schrijver <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">2002</xref>; Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">2002</xref>; Baumann <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>, and references therein). The key question is whether this is an active component of the dynamo cycle, or a mere side-effect of active region decay. Likewise, the buoyant instability of magnetic flux tubes (Section <xref rid="Sec41" ref-type="sec">4.7</xref>) is, in some sense, unavoidable; here again the question is whether or not the associated azimuthal mean electromotive force contributes significantly to dynamo action in the Sun.</p><p>Petrovay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2000</xref>) makes an interesting proposal, namely that one would be better off to categorize dynamo models according to the following two criteria: (i) whether or not the source regions for the poloidal and toroidal components are spatially coincident, and (ii) whether the sunspot butterfly diagram is to be understood in terms of the Parker-Yoshimura sign rule, or to advection by meridional circulation. All dynamo models described above fall into one of four possible categories (see Table 1 in Petrovay, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2000</xref>, and accompanying discussion). The challenge is then to devise observational criteria allowing to meaningfully distinguish between these four possible classes.</p><p>A noteworthy contribution along these lines is the recent work of Hathaway <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2003</xref>), who have shown that the duration of individual sunspot cycles is inversely correlated with the slope of the dynamo wave in the butterfly diagram. The latter, in models relying on advection by meridional circulation, is itself expected to be set by the equatorward meridional flow speed at the core-envelope interface, which can be related to the <italic>observable</italic> surface meridional flow speed via the mass conservation constraint; although uncertainties remain at that level, the analysis of Hathaway <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2003</xref>) supports the idea that the cycle period is indeed set by the meridional flow speed (but do see Schmitt and Schüssler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2004</xref>, for an opposing viewpoint). This kind of work must be pursued.</p></sec><sec id="Sec67"><title>What limits the amplitude of the solar magnetic field?</title><p>The amplitude of the dynamo-generated magnetic field is almost certainly restricted by the back-reaction of Lorentz forces on the driving fluid motions. However, as outlined in Section <xref rid="Sec53" ref-type="sec">5.3.1</xref>, this backreaction can occur in many ways.</p><p>Helioseismology has revealed only small variations of the differential rotation profile in the course of the solar cycle. The observed variations amount primarily to an extension in depth of the pattern of low-amplitude torsional oscillations long known from surface Doppler measurements (but see also Basu and Antia, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2001</xref>; Toomre <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">2003</xref>). Taken at face value, these results suggest that quenching of differential rotation is not the primary amplitude-limiting mechanism, unless the dynamo is operating very close to criticality. Once again the hope is that in the not-too-distant future, helioseismology will have mapped accurately enough cycle-induced variations of differential rotation in the convective envelope and tachocline, to settle this issue. It is also worth noting that mechanisms for generating torsional oscillations that are not directly relying on the Lorentz force are also possible (see Spruit, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2003</xref>).</p><p>Algebraic quenching of the <italic>α</italic>-effect (or <italic>α</italic>-effect-like source terms) is the mechanism most often incorporated in dynamo models. However, this state of affairs usually has much more to do with computational convenience than commitment to a specific physical quenching mechanism. There is little doubt that the <italic>α</italic>-effect will be affected once the mean magnetic field reaches equipartition; the critical question is whether it becomes quenched long before that, for example by the small-scale component of the magnetic field. The issue hinges on helicity conservation and subtleties of flow-field interaction in MHD turbulence, and remains open at this writing. For recent entry points into this very active area of current research, see Cattaneo and Hughes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1996</xref>); Blackman and Field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2000</xref>); Brandenburg and Dobler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2001</xref>).</p><p>Magnetic fields are buoyantly unstable in the convective envelope, and so will rise to the surface on time scales much shorter than the cycle period (see, e.g., Parker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">1975</xref>; Schüssler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">1977</xref>; Moreno-Insertis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">1986</xref>). This is in fact the primary reason why most contemporary dynamo models of the solar cycle rely on the velocity shear in the tachocline to achieve toroidal field amplification. If the dynamo were to reside entirely in the convective envelope, then this would be an important, perhaps even dominant, amplitude limiting mechanism (see Schmitt and Schüssler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">1989</xref>; Moss <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">1990</xref>). If, on the other hand, toroidal field amplification takes place primarily at or beneath the core-envelope interface, then it is less clear whether or not this mechanism plays a dominant role, but this remains to be confirmed by detailed calculations.</p><p>A related question is whether the destabilization, rise and surface emergence of sunspot-forming toroidal flux ropes amounts to magnetic flux loss; the answer depends on the fate of the emerged portion of the flux ropes, namely if and how it disconnects from the deep-seated magnetic flux system. Because some stretching can also take place in the course of the buoyant rise across the convective envelope, it may even be that rising flux ropes <italic>amplify</italic> the deep-seated magnetic field, as nicely demonstrated by the numerical calculations of Rempel and Schüssler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2001</xref>). Estimates of the total magnetic flux emerging at the surface of the Sun in the course of a solar cycle also amount to a small fraction of the amount of magnetic flux produced in the tachocline, for most current solar dynamo models. This suggests that flux loss due to buoyant rise of toroidal flux ropes is not the dominant amplitude-limiting mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec68"><title>Flux tubes versus diffuse fields</title><p>The foregoing discussion has implicitly assumed that the dynamo process produces a mean, large-scale magnetic field that then concentrates itself into the flux ropes that subsequently give rise to sunspots. High-resolution observations of the photospheric magnetic field show that even outside of sunspots, the field is concentrated in flux tubes (see, e.g., Parker, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">1982</xref>, and references therein), presumably as a consequence of convective collapse of magnetic flux concentrations too weak to block convection and form sunspots. In this picture, which is basically the framework of all dynamo models discussed above, the mean magnetic field is the dominant player in the cycle.</p><p>An alternate viewpoint is to assume that the solar magnetic field is a fibril state from beginning to end, throughout the convection zone and tachocline, and that whatever large-scale field there may be in the photosphere is a mere by-product of the decay of sunspots and other flux tube-like small-scale magnetic structures. The challenge is then to devise a dynamo process that operates entirely on flux tubes, rather than on a diffuse mean field. Some exploratory calculations have been made (e.g., DeLuca <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1993</xref>), but this intriguing question has received far less attention than it deserves.</p></sec><sec id="Sec69"><title>How constraining is the sunspot butterfly diagram?</title><p>The shape of the sunspot butterfly diagram (see Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) continues to play a dominant constraining role in many dynamo models of the solar cycle. Yet caution is in order on this front. Calculations of the stability of toroidal flux ropes stored in the overshoot region immediately beneath the core-envelope interface indicate that instability is much harder to produce at high latitudes, primarily because of the stabilizing effect of the magnetic tension force; thus strong fields at high latitudes may well be there, but not produce sunspots. Likewise, the process of flux rope formation from the dynamo-generated mean magnetic field is currently not understood. Are flux ropes forming preferentially in regions of most intense magnetic fields, in regions of strongest magnetic helicity, or in regions of strongest hydrodynamical shear? Is a stronger diffuse toroidal field forming more strongly magnetized flux ropes, or a larger number of flux ropes always of the same strength?</p><p>These are all profound questions from the point of view of comparing results from dynamo models to sunspot data. Until they have been answered, uncertainty remains as to the degree to which the sunspot butterfly diagram can be compared in all details to time-latitude diagrams of the toroidal field at the core-envelope interface, as produced by this or that dynamo model.</p></sec><sec id="Sec70"><title>Is meridional circulation crucial?</title><p>The main question regarding meridional circulation is not whether it is there or not, but rather what role it plays in the solar cycle. The answer hinges on the value of the turbulent diffusivity nT, which is notoriously difficult to estimate with confidence. It is probably essential in dynamo models characterized by positive <italic>α</italic>-effects in the Northern hemisphere, in order to ensure equator-ward transport of the sunspot-forming, deep-seated toroidal magnetic field (see Sections <xref rid="Sec33" ref-type="sec">4.4</xref>, <xref rid="Sec36" ref-type="sec">4.5</xref>, and <xref rid="Sec41" ref-type="sec">4.7</xref>). It also appears to be a major determinant in the evolution of the large-scale surface magnetic field in the course of the solar cycle. Something like it is certainly needed in dynamo models based on the Babcock-Leighton mechanism, to carry the poloidal field generated at the surface down to the tachocline, where production of the toroidal field is taking place (see Section <xref rid="Sec44" ref-type="sec">4.8</xref>). In the context of Babcock-Leighton models, meridional circulation has also been shown to act as a clock regulating the pace of the solar cycle (Charbonneau and Dikpati, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2000</xref>), and favoring phase persistence across intermittent, quiescent epochs of suppressed activity (Charbonneau <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2004</xref>), in qualitative agreement with inferences from cosmogenic radioisotopes studies.</p><p>The primary unknown at this writing is the degree to which meridional circulation is affected by the Lorentz force associated with the dynamo-generated magnetic field. Recent calculations by M. Rempel and collaborators (Rempel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2004</xref>) suggest that the backreaction is limited to regions of strongest toroidal fields, so that the “conveyor belt” is still operating in the bulk of the convective envelope. Such calculations must be vigorously pursued.</p><p>Another pressing matter is to establish the form and speed of the equatorward return flow in the lower convective envelope, and to determine how much — if any — penetration takes place in the radiative layers below. While Nandy and Choudhuri (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2002</xref>) have argued that deep penetration (i.e., down to <italic>r</italic>/R<sub>⊙</sub> ≃ 0.6) is essential for a proper butterfly diagram to be produced, the boundary layer analysis of Gilman and Miesch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2004</xref>) indicates no significant penetration below the base of the convective envelope. This is an issue where the final word will likely come from helioseismology, hopefully in the not too distant future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec71"><title>Is the mean solar magnetic field really axisymmetric?</title><p>While the large-scale solar magnetic field is axisymmetric about the Sun’s rotation axis to a good first approximation, various lines of observational evidence point to a persistent, low-level non-axisymmetric component; such evidence includes the so-called active longitudes (see Henney and Harvey, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2002</xref>, and references therein), rotationally-based periodicity in cycle-related eruptive phenomena (Bai, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1987</xref>), and the shape of the white-light corona in the descending phase of the cycle.</p><p>Various mean-field-based dynamo models are known to support non-axisymmetric modes over a substantial portion of their parameter space (see, e.g., Moss, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">1999</xref>; Bigazzi and Ruzmaikin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2004</xref>, and references therein). At high Rm, strong differential rotation (in the sense that <italic>C</italic><sub>Ω</sub> ≫ <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>α</italic></sub>) is known to favor axisymmetric modes, because it efficiently destroys any non-axisymmetric component on a timescale much faster than diffusive (∝ Rm<sup>1/3</sup> at high Rm, instead of ∝ Rm). Although it is not entirely clear that the Sun’s differential rotation is strong enough to place it in this regime (see, e.g., Rüdiger and Elstner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">1994</xref>), some 3D models do show this symmetrizing effect of differential rotation (see, e.g., Zhang <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">2003a</xref>).</p><p>While all poloidal field regeneration mechanisms considered above must rely on some break of axisymmetry to circumvent Cowling’s theorem, some are of a fundamentally non-axisymmetric nature even at the largest scales. This is the case with the <italic>α</italic>-effect based on both the buoyant instability of toroidal magnetic flux tubes (see Section <xref rid="Sec41" ref-type="sec">4.7</xref>), and on the hydrodynamical shear instability in the tachocline (see Section <xref rid="Sec36" ref-type="sec">4.5</xref>). In either cases stability analyses indicate that the most readily excited modes have low azimuthal wave numbers (<italic>m</italic> = 1 or <italic>m</italic> = 2). This is subsumed in an axisymmetric dynamo model upon invoking azimuthal averaging, which amounts to assuming that successive destabilization events are uncorrelated in longitude; if they are, however, then the corresponding <italic>α</italic>-effect should be itself longitude-dependent, which is known to favor the excitation of non-axisymmetric dynamo modes (see, e.g., Moss <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">1991</xref>). This avenue should definitely be explored.</p></sec><sec id="Sec72"><title>What causes Maunder-type Grand Minima?</title><p>The origin of Grand Minima in solar activity is also a question subjected to intense scrutiny. Broadly speaking, Grand Minima can occur either through amplitude modulation of a basic underlying dynamo cycle, or through intermittency. In this latter case, the transition from one state to another can take place via the system’s internal dynamics, or through the influence of external stochastic noise, or both. Not surprisingly, a large number of plausible Grand Minima models can now be found in the extant literature (cf. Section <xref rid="Sec59" ref-type="sec">5.6</xref>).</p><p>Historical researches have shown that the Sun climbed out of the Maunder Minimum gradually, and showing strongly asymmetric activity, with nearly all sunspots observed between 1670 and 1715 located in the Southern solar hemisphere (see Ribes and Nesme-Ribes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">1993</xref>). This is the kind of pattern that is readily produced by nonlinear modulation of two dynamo modes of comparable period but opposite parity (cf. Figure <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref> herein; see also Beer <italic>et al.</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1998</xref>; Sokoloff and Nesme-Ribes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">1994</xref>). Then again, in the context of an intermittency-based model, it is quite conceivable that one hemisphere can pull out of a quiescent epoch before the other, thus yielding sunspot distributions compatible with the aforecited observations in the late Maunder Minimum. Such scenarios, relying on cross-hemispheric coupling, have hardly begun to be explored.</p><p>Another possible avenue for distinguishing between these various scenarios is the persistence of the primary cycle’s phase through Grand Minima. Generally speaking, models relying on amplitude modulation can be expected to exhibit good phase persistence across such minima, because the same basic cycle is operating at all times (cf. Figure <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref>). Intermittency, on the other hand, should not necessarily lead to phase persistence, since the active and quiescent phases are governed by distinct dynamics. One noteworthy exception to these expectations is the intermittent Babcock-Leighton solution presented in Charbonneau <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2004</xref>), where the cycle’s phase can be sustained across Grand Minima, through the regulating influence of meridional circulation. One can but hope that careful analysis of cosmogenic radioisotope data may soon indicate the degree to which the solar cycle’s phase persisted through the Maunder, Spöorer, and Wolf Grand Minima, in order to narrow down the range of possibilities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec73"><title>Resources</title><p><bold>Resource 1</bold>: Four animations corresponding to the solutions whose butterfly diagrams are plotted on the four panels of Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://solarphysics.livingreviews.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://solarphysics.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2005-2/resources/index.html#aosolns</ext-link></p><p><bold>Resource 2</bold>: Four animations corresponding to some of the solutions whose characteristics are presented on Fig. <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref>, namely those with a core-to-envelope diffusivity ratio of 0.1, 0.01, 0.001 and 0.0001.</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://solarphysics.livingreviews.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://solarphysics.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2005-2/resources/index.html#intrf</ext-link></p><p><bold>Resource 3</bold>: Animations corresponding to the solutions whose butterfly diagrams are plotted on the nine panels of Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref> (animations are not provided for the decaying and steady solutions).</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://solarphysics.livingreviews.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://solarphysics.livingreviews.org/lrsp-2005-2/resources/index.html#aocmsolns</ext-link></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>I wish to thank Juürg Beer, John Brooke, Mausumi Dikpati, Antonio Ferriz-Mas, David Hathaway, Mathieu Ossendrijver, and Steve Tobias for providing data and/or graphical material for inclusion in this review; also Peter Gilman, Arnab Choudhuri, and Matthias Rempel for providing preprints in advance of publication.
