The basic concept consists the integration of the GOC as a flat absorber on the top of a low iron glass or aluminium-based substrate (5 × 5 cm<sup>2</sup>) connecting through a phase change material channel in contact with direct sun exposure. The function of GOC as an outdoor cover of the prototype chamber is to maintain the high indoor temperature while the outdoor temperature is low. Using the GOC, it has been observed that the indoor temperature (at the substrate) of the prototype chamber always remains higher as compared to the outdoor temperature (at the GOC) as measured under 1 SUN 1.5 AM condition. The temperature difference between outdoor and indoor exterior surface significantly increases during the light exposure time, whereas the difference drastically approaches to zero during the cooling period. The variation of different crucial environmental factors such as high temperature, moisture, flexibility and water resistivity has been investigated on the developed GOCs to understand the stability of the coating further.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Nature Research</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>15575</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2020</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>9</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2020_Article_72670.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Currently, the building consumes excessive energy due to heating and cooling load demand<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Temperature swing into a building interior is the root cause of the discomfort. Traditionally using sensible heat storage-based building envelope as thermal mass or inertia, this temperature fluctuation was reduced, which is not efficient. The latent heat storage medium is superior to sensible as it can delay the rise and fall of building interior temperature. The latent heat storage medium has 5–14 times more heat storage ability than the sensible heat storage medium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Building in northern latitude climate (colder climate) requires the heating load to maintain the comfortable interior temperature. The phase change material (PCM) based latent heat storage can releases the stored heat after sunset, which can reduce the daily temperature swing. Up to 10° to 20° C of temperature swing, swing reduction is possible by using this technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The PCM operation is restricted mainly due to its low thermal conductivity and leakage issue during phase transition. The heat transfer rate has been suppressed due to the low thermal conductivity of PCM<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. At the same time, during the phase transition stage, the leakage of PCM affects the system, which limits its further use. However, this low thermal conductivity of PCM, which can be improved by using nanoparticle incorporation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. In this regard, high conductive nanoparticle dispersion could be a better alternative solution of PCM to enhance its thermal conductivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Though, factors such as surface-functionalization, surface area, shape and size of nanoparticle are also controlled the efficacy of the PCM operation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. However, nanoparticle addition does not affect the water-resistant property of PCM.</p><p id="Par3">Further, the preparation and fabrication process of nanoparticle incorporation in PCM becomes quite inflexible for its on-site application too. Placement of reflecting and absorbing coating plays a crucial role in building interior comfort. While for summer climate reflecting coating at the exterior building wall reduce the solar transmission reflecting coating at the building interior is suitable for the colder climate where the long wavelength radiation inside the building get reflected from the wall and stay stored inside a building. Solar absorbing coating at the external wall of the building allows more heat to penetrate inside a building which offers comfort temperature and suitable for colder climate building<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The solar absorbing coating can utilize solar thermal energy appropriately<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. In recent years, considerable efforts have been executed to develop and prepare novel, efficient and excellent weather resistance coatings worldwide. Many novels, efficient solar absorber coatings are developed in recent decades<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. However, the methods of qualification tests, such as the test of thermal stability, corrosion resistance and prediction of service life are still the critical challenges for solar absorber coating to be applied for large-scale applications. At this scenario, light-weighted, flexible, and of course, higher specific heat capacity and a better thermal conductive material is required. With a relatively simple generation process and enhanced optical absorption, carbon materials will help to expand the application of graphene-based materials as broadband solar absorbers. The Dirac fermions (zero effective mass) of graphene provides high electron mobilities up to 200 k cm<sup>2</sup>V<sup>−1</sup> s<sup>−1</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The combination of high broadband absorption up to 85% (~ 1200 nm), high specific surface area (&gt; 2000 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>−1</sup>), excellent mechanical properties such as high Young’s modulus (1.1 TPa) and excellent thermal stability (&gt; 200 °C) compare to many polymers makes the carbon as an effective photo-thermal conversion layer in the interfacial evaporation system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. A perfect monolayer of graphene can absorb ∼ 2.3% incident solar light in the visible range along with excellent electrical and thermal conductivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Having high electrical-thermal conductivity and excellent water-resistive features coupled with flexibility in a single material, graphene and related derivatives such as graphene oxide, fibres, foams etc. has been turned up as a fantastic material for various thermal applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Graphene has been successfully employed as a heat-spreader candidate for power electronics, automotive electronics devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Besides, graphene has also been used along with the PCM for photo-to-thermal conversion study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. However, as a building-integrated application, the studies with graphene is relatively rare. However, the synthesis of graphene is quite expensive, restricted to many chemical reactions (need surface functionalization), and thus retard mass production for large-scale application. In that respect, graphene oxide (GO) is cheaper and easier to manufacture than graphene, and so may enter mass production and use for large-scale applications too. Besides, GO can easily be mixed with different polymers and other materials in order to enhance the properties of composite materials like tensile strength, elasticity, conductivity, and so on.</p><p id="Par5">Presently, the room heater is a quite popular heating appliance worldwide. However, using the heater appliances further blemishes environment associated with the depletion of ozone level and global climate. Passive heating techniques thus elicit the attention in terms of its low energy consumption, environment-friendly degree of comfort. GO emerges as a low-cost suitable passive cooling/heating candidate for energy and environmentally friendly building thermal comfort solution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Containing different epoxy and hydroxyl groups at the surface, GO exhibits very unique chemical, optical and electronic properties to become an independent solar absorber material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Besides, GO has been found as a more scalable alternative to graphene for large-scale application.</p><p id="Par6">Though, different ceramics, inorganic oxides, phase change materials, cermet and composite materials are already available as a trendsetter solar heat absorber and mostly their preparation and application dealing with the environmental factor, energy consumption, toxicity and of course cost-effectiveness. In terms of cost and eco-friendly sustainable material development, graphene-based materials provide new opportunities to current existing adsorbents employed for the solar heat removal coating material<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. Despite that, the hydrophobic property of GO enables both preventing water passage and resisting damp, and water ingress to the building structure. In addition, building coatings are supposed to feel pleasant to the touch and to look good for as long as possible, be easy to maintain and not be spoiled by dirt, water stains or finger marks. Therefore, features like anti-scratching, flexibility and anti-dust properties of GO coatings further attracted as a suitable coating material in a single system for the building application<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Using PCMs go through a phase change, and accordingly, they are capable of storing thermal energy, allowing for stabilization of temperature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par7">In addition, using GO on flexible substrate allows ease of storage in rolled-up form for new fields such as building-integrated photovoltaics and flexible electronic devices, Primary considerations for the selection of appropriate metal substrates are the thermal expansion coefficient, surface roughness, impurity content, and cost. Polymer films such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) are already used as transparent and lightweight substrates for photovoltaic applications but restricted to apply for high-temperature processing. Stainless steel (StS) is considerably less expensive than its glass counterpart is, and it has the added benefit of being easy to large production through roll-to-roll fabrication. Besides, the less-explored StS is attractive for the PV industry due to excellent chemical, mechanical and thermal stability, widely used in the industry, relatively cheap, readily available in thin foils, high temperature compatible, with shallow surface roughness.</p><p id="Par8">In this regard, applying graphene as a separate layer over PCM brings to light the possible underlying science under the change in the thermal properties of PCM and therefore, its efficacy. In this work, the thermal performance of the screen-printed graphene coating as a heat spreader was evaluated in terms of its integration in a 5 cm × 2 cm × 2 cm definitive prototype chamber and the corresponding temperature profile experiment has been performed under 1 SUN 1.5 A.M. Besides, the high temperature and water resistivity studies of the graphene oxide coating has been further investigated to understand its stability. It has been observed that graphene oxide coating has the potential to be a promising heat spreader material for thermal management of hot spots in buildings’ thermal comfort analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Prototype testing and passive cooling property analysis</title><p id="Par9">In order to monitor the high-temperature resistive effect, the integration of the GOC as a flat absorber strip on the top of a glass or aluminium (Al) substrate connecting through a PCM channel was further executed in contact with direct sun exposure.

In the absence of GOC, the heat transmitted to the PCM and therefore resulted in a lower indoor temperature, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a. Corresponding ΔT profile has been given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b, which shows a maximum ΔT value of ~ 15 °C. It indicates the lower temperature difference between indoor and outdoor, which further signifies the low thermal insulating building envelope. Whereas, in the case of GOCGG, the introduction of GOC successively maintained higher indoor temperature and further able to hold on the temperature ≥ 32 °C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). In this case, the results further correspond to the ΔT profile, which indicates the maximum temperature difference lifted significantly to 30 °C as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d.

However, the ΔT profile exhibits a maximum temperature difference of ~ 27 °C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f). This is because of the higher thermal conductivity (~ 205 W m<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>) and emissivity (0.09 -0.1) of Al compared to glass<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Besides, during the cooling time, the GOC systems exhibit faster temperature reduction compared to without GOC system. This is because GO has a higher emissivity and a larger surface area than Al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. It is, therefore, anticipated that the generated heat escapes to the exterior of the GOC through the pores of GO and facilitates the faster heat dissipation. Not only that, but the GOC system also diminishes the ΔT in such a way that it can be minimized and retain this for a long time as observed up to 180 min. Therefore, for the glass-based outdoor cover, the maximum ΔT trend follows as GG &lt;  &lt; GOCGA &lt; GOCGG. Whereas, the minimum ΔT trend exhibits as GG &lt;  &lt; GOCGA ⁓ GOCGG.

As a result, this observation shows quite impressive performance of GOC as a head spreader to diminish the indoor temperature and further able to have appeared as a passive heating strategy. Also, the temperature reduction further enfolds high efficiency in case of the glass-based indoor substrate. It has been observed that Al-based substrates are light weighted and flexible compared to the glass-based substrate and therefore, excels priority to use. However, as Al itself, a conductive metal allowed more heat and resulted in comparatively higher outdoor temperature than glass.

The same intensity of the D band also implies a decreased level of disorder and an increase in the graphitic domain size.

For instance, GO benefits from the high <italic>in-plane</italic> thermal conductivity, up to a particular channel length. However, weak thermal properties for the substrates implies that interfaces and contacts remain the significant dissipation bottlenecks. The heat generation mainly originated from the phonon–phonon coupling within the graphene electronic band structure.

The overall experiment has been executed using a 3D printed prototype chamber, where GOC has been used as a top cover on the low iron glass or aluminium-based substrate (5 × 5 cm<sup>2</sup>) connecting through a phase change material channel in contact with direct sun exposure. Using GOC on Al sheet resulted in a maximum temperature difference (ΔT) of ~ 50 °C, while GOC on glass substrate offered the maximum ΔT increment to ~ 30 °C. Besides, the reduced temperature was maintained for a more extended period compared to the outside temperature. The experimental results showed promising thermal comfort behaviour of the proposed material. Further, the stability of GOC has been extensively monitored at different temperature and towards the water. Two crucial microstructural characterizations techniques of graphene oxide such as X-ray diffraction and Raman spectra analysis further signified about the physicochemical properties of the different temperature treated GOC. Despite that, the water contact angle measurements established the hydrophobic behaviour of the GOC, which shows water-repellent characteristics of the coating. Besides, GOC exhibits a very high order of mechanical robustness, substantial flexibility and a higher degree of toughness. All these characterization leads to develop a stable coating of graphene oxide.
