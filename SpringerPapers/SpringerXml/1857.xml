Cre-ERT2 under the control of a Sox9 promoter potentially allows spatiotemporal control of lineage labeling of pancreatic duct cells (as well as other non-pancreatic cells such as bile duct cells). However, several caveats and limitations exist with tamoxifen-induced labeling. Tamoxifen administration in pregnant mice can induce abortions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> and a single dose of greater than 4 mg of tamoxifen in adult mice leads to abnormal liver function tests.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> Furthermore, the cre-ERT2 system may be leaky, resulting in constitutive rather than inducible activation in some cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> Another drawback is the inefficient labeling of cells. When the cre recombinase was driven by the HNF1<italic>β</italic> promoter (HNF1<italic>β</italic>creER mouse) and crossed with a Rosa26 reporter mouse to perform lineage tracing of HNF1<italic>β</italic> promoter activity to analyze a possible ductal contribution to <italic>β</italic>-cell mass expansion during regeneration, only 1–2% of embryonic and 40% of adult pancreatic duct cells were lineage labeled.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup></p><p id="Par5">To address the inherent problems associated with pancreatic duct labeling, especially the issues of low labeling efficiencies and unpredictable tamoxifen sensitivity, we utilized an adeno-associated virus (AAV serotype 6), ductal infusion approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> Our goal here was to provide a better tool to more accurately assess for any ductal contribution to newly forming cells in different regeneration models. We first used a Sox9 promoter (468 bp short promoter) to generate a recombinant virus carrying a reporter GFP (AAV6-Sox9-GFP). This recombinant virus construct was then infused into the pancreatic ducts, through the common bile/pancreatic duct, to tag the duct cells. Sox9 is a transcription factor that has been found to be specifically expressed in the pancreatic ducts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> After ductal infusion, we only found GFP in pancreatic ducts, not in other pancreatic cells (after 3 days). We also generated a similar AAV vector, but that instead carried a cre recombinase (no ERT) under the same sox9 promoter, and then infused that virus into the common duct of ROSA26flox/Stop/flox-tomato reporter mice (LSL-Tm mice, The Jackson Laboratory strain B6;129S6-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor</italic><sup><italic>tm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</italic></sup>/J, stock number 007905). One week after injection, it appeared that only the pancreatic duct cells were lineage-tagged and expressed red fluorescence as a result of cre excising the stop cassette.
