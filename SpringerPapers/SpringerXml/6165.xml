To obtain ultra-low resistivity paper-based writing electronics, we developed a kind of ink with high concentration of Ag Nano-particles (up to 80 wt%), as well as a related dispensing writing system consisting an air compressor machine and a dispenser. Additionally, we also demonstrated the writability and practical application of our proposed ink and writing system. Based on the study on the effect of sintering time and pressure, we found the optimal sintering time and pressure to obtain high quality Ag NPs wires. The electrical conductivity of nano-silver paper-based electronics has been tested using the calculated resistivity. After hot-pressure sintering at 120 °C, 25 MPa pressure for 20 minutes, the resistivity of silver NPs conductive tracks was 3.92 × 10<sup>−8</sup> (Ωm), only 2.45 times of bulk silver. The mechanical flexibility of nano-silver paper-based electronics also has been tested. After 1000 bending cycles, the resistivity slightly increased from the initial 4.01 × 10<sup>−8</sup> to 5.08 × 10<sup>−8</sup> (Ωm). With this proposed ink preparation and writing system, a kind of paper-based writing electronics with ultra-low resistivity and good mechanical flexibility was achieved.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>17</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep21398.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>8</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>With the rapid development of microelectronics, the corresponding electronic components also showed a lightweight, three-dimensional, flexible trend<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. To meet the requirement of folded and unfolded print circuit, a lot of work has been carried out on flexible substrates for flexible electronics and generated many new applications including flexible displays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, antenna arrays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, electronic solar cell arrays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, batteries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and biomedical devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. As a substrate for fabricating flexible electronics, paper-based electronics not only is lightweight, biodegradable and recyclable, but also can be rolled or folded, which shows a great potential on the application of flexible electronics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p>Due to the compatibility with high conductivity and low-temperature processing required by paper substrate, nano-particle (NP) metal conductive inks present a promising candidate for large-area paper-based flexible electronic applications and have been commonly applied in functional printing based on the high electrical properties<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Among the metal NPs, Ag NPs ink has been employed most extensively because of its excellent electrical conductivity and oxidation stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>.</p><p>Regarding the preparation and printing method of the nano-silver conductive ink, lots of research has been done. To date, functional printing approaches such as inkjet printing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, airbrush spraying<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> or sputter coating<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, were used to deposit nano-silver conductive ink. However, these approaches were limited by many factors, such as materials waste, complex manufacturing process, expensive equipment, high costs and environmental pollution, etc. To overcome those disadvantages, Lewis <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> demonstrated a facile pen-on-paper approach that offers a low-cost, portable fabrication method for printed electronic and optoelectronic devices by directly writing patterns on paper with a rollerball pen. Since then, many other researches have been carried out based on this approach. In 2012, Yang <italic>et al.</italic> deployed a new uniform organic silver ink with 20 wt% solid loading of Ag NPs to write directly on a sulfuric paper substrate and formed conductive connection at 200 °C for 60 minutes, which obtained the resistivity as 3.26 × 10<sup>−6</sup> (Ωm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In 2013, Liu <italic>et al.</italic> studied Ag NPs (20 wt%) ink writing on sulfuric paper and the silver nano-ink was sintered at a temperature of 180~220 °C with resistivity of 2.1 × 10<sup>−6</sup> (Ωm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In 2013, Xu <italic>et al.</italic> directly wrote Ag NPs (20 wt%) ink on Epson photo paper and sintered at optimum hot-pressure condition (temperature of 120 °C/pressure of 25 MPa/time of 15 minutes) and obtained a relative low resistivity value of 1.43 × 10<sup>−7</sup> (Ωm)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. However, to prevent the occurrence of clogging, rollerball pen writing implementation always limited the solid loading of Ag NPs in hybrid ink low to 20~45 wt% and lots of organic solvents, like ethanol, glycerol and ethylene glycol were required to improve the viscosity. Theoretically, the low solid loading of Ag NPs would decrease the thickness of silver tracks, leading to high resistance and large amounts of organic solvents also increase the contact resistance between the nanoparticles. Thus consequently, the electrical and mechanical properties of the designed sample could degrade significantly.</p><p>As a writing method for ink or glue, time-pressure dispensing technology has been widely employed in such processes as advanced integrated circuit encapsulation (AICE) and surface mount technology (SMT) in the semiconductor industry<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, due to its flexibility to ink/glue viscosity, simple operation and easy maintenance, which make it the great potential for writing application with high concentration of Ag NPs ink.</p><p>In order to obtain an ultra-low resistivity writing electronics, a kind of high concentration Ag nano-particles conductive ink containing Ag NPs up to 80 wt% was prepared in the paper. Additionally, a time-pressure dispenser was employed as the writing device to overcome the clogging problem caused by high concentration Ag NPs ink and patterns were written on Epson photo paper (Type: C13S042551, cast coated photo paper). Given that the rough surface of common printing paper could prevent the continuity of the conductive films and thus lead to a high resistivity, therefore, cast coated photo paper that has a coating of silicon dioxide NPs and forms tiny inorganic–organic hybrid fine particles which can enhance the adhesion strength of the conductive film is employed in this work. After that, hot-pressure sintering was used to convert the writing patterns into its conductive counterparts. Finally, the conductivity, mechanical flexibility and adhesion of the writing electronics were validated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Effect of sintering time on resistivity</title><p>To study the effects of sintering time on the resistivity of tracks with high solid loading of Ag NPs ink, a series of silver tracks was dispensed on Epson photo paper with the width of about 1 mm, thickness of about 4 μm and a length of about 45 mm. The tracks was dried 2 hours at room temperature in air, then the samples were sintered using pressure of 25 MPa at 120 °C for different sintering time with 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17 and 20 minutes, respectively.</p><p><xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> shows the average resistivity of silver tracks that sintered with different time. It shows that the resistivity decreased with the increasing of sintering time. At the beginning (from 2 to 8 minutes), the resistivity rapidly decreased from 6.97 × 10<sup>−8</sup> to 3.94 × 10<sup>−8</sup> (Ωm). After 8 minutes, the resistivity approximately approached a stable value regardless of the sintering time, which only decreased from 3.94 × 10<sup>−8</sup> to 3.92 × 10<sup>−8</sup> (Ωm) from 8 to 20 minutes. Therefore, 8 minutes seems to be the optimal hot-pressure sintering time in this study. Compared with the optimal sintering time as 15 minutes in Xu <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> under the same sintering pressure and temperature, we achieved a faster sintering process with 7 minutes less. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> also shows that the lowest resistivity is 3.92 × 10<sup>−8</sup> (Ωm), which is only 2.45 times of bulk silver (1.58 × 10<sup>−8</sup> Ωm).

Based on these excellent properties, a simple LED lighting electronic circuit was fabricated, which demonstrated that the ink preparation and writing method proposed in this paper are promising for writing electronics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Material</title><p>Nano-silver particles with purity of 99.9% and average size of 20 nm were purchased from China Shanghai Chao Wei Technology Co., Ltd.

All of these were used without additional purification.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Preparation of nano-silver conductive ink</title><p>The preparation process goes on as follows: Firstly, the nano-silver particles were dispersed in the mixture solvent of ethanol, ethylene glycol and glycerol using the ultrasonic bathing for 10 minutes, the volume ratio of solvent was ethanol: ethylene glycol: glycerol = 60:35:5%. Then, the mixture solution was held for 10 minutes to settle down the Ag NPs and the top transparent solution in the tube was removed to increase the solid loading of Ag NPs. Finally, 5 wt% glycerol was added into the solution to improve the wettability and surface tension of ink and ultrasonic agitation was applied again until the ink becomes uniform. The obtained conductive ink can reach the solid loading of Ag NPs as high as 80 wt%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Writing system setup</title><p>In order to write patterns on a paper substrate using the high concentrative Ag NPs ink, a writing system consisting an air compressor machine and a dispenser was developed, as shown in <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. Firstly, the ink syringe barrel and needle were cleaned thoroughly in ethanol using ultrasonic bath and dried with clean air. Then, the Ag NPs ink was filled into the ink syringe barrel and the ink syringe barrel was connected to the dispenser with needle installed. Finally, the air pressure of dispenser was adjusted together with the valve open to dispense the Ag NPs ink on the Epson photo paper to form desired tracks. Note that the dispenser tip was controlled automatically using servo motor via LabView tool to generate uniformal silver tracks.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of the writing system.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep21398_Fig8_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Hot pressing sintering</title><p>To convert the non-conductive writing pattern into its conductive counterparts, the hot pressing sintering method was used.
