Power satellites can deliver GW-class power to municipal statistical areas and industrial parks using wireless power transfer from phased array antennae. Two recent innovations allow for a low specific cost (USD/kWh) at maturity, along with a small carbon footprint (gCO2(eq)/kWh). Remote from cities, local power and heat can be produced from non-food biomass. For villages and settlements in rural areas, agricultural residues can be converted to a tar-free hydrogen-rich syngas suitable for hydrogen extraction or as a fuel for an electrical generator (fuel cell or internal-combustion engine). This proven technology provides always-on power to off-grid locations, as well as heat for cooking or sterilization. Furthermore, with dry feedstock, the process generates biochar that can augment soil productivity, and be carbon-negative as well. Mineral ash from biomass conversion includes silica that can be reduced, with biochar, to produce metallurgical grade silicon. That silicon can be made porous with a chemical etch, and treated with a transition metal to produce a hydrogen storage medium. The parasitic energy loss of charging and discharging catalytically-modified porous silicon is very low, and it has negligible leakage. These qualities make for an ideal choice in fuel cell vehicles and portable electronics. Hydrogen can come from biomass in the countryside, or from powersat electrolysis during periods of low demand in the city. Taken together, these complementary technologies can power all of human needs for all time to come.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Power</kwd><kwd>Sustainability</kwd><kwd>Integrated</kwd><kwd>Environmental</kwd><kwd>Green energy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2023</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>6</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>22</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/12667_2023_Article_598.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Policy, Economics and Management</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Operations Research/Decision Theory</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Optimization</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Energy Systems</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Energy</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Power is the use of energy over time. Work is force applied over distance. Mechanized society requires considerable energy to accomplish useful work. Competition and growth demand working faster, or across greater distances, requiring more power. Accelerating food production results in more population, who require more energy in a self-stoking cycle. The failure of humankind to curb greenhouse gas emissions in the decade or more since global climate change has been well established suggests a Malthusian endpoint to civilization. Humankind urgently needs power sources that are globally abundant, environmentally clean, sustainable across generations, and low in cost so that nearly everyone can afford the basics of survival in the modern world.</p><p id="Par3">To solve all of the world’s energy problems for once and forever requires such solutions in three areas: (1) large-scale, baseload ("always on") dispatchable power for cities and industrial parks; (2) distributed, local, small-scale power for rural villages or remote outposts; and (3) mobile and portable power for vehicles and hand-held electronics. Renewable energy generation from wind and ground-based solar are intermittent and cannot be dispatched as needed to follow demand. Renewable sources such as geothermal, wave, and tidal power are geographically limited. One proposed solution is a world-wide energy grid because there is always sunshine and wind somewhere on Earth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Another approach is to pair wind and solar with energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and pumped storage hydro. These "grid-scale" solutions are lower in cost than batteries, but are also geographically limited.</p><p id="Par4">Existing baseload power sources include nuclear power plants, coal-fired power plants, natural gas-fired power plants, and site-specific technologies such as geothermal power, wave power, and tidal power. Renewable energy such as wind and solar are intermittent, and require grid-scale energy storage to provide dispatchable, baseload power needed by metropolitan statistical districts (MSD), large factories, and data centers.</p><p id="Par5">Presented here for the first time is a comprehensive, integrated solution suitable for all of human activity with minimal environmental impact. Area (1) above is served by power satellites (powersats) in orbit beaming energy wirelessly to ground-based receivers. Area (2) is served by biomass conversion using locally-available feedstock to produce energy, chemicals, fuel, and heat. Area (3) is served by low-energy hydrogen storage based on earth-abundant sorbents, using hydrogen from electrolysis of water via area (1) and hydrogen from syngas via area (2). This whole-of-Earth approach can serve all energy and power requirements based on sunlight, water, and soil, for all time to come.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par6">The Paris Climate Accords, adopted in 2015, call for global average temperature to be limited to two degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels. Global emissions declined during the COVID-19 global pandemic, but have since returned to the "business as usual" trajectory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The sixth report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change makes abundantly clear the anthropogenic nature of climate change, and projects that our current civilization is likely to pass through the 2 degree limit without appreciably slowing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Greenhouse gases are persistent, and the warming from existing emissions has not yet manifested. Even if civilization collapsed entirely this year, the Earth will continue to increase in temperature for a decade or more. Carbon removal from the atmosphere is theoretically possible, but challenging in practice, and energy-intensive. For the current global economic environment and interconnected activity to persist, a clear vision and pathway is needed for a rapid shift to low-emissions energy and power solutions.</p><p id="Par7">First envisioned in a science fiction novel in the 1940s, and first patented in the US in the 1960s, solar power from space has the potential to serve area (1) of baseload power. For satellites in high orbits, the shadow of the Earth occludes the sun only briefly at the Spring and Autumnal Equinoxes, but is otherwise available without interruption or decline. Very large powersats with millions of solar panels generate DC power from sunlight. This power is converted to radio frequency (RF) using solid-state electronic devices and is then fed into an antenna array ("spacetenna"). Using the same frequency as cellular telephones, the spacetenna directs a low-density power beam to a rectifying receiving antenna ("rectenna") on the surface of the Earth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The rectenna converts RF back to DC, which is then delivered to a nearby city or industrial park. Inverters and transformers condition the power so that existing appliances and machinery can operate without modification.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Space solar power</title><p id="Par8"><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>One possible powersat configuration for beaming baseload power to terrestrial customers</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12667_2023_598_Fig1_HTML.jpg" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">There are many engineering challenges to space solar power (SSP), but the primary obstacle is cost. Launching hardware into orbit is expensive, and consumes a great deal of energy. For a space system intended to supply energy to terrestrial customers, one must question the energy returned on energy invested (EROEI). A superior solution is to use materials that are already in orbit. A factory delivered to the Moon can extract silicon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and produce solar panels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Delivering solar panels from the lunar surface to orbit requires significantly less energy than launching from Earth (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

Power transmission lines can be built to serve few customers widely spaced, but this is expensive to install and prone to disruption. In the United States, president Harry Truman signed the Rural Electricifation Act into law in 1936, which dramatically aided farm communities in that country. Many other countries have spotty or irregular power, if any. Fortunately, growing food produces non-edible biomass such as rice husks and corn stover. These feedstocks, plus woody waste, and even non-halogenated plastics, can be gasified to produce "syngas"—a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO). A high-temperature, indirectly-heated gasifier improves on the traditional gasification methods by eliminating tars in the reaction vessel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Syngas can be converted to electricity and heat either by a fuel cell (solid-oxide type) or a spark-ignited internal combustion engine driving a dynamo. For rural, remote villages, the electricity can be used for education, communication, and light industry, while the heat can be circulated through domiciles to provide smoke-free cooking hearths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. When the feedstock moisture content is below 20%, there is a surplus of pure carbon, called biochar, which can be tilled into dirt as a soil augmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This approach can reverse desertification around rural villages, and is the only proven method of carbon sequestration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Indirectly-heated pyrolytic gasifier (I-HPG) for biomass conversion</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12667_2023_598_Fig3_HTML.jpg" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par12">The mineral ash remaining after gasification includes silicates drawn up from the soil by the growing plant.

A superior approach is exponential manufacturing, also called self-replicating assembly, in which the original machines first make more of themselves from in situ materials, and then the ensemble converts to build more complex machines. The first powersat delivery is delayed somewhat but subsequent items arrive more rapidly. As each additional unit is produced, it carries a smaller fraction of the cost burden of the infrastructure creation, so that the cost to produce new 5 GW powersats decreases with increased volume. This economy of scale, together with an expected learning curve in technology maturation will rapidly reduce the marginal cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par21">Human civilization on Earth requires a rapid shift to low-carbon sources of energy for cities and factories, for vehicles and electronics, and for the rural food-growing regions of our planet. These can be served by a trio of  interconnected technologies, each with the potential for the exponential growth required to avert the worsening of climate-related disasters. Each technology is founded upon existing US patents, plus detailed analysis published in technical venues as reflected in References section. The overall concept of this paper can be viewed as a universal framework that need not rely on these specific technologies. Resistance to these disruptive energy technologies are likely to be raised by those who profit from the existing system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. As climate-related impacts become increasingly severe, there will reach a point when the will and finances, talent and cooperation needed to bring this vision to reality will converge. Together, then, we can solve all the world’s energy problems for once and forever.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was unfunded.</p></sec><sec sec-type="ethics-statement"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="FPar1" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par22">The author declares no conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fuller</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name></person-group><source>Critical Path</source><year>1981</year><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>St. Martins Press</publisher-name></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Friedlingstein</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Global Carbon Budget 2022</article-title><source>Earth Syst.
