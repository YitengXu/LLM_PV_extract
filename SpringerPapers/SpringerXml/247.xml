Electrical analyses based on cell-selective light absorption were applied to individually characterize the photovoltaic performances of the top and bottom subcells. Illumination at a frequency that could be absorbed only by a targeted top or bottom subcell permitted measurement of the open-circuit voltage of the target subcell and the shunt resistance of the non-target subcell. The cell parameters measured from each subcell were very similar to those of the corresponding single cell, confirming the validity of the suggested method. In addition, separating the light absorption intensities at the top and bottom subcells made us measure the bias-dependent photocurrent for each subcell. The series resistance of a c-Si/ITO/CGSe cell subjected to bottom-cell limiting conditions was slightly large, implying that the tunnel junction was a little resistive or slightly beyond ohmic. This analysis demonstrated that aside from producing a slightly resistive tunnel junction, our fabrication processes were successful in monolithically integrating a CGSe cell onto a c-Si/ITO cell without degrading the performances of both cells.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2017</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>7</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2017_Article_15998.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-collection</meta-name><meta-value>Science (multidisciplinary)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>introduction</title><p id="Par2">Multi-junction solar cells (or tandem solar cells) designed with the aim of achieving high photovoltaic conversion efficiencies (PCEs) offer a key technology for reducing the levelized costs associated with photovoltaic energy generation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. The single junction limit may be exceeded by harnessing high-energy photons from the sun at higher voltages, which reduces the thermalization loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Representative multi-junction solar cells are based on group III–V semiconducting materials, which offer a wide range of band gaps and a high crystal quality. These cells have achieved uniquely high efficiencies close to 40%;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> however, the high efficiency is offset by penalties in terms of high manufacturing complexity and price (several hundred times higher than the costs associated with commercially-available single-junction solar cells, <italic>i.e</italic>. crystalline Si solar cells). Instead, hybrid tandem solar cells consisting of a wide band gap (E<sub>g</sub>) thin film solar cell and a crystalline Si (c-Si) solar cell have attracted significant interest<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Such cells offer a pathway to achieving the milestone goal of improving the efficiency beyond 30% while maintaining low fabrication costs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This approach tends to involve, as a bottom subcell, a c-Si solar cell with a sandwich cell architecture (electrode/Si/electrode) that is more compatible with the subsequent deposition of the thin films used to create the top subcell. The sandwich cell architecture is a c-Si PV market-dominating technology with good cost competitiveness. Thus, more beneficially, this approach can utilize the existing manufacturing infrastructure of the c-Si PV industry, for example if the deposition equipment needed to fabricate the top subcell is added.</p><p id="Par3">Perovskite and Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)<sub>2</sub> (CIGS) have been considered as promising candidate materials for wide bandgap thin film solar cells, because they offer high band gap tunability and a high PCE exceeding 22%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.

However, perovskite solar cells contain a significant amount of lead (Pb), which is harmful to the human body and shows very poor long-term stability upon exposure to moisture, light, bias, and heat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. The issues need to be addressed for the successful commercialization of these cells.</p><p id="Par5">CIGS thin film solar cells display excellent long-term stability, and can be fabricated using minimal or no toxic elements. For example, Cd can be removed by replacing the CdS buffer with a Cd-free buffer, such as Zn(O,S) and ZnSnO. However, the CIGS solar cell provides its highest efficiency at a narrow band gap of around 1.15 eV, which is too low for use in top subcells. A wider band gap absorber, such as CuGaSe<sub>2</sub> (CGSe), which has a band gap of 1.68 eV, displays at best a relatively low PCE of 11.2%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. This PCE is too low for use in top subcells. The PCE of the top subcell must exceed 14% to obtain a tandem cell PCE above 25% and must exceed 18% to obtain a tandem cell PCE above 30%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The primary factor underlying the low PCE of the CGSe solar cell is a high V<sub>OC</sub> deficit (=E<sub>g</sub>/q − V<sub>OC</sub>), attributed to the high recombination rate resulting from either a high density of bulk and/or surface defects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> or inappropriate alignment of the conduction band minima (CBO) of the CdS buffer and CGSe absorber<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Another problem is that c-Si and CGSe solar cells do not have an optimal tunnel junction to enable easy transport of the carriers between the top and bottom subcells. The only approach currently available involves the use of a transparent conducting oxide (TCO) layer, such as an indium tin oxide (ITO) film, as an interlayer between the CGSe film and the c-Si emitter; however, a highly resistive gallium oxide (GaO<sub>x</sub>) layer tends to form at the interface between ITO and CIGSe during deposition, producing a counter diode that blocks carrier transport<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. For this reason, the highest PCE achieved to date using a tandem structure was only 5.1%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Despite the issues described above, it is very valuable to find methods for improving the performances of c-Si/TCO/CGSe monolithic tandem cells. Such methods include searching for novel ways to reduce the high V<sub>OC</sub> deficit of the CGSe solar cell or creating more ohmic junctions between c-Si and CGSe. In any effort designed to overcome these critical issues, analysis of the root cause underlying the performance degradation in tandem cells is mandatory. It is particularly difficult in two-terminal monolithic-integrated tandem cells to identify the causes underlying their subcell degradation. Because subcells within the structure are connected in series and cannot be separated, identifying the damaged subcell associated with cell performance degradation during fabrication or characterization tends to be difficult. A lack of methods for characterizing the performances of subcells increases the difficulties associated with successfully fabricating tandem cells. Few studies have addressed the effects of the subcell breakdown voltage and shunt loss on the electrical properties of tandem cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. In this study, we individually characterized the electrical performances of the top and bottom subcells in a monolithic c-Si/ITO/CGSe tandem solar cell developed in our laboratory; the cell structure is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Diagram showing a cross-sectional view of the fabricated c-Si/ITO/CGSe monolithic tandem solar cell.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2017_15998_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Method for individually characterizing the performance of the top subcell or bottom subcell</title><p id="Par7">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> illustrates the electrical circuit of a tandem solar cell in which two subcells were connected in series. Here, all lights entered the top subcell first. Illumination of the cell with white light across the full solar spectrum generated a photocurrent and photovoltage in both the top and bottom subcells (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(a)</xref>). Because the top and bottom subcells were connected in series in the tandem cell, the voltage across the tandem cell (V<sub>TOT</sub>) was determined by the summation of each subcell’s voltage (V<sub>T</sub> + V<sub>B</sub>), and the current was determined by the lowest current in the subcells.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2(b)</xref>, blue light illumination (at an energy higher than the absorber band gap in the top subcell) did not generate a photocurrent in the bottom subcell. In this case, the open-circuit or short-circuit conditions could be defined as follows.</p><p id="Par9">Under open-circuit conditions, the current in the tandem cell was zero, and a voltage due to the light-induced current formed across the top subcell. The magnitude of the voltage depended slightly on the magnitude of the absorbed light but was almost equal to the open-circuit voltage generated in the top subcell alone (V<sub>OC,T</sub>) under one-sun illumination. The open-circuit voltage of a well-functioning solar cell is a logarithmic function of the photocurrent and is not sensitive to small variations in the light intensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Because light was not absorbed in the bottom subcell, the voltage across the bottom subcell was zero. Consequently, under open-circuit conditions, the total voltage across the tandem cell (V<sub>T</sub> + V<sub>B</sub>) was expected to be identical to the V<sub>OC,T</sub>. In other words, the open-circuit voltage of the top subcell (V<sub>OC,T</sub>) could be obtained from the x-axis intercept of the <italic>j-V</italic> curve of the tandem cell measured under blue light illumination. On the other hand, consider a case in which the top subcell was partially shunted. Applying the principles described above, the open-circuit voltage of the top subcell as reduced by a leakage current through the shunt resistance could be extracted from the measured blue light <italic>j-V</italic> curve of the tandem cell.</p><p id="Par10">Under short-circuit conditions, the total voltage should be zero, and V<sub>B</sub> = −V<sub>T</sub> if the series resistance of each cell was negligible. Under blue light illumination, the photocurrent was not generated in the bottom subcell. Therefore, the bottom subcell had no way to allow for the passthrough of the top subcell photocurrent except via paths such as the shunt resistance and e-h recombination in the diode under a reverse bias. If the shunt resistance of the bottom subcell was sufficiently high (R<sub>SH,B</sub> ≫ 1), the current passing through the bottom subcell was negligible compared to the photocurrent of the top subcell. Consequently, the top subcell could be approximated as operating under open-circuit conditions, <italic>i.e</italic>., V<sub>T</sub> = V<sub>OC,T</sub> in the case R<sub>SH,B</sub> ≫ 1. On the other hand, if the bottom subcell were partially shunted (R<sub>SH,B</sub> ≪ R<sub>SH,T</sub>), a portion of the top subcell photocurrent could flow through the bottom subcell (which reduced the recombination current within the top subcell), thus slightly decreasing V<sub>T</sub>. Nonetheless, V<sub>T</sub> was similar to V<sub>OC,T</sub>, (V<sub>T</sub> ~ V<sub>OC,T</sub>) because the voltage was less sensitive to the current variations, as stated above. Here, the voltage across the shunt resistance of the bottom subcell was the same as V<sub>B</sub> (= −V<sub>T</sub> ~ −V<sub>OC,T</sub>). Consequently, the short-circuit current (j<sub>SC</sub>) of the tandem cell should pass through the shunt resistance of the bottom subcell under a bias of V<sub>B</sub> (~ −V<sub>OC,T</sub>), assuming that the reverse diode recombination current of the bottom subcell was negligible. These conditions lead to the relation R<sub>SH,B</sub> = V<sub>OC,T</sub>/j<sub>SC</sub>.</p><p id="Par11">Red light illumination (with an energy lower than the absorber band gap of the top subcell) resulted in absorption only in the bottom subcell, which generated a photovoltage and photocurrent only in the bottom subcell. Thus, the open-circuit voltage of the bottom subcell (V<sub>OC,B</sub>) and the shunt resistance of the top subcell (R<sub>SH,T</sub>) could be extracted according to the approach described above under blue light illumination. In summary, inducing selective light absorption by either the top or bottom subcell enabled characterization of the individual electrical properties of the constituent subcells within a monolithic tandem solar cell.</p><p id="Par12">Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> plots the PSPICE-simulated <italic>j-V</italic> characteristics of the tandem cell for the case of a well-functioning or shunted subcell (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(a)</xref>) under various illumination conditions: dark, white light, blue light, or red light. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(b) and (c)</xref> compare the dark <italic>j-V</italic> and white light <italic>j-V</italic> characteristics of tandem cells in well-functioning or partially shunted states.

By contrast, Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(d–f)</xref> show that the blue light or red light <italic>j-V</italic> measurements indicated exactly which subcell was shunted. First, consider the case in which both subcells functioned well (i.e., were not shunted), as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(d)</xref>. Blue light or red light illumination could not induce a substantial short-circuit current because a photocurrent was not generated in one of the subcells: A short-circuit current is limited by the smallest current in either of the top and bottom subcells. Second, consider the case in which the top subcell was shunted, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(e)</xref>. The photocurrent generated in the bottom subcell by red light absorption could pass easily through the shunt path of the top subcell, whereas the photocurrent due to blue light absorption could not pass through the bottom subcell. Third, consider the case in which the bottom subcell was shunted, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3(f)</xref>.

The fill factor of the tandem cell was improved relative to the value obtained from the single CGSe cell but degraded relative to the value obtained from the single c-Si cell. The mechanism by which the V<sub>OC</sub> and FF were achieved in the tandem cell will be discussed below, along with the results obtained from the electrical analyses described here.</p><p id="Par16">The short-circuit current of the tandem cell was slightly larger than that of a single CGSe cell and significantly smaller than that of a single c-Si cell. It was difficult to obtain a mechanistic description of photocurrent generation and collection in the tandem cell without independent knowledge of the optical and electrical losses in the top and bottom subcells. The quantum efficiency (QE) spectrum suggested some insights into how the photocurrent in the tandem cell was achieved. The QE is obtained by measuring the photocurrent at a single photon energy, and photocurrents could only be produced in the bottom and top subcells simultaneously for photon energies that could be absorbed in both subcells. Therefore, it would be impossible to measure the exact photocurrent generated by the subcells at each photon energy without modifying the illumination configuration. Back light illumination was applied during the external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements: 850 nm monochromatic light was used to characterize the top subcell, and 635 nm monochromatic light was used to characterize the bottom subcell.</p><p id="Par17">As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(b)</xref>, the CGSe top subcell showed a maximum collection efficiency of 60%, and the c-Si bottom subcell showed a maximum of 80%. The short-circuit current from the top subcell was calculated from its EQE spectrum to be 10.2 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, similar to that of a single CGSe cell (10.9 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>). This low current was attributed to the fact that the CGSe cell technology used in the fabrication of the tandem cell was not optimal. The low PCE of the CGSe solar cell is a major cause of the relatively low tandem cell efficiency compared with its potential performance. On the other hand, the short-circuit current from the bottom subcell was calculated, from its EQE spectrum, to be 12.0 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, significantly lower than the single cell value (29.6 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>). This reduction was attributed mostly to light absorption by the top subcell in the short wavelength range (above the band gap energy of the CGSe absorber) and partly to long-wavelength optical losses via reflection and absorption in the AZO, CGSe, and ITO thin films of the top subcell. Maximizing the photocurrent and optimizing the cell structure of the tandem cell requires a systematic optical analysis.</p><p id="Par18">The magnitude of the short-circuit current, 12.3 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, obtained from the <italic>j-V</italic> measurements in the tandem cell did not match those calculated from the EQE spectra, 10.2 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for the top subcell and 12.0 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for the bottom subcell. Because the subcells were connected in series, the J<sub>SC</sub> values were expected to be the lower of the calculated values obtained from the EQE spectra. However, the actual short-circuit current was closer to the higher calculated value. This mismatch in the J<sub>SC</sub> values obtained from the <italic>j-V</italic> measurement and the EQE spectral calculations could be explained as follows. The photocurrent in the CGSe solar cell exhibited a strong bias dependency, as shown in the <italic>j-V</italic> curve of the single top cell, in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(a)</xref>. When the photocurrents generated in two subcells (connected in series) differ, a negative bias may be applied across the subcell having a lower photocurrent due to the excess photocurrent in the adjacent subcell. A negative bias across the top subcell would improve the current collection efficiency and increase the photocurrent to 12 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. This bias effect may be negligible in the EQE measurements because the probe and back light illumination intensities were very weak.</p><p id="Par19">The above discussion of the tandem cell efficiency (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) assumed that the performances of a single CGSe cell and a single c-Si cell remained unchanged upon integration in a tandem cell. It was, however, impossible to identify the exact status of each subcell in the tandem cell. The performances of the subcells were examined by measuring the <italic>j-V</italic> characteristics under cell-selective light absorption conditions applied to the tandem cell, as explained in the previous section. In the measurement, a short pass filter was used to permit light transmission at wavelengths below 650 nm, and a long pass filter allowed transmission at wavelengths above 830 nm (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(a)</xref>). With the short and long pass optical filters in place, one of the subcells did not produce a photocurrent. Thus, the photocurrent generated in each subcell was mostly suppressed by its adjacent subcell unless the latter was shunted. Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(b)</xref> presents the results obtained from exactly this case. The photocurrent disappeared upon application of the optical filters. Rescaling the y-axis of the graph to highlight the smaller current (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(c)</xref>) revealed that a very small photocurrent was present, resulting in open-circuit voltages with both a short pass filter and a long pass filter, respectively.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Light transmittance spectra of the optical filters used in the measurements.

These results revealed that both the top and bottom subcells were characterized by sufficiently large shunt resistances. The measured open-circuit voltage of the top subcell was almost the same as that of the single CGSe cell. Together with the previous EQE results, which indicated that the photocurrent of the top subcell was equal to that of the single CGSe cell, these results demonstrated that the CGSe cell performance was preserved in the c-Si bottom cell without loss. The bottom subcell showed a large shunt resistance similar to that of the top subcell, but its open-circuit voltage was slightly smaller than that of the single c-Si cell. The lower open-circuit voltage was attributed to reduced light absorption due to screening by the top subcell. These results demonstrated that the c-Si solar cell was highly tolerant of the elevated temperatures and Se environment imposed during CGSe film growth.

This phenomenon may have resulted from a secondary barrier to the current in the CdS/CGSe layers of the top subcell. The secondary barrier was tentatively attributed to the accumulation of negative charges at the interface due to the presence of either deep-level acceptor traps within the CdS layer or Se vacancies related to deep-level defects near the absorber surfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Blue photon absorption by the CdS buffer generated holes that passivated the deep-level defects in the buffer or the absorber surface and, in turn, reduced the secondary barrier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. The voltage drop across the CdS buffer was, therefore, significantly reduced. Blue photons could not be absorbed by the CdS buffer layer in the presence of the long pass filter, and the CdS buffer became more resistive, thereby increasing the diode voltage, as shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5(b)</xref>.</p><p id="Par23">The framework described above successfully characterized the V<sub>OC</sub>, R<sub>SH</sub>, and J<sub>SC</sub> values of the individual subcells in a monolithic tandem cell; however, this approach did not reveal the fill factor or the bias-dependence of the photocurrent, which were measured from the single CGSe cell (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(a)</xref>). In other words, it is not yet clear whether the CGSe cell photocurrent preserved its strong bias-dependence upon stacking on the c-Si subcell. The quality of the tandem cell tunnel junction employed in this study also raised concerns. We postulated that the quality of the tunnel junction against carrier transport could be determined from the level of the series resistance extracted from a diode analysis performed on the tandem <italic>j-V</italic> characteristics.</p><p id="Par24">We postulated that adjusting the relative amount of light absorbed in the top cell and the bottom cell could be used to characterize the bias-dependent photocurrent properties of the subcells. For this purpose, we used two optical filters with the transmission spectra shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(a)</xref>. The 500FL filter transmitted light over a narrow range of short wavelengths and a wide range of long wavelengths, whereas the 700FL filter transmitted light over a relatively wide range of short wavelengths and a relatively narrow range of long wavelengths. The photocurrents in the top subcell (j<sub>QE,T</sub>) and the bottom subcell (j<sub>QE,B</sub>) under AM1.5 G 1 sun conditions could be calculated from the EQE spectra (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4(b)</xref>), the transmission spectra of the optical filters in place, and the AM1.5 G solar spectrum. The results revealed that j<sub>QE,T</sub> = 2.8 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and j<sub>QE,B</sub> = 7.6 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for 500FL and j<sub>QE,T</sub> = 8.1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and j<sub>QE,B</sub> = 1.1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for 700FL. Therefore, use of the 500FL filter induced a lower photocurrent in the top subcell, which limited the photocurrent of the tandem cell and clearly revealed the <italic>j-V</italic> characteristics of the top subcell. On the other hand, the 700FL filter allowed the bottom subcell to limit the photocurrent of the tandem cell, revealing the <italic>j-V</italic> characteristics of the bottom subcell.

This layer must permit easy passthrough of carriers between the top subcell and the bottom subcell and form ohmic contacts with the adjacent subcells.

The layer quality, therefore, could be assessed by measuring the series resistance in an indirect way through a diode parameter analysis of the tandem <italic>j-V</italic> characteristics. The photocurrent in the tandem cell was limited by the top subcell and, therefore, was strongly dependent on the bias. The bias dependence of the photocurrent might be related to the poor properties of the p-n junction between the CGSe and CdS, for example, a high conduction band barrier, a high interface recombination, or a very low photocarrier diffusion length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. These features could render the diode parameter analysis impractical. To avoid interference by the top subcell in the diode parameter analysis (the details of which are described elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>), the 700FL filter data was examined so that the photocurrent was limited by the bottom subcell and, thus, was not influenced by the poor p-n junction of the top subcell.

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7(c)</xref>, this value was much higher than that of the single c-Si cell (0.82 Ωcm<sup>2</sup>), which meant that the junction layer employed in the tandem was slightly resistive or insufficiently ohmic. The problems associated with the junction layer likely arose from a reaction between the ITO and CGSe or from the treatment conditions.
