microbiological soup found in the oceans is a remarkable resource for antibiotics and antibacterials. Resident pathogenic microorganisms present a threat to marine organisms. This battle for survival requires potent molecules endowed with antibacterial activity to be stable under harsh conditions of high salt content to aid the embattled marine organisms. Metabolites such as ribosomal and non-ribosomal peptides, alkaloids, polyketides, and terpenes exhibit antibacterial activity. The need for antibacterials is enhanced by the occurrence of human bacterial pathogens that are no longer controlled by available antibiotics. Antibacterials inhibit bacterial growth (bacteriostatic). Of the 98 small molecule antibacterials marketed between 1981 and 2005, 74 are attributed to discrete structural motifs found in nature. Nine of the twelve antibacterial classes are formulated on a template derived from nature. The vast sea remains virtually unexplored for antibacterial therapeutics in contrast to the terrestrial environment, which has been harvested for the past 50 years. Numbers of taxa in the ocean dwarf the species characteristic of a tropical rain forest. Ocean water contains 10<sup>6</sup> bacteria, and 10<sup>3</sup> fungal cells per mL. The surfaces of most marine organisms are populated with specific microbes. Candidate antibacterials have been found in some rather obscure places such as a microbe in a marine annelid. Examples of antibacterial terpenes are pseudopterosin P found in association with soft coral, and axisonitrile 3 and manoalide from marine sponges. The structural diversity apparent in these few examples exemplifies the importance of the sea’s microbial diversity to humankind’s need for therapeutic pharmaceuticals.</p><p><fig id="Figa" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10098_2011_363_Figa_HTML.gif" position="anchor" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec1"><title>Greenland watch—global warming at ground zero</title><p>The tantalizing photographs record the continuous etching of the Greenland landscape through ice melt. The vast ice field is marred by thaw lakes of blue meltwater at the fringes of the ice sheet. Within the white fields, rivers in deep crevasses convey the meltwater to points of discharge at moulins (deep shafts into the ice structure). The ice is brown and blackened by cryoconite, a brown- black grit from fires, coal-fired plants, diesel engines and other particulate sources. This dust reduces the ice’s albedo (reflecting power of a surface) and permits greater absorption of solar radiation, which leads to melting. Blue ice, ancient ice void of air bubbles, is exposed through weathering processes. The meltwater lakes have a pronounced tendency to drain without warning. During 2006, one lake of 1 billion gal (3.8 billion liters) covering a two square-mile (518 hectares) emptied into a moulin in 84 min at a speed greater than the water flow at Niagara Falls. The melting pattern is greatly aided by the black hue of the soot component of cryoconite, which is deposited and entrained by recent snow falls. The intermediacy of cryoconite as an anthropogenic causative agent to the melt should concern the global citizenry. Clearly, we all stand as interested parties to the natural processes of Greenland ice thaw with an eye to sea rise effects and the continuing understanding of climate change.</p><p>(Natl Geogr 2010 217(6), 34–67)</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Combustion chemistry of biofuels</title><p>The fuels, ethanol, butanol, and diesel, derived from biomass sources are beginning to show their use as alternatives to petroleum-derived fuels and offer promise for reduced climatic impact and renewable fuel resources. Compatibility of fuels from these new sources with current petrochemical fuels, delivery infrastructure, and engine performance offer significant hurdles to their integration into the fuel supply system. Engine performance and climate effects are directly coupled to the combustion chemistry of the fuel constituents. Combustion chemistry analysis uses techniques capable of providing information about the composition and energetics of individual fuel constituents. Flow reactors, jet-stirred reactors, rapid compression machines, and different laboratory flame structures enable the development of combustion kinetic expressions, combustion diagnostics, and modeling of flames and combustion. Flame temperature, qualitative chemical species combustion, reactant concentrations, products and both reactive and stable intermediates need to be profiled with a combination of sophisticated analytical techniques. Molecular-beam mass spectrometry, electronic ionization mass spectrometry, synchrotron light sources using tunable vacuum-ultraviolet radiation for photoionization analysis by time-of-flight mass spectrometry contribute the ability to evaluate flames for the desired information. The chemical structures of the fuel species modify their reactivity in the flame. At this level of analytical sophistication, each fuel chemical species is individually analyzed to assemble reaction-pathway diagrams, which show changes affected, by reactor type, pressure, temperature, and flame stoichiometry. The selection of next-generation biofuels is keyed to the understanding of fuel combustion chemistry.</p><p><fig id="Figb" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10098_2011_363_Figb_HTML.gif" position="anchor" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Algal biofuels roadmap</title><p>The U.S. Department of Energy has released a 140-page roadmap for algal biofuels entitled: <italic>U.S. DOE 2010. National Algal Biofuels Technology Roadmap. U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Biomass Program.</italic> The report was constructed from the exchange of information at a 2008 workshop among some 200 attendees. This research roadmap is built on the knowledge that microalgae can accumulate lipids more than 50% of their ash-free cell dry weight, thereby offering a potential source of high energy density, fungible fuels. The report offers an introduction to algal biofuel research with an eye to past research efforts and the challenges of developing a reliable technology that can contribute to the U.S. fuel needs. The report is subdivided into sections relating algal biology, algal cultivation, downstream processing: harvesting and dewatering, extraction of products from algae, algal biofuel conversion technologies, co-products, distribution and utilization, resources and siting, systems and techno-economic analysis, and public–private partnerships. The immediate research directions and future efforts are developed in some detail with a timeframe relating need and the ability to accomplish the research.

Multiple modes of therapeutic action for each pharmaceutical make the evaluation of environmental impact a difficult research target. The diversity of the pharmaceuticals has been shown in previous research to have 900 different active substances representing 90% of the German pharmaceutical consumption. Some 38,000 tons (34 × 10<sup>6</sup> kg) of these active substances are used annually. The analysis was developed using a UK database of all prescription pharmaceutical sales to assess the impact of these substances to the aquatic environment with aquatic organisms as sensitive measures of impact. Prioritization of the different substances and the importance of their known modes of action assisted the study focus.</p><p>The importance of estrogenic chemicals in the aquatic environment can be recognized in their effects with fish and other animal species. The researchers chose to focus on steroids such as estrogen agonist (ethinylestradiol), progestrogens (norethindrone), and glucocortiosteroids (betamesthasone, and fluticasone proprionate). The water concentrations of these and other steroids were assessed from sales information in the data base to estimate environmental concentrations of effluent from sewage treatment. The effects of the steroids are not very evident from the water solubility criterion used by the authors. Due to molecular weight of the various steroid pharmaceuticals, the environmental fate is generally predicated on the pharmaceuticals’ low water solubility and general partitioning to solids. The real impact of this scenario is the importance of bottom feeding organisms and biomagnification mechanisms.</p><p><fig id="Figc" position="anchor"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10098_2011_363_Figc_HTML.gif" position="anchor" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>(Hum Ecol Risk Assess 2010, 16, 1318–1338)</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Disposable reactors</title><p>Biological reactors made of plastic shaped cubes or cylinders or flat oblong bags are now taking center stage in many biomanufacturing technology applications. These ultraclean single-use bags are produced by a select group of concerns in volumes ranging from 500 L to 2,500 L with the prospects for a 5,000 L bag available in the near future. Cost of the bags is found to scale as a factor of 1.32 as the size of the bag doubles. Clearly, when used for discontinuous production, savings in manpower costs can be realized using larger reactor sizes since one operator is required for all sizes. The 500 L size is currently the size of choice with many innovations tested at this volume. Improvements to the disposable bioreactor have overcome limitations of earlier renditions of this technology. A major advantage of the disposables is the avoidance of sterilization protocols for stainless steel reactor construction. There is an increasing recognition that processing bottlenecks can be managed using disposables. The major market for these reactors is in the production of biological medicinals such as monoclonal antibodies, culture-derived therapeutic proteins, and plant-based vaccine technologies.</p><p>(Gen Engin Biotech News 2010, 30, 42–45)</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Microwave applications</title><p>Application of microwave heating to synthetic organic reactions has been reported to be an effective means to conduct a growing range of synthetic technologies. Laboratory-scale conversions continue to support the general utility of microwave radiation for high-yield conversions that can be guided with significant specificity through the proper selection of reaction conditions. Larger scale microwave radiation equipment is generally available but not necessarily fabricated for the needs of the synthetic chemist. A new batch-microwave reactor has been appraised for conducting palladium-mediated transformations, condensation reactions, nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions, and alkylations. A synthetic protocol involved linear scaling and no changes between a small, developmental scale to larger scales. Reaction scaling was tested across a range of small (0.1–1 mmol) to large (1–18 mol) runs which is some 18,000 fold.</p><p>Batch microwave and conventionally heated continuous flow scale-up reactor conditions for three selected model reactions were compared. Reaction conditions of high-temperature/high-pressure were used to explore process intensification. For the three transformations conducted in sealed vessel microwave conditions, reaction times were reduced to a few seconds or minutes at temperatures ranging from 180 to 270°C at small scale (2 mL). Two out of three reactions were successfully scaled up using a multimode batch microwave reactor at a 1 L scale produced product quantities of 0.5 kg within less than one hour of overall processing time. A continuous flow format in a high-temperature/high-pressure stainless steel microcapillary microreactor (4–16 mL reactor volume) all three transformations were scalable with significantly increased space–time yields compared to the microwave batch protocols.</p><p>(Org Process Res Devel 2010, 14, 215–224; 14, 205–214)</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Polyester synthesis using lipases</title><p>Sebacic acid and 1,4-butanedol were polymerized by a lipase into polyesters having different extents of polymerization and concentrations.

This reaction system offers control of product yield, molecular weight, and polydispersity depending on the partitioning of the substrates and the product between the phases.

The global challenge of climate change could be addressed partially by the management of this land to grow biomass yielding renewable energy. Agricultural land diversion away from food production is expected to exacerbate chronic food shortages by 2050. Second-generation (lignocellulosic) feedstocks rather than first-generation (starch, sugar, and oilseed) feedstocks are offered as a potential solution to the food/fuel dilemma. Woody crops and the biofuels derived from their processing can potentially complement intensive food agriculture and reduce environmental impacts. An economic analysis of mallee, a woody crop being developed for low-cost biomass production in Western Australia, has prompted an extended evaluation of this second generation biofuel source. Dispersed narrow belts, regular short cycle harvest, and regenerated by coppice the short, multistemmed eucalypts offer significant promise when integrated into the dryland agriculture.</p><p>(Energy Fuels 2010, 24, 2–9)</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Laccases</title><p>Laccases are enzymes capable of oxidizing a variety of aromatic compounds using oxygen as the electron acceptor and producing water as byproduct. Renewed interest in the oxidoreductases has arisen in their potential applicability to modern biotechnological transformations. Redox mediators are required to permit oxidation of complex substrates directly oxidized by the enzyme. Laccase–mediator systems have been demonstrated to degrade recalcitrant compounds, but cost and possible toxicity of artificial mediators thwart industrial scale application. This review offers a general analysis of alternative mediators and how limitations can be surmounted. Phenolic compounds related to lignin polymer involved with the in vitro transformation of recalcitrant non-phenolic structures by laccase appear to be natural mediators of laccases. These environmentally friendly mediators derived from lignocellulose are integral components to the exploitation of laccase activity and the development modern biorefineries</p><p>(Biotechnol Adv 2010, 28, 694–703)</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Electrical hybrid vehicles</title><p>The inaugural meeting of the IEA Electric Vehicles Initiative (EVI) formed as a consortium of China, France, Germany, Japan, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and the United States was the occasion for predictions related to the need for alternative vehicles.
