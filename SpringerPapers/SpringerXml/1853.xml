transform cities to the net social, environmental and economic benefit of the e-City dweller as did the introduction of utility and transport network infrastructures. Yet without action, the quantity of greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the increasing energy consumption of access networks will become a serious threat to the environment. This paper introduces the vision of a ‘sustainable Digital City’ and then considers strategies to overcome economic and technical hurdles faced by engineers responsible for developing the information and communications technology (ICT) network infrastructure of a Digital City. In particular, ICT energy consumption, already an issue from an operating cost perspective, is responsible for 3 % of global energy consumption and is growing unsustainably. A grand challenge is to conceive of networks, systems and devices that together can cap wireless network energy consumption whilst accommodating growth in the number of subscribers and the bandwidth of services. This paper provides some first research directions to tackle this grand challenge. A distributed antenna system with radio frequency (RF) transport over an optical fibre (or optical wireless in benign environments) distribution network is identified as best suited to wireless access in cluttered urban environments expected in a Digital City from an energy consumption perspective. This is a similar architecture to Radio-over-Fibre which, for decades, has been synonymous with RF transport over analogue intensity-modulated direct detection optical links. However, it is suggested herein that digital coherent optical transport of RF holds greater promise than the orthodox approach. The composition of the wireless and optical channels is then linear, which eases the digital signal processing tasks and permits robust wireless protocols to be used end-to-end natively which offers gains in terms of capacity and energy efficiency. The arguments are supported by simulation studies of distributed antenna systems and digital coherent Radio-over-Fibre links.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Radio-over-Fibre</kwd><kwd>Green ICT</kwd><kwd>Digital Cities</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>11</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-pricelist-year</meta-name><meta-value>2013</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>Institut Mines-Télécom and Springer-Verlag France</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2013</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>No</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2012</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>12</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>NonStandardArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>ContentOnly</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/12243_2012_Article_346.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2013</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>27</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2013</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-print-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Combined</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Engineering</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Communications Engineering, Networks</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Information Systems and Communication Service</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Signal,Image and Speech Processing</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Computer Communication Networks</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Information and Communication, Circuits</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>R &amp;

Their rapid proliferation has reached private (home) services, becoming available through digital subscriber lines and cable access modems, hence providing fixed wireless Internet services to subscribers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A distinctive feature of such WLAN networks is their ‘narrow band’ services, offering transmission rates up to 54 Mbps with carrier frequencies in the 2.4 GHz (standard IEEE 802.11a/g) and 5 GHz (HiperLAN2) bands. The explosive growth of the Internet and the consequent demand for data, voice and video applications has brought about the concept of ubiquitous connectivity (communication anytime, anywhere and with anything). As a consequence, today’s wireless local networks must meet consumer demands to provide an increased transmission capacity while maintaining sufficient coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The capacity can be increased by using carriers at higher frequencies (for instance, the use of the unlicensed millimetre frequencies at around 60 GHz), which also results in reduced reach and, hence, service areas (cells) of reduced size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A smaller cell size implies a larger number of remote antenna units (RAU), and therefore, extensive feeder networks are required to provide the demanded service. In the end, the cost of the RAUs (which in this case is mainly determined by the frequency of the RF carrier), the feeder network and the system installation and maintenance, in combination with the demanded broadband services (multi-gigabit per second (Gbps)), have brought to the scene the appearance of new paradigms in broadband wireless access networks.</p><p>Whereas the majority of efforts by both the industry and the research community have been focused on the technical and technological aspects of improving the quality and speed of the telecommunication services of the present WLANs (and creating new network paradigms), the ecological and environmental aspects in terms of energy efficiency/savings have taken second place. The objective of this manuscript is twofold. From the environmental perspective, it presents an open discussion of the sustainability aspects that should be considered in wireless access networks towards the conception of a Digital City of the future. From the technical point of view, it addresses the application of distributed antenna systems as a feasible approach to reduce the energy consumption in the wireless access points of present and future broadband WLANs. Nevertheless, the Radio-over-Fibre (RoF) network paradigm as a feasible approach to provide broadband wireless services to end users is also introduced and discussed. The Radio-over-Fibre networks are analysed within the frame of optical coherent systems, thus providing technical and environmental advantages relative to the traditional analogue systems making use of intensity modulation and direct detection techniques.</p><p>The manuscript is organised as follows. Section <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> describes the envisaged context (use case scenario) for wireless access technology. It introduces the concept of wireless/ cloud computing/ambient intelligence as an ‘intelligent urban network infrastructure’ that will shape cities of the future. It raises sustainability issues that have been overlooked by urban ecologists but which are of paramount importance to engineers responsible for creating this infrastructure. It emphasises that a whole system perspective is necessary and that such approaches may have nonintuitive and different outcomes than a simple minded focus on ‘energy efficiency’. Section <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">3</xref> raises the issue of energy consumption of wireless access networks as a particular issue in the proposed scenario (Digital Cities) and identifies the fundamental problem as the wide angle radiation patterns of wireless (assuming the profligacy elsewhere is removed by good engineering). Distributed antenna systems (DAS) are found to be the answer in terms of coverage and total power in a cluttered urban environment, providing an incremental advance of directionality from simple powering down of excess capacity to advanced beam-forming systems, e.g. multiple-input multiple-output systems. Numerical simulations based on a simple model of electromagnetic waves propagation are implemented to demonstrate the concept of energy efficiency in wireless access networks operating at 2.4 GHz and millimetre-waves. Motivated by the perspective of energy consumption in a Digital City scenario rather than the usual argument about cost (also important), the paper arrives at a Digital Coherent Radio-over-Fibre architecture described in Section <xref rid="Sec16" ref-type="sec">4</xref>. The argument for a fibre optic feeder network (a Digital City may be expected to be fibre-rich) rests on its established energy efficiency compared to copper or microwave backhaul (optical wireless backhaul and optical wireless access are options in benign environments). The digital coherent RoF networks can outperform analogue intensity-modulated direct detection systems from an energy consumption perspective and, important enough, in the quality and the bandwidth of the telecommunication services. Numerical simulations on optimised digital coherent Radio-over-Fibre systems at millimetre-wave carriers have been implemented. The optimisation is implemented in terms of the photonic generation of the carrier signals, as opposed to their generation by electronic approaches. Nevertheless, the coherent system offers the advantage of an optimised component counts in an architecture free of hungry energy consumers such as Erbium-doped fibre amplifiers. A significant outcome of this section is the identification of the RF to optical single sideband upconverter (mixer) as the weakest link of the digital RoF architecture. Research is required to improve power consumption, conversion efficiency, carrier and sideband suppression, footprint and stability (integration without a need for trimming). At the end of the manuscript, conclusions and take-home messages are presented.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Sustainable Digital Cities</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Intelligent network urban infrastructure</title><p>As of 2008, over 50 % of the world’s population live in cities, and this number is expected to rise to 80 % by 2020 and reach 6.4 billion by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For instance, in the province of Ontario (Canada), urban areas already attract 85 % of the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Cities have become the major economic units in the global economy and are responsible for the bulk of innovation. The structure of cities has been radically transformed by the introduction of utility, transport and now <italic>information and communications technology</italic> (ICT) network infrastructure to propel cities into the digital age and e-economy.</p><p>Urban planners envisage a <italic>Digital City</italic> in which ICT enables all operations to be more efficient and effective. To that purpose, it is assumed that ambient intelligence is embedded in the fabric of the city, wherein various sensors are widely and densely deployed to gather all sorts of information (traffic, pollution, temperature, etc.) which is then transported by wireless and wired access networks to data centres for analysis in order to optimise the use of resources. Ubiquitous wireless broadband and computing access provides all imaginable services to citizens, enterprises and public services, and enables citizens to be well integrated into the life of their community and the city. Our vision is of an information-rich, economically efficient and effective, city that is clean, healthy and aesthetically pleasing.</p><p>The socioeconomic benefits of Digital Cities are subject to vast literature (see URENIO <italic>Intelligent Cities</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). The results of Digital City research are amenable to commercialisation over both short and long terms. Digital Cities are now big business for some major companies—as seen on the websites of IBM (<italic>Smarter Cities</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]), Siemens (<italic>City of the Future</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]) or Philips (<italic>Liveable Cities</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>])—and commercial interest extends well beyond the electronics industry to include, for example, municipalities, heavy engineering companies and urban furniture manufacturers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sustainability and ICT</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Green by ICT</title><p>Climate change has alerted society to the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In that regard, ICT networks can substantially lower GHG (<italic>Green by ICT</italic>) by facilitating remote interactions (tele-working, e-conferencing, e-learning, e-health monitoring) and by effective use of resources (simplified supply chain management, lower cost lighting, heating, computing, etc.). For instance, EUROCITIES, a coalition of more than 140 large cities in over 30 European countries, has set up a framework based on the exploitation of ICT to develop greener cities. An ongoing European project NiCE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] focusing on energy efficiency in intelligent cities supports the Green Digital Charter with an aim to use ICT to significantly reduce energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Growing concerns on the environmental impact of ICT</title><p>However, globally, about 80 % of the electricity consumed is generated by burning carbon-based fuels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and this proportion is unlikely to change greatly in the foreseeable future. Besides, ICT has been ranked as the fifth largest industry in terms of electrical power consumption corresponding to 2–6 % of the total energy consumed worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As an example, Telecom Italia is reported as the second largest consumer of electrical power in Italy after the railway system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the European Union, recent statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] revealed that ICT equipment and services consumed over 8 % of electrical power and produced about 4 % of its CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in 2010.</p><p>Increased use of ICT is outstripping energy efficiency improvements, leading to unsustainable growth in energy consumption, faster than any other industry sector; ICT GHG is currently doubling every 4 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. With projected growth in traffic, the provision of a good proportion of the world’s population with equal access to broadband services, machine-to-machine communication outstripping human-to-machine communication, a time is inevitably reached when energy consumption, GHG emissions and operating temperatures exceed reasonable bounds. Estimates vary, but the ‘business as usual’ approach will be unsustainable within a few decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>The search for solutions</title><p>Can we look to <italic>renewable energy</italic> for zero GHG emission solutions to the increasing demand by ICT for electricity? Urban areas could be provided with broadband services via optical communication links from remote data centres strategically positioned near sources of renewable energy. It is worth noting that network operators are investing in wind farms and other sources of renewable energy to offset part of their carbon footprint. This can be complemented by <italic>intelligent energy management</italic> that, amongst other whole system optimisations, opportunistically harvest renewable energy when available and offsets energy consumed by heating and cooling, making the best use of the waste heat from ICT infrastructure.</p><p>However, even if it were possible to supply all the energy needed from renewable sources, there would remain economic and technical roadblocks to the scaling up of ICT networks. Without other measures, energy consumption would eventually outstrip supply and heat dissipation would become unmanageable. For example, it has been estimated that, with current growth in demand, core IP routers must operate at temperatures found at the surface of the sun within a couple of decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, more radical measures are required to fully address societal concerns regarding sustainable development and potential health risks associated with increased RF exposure. These radical measures will entail <italic>new engineering criteria and rules</italic> and, ultimately, <italic>new ultra-low-energy component technology</italic> aimed at reducing overall energy consumption and GHG emissions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Why energy efficiency is not enough</title><p>As huge consumers of electrical energy, network providers have shown strong determination over the past 3 years to improve energy efficiency. In the context of current telecommunication networks, energy efficiency is conveniently expressed as the amount of energy (in Joules) that is required to move an array of data (in bits) across a device or a communication link. OVUM has published two reports: <italic>Surfing the Green Wave in Telecom</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] in 2008 and <italic>Increased Focus on Network Power Consumption to Lower OpEx, Go Green</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] in 2009.</p><p>In <italic>“Surfing the Green Wave in Telecom”</italic>, OVUM advises: “Going green must serve the overriding goal of making money for their shareholders. As such three realities should drive action. First, energy—electricity, mainly—has significant direct costs for telecos, and these costs are rising, in some cases dramatically. Second, environmental and energy cost concerns give rise to a number of sizable business opportunities to service providers. Third, green is ‘in’: credible, sustained commitments by corporations to environmentally friendly practices can pay off with public goodwill.”</p><p>While ‘green’ thus remains a secondary priority of business strategies, it is at least a start that operating cost reduction in the form of improved energy efficiency is being branded as green. However, <italic>energy efficiency alone is not enough for a truly green ICT</italic>. Whilst welcome, an exclusive focus by operators on energy efficiency is not sufficient to ensure sustainability and may in fact cause net GHG emissions to increase for the following reasons:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Increased energy efficiency paradoxically leads to increased energy consumption</italic> (Jevon’s paradox, also known as the Khazzoom—Brookes postulate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]). In essence, the increased energy efficiency encourages an even greater increase in use. It is clear that mobile wireless follows this economic paradox.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Improvements in energy efficiency in one part of a complex system could lead to increased energy consumption in another part of the system.</italic></p></list-item></list> For example, a study carried out by the International Institute for Sustainable Development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and funded by Canada’s Advanced Research and Innovation Network (CANARIE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] assessed the business case for moving University data centres to remote, zero-carbon (i.e. powered with renewable energy) facilities. While the relocated data centres are powered by sources of substantial renewable energy, the computing services are delivered over broadband (optical) networks, c.f. ‘cloud computing’. ICT accounts for a significant but largely unquantified proportion of a university’s electrical consumption. In the case of the University of Ottawa, it was found that a business case for relocation did not exist because the university successfully converts waste energy from ICT into energy needed elsewhere on campus to heat and cool buildings and to provide hot water. This nonintuitive result amply illustrates the need for a whole systems (including socioeconomic factors) approach to the optimization of energy management. The report also illustrated the need for improvements in the granularity of consumption data logging to ensure adequate information for analysis. In the ideal sustainable Digital City, one might envisage wireless sensor networks logging at the granularity of individual outlets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>The case of mobile and wireless access</title><p>With the worldwide adoption of wireless solutions, mobile and wireless access networks now act as a major contributor to ICT energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. From a network operator perspective, energy consumption dedicated to mobile network operation is on the rise and becomes alarming in view of subscriber/user growth predictions. For instance, the total energy consumption of the France Telecom network was estimated in 2006 at 1,341.5 GW h/year of which 21 % is accounted for by the mobile wireless network (57 % of this is attributable to wireless base stations) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. These statistics are representative of most major network operators worldwide.</p><p>Amongst all access technologies, RF wireless remains one of the most power-hungry means of communication. For instance, wireless access using WiMAX can be up to ten times less energy-efficient than photonics-based wired solutions based on passive optical networks (PON) for access speeds ranging from 1 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Yet, the sheer convenience of an untethered wireless connection guarantees growth in subscriber numbers. Wireless mesh networks are being deployed extensively in dense urban areas not only for in-building access (train stations, shopping malls, stadiums, offices, homes) but also for outdoor access in streets and highways. It is foreseen that ultimately, all final links will be wireless, even if the distance spanned is as little as a metre. Wireless access points at 60 GHz may well be deployed every 10 m in a Digital City use case scenario [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Growth in bandwidth demand also continues unabated, driven by new services and applications; in order to avoid a bottleneck, the wireless link must have commensurate capacity growth. The energy consumed by mobile and wireless access networks and their contribution to GHG emissions are therefore set to increase with capacity growth.</p><p>The need for a paradigm shift in network design has been recognised by the recent formation of an Alcatel-Lucent led consortium of industry and academia named Green Touch<sup>TM</sup> whose goal is to create technologies that will make communication networks a thousand times more energy-efficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] than they are now. Ongoing EU-funded projects EARTH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], OPERANet I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and TREND NoE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] address energy efficiency of mobile/ wireless access networks. Fortunately, current practice is profligate in respect of energy consumption, and many energy savings can be made from power-efficient and energy-aware protocols and architectures (e.g. sleep mode, circuit vs. packet switching) to low-energy consumption implementations (e.g. replacement of copper or wireless access by photonics-based solutions) and energy harvesting from the environment (e.g. solar cells). Addressing energy consumption at the physical layer is a mandatory research objective to complement the aforementioned endeavors.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Distributed antenna systems</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Fundamental issue of RF wireless</title><p>One fundamental issue of RF wireless is its broadcast nature compounded by the inefficiency of antennas that are small compared to the wavelength—the transmitted power is radiated in broad beams of which only a minute fraction is intercepted by the receiver.</p><p>However, in practice, the energy consumption of mobile terminals in operation is negligible in comparison to that of base stations (a ratio of 1:150 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]). This is a testament to the great strides that have been made in reducing the power consumption of mobile terminals enabled by application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) and driven by the requirement to minimise the bulk of the terminal and to extend battery life, rather than by any concern for the environment. <italic>The concern to reduce energy consumption has not previously been applied to the design of base stations:</italic> their lower volumes do not warrant ASIC technology, and the alternative is power-hungry field programmable gate arrays.</p><p>The total power consumption of a base station varies proportionally to the usefully radiated RF power even though the latter is only 5–10 % of the total. The RF power amplifiers are approximately 45 % efficient, contributing a further 11–22 %. Fans account for 10–15 %, while air conditioning accounts for 50 % of the total consumed power. The signal processing and switching hardware consume power proportional to the base station data capacity, which also scales with RF power, either by capturing more mobile handsets or by providing higher data rate links to end users. If the link between the transmitter and the receiver could be made more directional, the transmitted power could be reduced and, with it all other components of base station energy consumption. A major milestone would be the achievement of uncooled operation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Towards a higher degree of densification in wireless access networks</title><p>The ever-growing demand for broadband services with enhanced capacity and mobility is a significant factor in driving mobile and wireless access networks towards a higher degree of densification.

In Contrast, the maximum data rate in the single antenna case can be reached only in zone A and partly in zone B. This demonstrates that distributed antennas drastically improve the overall wireless coverage. Besides, the total transmit power (three antennas with 5-dBm EIRP each) is reduced by 10 dB as compared with the single antenna case, thereby reducing the overall energy consumption. Further energy savings may be achieved through innovative circuit design and network strategies for turning off antenna units whenever and wherever transmission resources are not required by user terminals, which in turns mitigates human exposure and electromagnetic interference problems.</p><p>In order to estimate the real benefits of DAS, appropriate energy efficiency metrics should be defined, taking both power consumption and performance into account.

The antennas are positioned in a way to obtain the best possible coverage in the office spaces. The simulation tool WinProp<sup>TM</sup> was used with its module WallMan<sup>TM</sup> to model the office building, taking into account the frequency dependence of the material properties (transmission and reflection losses). The simulation was done in the ProMan<sup>TM</sup> module using the <italic>dominant path method</italic> and the wireless norm IEEE802.11g. Simulation results were confirmed by measurement campaigns. In the DAS case, the Wi-Fi box (Buffalo Wireless router) was set to transmit 1 dBm, which, after distribution through RF cables and power splitters, meant an EIRP at each antenna of −17 dBm (0.02 mW). To achieve the same coverage and bit rate with a single antenna system (centred antenna), the transmitted power from the Wi-Fi box had to be increased to 10 dBm (10 mW), which resulted in −2 dBm (0.63 mW) EIRP at the antenna after taking into account the cable losses. Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> illustrates the received power distribution within an office building, for both a DAS with four antennas and a conventional single antenna system. Both systems provide equal service to the end users in terms of bit rates. The simulation results, which are confirmed by measurements, showed that a 15 dB reduction in RF power exposure can be achieved by the DAS as compared with the single antenna system. In other words, users located closest to the antenna of the single antenna system are exposed to a 15-dB higher radiated power than those being closest to any one of the antennas of the DAS. This confirms that DAS can be advantageously used for minimizing overall transmitted power, thus mitigating electromagnetic exposure levels and electromagnetic interference problems.

It also enables <italic>higher antenna gain</italic> from small antennas and offers <italic>compactness</italic> by keeping the overall dimensions of antenna arrays compatible with a handheld mobile terminal. The increased directionality and increased atmospheric absorption of 60-GHz wireless links (∼15.5 dB/km [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]) also mandates shorter ranges. Such a densification entails deploying denser sets of smaller coverage cells, thereby increasing the overall number of remote antenna units (i.e. base stations or wireless access points) for a given surface area.</p><p>From a physical viewpoint, the high losses of 60-GHz wireless links can be compensated by using high gain antennas (∼50 dBi) to extend propagation up to the kilometre range, which can be considered for point-to-point links in outdoor environments such as those envisaged in the Digital City scenario. From an economical viewpoint, low-cost components at mm-wave frequencies, including power amplifiers, are still difficult to obtain, even though 60-GHz RF-CMOS technology is expected to bring costs down. As described in an ongoing project Optical Radio Infrastructure for Gigabit Indoor Networks (ORIGIN, FUI-8, 2009–2013), the search for solutions to further optimise wireless coverage on a room-by-room basis becomes a key issue while using low power amplifiers (i.e. 10-dBm output power).</p><p>Wireless access network architecture based on DAS benefits from the strategic positioning of the various antennas while adapting their radiating patterns according to their environment. In this context, low-cost 60-GHz wideband horn antennas based on foam technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] are particularly attractive from an economical viewpoint. Indeed, their aperture dimension can be freely chosen (no constraint of standard dimensions) with the same low-cost manufacturing. As a result, they can provide a quasi-constant directivity if one keeps their effective aperture area constant while adjusting the main beam width in both planes according to the needs. Simulations of the wireless coverage of a 60-GHz foam antenna carried out at Télécom Bretagne show that it is possible to achieve quasi “line of sight” (LOS) propagation by using six-sector horn antennas, each having a measured gain of 10.3 dBi and an EIRP of 20.3 dBm, combined with a 10 dBi gain receiving antenna. Under LOS conditions and a given relative position between the transmitter and receiver, the position and the tilt angle of the antenna were determined to optimise wireless coverage within a 35-m<sup>2</sup> room. Assumptions are that the receiver (which can be installed in a personal computer above an office desk) and the transmitter are placed with a relative height difference of 1.4 m and that the receiver antenna is always oriented for maximum reception (10 dBi). Also, because of the relatively high attenuation that occurs at 60 GHz, reflection effects were neglected. Simulation results illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> show that the best coverage is obtained when the RF beam is aligned along the longitudinal dimension of the reference rectangular cell with a tilt angle of 30° (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c).

In order to demonstrate the functionality of such a system, four rooms in a house used as a laboratory will be equipped with transmit and receive (TRX) radio modules which are then interconnected using an optical or electrical switching network.</p><p>Although the system operates in the 60-GHz range, the use of an intermediate frequency of less than 10 GHz allows the project to profit from cheaper and commercially available components for the optical part of the system. Generally, low-cost lasers and photodiodes can handle a bit rate of up to 10 Gbps which defines the intermediate frequency. The fibre chosen is a low-cost multi-mode fibre which is easier and cheaper to install than a single-mode fibre. The 60-GHz receive and transmit modules are designed within the project using commercially available 60-GHz monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC) from Goteborg Microwave Integrated Circuits and Hittite Microwave Corporation. The mm-wave signal of these modules is converted to/from the intermediate frequency by a mixer in the MMIC.

Whilst the former system can provide a data rate of 54 Mbps utilising only one antenna with 5 dBm of transmit power for a coverage of ∼110 m<sup>2</sup> (refer to the coverage illustrated by the red circles (54 Mbps) in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), a distributed scheme of eight antennas (1 mW of transmit power per antenna) would be necessary for a mm-wave system covering ∼100 m<sup>2</sup> (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>b), albeit the data rate is significantly higher (1.54 Gbps).</p><p>This analysis has been extended to the whole SITE building. The current 2.4-GHz wireless network runs with around 100 access points (IEEE 802.11g) with 15 mW of transmit power per node and data rate of 54 Mbps. It is estimated that the same coverage can be reached, installing around 1,000 access points at 60 GHz (IEEE 802.15.3c) with 1 mW per node and data rate of 1.54 Gbps. Under these conditions, a distributed antenna system at 60 GHz will consume 33 % less power relative to the existing 802.11g network and provide a service with a data rate of 1.54 Gbps. The reduction in energy consumption is justified by the fact that power dissipation is proportional to the RF transmitted power. Hardware and auxiliary equipment may be characterised by a power efficiency, which for a mobile base station is as low as 10 %. A more accurate model might result in a constant plus a linear part, even that constant is likely to be proportional to the designed capacity of the transmitter. In the distributed case, the fact that each transmitter may operate at reduced power means that the remainder of the hardware should be designed to operate at a commensurately reduced power, attempting to preserve equipment efficiency.</p><p>On the other hand, further energy savings may be reached through dynamic allocation of resources (power and data on demand) in time and space, for instance, by ensuring that distributed antenna units are only fully powered on when and where resources are needed, which is essentially a crude form of <italic>directionality (connect to nearest antenna only)</italic>.</p><p>To attain further reduction in energy consumption, <italic>small antenna arrays</italic> (i.e. with dimensions of the order of 200–300 micrometres), as illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>, can be advantageously used to form and <italic>steer beams</italic> as in phased array radars.

It is well established that optical fibre networks offer orders of magnitude lower energy consumption compared to other technologies. Considerations of reduced energy consumption of radio access networks in a Digital City have led us inexorably to the Radio-over-Fibre paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p>RoF has long been viewed as a means to simplify remote antenna units, base stations and the backhaul network that connect to the central office. RF transport over analogue intensity modulation direct detection (IM-DD) optical links has dominated RoF research so long that ‘analogue transport’ and ‘RoF’ have become synonymous, but analogue transport is subject to problems of noise, linearity, dynamic range and dispersion. The industry preference is for digital RF transport. The arguments herein support a distributed antennas system driven by a fibre optical network but are silent on the best mode of operation.</p><p>To accommodate bandwidth-hungry applications, wire-line systems must devote an entire wavelength to the signal as in wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) passive optical networks (PON). One consequently envisages a converged Radio-over-Fibre WDM-PON paradigm in which RF signals are distributed (in analogue or digital form) to wireless access points over an optical fibre network that also offers wired access. The optical fibre may also be used to distribute low-noise optical carriers for use as local oscillators at the optical access points or to provide mm-wave carriers at the wireless access points. Owing to the higher path loss at mm-wave frequencies, transmission has a limited coverage (e.g. confined within a room), which, on the other hand, provides the advantage of frequency reuse and the conception of smaller antennas (140 times smaller) relative to their commercial counterpart currently in operation.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Analogue vs. digital transmission</title><p>The most effective RoF operating mode remains an open question. It is commonly assumed that RoF employs analogue IM-DD optical links. However, all methods of intensity modulation have inherent nonlinear transfer functions and hence are subject to problems of noise, linearity, dynamic range, and dispersion. One option is to operate with a small modulation index but that exacerbates the signal-to-noise ratio and energy efficiency issues. Another option is to compensate the nonlinearity of the link through a combination of pre-distortion and/or post-distortion processing, and to exploit symmetries to suppress third-order distortion arising from the modulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>RF base stations already contain much digital processing in the radio equipment control (REC). One, therefore, has the option of using digital signal processing (DSP) to correct for analogue impairments. Linearization by DSP shows considerable promise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] to permit operation in regimes for which the RF amplifier is efficient but normally distorts excessively.</p><p>Another aspect deals with the transport of analogue broadband RF signals. Although this scheme offers easy transparency to microwave signal formats, the requirement to terminate a high-speed photodiode directly into a load matched to the low characteristic impedance of a waveguide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], results in a low electro-optic conversion efficiency and poor noise figure mandating quite high transmitted optical power (∼0 dBm). In addition, the differential delays introduced by the chromatic dispersion of the fibre can also be a cause of impairments to broadband RF modulation by changing the relative phase relationship between frequency components (e.g. carrier and sidebands). In the case of remote heterodyning architectures, for instance, the differential delays may also cause the de-correlation of the phase noise of the two optical signals that beat to create the local oscillator, resulting in a noisier and weaker beat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Therefore, the principal challenge has been to achieve high linearity and hence a high spurious-free dynamic range.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Digitised Radio-over-Fibre</title><p>RF signals use advanced modulation formats that are synthesised in DSP hardware (e.g. orthogonal frequency division multiplexing uses a fast Fourier transform), and the analogue RF is reconstructed using a digital-to-analogue converter (DAC). There is consequently a digital interface between the REC and radio equipment (RE) which has motivated a digitised RF-over-fibre (D-RoF) approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The analogue RF input signal is first digitised by an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC), then transported over a binary shift keyed IM-DD optical link, and finally reconstructed by a DAC at the output. The D-RoF would lead to a downlink featuring a DAC and ADC connected back-to-back with digital RF-in and digital RF-out in different formats. This ensures that the optical link is transparent to the RF protocol; functionally an identity mapping, the data formats differ at input and output of the DAC-ADC but the encoded RF signal is unaltered. Despite the complexity, there are indications that digitisation offers lower energy consumption primarily because a more sensitive photoreceiver may be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Digital coherent optical transmission</title><p>An alternative approach retains analogue transport, but phase modulation is used to exploit the inherent linearity of phase modulators that make use of the electro-optic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Phase modulation necessarily requires the use of coherent detection. Once the coherent detection in RoF is embraced, it is a small step to the use of modern digitally enabled coherent optical transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Optically transporting the wireless protocol natively provides some simplification. That it should work is not surprising given that the advanced modulation formats gaining popularity in optical communications were first used in wireless. Essentially, the downlink transports the RF signal on a carrier at optical frequencies and this is down-converted (by the optical local oscillator, LO) to an RF carrier at the remote antenna unit, where it might be further translated in frequency using an RF LO.</p><p>Coherent transmission can increase the capacity, and the unamplified reach of the optical link (the receiver requires −20 dBm rather than 1–10 dBm of optical power), hence a net power consumption/unit bandwidth saving, especially through the elimination of power-hungry Erbium-doped fibre amplifiers or RoF repeaters. Moreover, it is also possible to compensate the frequency drift of an optical local oscillator (the linewidth requirements are also eased somewhat) and the transmission impairments (e.g. chromatic dispersion, nonlinearity) entirely in the digital domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Prima facie, this approach is well suited to the uplink. Wireless protocols have, however, time-out mechanisms that militate against long-reach architectures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p>The cost of the coherent systems discussed is falling rapidly with advances in photonic integration of the coherent optical front-end and mixed signal integration in CMOS VLSI. Widespread adoption of these techniques will occur if the DSP blocks are implemented in ASICS technologies. This would also dramatically reduce the energy consumption of the transmission system by an order of magnitude or more.</p><p>Different solutions for upstream and downstream may offer a greater simplification of the antenna units. The implementation of polarisation diverse schemes is an essential consideration. Access to the field yields a linear channel that is a composition of the wireless and optical channels which facilitates impairment correction by digital signal processing. A local oscillator may be distributed optically using the same feeder network as the signal. Information may be carried in the amplitude, phase and polarisation of the optical field. Additionally, the selectivity of a coherent receiver is very well suited to dense multiple access networks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Numerical simulations of a digital coherent RoF system</title><p>To illustrate the importance of exploiting modern digital coherent optical transmitters and receivers in multi-Gbps RoF systems relative to the traditional intensity modulation direct detection schemes, a numerical simulation of a coherent RoF system carrying 10-Gbps QPSK signals has been implemented.

The efficacy of this approach depends upon the stability, linewidth and degree of phase correlation between the lasers. Frequency drift of the lasers directly translates to frequency drift of the carriers. A broad linewidth and low degree of correlation can result in an unacceptably noisy carrier signal.</p><p>An ideal mm-wave source would be frequency agile, tuneable and incorporated directly into a system to replace multiple banks of conventional signal generators. Indeed, the availability of inexpensive integrated mm-wave sources is an enabling factor for the deployment of wireless RoF communications systems operating at frequencies around 30 GHz and up to 110 GHz. One approach to photonic means of achieving this ideal is to use heterodyne beating of a master and a slave lasers. Phase-locked loop techniques may then be used to control the frequency of the slave laser, so that the beat is locked to a harmonic of a micro-/mm-wave reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Alternatively, narrow linewidth single frequency lasers may be phase-locked by optical injection locking to individual lines separated by the desired RF frequency of a frequency comb generated by mode-locking a semiconductor laser. Quantum dot lasers show particular promise in this respect. If necessary, the spacing of the lines of the comb may be locked to a lower-frequency microwave reference source. Much of the complexity of these methods vanishes if a laser can be made that oscillates stably in two longitudinal modes separated in frequency by the desired RF frequency. The hope is that the two modes share the same electrical, thermal and mechanical fluctuations. The linewidth of the beat between the two modes will be then significantly narrower than the linewidth of the individual modes because of the correlation of their phase noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Simultaneous emission from two modes within the same laser cavity is very appealing due to its compactness, stability and spectral quality. However, the two modes will also compete with each other for a share of the gain, and this can lead to the instability of two-mode operation.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Energy efficiency in telecommunication networks (in general) and in broadband wireless access networks (in particular) must be carefully analysed by engineers and industry partners, as well as jointly discussed with urban planners for the conception of sustainable Digital Cities.</p><p>Based on the fact that the total power consumption of a base station varies proportionally to the radiated RF power, the distributed antenna systems are likely the only solution for reducing energy consumption in cluttered access networks providing broadband links at millimetre-wave carriers.
