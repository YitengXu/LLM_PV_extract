processes or heuristic designs used to create algorithms that can nevertheless offer an adequate solution to an optimization issue, despite the limited processing capability. Most of the time use of conventional methods to optimize some problem takes a long time. Therefore compromising somewhat on the quality of the solution, which may not find the optimal solution, but we will find a solution that is sufficient for our needs, and we can do this very efficiently with a meta-heuristic algorithm. Among the various meta-heuristic algorithm some are inspired by our nature or mimic some behavior from our nature. Commonly, nature-inspired algorithms are employed to solve a variety of optimization challenges. There have been several meta-heuristics developed in the last three decades to help solve complicated and real-world problems in a variety of sectors. These meta-heuristics algorithms draw a huge amount of attention to researchers and scientists due to their complex problem-solving capability. Meta-heuristics algorithms can be used in many different fields, such as computer science, image processing, control systems, electrical engineering, different types of classification, etc. According to the No Free Lunch Theorem, “all optimization algorithms perform equally well when their performance is averaged across all possible problems”. That means one can’t say that one optimization is good for solving all types of optimization task. It is application dependent. So, the researcher tries to invent a new algorithm or improve the existing one according to their requirements. New NIOAs are always a good thing for the research field, as long as they solve problems quickly and effectively. One can classify these optimization problems according to the solution originated or the behavior of the algorithms. Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the classification of meta-heuristic algorithms.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Classification of optimization methods</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11831_2022_9876_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par3">Image segmentation is the branch of digital image processing which primarily emphasizes on sectionalization of an image into numerous shares as per their features or properties basically for easier analysis of imagery. Various methods of segmentation are extensively employed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] namely thresholding-based, boundary-based, region-based, clustering-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and hybrid technique based, and amongst all the methods, thresholding-based is the most popular one. Multi-Level Thresholding (MLT) image segmentation has attained significant attention in quite a lot of image processing applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, the usage of traditional thresholding methods in determining the optimal threshold values (as a part of preprocessing step) is not just time-consuming but computationally demanding. This leads to the requirement of extension and attachment of certain procedures that might resolve the issue thus actuating the curiosity and interest in several academic scholars. Enormous research attempts are made during recent years toward solving real-world optimization problems with exceptionally towering dimensional search space, and rigorous constraints with nonlinear objective functions. More than a few mathematical elucidations rather than traditional optimization methods have been provided by a variety of researchers to work out the optimization problems however, the complexity of such mathematical solutions turned out to be very high requiring enormous computational time thereby proving to be ineffective in providing comprehensive solution in such circumstances. This pursuit consequently leads in the direction of the requirement for several modern technological optimization processes that would be proficient enough to accomplish the most favorable general yet thriving solution bearing in mind time, complexity, and other checks.</p><p id="Par4">In light of this, NIOA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and their upgraded variations and subset whose solutions were based on chemical, physical, and biological phenomena in nature showed their usefulness in engineering optimization issues and also in resolving a number of MLT problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These nature-inspired solutions happen to be incredibly trendy as they offered to a large extent improved solutions in terms of efficiency and complexity than earlier methods. However, in recent years methodologies associated with nonlinear physics have flourished; therefore, across a wide range of applications, nonlinear procedures-based algorithms are more effective and versatile than other approaches published previously. Numerous global optimization strategies more notably; unique searching strategies based on various nonlinear physics phenomena are a popular current trend in NIOA design leading to the introduction of the Physics Inspired Optimization Algorithm (PIOA). The uniqueness of this method is that nonlinear processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] may perhaps be used as a brainwave for building up flourishing search algorithms that principally tag along with the nonlinear directives originated in natural systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Such approaches appear to be more challenging to develop than other search methodologies, since they need not only the use of a novel, natural nonlinear method as the searching basis, but also modeling an effective adaption of that procedure for addressing optimization issues. In order to build a completely new optimization algorithm following nonlinear processing modeling, this can be a challenging task and may require an expensive design method. In addition, this modeling may demand the tweaking of a set of algorithm parameters that are often connected with physical sub-processes inside the primary nonlinear process.</p><p id="Par5">In this paper, a brief study has been performed on the Archimedes Optimization Algorithm (AOA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] which is a most recent and one of the most promising physics-inspired algorithm in the domain of optimization. This AOA is motivated by the physics phenomenon and here author evaluated, assessed, documented, and profoundly experimented with two types of images namely standard color images and pathology images by employing AOA. This paper mostly talks about AOA, its variations and improvements, and how Tsallis and t-entropy can be used to improve MLT image segmentation. Here, Tsallis and t-entropy are used as objective functions. Among all PIOA-based algorithms, AOA gives the best result in both Tsallis and t-entropy. But AOA with Tsallis entropy outperformed AOA with t-entropy in most of the cases with 4, 6, and 8 threshold values. Furthermore, we can conclude that AOA with Tsallis entropy gives superior results for medical pathology images rather than standard color images.

To solve various optimization issues, in the last 3 years (2019 to 2021), some efficient Physics Inspired Optimization Algorithms (PIOA) have been introduced and this paper deals with the same, and also a comparative study has been done in the result section.

Archimedes’ principle basically elucidates the law of buoyancy which fundamentally elaborates the association amongst an object immersed in a fluid and buoyant force that is applied to it. However, if at all the weight of the object is superior to that of the weight of the displaced fluid, the object tends to sink else, the object will float above the fluid taken into consideration. In AOA, the population individuals of the algorithm are compared and considered as the immersed objects. Since all the population-based NIOA inaugurate its search process with an initial population known as candidate solutions that are associated with some random density, volume, and acceleration.

They trap into local optima. AOA suffers also same problem and because of that finding, the optimal solution goal is not achieved. This problem increases gradually when we move from unimodal to a multimodal or high-dimension complex problem. AOA is renowned for its efficiency, simplicity, and resilience, but it also has issues with premature and sluggish convergence, which causes it to become stuck in local minima. AOA generates a new solution based on the previous iteration. This phenomenon may reduce the algorithm coverage rate and might cover the whole search space effectively and it reduces the algorithm efficiency. So many researchers introduce various methods or adapt new parameters to balance between exploration and exploitation phase. All of the enhanced versions of AOA that which author found so far are discussed below.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Enhanced AOA Variants</title><p id="Par30">There are a numerous number of physics-inspired based meta-heuristic algorithms proposed by various researchers.

Though it has also some drawbacks but most of the cases it gives us excellent results in various real-world applications. In the energy sector, it has made a significant impact. In a few cases, it is observed that it traps in local optima due to unbalancing of exploration and exploitation phase. So, some researchers tried to make this AOA better and more robust for their application. Sometimes an extra parameter is added [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] or a chaotic method is introduced inside the algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] or Levy Flight-based method is adopted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] to avoid trapping into local optima. In most cases, researchers modified AOA according to their needs, and also they tried to modify the algorithm in such a way so that it can perform equally well for other applications. In this literature survey, we found that eight improvements to AOA have been proposed so far.

In the last two decade, more than two hundred optimization algorithm has been proposed so far. Each algorithm has its flavor, which means the performance of these algorithms is application dependent. As previously said according to the free lunch theorem one cannot say that one algorithm gives the best result in all the fields. So, like other NIOA Archimedes Optimization Algorithm (AOA) is not the exception. This AOA has also some drawback which was discussed in the previous section and it is also been improved by many researchers. The researcher modifies the AOA according to its application area which is discussed in Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. From the literature survey of AOA, we can conclude that AOA has been widely used in the energy sector, especially in the wind energy domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

The application of AOA in the medical image domain is very little [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Only one paper we found where AOA has been applied in the medical image domain. In this paper, the author developed a model to detect and diagnose disease from chest X-rays. Though we found three papers in the image processing domain where AOA has been applied. Apart from medical images, AOA is also used to classify soybean plant disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] and Human facial analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This paper AOA use here to determine the ideal facial area for gender recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

Based on the number of threshold values one may classify two types of thresholding, namely bi-level and multi-level thresholding. From its name, one can say that when there is two threshold value then it is the bi-level threshold and when the threshold value is more than two it is said multi-level threshold. Multilevel Thresholding (MLT) segmentation algorithms have limits while looking for ideal thresholding values comprehensively to enhance the objective function, which also increases computing cost. In a nutshell, as the number of thresholds increases, MLT approaches become increasingly computationally difficult. Many scholars are drawn to a variety of methods that are inspired by nature or human behavior or physics phenomenon that may be used extensively to address this and other concerns with MLT.</p><p id="Par59">In addition to that recently designed PIOA has also been utilized for MLT in the last 2 to 3 years. However, the effort is too little. For example, Dinkar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] suggested an Opposition-Based Laplacian Equilibrium Optimizer (OB-L-EO) in Image Segmentation using Multilevel Thresholding by utilizing Otsu’s interclass variance function over Standard Gray Scale Images and employing Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSD) and claims that the Proposed OB-L-EO is capable of exhibiting superior outcome in terms of maximizing variance and PSNR values thereby outperform other methods. Basset et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] proposed an Equilibrium Optimization Algorithm (EOA) for multi-thresholding image segmentation by utilizing Kapur’s entropy over Standard Gray Scale Images and employing Berkeley Segmentation Dataset (BSD) and claims proposed EOA is capable of outperforming all other algorithms. However, EO failed to show its superiority over some algorithms in Standard values, and CPU time for the large threshold levels. Qi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] proposed Hybrid Equilibrium Optimizer Algorithm (HEOA) for multi-level image segmentation utilizing 3D Otsu over Standard Color Images, and Color Satellite Images using the CEC2015 dataset and claims that the proposed HEOA is capable of performing better (has the good optimal ability) than the other methods. However, it takes enormous time to iterate in order to find the best solution. On the other hand, this method has strong performance in wood fiber image segmentation thereby having a greater scope in the field of medical image segmentation, forest fire image segmentation, and so on. Rai et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] also performed a comparative study among six NIOA called Archimedes Optimization Algorithm (AROA), Aquila Optimizer (AQO), Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA), Rat Swarm Optimization Algorithm (RSA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Firefly Algorithm (FA) in satellite image MLT domain by considering Masi entropy as an objective function. Experimental results showed that AROA gave better results than other tested NIOA in terms of optimization ability, quality parameters, and execution time. Kurban et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] also performed a comparative study among six novel NIOA such as Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA), Henry Gas Solubility Optimization (HGSO), turbulent flow of water-based Optimization (TFWO), Political Optimizer (PO), Marine Predators Algorithm (MPA) and Equilibrium Optimization (EO) for color image thresholding using Kapur and Otsu as objective functions. Comprehensive studies showed that MPA and TFWO produced better results than SMA, EO, PO, and HGSO for satellite images. Cuckoo search-based multi-level thresholding for lymphoblastic leukemia image segmentation proposed by Ray et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. The next section focuses mostly on the problem foundation and objective function for multi-level thresholding.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Problem Formulation of Multilevel Thresholding</title><p id="Par60">In image segmentation, based on multiple thresholding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], the primary objective is to choose threshold values so that the segmented images possess the required characteristic. Here the threshold values are taken into account while constructing the objective function.

With addition, the bold value in this table is represented the best performance value. Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> reveals that AOA achieves the best outcome across all <bold>threshold values (4, 6, and 8)</bold> for every parameter considered, but NRO achieves the lowest result across all evaluated PIOAs. From the same table, Table <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>, we can conclude that when the number of thresholds increases, FSIM, PSNR, and SSIM values similarly increase for the objective function studied in this situation. The fitness value of AOA is compared to that of other PIOAs studied (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) using a non-parametric significance test known as Wilcoxon’s rank test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] that permits the estimation of differences between the outcomes of two related approaches. A p value of less than 0.05 (5 percent significance threshold) strongly supports the rejection of the null hypothesis, indicating that the results of the best algorithm differ statistically insignificantly from those of the other peer algorithms and that the difference is not attributable to random chance. Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref> presents the pair-wise comparisons of PIOA (AOA vs. ASO; AOA vs. FDA; AOA vs. EO; AOA vs. HGSO; AOA vs. AOS; and AOA vs. NRO) based on Wilcoxon p-values for Standard Color images for Tsallis Entropy for <bold>4, 6, and 8 thresholds</bold>. The fact that all Wilcoxon p-values collected and projected in Table <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref> are less than 0.05 (5 percent significance threshold) with h = 1 is evidence against the null hypothesis, implying that the AOA fitness values for performance are statistically superior. This suggests that AOA combined with Tsallis entropy as an objective function is competent enough to produce consistent solutions regardless of the threshold settings.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Segmented results of PIOA using Tsallis entropy over 4, 6, and 8 thresholds for Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>a</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11831_2022_9876_Fig8_HTML.png" id="MO8"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab6"><label>Table 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Numerical comparison of PIOA for Tsallis Entropy as objective function over standard color image</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Number of thresholds (<italic>nt</italic>)</p></th><th align="left"><p>PIOA</p></th><th align="left"><p><inline-formula id="IEq135"><alternatives><mml:math id="IEq135_Math"><mml:mover><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>¯</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math><tex-math id="IEq135_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

Table <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref> reveals that AOA achieves the best outcome across all <bold>threshold values (4, 6, and 8)</bold> for every parameter considered, but NRO achieves the lowest result across all evaluated PIOAs. Table <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref> further shows that when the number of thresholds increases, values for PSNR, FSIM, and SSIM likewise increase for the objective function studied in this situation. Table <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref> displays the pair-wise comparisons of PIOA (AOA vs. ASO; AOA vs. FDA; AOA vs. EO; AOA vs. HGSO; AOA vs. AOS; and AOA vs. NRO) based on Wilcoxon p-values for Pathology images for Tsallis Entropy for <bold>4, 6, and 8 thresholds</bold>. All of the Wilcoxon p-values found and shown in Table <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">9</xref> are less than 0.05, which is the 5 percent significance level. This seems to show that the null hypothesis is not true, which means that the AOA fitness values for performance are statistically better.

Tsallis entropy, on the other hand, surpasses t-entropy in terms of SSIM for nt = 6 and 8; nevertheless, for nt = 4, t-entropy yields superior results. When utilizing Tsallis entropy to segment standard color images, different PIOA’s require almost half the computation time for different threshold values than using t-entropy as an objective function. It can be concluded and inferred from the experimental results that every PIOA combination with Tsallis entropy surpasses the PIOA combination with t-entropy in almost all circumstances and in almost all parameters. While this is true, the PIOA in combination with Tsallis entropy yields better results and is clearly superior as an objective function for any threshold value, it is clear by looking at Tables <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">8</xref> and <xref rid="Tab12" ref-type="table">12</xref>, which show that this is also true for every parameter evaluated in the scenario. This demonstrates that, despite the fact that t-entropy is a recently proposed notion that is rarely used in image segmentation, Tsallis entropy as an objective function gives an intriguing and unorthodox option for regular color image segmentation problems. Both Tsallis entropy and t-entropy as objective functions in association with various PIOA are more suited for pathology pictures than ordinary color images in general, according to this analysis. According to the tables described above, a further examination shows that the processing time rises, but the values for FSIM and PSNR and SSIM also increase as the number of thresholds grows for the objective function under consideration. For a typical color image and a pathologic image, Figs. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref> and <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref> provide a visual comparison between Tsallis and t-entropy in terms of processing time, FSIM, PSNR, and SSIM. The average values of the computational time, FSIM, PSNR, and SSIM for the graphs have been computed by averaging the results of all the seven tested PIOA over all the tested standard color images and pathology images.<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 12</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison among Tsallis and <italic>t</italic>-entropy over Standard Color Images</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11831_2022_9876_Fig12_HTML.png" id="MO12"/></fig><fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Comparison among Tsallis and <italic>t</italic>-entropy over Color Pathology Images</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11831_2022_9876_Fig13_HTML.png" id="MO13"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par80">In this paper, the author conducted a depth review of AOA which is a recent physics-inspired optimization problem. Along with AOA the author also presents several optimization techniques inspired by the non-linear physics phenomena applied over standard color and pathology images for MLT image segmentation problems. In this study, the author considers two significant objective functions i.e. Tsallis and <italic>t-</italic>entropy. An intense experiment has been carried out to demonstrate the significance of different PIOA in the field of MLT image segmentation and the comparison among the different methods namely AOA, ASO, HGSO, EO, AOS, FDA, and NRO has been carried forward to identify the appropriate one for the same. The performance of AOA along with several other PIOA are evaluated here with help of PSNR, FSIM, SSIM, standard deviation, fitness function, etc. Quite a few contributions have been projected in this paper as highlighted in the introduction section out of which, <italic>t-</italic>entropy for MLT predominantly with PIOA marks the key contribution. The results and core proclamation of this paper have been recapitulated as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par81">It is evident from the numerical results that AOA has shown its competence and accuracy above other PIOA’s signifying that AOA is the most suitable PIOA for the MLT image segmentation process of the standard color images as well as pathology images over the entire threshold’s values (4, 6, and 8) for every parameter taken into account with Tsallis’ entropy as objective function thus paving its way towards other realms of image processing with fastest execution time. On the other hand, NRO for the same scenario displayed the worst result.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par82">Further, using <italic>t-</italic>entropy as the objective function, the experimental result generated showcased that for different performance parameters different PIOA has its own significance. Also, the performance of PIOA varied as per the different threshold values taken into account. However, from the overall analysis, it can be stated that AOA in most of the cases outperforms other PIOA’s considered in this paper.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par83">In addition, every PIOA generates better results in terms of computational effort and quality parameters every time Tsallis’ entropy as the objective function is taken into account for both variants of imagery in comparison to that of the <italic>t-entropy</italic> taken under similar circumstances.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par84">Each PIOA’s considered in this paper and highlighted in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, consumes almost half of the computation time for different threshold values considering Tsallis entropy to segment the standard color images as compared to segmentation using <italic>t</italic>-entropy as an objective function. However, in general, it can be stated that the computation time consumed by different PIOA using Tsallis entropy is much lesser than consumed using <italic>t</italic>-entropy.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par85">The experimental conclusion demonstrates that both objective functions studied in this research in relation to various PIOA are better suited for pathology images than the usual color image.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par86">Even though as mentioned earlier that <italic>t</italic>-entropy is the newly established concept rarely employed in image segmentation, Tsallis entropy as an objective function proves its way towards flattering the researcher by becoming an interesting and unconventional preference/choice for standard color image and pathology image segmentation tasks.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par87">As the number of thresholds rises, it is also shown that computation time increases, and PSNR and the other SSIM metrics do as well for both the objective function.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par88">The experimental analysis unquestionably draws attention to the researcher to explore and examine AOA for MLT based image segmentation and broadly in the image processing domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].
