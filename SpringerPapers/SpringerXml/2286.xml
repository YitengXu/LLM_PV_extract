The electrochemical behaviour of a graphite electrode in 0.5 M NaOH was studied to elucidate its surface structure/electrochemical activity relationship. Graphite voltammograms are characterized by an anodic shoulder AI and a cathodic peak CI in addition to the oxygen reduction reaction plateaus, PI and PII. AI and CI were attributed to oxidation and reduction of some graphite surface function groups, respectively. Rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) study revealed two different oxygen types assigned as inner and outer oxygen. The inner oxygen was reduced via the more efficient 4-electron pathway. The outer oxygen reduction proceeded with a lower efficient 2-electron pathway. The calculated percentages of the 4-electron pathway were ranged from 70% to 90%. A full mechanism for the graphite surface function groups changes over the studied potential window was suggested through the combination between the voltammetric, FT-IR and Raman results.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>publisher-imprint-name</meta-name><meta-value>Springer Nature</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-issue-count</meta-name><meta-value>1</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-article-count</meta-name><meta-value>21028</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-holder</meta-name><meta-value>The Author(s)</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-contains-esm</meta-name><meta-value>Yes</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-registration-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>26</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>toc-levels</meta-name><meta-value>0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>volume-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-product</meta-name><meta-value>ArchiveJournal</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>numbering-style</meta-name><meta-value>Unnumbered</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-grants-type</meta-name><meta-value>OpenChoice</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>metadata-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>abstract-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodypdf-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bodyhtml-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>bibliography-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>esm-grant</meta-name><meta-value>OpenAccess</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>online-first</meta-name><meta-value>false</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-file-reference</meta-name><meta-value>BodyRef/PDF/41598_2016_Article_BFsrep22056.pdf</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>target-type</meta-name><meta-value>OnlinePDF</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>pdf-type</meta-name><meta-value>Typeset</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-year</meta-name><meta-value>2016</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-month</meta-name><meta-value>4</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-online-date-day</meta-name><meta-value>20</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-type</meta-name><meta-value>Regular</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>article-type</meta-name><meta-value>OriginalPaper</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-primary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>journal-subject-secondary</meta-name><meta-value>Science, multidisciplinary</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>open-access</meta-name><meta-value>true</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="ESMHint"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:<ext-link xlink:href="10.1038/srep22056" ext-link-type="doi">10.1038/srep22056</ext-link>) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></notes></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fuel cells are considered to be perfect candidate as alternative energy resources. Yet the major technical problem facing their commercialization is basically due to using the high cost Pt based electrocatalysts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Many researches focused on using Ni based electrocatalyst as a strong alternative to its Pt analogous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. During our research on electrodeposition of Ni electrocatalyst on graphitic support from different bathes to obtain more efficient and low cost fuel cell electrodes, we found that the electrochemical oxidation response obtained with the Ni electrodeposited from near neutral media is much higher than that obtained with Ni electrodeposited from sulphuric acid bath. At first glance, we attributed the low response of electrodes deposited from acidic media to smaller amounts of deposited Ni as a result of the preferential hydrogen evolution during its deposition. However, we have obtained a small response even for electrodes supported with Ni deposited from non aqueous methanol bath with null hydrogen evolution, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>. Moreover, we have also observed a similar behaviour with Cu based electrocatalyst. Additionally, an increased activity of Pt for Methanol electrooxidation was reported if it would be supported on thoroughly oxidized glassy carbon, GC, owing to bi-functional catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. All these observations derived us to think about the presence of synergic effect between the graphitic support and the electrodeposited active phase. These remarks were the motive beyond our passion to stands on the true role of graphitic supports.</p><p>Graphite is considered as one of the most widely used electrodes in different electrochemical applications either as anode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> or cathode<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Many of these applications neglected the complicated surface nature of graphite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and the possible interactions between the surface functional groups (SFG’s) and the solution species and/or their reaction products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The electrochemical behaviour of the graphite electrode is strongly dependent on the possible organic surface compounds combinations of carbon and oxygen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p>One of the most recent applications of the graphite electrode in direct alkaline fuel cell is to act as a large surface support for the electro-catalytic phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Almost all studies dealt with the graphite electrode surface as a non-interacting support and tackled it from surface area point of view<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In this work, it has proved that the SFG’s undergo critical changes within the medium and the potential window in which the graphite electrode play a vital indirect role in both electrochemically obtained behaviour and response.</p><p>Carbon surfaces are very susceptible for both oxygen chemisorption and physisorption<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The origin of the SFG’s in the graphite is attributed mainly to the chemisorbed oxygen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. They are composed of alcoholic, phenolic, carboxylic, lactonic, oxygen containing alicyclic compounds, … etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Obviously, it must be taken into consideration that these functional groups may undergo chemical and/or electrochemical transformations depending on the electrolyte and the potential at which they are subjected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p>Y. Chabal and his co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> utilized the FT-IR spectroscopy to follow the effect of thermal reduction on the SFG of graphene oxide. However, it is well known that the ordinary quantitative analysis using FT-IR is restricted by several limitations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.Although Raman and IR spectroscopy are complementary techniques widely used to provide useful information about graphitic surface functional groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, many researchers investigated the Raman D and G bands for graphite, graphene oxide and graphene, yet they only considered the I<sub>D</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> for testing the quality of the produced graphene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> neglecting the correlation between the I<sub>D</sub>/I<sub>G</sub> ratio with the surface functionality of the graphitic surfaces. The assignment of the peaks of the G-bands reported in the literature is not straightforward. Few studies correlated the overlapped peaks of the G-band for nano diamond (ND) to the C=C, G-band, OH and C=O surface functional groups<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>.</p><p>The aim of this work is to investigate the major significant role of the graphite SFG’s and their effects on using the graphite as a support for the electrocatalytic active phase in direct alkaline fuel cell.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cyclovoltammetric behavior of BG in alkaline media</title><p>The studies in the field of enhancing the performance of graphite based fuel cell electrodes need a prior inspection of the surface structure of graphite and its relationship with the electrochemical response of bare graphite electrode (BG). The study of the cyclic voltammetric behaviour of bare graphite electrode in alkaline media is a mandatory for understanding the processes that happen on its surface.</p><p>The cyclic voltammograms CV of bare graphite electrode in 0.5 M NaOH in absence and presence of 1M ethanol as fuel are represented in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>. In the forward span, the observed cathodic current is usually attributed to the reduction of H<sub>2</sub>O and/or dissolved O<sub>2</sub>. The stationary electrode condition of <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> doesn’t favour the sluggish diffusion controlled oxygen reduction reaction, ORR. Therefore, water reduction reaction is predominant in this potential range. The anodic part of the forward span prior to E = 0.7 V does not exhibit well-defined peaks. However, beyond this potential the current increases with the anodic potential in two successive regions with different slopes. The first region covers the potential range till 1V and implies a small anodic peak assigned as AI; followed by a steeper sloped region at higher anodic potentials. Although the peak AI appears as a shoulder in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, it becomes well defined at lower scan rates, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(a) The CV response of the bare graphite (BG) electrode at 50 mV.s<sup>−1</sup> in 0.5 M NaOH without (solid line) and with 1M EtOH (dashed line).

As an attempt to stand on the CI origin, a series of linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) was carried out, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(b,c)</xref>. They commenced with different starting potentials, E<sub>s</sub>, more anodic than CI and ended with a constant final cathodic potential of −1 V. The first LSV started from 0.4 V and swept cathodically to −1V (curve 1), then the electrode potential was jumped to 0.5 V starting the second ramp (curve 2) without withdrawing the electrode from the solution. This procedure was repeated sequentially by shifting the start potential 0.1 V each time until arriving the final ramp (curve 11) which started from 1.4 and ended at −1 V. This set of experiments is divided into two groups, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(b,c)</xref>. It is worth noting that the cathodic peak CI does not appear in curves 1–7, where E<sub>s</sub> varies from 0.4 to 1 V. However, when E<sub>s</sub> exceeds E<sub>AI</sub>, CI appears and its height increases progressively as E<sub>s</sub> moves to 1.4 V. It is clear that, CI is a result of the reduction of certain species formed in the potential range more anodic than AI where the increase in its height is synchronized with the shift in the E<sub>s</sub> from 1.1 to 1.4 V, curves 8–11. To the best of our knowledge, CI is not reported in the published graphite voltammograms which lied in narrower anodic potential windows. However, Stevanović <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> obtained a reversible peak around 400 mV (vs. SCE) during the electroactivation / anodization of glassy carbon, GC, in acidic solution. They related the redox peaks to the pseudocapacitive currents associated with the charge transfer of carbon or graphite surface functional groups (SFG`s). Since their peaks were enhanced upon intensification of the oxidative conditions, they concluded that electrochemical activation of carbon causes abundant functionalization of its surface and simultaneously opens the closed-pore structure of GC. The broadness of this peak was attributed to its composition of several overlapping peaks, as a result of the close redox responses of the functional groups of different types. Moreover, a cathodic peak in the potential range of CI was previously observed in the first sweep during the electrochemical grafting of GC in 0.1 M KOH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, at potentials more cathodic than CI in the voltammogram of <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a</xref>, the reverse scan exhibits two well defined cathodic plateaus PI and PII. The height of these plateaus enhances with increasing the potential scan rate, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>. Similar plateaus were previously obtained for flat metallic electrodes only under hydrodynamic conditions (using RDE) which enhance the diffusion controlled oxygen reduction reaction responsible for PI and PII<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. The presence of such plateaus in the voltammograms of stationary GE reveals the presence of high amount of captured oxygen in the surface GE vicinity.</p><p>Moreover, the LSVs illustrated in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1(b,c)</xref>, show the two plateaus in curve 1, but they diminish in curves (2–6), with a starting potential lies just before the range of AI. Subsequently, the two plateaus return to the LSVs whose starting potentials equal to or exceed that of AI, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>. It is clear that the currents of the two plateaus don’t alter when E<sub>s</sub> exceeds E<sub>AI</sub>, (E<sub>s</sub> &gt; 1V), where the GE surface becomes fully saturated with oxygen.</p><p>The above results reveal that the reduction process associated with the cathodic peak CI and the two plateaus PI and PII are independent from each other. This observation arises from the appearance of PI and PII without the existence of CI (curves 1 and 7) and the increase of the CI current without a similar response on PI and PII (curves 8–11). Moreover, we can conclude that PI and PII are correlated to a reduction of inherent (captured) oxygen species attached to the surface that produced in the potential range of the anodic peak AI, rather than the naturally dissolved O<sub>2</sub> in the electrolyte. This inherent oxygen can be subdivided into two types of oxygen; oxygen in the form of oxidized graphite functional groups (OxSFG) and adsorbed or trapped oxygen. The oxidation of the different SFG commences with the easily oxidizable groups, E-OxSFG, in the potential range of AI and proceeds though the more anodic potential till oxidizing the most difficult ones, D-OxSFG. Consequently, during the reverse scan the D-OxSFG is reduced easily at CI. On the other hand, PI and PII could be due to the reduction of the adsorbed or trapped oxygen. A more detailed studies are proposed for the deeper inspection of the oxygen reduction reaction using hydrodynamic techniques (RDE, RRDE) as well as, an intensive inspection of FT-IR spectra of GE’s subjected to different electrochemical conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>ORR and RDE studies</title><p>The two plateaus PI and PII were observed in the literatures under hydrodynamic conditions and assigned to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Some of the reported works<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> proposed a reduction mechanism via two successive two-electron processes (equation <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>, <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="disp-formula">2</xref>, <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="disp-formula">3</xref>) or direct 4-electron mechanism (equation 4)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, others attributed the occurrence of the two plateaus to the change of surface active sites such as quinine-like groups that are produced at highly anodic potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. The aim of this part of the present work is to correlate the plateaus currents and the types of oxygen to be reduced. For this purpose we ascribed some experiments whose results are shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. The idea is to differentiate between dissolved (outer) O<sub>2</sub> that diffuses to the electrode surface from the bulk of solution and the inherent (inner) oxygen, OxSFG and the adsorbed oxygen that are formed at the graphite surface and within its pores as a result of oxidation at highly anodic potentials. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> shows LSV curves for graphite electrodes pre-reduced at −1V to get ride off any inner O<sub>2</sub> that may previously present on the electrode surface. The sluggish diffusion controlled outer O<sub>2</sub> reduction enhanced when the electrode rotates at 1600 rpm as expected<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. When the electrode is exposed to pre-oxidation at 1.3V it forms a sufficient amount of inner oxygen as will be illustrated in the following sections. The curves of <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref> show that reduction of the inner oxygen is not significantly affected by the convection or rotation of the electrode where it is already present in the electrode vicinities. It is also clear from this figure that the activity of ORR is enhanced significantly as its onset potential of the ORR shifts to more positive values after pre-oxidation (compare curves of <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2c</xref> illustrates the reduction of both of inner and outer oxygen. It is worth noting that the currents corresponding to the reduction of inner and outer oxygen (curve 6) are larger than the algebraic sum of curves 2 (outer O<sub>2</sub>) and 4 (inner oxygen), <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. These results prove that the pre-oxidation at 1.3 V is not only saturates the pores of the graphite surface, but also creates some new or modifies active sites for ORR and hence enhances the reduction of both of inner and outer oxygen. This suggestion is confirmed by the positive shift of the onset potential of the ORR after pre-oxidation, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> and by earlier work of Palitero <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>LSV of a pre-oxidized at 1.3V (b,c) and pre-reduced at −1 V (a) graphite disc electrodes for 60 s in Ar saturated (b) and O<sub>2</sub> saturated (a,c) 0.5 M NaOH at 5mV.s<sup>−1</sup>.

Prior to this experiment, the disc GE is reduced by keeping its potential at −1 V for 60 s to reduce all of the inner oxygen species present in the vicinity of the electrode surface and deactivate the ORR active sites. The ring current during the forward span of the first disc cycle exhibits low background values in the potential range −1.0 to 1.0 V. More anodic disc potentials show high rate of O<sub>2</sub> evolution which is detected at the ring causing high increase in their cathodic currents at 1.1 V &gt; E<sub>disk</sub> &gt; 1.3 V.

To resolve the peaks of their spectroscopic data using cluster-based first principle calculations, they identified many oxygenated functional groups in the fingerprint region. The overlapping in the fingerprint region results from the complicated surface structure of the graphite due to the effect of the compatible neighbouring groups coupling such as; carboxyl-carboxyl, hydroxyl-hydroxyl, carbonyl-hydroxyl and any cross coupling between them. If coupling between carbonyl and hydroxyl group occurs, it could be quite observable.

The spectrum of the BGE is characterized by the marked appearance of different O-H’s bands (R1 &amp; R2); a variety of functional groups containing olefinic C=C and carbonyl C=O bands (R3); epoxide and C-O stretching (R4) and phenolate or mono substituted phenyl groups (R5) with a small CO<sub>2</sub> band which occurs at about 2300 cm<sup>−1</sup>, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref> and <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> (and references therein).

This is mainly attributed to the disappearance of all acidic OH groups due to their conversion into phenolate and carboxylate anions. The residual low intensity peak observed at (R1) is attributed to a small number of unchanged alcoholic based O-H’s, which may exist at the edge and basal sites as illustrated in structure (II).</p><p>Furthermore, the O-H’s and the carboxylic C=O bands vanish after oxidation at 1.30 V, <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref> and structures (III–V) of <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. On the contrary, they reappear again after post reduction at 0.35 V, leaving the spectra nearly the same as the blank, spectrum (a), <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6d</xref> and structures (VI–VIII). Finally, reduction at −1 V gives rise to the disappearance of the O-H’s, CO<sub>2</sub> and the carboxylic C=O bands, spectrum (e), structure (IX). This result is in a good agreement with the observed diminution of the two plateaus PI and PII, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1b</xref> (curves 1–7) upon pre-reduction. All of the above mentioned structures were based on selected possibilities of function group interchanging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> under either electro-oxidation or electro-reduction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>.</p><p>In addition, two step oxidations of the SFG’s are suggested at the anodic potentials of AI and above. The first step is the oxidation of the surface carboxylates and phenolates (E-OxSFG) forming epoxide and ketonic surface C=O in addition to generating extra quinone sites added to the already existed ones at AI potential (structure II → III). In the second step, at higher anodic potentials, the edge and the basal surface OH groups (D-OxSFG) are oxidized (structure (IV)). Moreover, oxygen gas is evolved and stored on the surface by the highly oxygen susceptible quinone sites forming cyclic peroxide/quinone moiety<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>, as shown in structure (V) of <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. This conclusion clarifies the way of the above mentioned modification of the graphite surface active sites to accommodate the more efficient 4-electron ORR pathway as discussed above. On mild reduction at 0.35 V, some of O-H’s returns again to the surface and is manifested by the appearance of CI. However, the peer reduction at −1 V leads to the removal of the C-OH and carboxylic C=O groups from the surface, which is reflected by the disappearance of the OH bands (R1 &amp; R2) and the vanishing of quinonidal R3 bands (structure (IX)).

Our findings strongly confirm that the surface function groups (SFG) of the graphite could be divided into easily and more difficult oxidized groups, E-OxSFGs and D-OxSFGs, respectively. The E-OxSFGs are mainly assigned to carboxylates and phenolates, while the D-OxSFGs are mainly assigned to the edge and the basal hydroxyl sites. A novel cathodic peak CI is recorded at 0.35 V in the cyclic voltammograms of GE in alkaline medium and attributed to the reduction of the D-OxSFGs. Moreover, at high anodic potentials, sufficient amount of oxygen is produced at the GE surface and divided into inner (inherent) and outer oxygen. The inherent oxygen is captured into the graphite surface in the form of oxidized graphite functional groups (OxSFG) in addition to the adsorbed or trapped O<sub>2</sub> within the graphite pores. The excess of the produced oxygen is dissolved in the electrolyte (outer O<sub>2</sub>). The appearance of PI and PII plateaus in stagnant conditions could be ascribed to the reduction of the adsorbed or trapped oxygen rather than the dissolved outer O<sub>2</sub>. The inner (inherent) oxygen reduces mainly through the more efficient 4-electron pathway while the outer oxygen reduces mostly via a lower efficient 2- electron pathway. On the bases of the FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy results, a full mechanism with nine proposed structures, is suggested to understand the possible surface functional groups interchanges of the GE during its electrochemical polarization specially ORR. We believe that this suggested mechanism will add a great contribution for maximizing the efficiency of the different forms of electrochemical energy conversion and storage devices utilizing graphite as electrocatalyst support through tuning of the functionality of the graphitic support surface.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All solutions were prepared from analytical grade chemicals and double distilled water. All experiments were carried out in 0.5 M NaOH solutions in a jacketed EuroCell kit provided by Gamry instruments, USA. The working electrode was a Graphite electrode GE (G0091) provided by EG&amp;G (USA) with an apparent geometrical surface area of 0.28 cm<sup>2</sup>. The counter electrode was a platinum wire electrode. All of the potentials were recorded against saturated double junction Ag|AgCl reference electrode. Polishing of the working electrode with emery papers of 280 to 1000 grades was done until a smooth electrode surface is obtained, followed by rinsing with distilled water prior to each experiment. A fresh solution and newly polished electrode is used with each experiment. All measurements were maintained at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C). The measurements were done just after connecting the three electrodes and immersing the working electrode in the electrolyte.</p><p>All electrochemical measurements were done using a reference 3000 and interface 1000 Gamry electrochemical workstations provided with a Pine instrument rotating disk and rotating ring disk electrodes, RDE, RRDE, respectively. FTIR spectroscopic analysis of the electrode surfaces was done using Thermo Nicolet 6700 spectrometer. Raman spectra were recorded using Brucker Sinterra energy dispersive Raman. Excitation was carried out using 532 nm Laser beam with a power of approximately 10 mW.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Soliman, A.
