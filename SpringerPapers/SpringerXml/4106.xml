Regarding air de-pollution performance, the newly synthesized photocatalysts showed the ability of NOx reduction. However, their efficiency was somewhat lower, in which 23.81% of NO has been oxidized by the sample SN10TiO<sub>2</sub>, while SP25 showed a total NO conversion of 38.98%. The powdered xerogels of the newly synthesized nanoparticles revealed high photocatalytic efficiency concerning NO oxidation, resulting in a higher performance compared to those obtained by the

Particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are among the most common urban pollutants, originating from various sources, mostly from industrial activities and the transportation sector. It has been proven that huge amounts of NOx and airborne are emitted annually in Europe (European Environment Agency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2014</xref>). These pollutants have a significant impact on human health and are the main cause of degradation of building materials. It is well known that NOx and soot released in the air promote cancer mortality, respiratory troubles and other diseases (WHO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>; Kelly and Fussell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>; Gasca-Sanchez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2021</xref>). Moreover, these pollutants accumulate on building surfaces, causing staining and colour variation; additionally, these pollutants could dissolve in water (i.e. rain and surface condensation) and penetrate the pore of building surfaces, harming their aesthetic and structural aspect (Varotsos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>; Gibeaux et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2018</xref>), particularly, for portland cement mortar since it is one of the widely employed materials for building construction globally. Although considerable efforts have been made by industrial and transport technologies to minimize NOx emissions, its level is still too high, especially in large urban centres. One of the most advanced ways to remove specific pollutants from air is using photocatalysts as self-cleaning treatment for building material facades. A thin layer of semiconductors deposited on building surfaces can effectively diminish costs and increase the long-term aesthetic appearance of the subjected surfaces of building materials. Among the most used photocatalysts, TiO<sub>2</sub> has been considered the suitable choice due to its high photocatalytic efficiency, chemical stability, inexpensiveness and non-toxicity (Noman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2019</xref>; Korošec et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>; Wongaree et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2022</xref>). Titanium dioxide is the most widely applied photocatalyst in self-cleaning construction materials and air remediation due to its high photocatalytic efficiency (Bergamonti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>; Singh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2021</xref>; Khannyra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Nevertheless, the photocatalytic efficacy of TiO<sub>2</sub> is quite limited, mainly due to the lack of visible light absorption and the fast recombination of the photogenerated charges within TiO<sub>2</sub> particles, and, consequently, its self-cleaning ability only occurs at 3–5% of the solar spectrum, i.e. the UV region of sunlight (Pelaez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2012</xref>). Great efforts have been made to increase the absorption of TiO<sub>2</sub> in the visible range and reduce the recombination of the photogenerated electron/hole pairs, like loading of noble metal (Au, Pd and Pt) (Fujimoto et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2017</xref>; Torras-Rosell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2017</xref>; Yu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2021</xref>). Although noble metals have been extensively used and recognized as good cocatalysts for improving the photocatalytic activity of titanium dioxide, these cocatalysts are scarce metals that are expensive to use, therefore, are not the appropriate choice for large-application, as in the case of building materials. Thus, doping titania with low-cost elements is one of the most effective methods to extend its response towards the visible region (Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>; Xu and Zhang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2010</xref>; Lv et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2013</xref>; Ananpattarachai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>; Bakar and Ribeiro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>; Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2018</xref>). Among these elements, N was widely studied as a dopant for TiO<sub>2</sub> due to its high abundance and low cost. Since Asahi and coworkers reported that N doping results in band gap red shift (Bracco et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2020</xref>), considerable efforts have been made to prepare N-doped TiO<sub>2</sub> with the photocatalytic activity in the visible light region (Li et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>; Biswas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2018</xref>; Calisir et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>; Xu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2021</xref>). The use of these photocatalysts for outdoor applications cannot guarantee long-term performance due to their poor adherence to building materials substrates; for this reason, a matrix that ensures good adherence for long-term performance is needed. Silica has been considered an appropriate matrix for TiO<sub>2</sub> immobilization that guarantees good adherence, therefore, preventing TiO<sub>2</sub> release from building surfaces (Truppi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>), leading to the formation of durable materials (Pinho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>; Liu and Liu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>; Khannyra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2022</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">Herein, new materials TiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> and N-TiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> have been synthesized via sol–gel method and applied by brush on the substrates to produce self-cleaning coatings for portland cement. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no report on applying N-TiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> as a self-cleaning coating for building materials substrates. A number of N-TiO<sub>2</sub>/SiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts have been synthesized by varying the concentration of nitrogen doping in order to figure out its effect on the photocatalytic activity. The newly synthesized photocatalysts showed high self-cleaning behaviour and, the presence of nitrogen greatly enhanced their effectiveness. The self-cleaning performance of the coated samples has been evaluated employing two pollutants: first, the degradation of MB as a model dye; second, the oxidation of NO as a common pollutant released by industrial and transport activities in urbane areas. The TiO<sub>2</sub> and N-TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts employed in this study are in the process of being published in the submitted patent number P202131136.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Material and method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Photocatalysts synthesis and application</title><p id="Par6">The photocatalytic sols were manufactured as follow: first, N-TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts were synthesized via sol–gel method, in which titanium isopropoxide and urea precursors were used as the source of TiO<sub>2</sub> and nitrogen doping. First, 10 ml of Ti-isopropoxide was added dropwise to 100 ml of 96% ethanol under vigorous stirring. The stirring was continued at 60 °C for 1 h; then, urea solution was added dropwise to the mixture followed by the addition of 10 ml of water, and stirring was continued for a further 3 h at 60 °C. Different urea solutions were prepared at concentrations of 0, 3.33, 6.66, 8 and 10 M. In order to study the effect of soaking in nitrogen, the synthesis was carried out without the employment of any reducing agent or stabilizing agent. Undoped TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalyst was synthesized following the same procedure without adding urea precursor. The obtained suspensions were washed several times with water and dried overnight at 90 °C. The powders were granulated and calcined at 500 °C at the ramp of 5 °C/min for 1 h. Second, the required amount of the previously synthesized TiO<sub>2</sub> and N-TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts has been added to 30 ml of silica precursor, TES40 WN (Wacker, Munich, Germany), an ethoxysilane oligomer that has an average degree of polymerization 5. This precursor affords about 41% of silica after complete hydrolysis. The mixture was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min to obtain better dispersion. After that, water and n-octylamine (catalyst, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) have been added. The sols were mixed by using a Sonopuls HD3200 ultrasonic homogenizer from Bandelin (Berlin, Germany) under high-power agitation of 60 W for 10 min. The employed amount of water and n-octylamine respecting to silica oligomer was 0.83% v/v and 0.36% v/v, respectively. The photocatalyst proportion concerning silica oligomer was 4% w/v, and their formulation was as follow: matrix, STiO<sub>2</sub>, SN3.33TiO<sub>2</sub>, SN6.66TiO<sub>2</sub>, SN8TiO<sub>2</sub> and SN10TiO<sub>2</sub>, for S0N0TiO<sub>2</sub>, TiO<sub>2</sub>, 3.33 N-TiO<sub>2</sub>, 6.66TiO<sub>2</sub>, 8 N-TiO<sub>2</sub> and 10 N-TiO<sub>2</sub>, respectively.

The product containing P25 NPs showed a viscosity value somewhat higher compared to the newly synthesized NPs. There is a clear relationship between the viscosity and volume concentration, in which the viscosity increases with the concentration. Previous studies have observed similar behaviour, which links the viscosity and volume concentration (Pinho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>). From the obtained values, it is clear that nitrogen doping did not affect the rheological properties. The viscosity value was practically similar for all the products containing TiO<sub>2</sub> and N-TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs. Thus, these findings allow us to assume that all the synthesized products could penetrate into mortar substrates similarly to commercial silica, providing good spreading of the sols throughout the porous structure of the substrates.</p><p id="Par21">Gel time is another important parameter for building materials that plays an important role, especially for in situ applications. Immediate gelation strongly affects the product penetration in the pores of the substrates, inhibiting their penetration, especially when these products are applied in situ. Part of this products was stored in closed bottles, and the second part was deposited in plastic Petri dishes in order to boost the spontaneous sol–gel transitions. This latest demonstrated that the sol–gel transitions took place in a few hours, resulting in a homogeneous crack-free gigantic molecule. No remarkable difference in sol–gel transition has been observed, in which all the products showed overnight sol–gel transitions, indicating that the presence of the photocatalytic nanoparticles did not affect the gelation time, whereas the products stored in closed bottles were remained as sol after 1 year of storage.</p><p id="Par22">To investigate the optical absorption of the synthesized products, UV–visible diffuse reflectance has been carried out.

Moreover, the intensity of visible absorption was raised with nitrogen loading. These findings indicate that the sensitivity of the photocatalysts towards the visible light illumination has been increased and at the same time evidenced the presence of nitrogen within TiO<sub>2</sub> network, enhancing the photocatalytic activity as will be discussed in the following sections.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Diffuse reflectance UV–visible absorbance and reflectance spectra of the xerogels under study</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11356_2022_20228_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par23">The dried xerogels were powdered and characterized by TEM to figure out further details on their morphology and photocatalyst distribution into the silica matrix.

After measuring the total colour change ΔE*, it has been observed that the applied treatments induced significant colour changes on the substrates, exhibiting a total colour change ΔE* &gt; 5 for all the photocatalytic coatings. This change of colour is due to the nature of the original colour of the substrates (grey) and that of the products (beige).</p><p id="Par32">The treated samples and their untreated counterparts were characterized by SEM in order to figure out the effect of the coatings on the topography of the surface. The obtained micrographs are given in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. At first glance, it has been observed that the presence of the treatments significantly reduced the roughness of mortar substrates, forming smooth surfaces compared to the untreated sample that revealed a rougher surface resulting from different sizes of mortar material grains. This smoothness is a consequence of the presence of silica as a main component of the coatings, which led to the formation of coating’s surfaces with less roughness and helps develop well-adhered and durable treatments. It is also important to note that all treatments have exhibited homogeneous crack-free coatings. This behaviour has been previously observed in our earlier work (Khannyra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021</xref>), which is an outcome of n-octylamine surfactant that plays an essential role in coating adhesion and the formation of crack-free coatings (Illescas and Mosquera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>SEM images of the treated samples and their untreated counterparts.

These aggregates are evidentially related to the clusters and their aggregations. Moreover, it is also observed that these aggregates are covered by silica gel compared with the samples treated by the coating containing P25, which exhibited dispersed nanoparticles throughout the entire surface of the substrate. The fact that the clusters were entirely covered by silica gel might be a drawback for the photocatalytic activity, particularly for nitrogen oxide reduction.</p><p id="Par34">A peeling test was carried out to assess the adhesion of the treatments to the substrates. Excellent adhesion enables the development of durable coatings, especially for outdoor applications.

Their values were under the sensibility of the method (their value being practically zero). The mass removed from the untreated samples was significantly greater than that of the treated samples (6.57 × 10<sup>−5</sup>). These findings indicate that these treatments can be employed as durable coatings for outdoor applications. This result accords with our earlier work, where the study was evaluated on concrete substrates (Khannyra et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2021</xref>).</p><p id="Par35">Photocatalytic efficiency of the deposited photocatalysts on mortar substrates was evaluated through methylene blue degradation.

This degradation is often due to the sensitivity of MB to UV–vis light.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Evolution of MB photodegradation and (<bold>b</bold>) photographs showing the evolution of the untreated, SP25 and SN10TiO<sub>2</sub> samples, stained with MB during the time 0 and after 60 min of irradiation</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11356_2022_20228_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO7"/></fig></p><p id="Par36">Regarding the samples treated with the products containing TiO<sub>2</sub> and N doped TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalysts, these coatings showed high efficiency, and their photocatalytic trend was as follow: SN10TiO<sub>2</sub> &gt; SP25 &gt; SN8TiO<sub>2</sub> &gt; SN3.33TiO<sub>2</sub> &gt; STiO<sub>2</sub> &gt; SN6.66TiO<sub>2</sub>, reaching a degradation rate of MB of 85%, 83%, 79.5%, 79%, 78% and 72%, respectively, after 60 min of irradiation. These results proved the effectiveness of the newly synthesized photocatalysts as coatings on building materials for removing organic pollutants, providing high photocatalytic efficiency. Moreover, the sample with higher nitrogen loading exhibited the greatest kinetic of degradation in this study, leading to somewhat higher performance than the commercial P25. By comparing the efficacy of these coatings, the kinetics of degradation was increased with the amount of nitrogen added. In contrast, the coatings SN6.66TiO<sub>2</sub> revealed a marginally lower kinetic of degradation than other coatings.</p><p id="Par37">Despite the lower surface area of the photocatalyst STiO<sub>2</sub>, this sample exhibited high pore volume and similar pore size to the other photocatalysts, which could be the main reason behind its high photocatalytic performance. The photocatalyst SN8TiO<sub>2</sub> revealed a small pore volume and pore size compared to the rest of the photocatalysts. On the other hand, this sample has a similar surface area to other photocatalysts; the photocatalytic activity increases with the rise of surface area, which could explain its high photocatalytic efficiency. In general, the main reason behind the increase of the photocatalytic activity is that the introduction of nitrogen extended the absorption towards the visible region; therefore, high photocatalytic efficiency has been produced.</p><p id="Par38">Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> shows the colour change of the untreated sample and those treated with the photocatalysts SP25 and SN10TiO<sub>2</sub>, before and after 60 min of UV–vis irradiation. These images clearly indicated that the untreated sample remained stained after 60 min of irradiation, and no remarkable difference was observed between the irradiated and non-irradiated samples. On the other hand, the stain on the sample treated by the photocatalyst SP25 was almost totally removed after 60 min of irradiation. A minimal amount of the stain remains on the surface. By contrast, the stain on the sample treated with the photocatalyst SN10TiO<sub>2</sub> was totally bleached after 60 min of UV–vis light irradiation, confirming the high photocatalytic efficiency of this sample.</p><p id="Par39">Regarding the ability of the prepared coatings to reduce nitrogen oxides from the air, the treated samples and their untreated counterparts were exposed to UV light overnight to remove any existing organic compounds on their surfaces, then washed with distilled water and dried under laboratory conditions. The test was done following NOx ISO standard, wherein the samples were placed in a sealed reactor with no detectable leaks. The evolution profiles of NO, NO<sub>2</sub> and NOx are presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. Obviously, in the absence of irradiation, no photocatalytic activity can occur. The NO concentration remained constant, explaining that the photocatalytic sites are not activated. Once the UV–vis light turned on, the NO concentration fell sharply, reaching its maximum and remaining stable throughout the 5 h of the test, indicating the complete activation of the photocatalytic sites and their stability. At the same time, the concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> was increased, indicating that the reaction between NO and O<sub>2</sub> had started. Despite the increase in the concentration of NO<sub>2</sub> generated, the amount of the total nitrogen oxides (NOx) removed remained stable. As soon as the light switched off, the NO, NO<sub>2</sub> and NOx return to their initial values. The photocatalytic activity was also evaluated on the untreated sample for possible photolysis; the results revealed that no photooxidation has occurred. Similar results have been obtained by the sample treated with the photocatalyst-free coating (S0N0TiO<sub>2</sub>), pointing out that NOx could not be reduced without photocatalyst and at the same time confirming the ability of the synthesized photocatalysts in reducing air pollution (Silvestri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2016</xref>; Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>).<fig id="Fig7"><label>Fig. 7</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Evolution of NO, NO<sub>2</sub> and NOx concentration profiles on the treated substrates during the 5 h of NO photodegradation tests under UV–visible irradiation: SP25 (<bold>a</bold>), STiO<sub>2</sub> (<bold>b</bold>), SN3.33TiO<sub>2</sub> (<bold>c</bold>), SN6.66TiO<sub>2</sub> (<bold>d</bold>), SN8TiO<sub>2</sub> (<bold>e</bold>) and SN10TiO<sub>2</sub> (<bold>f</bold>)</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/11356_2022_20228_Fig7_HTML.png" id="MO8"/></fig></p><p id="Par40">By comparing the performance of the coatings containing the newly synthesized photocatalysts with that containing P25 NPs, it is clearly seen that the newly synthesized photocatalysts have the ability to oxidize NOx, although their efficiency was slightly lower than that of P25 NPs that exhibited a total NO conversion of ̴ 39%, while the photocatalyst SN10TiO<sub>2</sub> displayed a total NO conversion of ̴ 24%. However, the selectivity of NOx removed by these photocatalysts was quite similar to that of SP25. The low performance of the newly synthesized photocatalysts might be due to the clusters being aggregated and were not homogeneously distributed throughout the substrate’s surfaces. Moreover, these photocatalysts were covered by silica gel compared to those of P25 that exhibited a particulate surface and nanoparticles homogeneously dispersed on the entire substrate (see SEM images in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). It has been demonstrated that silica gel could absorb part of UV light (Yusof and Johan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014</xref>; Ghorbanpour et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2017</xref>), preventing the contact light photocatalysts, therefore, decreasing the efficiency of photocatalytic oxidation processes of NO. In addition, silica gel can also impede the adsorption of nitrogen oxide on the photocatalytic surfaces, which could be one of the reasons behind the lower photocatalytic efficiency.</p><p id="Par41">Concerning the influence of nitrogen, no significant difference has been observed between the undoped photocatalyst (STiO<sub>2</sub>) and those doped with nitrogen, for loading up to 8 M (SN8TiO<sub>2</sub> photocatalyst), in which the total of NO removed was between 14 and 16%, except for the photocatalyst with higher nitrogen loading SN10TiO<sub>2</sub> that revealed NO conversion somewhat higher (the amount of NO removed was up to 24%) compared to the previous photocatalysts (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Results of the test of NO photooxidation on the terated substrates</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left"><p>Sample</p></th><th align="left"><p>Gas supply vol. fraction (ppm)</p></th><th align="left"><p>% NO removed</p></th><th align="left"><p>% NO<sub>2</sub> generated</p></th><th align="left"><p>% NOx removed</p></th><th align="left"><p>NOx selectivity</p></th><th align="left"><p>NO<sub>2</sub> selectivity</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><p>Untreated</p></td><td align="left"><p>1165</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>-</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>-</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>-</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>-</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>-</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Matrix</p></td><td align="left"><p>1170</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>-</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>-</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>-</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>-</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>-</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>SP25</p></td><td align="left"><p>1136</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>38.98</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>14.28</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>24.70</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>63.36</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>36.63</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>STiO2</p></td><td align="left"><p>1176</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>15.23</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>7.12</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>8.11</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>53.23</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>46.76</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>SN3.33TiO2</p></td><td align="left"><p>1212</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>13.98</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>5.81</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>8.16</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>58.40</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>41.60</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>SN6.66TiO2</p></td><td align="left"><p>1152</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>15.95</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>6.82</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>9.14</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>57.27</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>42.72</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>SN8TiO2</p></td><td align="left"><p>1162</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>13.98</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>5.81</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>8.16</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>59.05</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>40.95</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>SN10TiO2</p></td><td align="left"><p>1188</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>23.81</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>8.64</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>15.16</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>63.70</p></td><td char="." align="char"><p>36.30</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par42">To better understand the photocatalytic behaviour of these photocatalysts and confirm the previous hypothesis, 1.5 g of the powdered xerogels was deposited in a holder of the same size as the substrates and pressed to form a homogeneous palette.

Moreover, the presence of nitrogen raised the selectivity of NOx removal, wherein the selectivity has increased from 66.19 to 69.27% for nitrogen doping concentration up to 8 M. Concurrently, these samples witnessed a decline in the selectivity of the generated NO<sub>2</sub>, indicating that most of the generated NO<sub>2</sub> has oxidized to HNO<sub>3</sub>. The greatest photocatalytic efficiency has been obtained by the sample SN10TiO<sub>2</sub>, which exhibited high NOx removal and lower selectivity of NO<sub>2</sub> generated (see Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). These results are a consequence of nitrogen doping that revealed a great increase in the visible range, thereby preventing the recombination of the photogenerated electron/hole resulting in a significant enhancement of the photocatalytic activity. These findings confirm the previous hypothesis and, at the same time, underline the photocatalytic efficiency of these photocatalysts towards NOx reduction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par44">In this investigation, the aim was to assess the self-cleaning and air de-polluting efficiency of the newly synthesized TiO<sub>2</sub> and N-TiO<sub>2</sub> clusters as coatings on Portland cement mortar substrates, wherein these clusters were integrated into silica matrix in order to ensure the good adherence and durability of the coatings onto the substrates. The characterization of the powdered xerogels showed that the doping with nitrogen significantly shifted the absorption towards the visible region. TEM characterization revealed that the clusters are distributed into silica matrix in the form of individual and aggregates; the latest was also observed on the surface of the substrates using SEM characterization. The adhesion test demonstrated that all the treatments were tightly adhered to Portland cement substrates, resulting in crack-free coatings.</p><p id="Par45">The effectiveness of these coatings was evaluated through MB degradation and the oxidation of NO for air de-pollution. The results revealed that the treatments showed high photocatalytic activity, and, their performance was raised with nitrogen doping, in which 85% of the dye was destroyed after 60 min of irradiation by the sample containing the greater amount of nitrogen doping (SN10TiO<sub>2</sub>). However, these coatings showed a slightly lower efficiency concerning the oxidation of NO compared to the coatings containing P25 NPs, which must be a consequence of two factors: (i) the presence of aggregates on the surface of the treatment and (ii) the silica gel being totally covering the clusters. The assessment of the powdered xerogels demonstrated that the newly synthesized photocatalysts are highly photoactive and that their effectiveness was similar to that of the xerogel containing P25. Moreover, the xerogel with high nitrogen loading showed somewhat higher efficiency than that containing P25 photocatalyst.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contribution</title><p>Conception and design of study: SK, MLAG, MJM; acquisition of data: SK; analysis and/or interpretation of data: SK; drafting the manuscript: SK; revising the manuscript critically for important intellectual content: SK, MLAG, MJM, MA; approval of the version of the manuscript to be published: SK, MLAG, MJM, MA.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Open Access funding provided thanks to the CRUE-CSIC agreement with Springer Nature.
