This rapid growth has led to concerns regarding the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of photovoltaics production. We present a review of 40 years of photovoltaics development, analysing the development of energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions associated with photovoltaics production. Here we show strong downward trends of environmental impact of photovoltaics production, following the experience curve law. For every doubling of installed photovoltaic capacity, energy use decreases by 13 and 12% and greenhouse gas footprints by 17 and 24%, for poly- and monocrystalline based photovoltaic systems, respectively. As a result, we show a break-even between the cumulative disadvantages and benefits of photovoltaics, for both energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, occurs between 1997 and 2018, depending on photovoltaic performance and model uncertainties.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">While the photovoltaic industry aims to achieve cleaner energy production, it consumes energy and emits greenhouse gases during production and deployment.

Over the whole life-cycle of a PV system, it pays back the energy invested and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions released during its production multiple times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. As PV systems operate over a period of up to 30 years, there is a significant time-lag between the investments, in terms of cumulative energy demand (CED) and GHG emissions, and the benefits obtained due to delivery of electricity and replacement of high-environmental impact electricity from fossil fuel sources. Coupling the rapid growth of PV with this context of upfront investments has led to some concerns, regarding the PV industry’s environmental sustainability. A fast growth of installed PV capacity could result in the creation of an energy sink, as the PV industry could embed energy in PV systems at a rate outpaced by these system’s ability to deliver it back. The same can be true for GHG emissions, when the production of PV systems releases more GHG emissions than the electricity produced with PV can offset by replacing more GHG intensive electricity. Although there is evidence that shows that CED and GHG emissions are correlated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, this is not necessarily the case.</p><p id="Par5">To avoid the creation of an energy and/or GHG sink, in general, the growth of the industry should be limited by 1/<italic>PBT</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, where <italic>PBT</italic> (payback time) is the time in which upfront investments in either CED or GHG emissions are paid back. However, energy and GHG sinks from periods of growth exceeding 1/<italic>PBT</italic> can be offset by decreased growth rates (or decreasing <italic>PBT</italic>) in later stages. Thus, the dynamics of growth need to be taken into account, rather than always aiming for a 1/<italic>PBT</italic> limited growth, as is discussed by Emmott <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> The concept of the PV industry as an energy sink, and more recently GHG sink is well known in the PV community. Grimmer <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> have been one of the first to address this issue in terms of energy, stating that to maximise the (positive) impact of solar technologies, they should have short energy payback time (EPBT) and long lifetime. When the growth of the PV industry started to accelerate, others indicated the necessity of strong decreases in energy payback time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Others have also analysed the relation between industry growth and EPBT and concluded that for mono-crystalline PV, a sustainable growth rate should be limited to around 7% (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>), however this result was based on a static measurement of the energy footprint of PV systems, and thus did not account for the decrease of the energy footprint of PV systems over time. More recent studies have also analysed GHG sinks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">Here, we review the development of environmental impact of production of PV systems over time, focusing on greenhouse gas emission and energy demand, and analysing only mono- and polycrystalline silicon based systems, as these cover over 90% of total installed capacity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. We gather results from a total of 40 life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies of PV systems (including inverters and support structure) conducted from 1976 to 2014, and couple these results to development of cumulative installed capacity figures, to show the development of energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions from PV production as a function of installed capacity, and to establish experience curves and learning rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> for these parameters. The models obtained are used in conjunction with scenarios on performance of PV in order to calculate net contributions of the PV industry as a whole, in terms of energy and greenhouse gas emissions, and to calculate when break-even between environmental investments and benefits occurs. A similar approach was used before by Dale and Benson<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, who focused on net electricity, and analysed studies in a narrower timeframe between 1990 and 2010. The authors concluded that cumulative break-even will occur somewhere before 2020. Other studies have focused on GHG emissions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> even taking into account the gradual effect of GHG emissions on radiative forcing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The latter two studies however focused on case studies or PV installation targets. Here, we want to combine approaches, by taking into account actual PV industry growth, and analysing the environmental impact using LCA studies from a wider time period. We show that there are strong downward trends for both energy demand and GHG emission from PV production, and that these trends follow the experience curve law. For every doubling of installed PV capacity, there is a decrease in energy use of 13% and 12% and in greenhouse gas footprint of production of 17 and 24%, for poly and monocrystalline based PV systems, respectively. As a result, there is a break-even since 2011 between the cumulative detriments and benefits of PV, in terms of both energy use and greenhouse gas emissions for a scenario that takes into account PV production location over time and a realistic PV performance scenario. Taking into account a worst-case PV performance scenario and model uncertainties, break even occurs in 2017 for net energy, and in 2018 for greenhouse gas emissions avoidance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Historical development of cost and environmental footprint</title><p id="Par7">The development of cost and environmental footprint over the period 1975–2015 is shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Within this period, with an installed capacity increase from less than 1 MW<sub>p</sub> to almost 180 GW<sub>p</sub>, prices dropped from almost 100 USD per W<sub>p</sub> to around 0.64–0.67 USD per W<sub>p</sub> at the end of 2014. Data for environmental footprint of PV systems do not go back that far, and furthermore show a less clear trend over time. Still, especially for energy pay-back time (which is calculated from reported system CED according to the procedure described in the Methods section) a clear decrease of environmental footprint over time can be observed. Energy pay-back times drop from around 5 years in 1992 to around just under 1 year for poly-Si and just over 1 year for mono-Si PV systems currently<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Greenhouse gas emissions from photovoltaics, expressed in grams of CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent per kilowatt-hour (gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq kWh<sup>−1</sup>), show large variations, even for studies analysing PV systems from the same year. This large variation is likely due to a variety of approaches in calculating the GHG emissions. More recent studies seem to use more congruent methods, resulting in a smaller variation of calculated GHG footprint. The current GHG footprint (harmonized data) is around 20 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq kWh<sup>−1</sup> for poly-Si PV systems, and around 25 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq kWh<sup>−1</sup> for mono-Si PV systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, down from 143 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq kWh<sup>−1</sup> for poly-Si in 1992 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>) and 409 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq kWh<sup>−1</sup> for mono-Si in 1986 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>). For determining the EPBT and the GHG footprint per kWh of produced electricity, the energy yield of the systems, and thus insolation and consequently location, are of great importance. The values here refer to standardised conditions: insolation of 1,700 kWh m<sup>−1</sup>y<sup>−1</sup> and a performance ratio (<italic>PR</italic>) of 0.75, based on methodology guidelines from<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Recent meta-analyses of LCA studies on crystalline PV systems established average values for environmental footprint of PV systems, and found energy payback times to be 3.1 and 4.1 years for poly and mono-Si, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, based on studies conducted between 2005 and 2013. In a recent study Ferroni and Hopkirk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> presented figures for energy return on energy invested that are equivalent to energy payback times that were much higher compared to what is found in other recent studies, or even much older studies. The study was not well received within the PV research community (M. Raugei, personal communication), and was found to severely lack in the applied methodology. For instance, the authors strongly overestimated the energy required for PV production, and at the same time underestimated the energy yield and lifetime of PV systems. Another meta-analysis found GHG emissions to be 44.3 and 79.5 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq kWh<sup>−1</sup> for poly and mono-Si, respectively, based on studies from 2004 to 2014 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>). Comparing this to the values mentioned earlier, that were reported for current PV systems by Wetzel<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, we see that the developments in the past decade have been so significant that the GHG footprint of state-of-the-art poly and monocrystalline silicon based PV systems is already 55 to 69% lower, respectively, compared to the averages of roughly the last decade (2004–2014) mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Development of cost and environmental impact of PV.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Development of average module selling price over time, in 2015 USD per W<sub>p</sub>.

A more even dispersement of studies over a longer period of time would likely result in higher fit quality and lower parameter error. We observe a stronger learning rate for mono- compared to polycrystalline silicon-based PV systems. This is likely due to the fact that mono-crystalline silicon PV module production is more energy intensive, and thus benefits not only from energy usage reduction, but also, more than poly-Si, from reduction of the GHG footprint of energy used as input in the production processes, that occurs independently over time as show in the data from the UN<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and the World Resources Institute (<ext-link xlink:href="http://cait.wri.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://cait.wri.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outlook for cost and environmental impact</title><p id="Par12">The future development of PV is very difficult to predict, as every year of development seems to exceed our expectations.

We have used this data to determine the net contribution of the PV industry in terms of CED and GHG emissions. Our analysis relies on a chain of (sometimes interdependent) data that can be difficult to accurately determine. For instance, development of cumulative installed PV capacity is not a measured quantity, but often rather estimated at country levels by performing surveys among select PV suppliers and extrapolating the resulting data. Some, but not all countries require registration of all installed PV systems and thus have more accurate data. The complete dataset is thus an aggregate of more and less accurate data.</p><p id="Par17">Another main factor is the performance of PV systems over time, which is used to determine both the energy production and GHG emission avoidance of the total installed PV capacity. The performance of PV systems can be measured directly, or inferred from high-level statistics databases showing both installed PV capacity and generated electricity, such as the EIA (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/browser/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/browser/</ext-link>) and UN databases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. The former are studies that result in detailed and accurate assessment of PV performance, but of a limited subset of PV systems. The latter can result in very unrealistic values for PV performance when the databases for PV capacity and PV electricity production are not aligned. For instance, for the year 1992 the calculated yield of PV systems from the UN database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> in the US is over 17,000 kWh k<inline-formula id="IEq4"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2016_Article_BFncomms13728_IEq4_HTML.gif"/></inline-formula>, while typical annual yields are currently in the range of 1,400–1,500 kWh k<inline-formula id="IEq5"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2016_Article_BFncomms13728_IEq5_HTML.gif"/></inline-formula>. Furthermore, in many cases PV electricity production is estimated from installed capacity figures by means of an estimate of the specific yield of PV capacity, rather than measured from actual production. As mentioned in the Methods section, this makes it difficult to ascertain the accuracy of the values for all countries and years. To address these issues we have analysed two performance scenarios (see Methods section): a worst-case and a realistic case. In <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> we show a comparison between the different datasets for electricity production, installed capacity and inferred global average specific yield of PV capacity (kWh k<inline-formula id="IEq6"><inline-graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2016_Article_BFncomms13728_IEq6_HTML.gif"/></inline-formula>). Focusing on electricity production (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>) we see that although the trends look very similar for the period between 1997 and 2014, our ‘Increasing <italic>PR</italic>’ scenario shows somewhat higher electricity production in the last years compared to the two databases, while the ‘Low <italic>PR</italic>’ scenario shows lower electricity production. The higher electricity production from the ‘Increasing <italic>PR</italic>’ scenario is partly due to the fact that the installed capacity numbers in both the EIA and UN databases are lower, compared to the data we use in this study (shown in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Examining the yield inferred from the different datasources (<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6c</xref>) we see that especially in the years before 2005 the EIA database but especially the UN database data results in unrealistically high average yield numbers. Furthermore it is shown that the time-range of the data is insufficient to cover the whole time horizon of our study. Taking into account the data from <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6a</xref>, we argue that it is likely that the ‘Increasing <italic>PR</italic>’ and ‘Low <italic>PR</italic>’ scenarios cover a range of results that includes those that would be obtained by using one or both of the statistics databases.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Comparison of different PV performance data sources.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Comparison of the electricity generation as estimated by different sources of data: EIA database (<ext-link xlink:href="http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/browser/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/browser/</ext-link>), UN database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> and ‘Increasing <italic>PR</italic>’ and ‘Low <italic>PR</italic>’ scenarios used in this study.

For PV production, we assumed the use of average grid mixes of the producing countries. We have also assumed that electricity from PV replaced the average grid electricity mix. We deem this to be a conservative estimate, as new PV capacity (and other renewable electricity sources) is more likely to replace older, fossil fuelled power plants as they are decommissioned, mainly coal fired power plants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, and thus avoided emissions could be larger. On the other hand, considering the timing of electricity production from PV, it could also replace electricity from more flexible sources of generation than baseline coal-fired power plants, such as gas fired power plants. As these are also often fossil fuel powered, especially in the major PV markets, we assume that using the grid average is a reasonable approximation. As the share of PV and other renewables in the electricity mix increases, the average grid GHG emission factor will decrease, and as a result, the GHG emission avoidance also decreases. Finally, increasing amounts of intermittent electricity sources like PV will require either storage or back-up capacity. In the absence of sufficient storage capacity, back-up power plants, possibly fossil-fuel fired, might limit net GHG emission avoidance. Furthermore, storage options will contribute to the environmental footprint of PV electricity as their production of course requires the input of energy and materials, but they will decrease the requirement for back-up generation.</p><p id="Par19">Our results show that from 1975 onwards, there are clear trends in reduction of cost, CED, and GHG emissions, concurrently with a rapid growth of installed PV capacity. While cost decreases with 20.1% for each doubling in capacity, CED decreases with 11.9–12.6% and GHG emissions with 16.5–23.6%. The rapid growth of the PV industry has resulted in the creation of a temporary net primary energy sink, as well as it being a temporary net emitter of GHG emissions. However, because of the trend of decreasing environmental footprint concurrent with the growth of CIPC, according to the ‘Increasing <italic>PR</italic>’ scenario, this debt was likely already repaid in 2011 for both CED and GHG emissions. For the worst case scenario, which is the ‘Low <italic>PR</italic>’ scenario, the 95% confidence interval shows break-even during 2017 for CED and 2018 for GHG emissions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data for PV market development and environmental footprint of PV production</title><p id="Par20">For the study conducted here we needed several different sources of data: <bold>1</bold>) historical data on the development of cumulative installed PV capacity (CIPC) including PV technology market shares, <bold>2</bold>) PV cost data for the period under investigation, <bold>3</bold>) forecast of the development of CIPC and PV technology market shares, <bold>4</bold>) life-cycle assessment (LCA) results for PV for the period studied.</p><p id="Par21">Historical data for CIPC was obtained mainly from the IEA PVPS reports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, reports from SolarPowerEurope (formerly EPIA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> and other literature data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

See also equations (1 and 2). The active capacity was calculated by correcting the cumulative installed capacity figures with an assumed degradation rate of 0.7% per year and a lifetime of 25 years.</p><p id="Par41">The <italic>PR</italic> is an important metric relating the actual yield of a PV system to the theoretical yield calculated with just the annual insolation and the systems’ rated (peak) power. It takes into account loss factors like higher operating temperatures, inverter and cabling losses, and other losses such as due to soiling, periods of outages, and suboptimal orientation. There likely is a trend of <italic>PR</italic> versus time, as increasing knowledge about and monitoring of PV performance, as well as improved system design and inverter efficiencies have led to a increase in system yields, as shown in<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>. Accurate data on the actual performance of CIPC is however practically non-existent. There are in general two approaches in determining the actual <italic>PR</italic> of CIPC figure: a top-down analysis combining installed capacity figures with electricity production figures for PV installations, and a bottom-up, detailed analysis of PV performance using dedicated test facilities or a limited number of PV systems. Data for the former approach is readily available, but lacks in geographical and temporal scope. For instance, statistics from both the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA, <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/browser/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.eia.gov/beta/international/browser/</ext-link>) and the UN statistics database<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> are insufficient to result in timeseries, from 1975 to now, of country-specific <italic>PR</italic> values, or other metrics that allow us to calculate historical energy generation from CIPC. The data goes back only to 1990, and for most countries, data is only available from 2010 onwards. Furthermore, especially for the older data, accuracy seems to be very low as unrealistic yield figures are obtained especially from the UN database (see also the Discussion section). Bottom-up studies result in very reasonable <italic>PR</italic> figures (around 75–85%) but their scope is even more limited (in terms of period and geography). More recently, due to improved output monitoring of PV systems (e.g., by embedded monitoring solutions in PV inverters) the amount of available data has increased and studies are published on the performance of large numbers of privately owned PV systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, the results from these studies are also (still) very limited in geographical but especially temporal scope, due to unavailability of older data. As <italic>PR</italic> is a very significant factor in determining annual yields, we have analysed two separate scenarios for the development of <italic>PR</italic> over time, which we consider represent a worst-case and more-likely scenario:</p><p id="Par42">· A constant low-<italic>PR</italic> scenario with a <italic>PR</italic> of 0.5 based on the lowest estimate mentioned in literature referring to general PV performance.</p><p id="Par43">· A increasing <italic>PR</italic> scenario, with <italic>PR</italic> increasing linearly with respect to time from 0.5 in 1975 to a maximum of 0.8 for the years 2015 and later, for all countries.</p><p id="Par44">Aside from a trend in time for PR, there is also a variation of PR per location, as ambient temperature, but also spectral variations have effect on the performance of PV systems. Statistics on the actual performance of systems in all countries analysed, for the whole period studied, are however much too limited or inaccurate. Therefore we have assumed an equal <italic>PR</italic> for all locations.</p><p id="Par45">Insolation data (<italic>H</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub>) was taken from<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>. We opted to use data that gives population-density weighted country insolation for surfaces with a fixed tilt and optimal orientation.We thus assume most systems to be installed in or near population centra, as is common at least in large parts of Europe. For some locations this might not be accurate. For instance, in the USA, large PV installations are built at locations in the South-West of the country, while population centres can be more confined to lower irradiance area’s like the ‘Boston-Washington Corridor’, which has a population of almost 50 million, or 15.4% of the total US population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Monte Carlo analysis</title><p id="Par46">The parameters of the nonlinear models fitted to the data (<italic>EI</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> and <italic>l</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> in equation (6)) have a certain standard error as a result of deviation of the data from the fitted model, which are established by the fitting tool by determining the covariance of the fit parameters. We use Monte Carlo simulation to analyse the effect of these fit errors on our results. For each calculation, we generated 10,000 random samples of the parameters from a normal distribution for which the mean is the fitted parameter value and the standard deviation is the calculated error in the parameter. We then recalculated the results using these samples, and present the intervals that cover the range from 2.5<sup>th</sup> percentile to the 97.5<sup>th</sup> percentile of the results, e.g., a 95% confidence interval around the main result.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Data availability</title><p id="Par47">The authors declare that all the data supporting the findings of this study are available within the article and its <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM2016">Supplementary Information</xref> files and from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Additional information</title><p id="Par48"><bold>How to cite this article:</bold> Louwen, A. <italic>et al</italic>.
