id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par20">Anaerobic digestion (AD) is one of the core technologies contributing to the transition from a fossil fuel-based economy to a more renewable energy-based circular economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This technology aims to valorize organic residues into an energetic biogas and a digestate that could be used as fertilizer or soil amendment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The energy content of the biogas is proportional to the CH<sub>4</sub> content. Usually, the AD biogas contains between 40–75% CH<sub>4</sub> and 25–60% CO<sub>2</sub>, besides other components in minor quantities such as H<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, H<sub>2</sub>O and others trace organic and inorganic components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Because of the presence of CO<sub>2</sub>, the biogas has a lower calorific value than natural gas, i.e. 21.5 MJ/Nm<sup>3</sup> to 35.8 MJ/Nm<sup>3</sup>, respectively, and therefore, biogas cannot be directly injected into the natural gas grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The minimal purity of CH<sub>4</sub> in the natural gas grid must be up to 95%, depending on the countries legislations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, the CH<sub>4</sub> content in biogas needs to be upgraded prior to be injected into the natural gas grid, used as vehicle fuel or for energy storage.</p><p id="Par21">In order to improve the CH<sub>4</sub> content in biogas, several purification technologies can be used, and the valorization of the CO<sub>2</sub> through biological technologies has been recently proposed. In a recent review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], several biogas upgrading methods were described and discussed. The biological upgrading methods are distinguished as chemoautotrophic or photosynthetic processes. The ex-situ and in-situ biomethanation processes correspond to the chemoautotrophic methods relying on the AD process. In both biomethanation processes, H<sub>2</sub> is injected into an anaerobic digester in order to upgrade the CH<sub>4</sub> content by reducing the CO<sub>2</sub>. For the ex-situ biomethanation process, an additional bioreactor, physically separated from the anaerobic digester, is fed with H<sub>2</sub> and biogas, while for the in-situ biomethanation process, the H<sub>2</sub> is directly injected into the anaerobic digester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Both processes are based on the capacity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens to use external H<sub>2</sub> as electron donor for the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> into CH<sub>4</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], following the reaction:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ1_Math"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="0.333333em"/><mml:mtext>H</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="0.333333em"/><mml:mtext>CO</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">→</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="0.333333em"/><mml:mtext>CH</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="0.333333em"/><mml:mtext>2 H</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>O</mml:mtext><mml:mspace width="0.333333em"/></mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>G</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>∘</mml:mo></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="0.166667em"/><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>130.7</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="0.333333em"/><mml:mtext>KJ</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">/</mml:mo><mml:mtext>mol</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

In this way, H<sub>2</sub> can be generated by water hydrolysis using the energy surplus of wind and solar power plants. However, these renewable power plants produce energy in a fluctuant way, which could lead to imbalance between energy production and the energy demand. Even though H<sub>2</sub> can also be stored or used as vehicle fuel, the current technologies are today too expensive and technically challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Therefore, an alternative is to transform H<sub>2</sub> into CH<sub>4</sub>, for which storage and transportation are cheaper and, CH<sub>4</sub> can also be used as vehicle fuel or injected into the gas grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This concept is named Power-to-Gas (PtG) and fulfils the requirement of linking electrical power and gas-grid networks in an environmentally friendly way.</p><p id="Par23">In this context, both, ex-situ and in-situ biomethanation are suitable processes to be applied to purify biogas produced in AD. However, some challenges need to be addressed prior to develop this technology at industrial scale. One of the limitations concerns the increase of the H<sub>2</sub> partial pressure within the digester that can alter the AD metabolic equilibrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The AD process is composed of 4 steps (hydrolysis, acidogenesis, acetogenesis and methanogenesis) which are carried on by different microbial groups that perform these reactions in a very coordinated way. H<sub>2</sub> is an intermediate during the AD, whose partial pressure, mainly affects the acetogenesis step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. During acetogenesis, the volatile fatty acids (VFA) that were formed during the hydrolysis step and the acidogenesis step, are transformed into acetate, H<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This step is carried out by syntrophic microorganisms, which are thermodynamically constrained by the H<sub>2</sub> partial pressure, which it must be kept under 10<sup>−4</sup> atm to allow VFA degradation and methanogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A higher H<sub>2</sub> partial pressure leads to VFA accumulation in the media, which further inhibits the methanogenic archaeal populations. Nonetheless, the effect of the H<sub>2</sub> injection over the microbial community is still not very well understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Mulat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and Wahid et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] have reported the inhibition of methane production due to VFA accumulation, caused by H<sub>2</sub> injection. Moreover, Cazier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] reported an inhibitory effect due to a high H<sub>2</sub> partial pressure in the methanogens community, even though the VFA accumulation and pH were not at inhibitory levels. In contrast, in the work of Bassani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], no hydrolysis inhibition or VFA accumulation was reported after an H<sub>2</sub> addition and pH increase. Agnesseens et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] detected a transient accumulation of acetate, which was overcome after several H<sub>2</sub> injections by a microbial adaptation to high H<sub>2</sub> partial pressure. Therefore, each microbial community configuration can adapt differently to the H<sub>2</sub> partial pressure. A better understanding of the microbial community characteristics that can improve CH<sub>4</sub> production under ex-situ and in-situ biomethanation conditions is a key step prior to process optimization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This work aims to provide new insights on the influence of the inoculum origin on biomethanation performances, and more particularly on the response of indigenous microbial communities facing high H<sub>2</sub> partial pressures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Metabolic patterns production during ex-situ and in-situ biomethanation</title><p id="Par24">Seven microbial inocula coming from different configurations of industrial digestion facilities, and treating diverse types of substrates were inoculated into semi-continuously fed reactors (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Cluster 3 represents the reactors that accumulated mostly VFA. These reactors were inoculated with the other four inocula used for this experiment (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). One set of reactors was inoculated with the liquid fraction of the first-step reactor from a two-step anaerobic digestion process treating farm waste (principally poultry slurry, food waste and some green waste) (inoculum MFW1), while another set of reactors was inoculated with the liquid fraction of the second-step reactor of the same process (inoculum MFW2). The third set of reactors belonging to cluster 3 was inoculated with the liquid fraction of an anaerobic digester treating food waste (inoculum FW), while the fourth set of reactors belonging to this group was inoculated with an aerobic sludge from a sewage waste water treatment plant (WWTP) (inoculum AeS). A statistically significant difference was confirmed between the clusters regarding their methane production after performing a Kruskal–Wallis test, followed by a Wilcoxon’s test, in which the obtained <italic>p</italic>-values were adjusted with the Bonferroni’s correction method. However, regarding the VFA production only cluster 3 was statistically different from the others (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">3</xref>). For the reactors inoculated with MFW1, MFW2 and FW, acetate represented the main accumulated VFA (93%, 94% and 95% in average from the total produced VFA for the reactors inoculated with MFW1, MFW2 and FW, respectively), while the rest of VFA was propionate and traces of butyrate, isobutyrate and isovalerate. Such acetate accumulation is consistent with previous biomethanation performances reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. On the contrary, the reactors inoculated with AeS produced almost the same proportion of acetate (46%) and butyrate (39%) in average from the total produced VFA. A higher proportion of propionate (10%) was also observed, in comparison with the reactors inoculated with MFW1 (3%), MFW2 (4%) and FW (2%). Some traces of isobutyrate and isovalerate were detected in the reactors inoculated with AeS and fed with glucose and H<sub>2</sub>. In the reactors inoculated with AeS, H<sub>2</sub> was hardly consumed and the accumulated VFA were likely produced from the organic substrate consumption, leading to the production of other VFA different from acetate. Besides, as these reactors had the lowest H<sub>2</sub> consumption, H<sub>2</sub> partial pressure was kept constantly high, likely inhibiting the VFA consumption by the syntrophic microorganisms. Regarding the inoculum AeS, another cluster inside cluster 3 could be detected regarding the accumulation of butyrate and a lower quantity of CH<sub>4</sub> produced. However, when performing a cluster analysis using the k-means algorithm with <italic>k</italic> = 4, cluster 3 was divided into two groups regarding the amount of total VFA produced: one group containing the ex-situ biomethanation reactors inoculated with MFW1, MFW2, FW and the ex situ and in situ biomethanation reactors inoculated with AeS. While, the other group was formed by the in-situ biomethanation reactors inoculated with MFW1, MFW2 and FW. Nevertheless, the distribution of the groups is more likely related to the amount of COD received by the reactors than with the actual distribution of the metabolite patterns.</p><p id="Par29">For the reactors belonging to cluster 3, a lower quantity of H<sub>2</sub> was consumed, in comparison with the reactors that produced mostly CH<sub>4</sub> (clusters 1 and 2). It is likely than in these reactors (cluster 3), when CO<sub>2</sub> was available, some of it and some of the added H<sub>2</sub> were transformed into CH<sub>4</sub> or acetate by the hydrogenotrophic methanogens or homoacetogens, respectively. As a consequence of the CO<sub>2</sub> depletion, H<sub>2</sub> started to accumulate in the head-space, likely leading to the accumulation of the VFA coming from the degradation of the remaining organic matter in the inocula, for the ex-situ biomethanation reactors or from glucose degradation in the case of the in-situ biomethanation reactors. According to the observations made by Cazier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], CO<sub>2</sub> depletion led to H<sub>2</sub> and VFA accumulation inducing subsequently the inhibition of syntrophic interactions, and impeding more CO<sub>2</sub> formation and higher inhibition. In some of the reactors from cluster 3 (inoculated with MFW1, MFW2 and FW) due to H<sub>2</sub> addition and concomitant CO<sub>2</sub> depletion, the final pH was over 8.5, which may have contributed to inhibit the methanogens, as already reported in other ex-situ and in-situ biomethanation works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The high accumulation of acetate in these reactors was likely due to the prevalence of homoacetogens over hydrogenotrophic methanogens as more acetate than methane was produced. Agneessens et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] reported that homoacetogens could be more important than hydrogenotrophic methanogens in a low-CO<sub>2</sub> environment due to their higher resistance to high pH.</p><p id="Par30">The in-situ biomethanation reactors have received a higher amount of substrates (as H<sub>2</sub> and glucose were provided) than the ex-situ biomethanation reactors (that received only H<sub>2</sub>), likely contributing to a higher production of metabolites as observed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, although the metabolite pattern distribution between in-situ and ex-situ biomethanation reactors was similar.</p><p id="Par31">In the reactors belonging to cluster 1 and 2 (reactors inoculated with BM, GS and AnS) that mostly produced CH<sub>4</sub>, lower accumulation of VFA and better H<sub>2</sub> assimilation were observed.

However, acetate production from the reactors in cluster 3, and more particularly the ones inoculated with MFW1, MFW2, FW did positively correlate with H<sub>2</sub> consumption (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.7615), indicating that at least some of the acetate production came from homoacetogenesis (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">4</xref>).

These works have reached to the conclusion that a thermophilic operation was more efficient than a mesophilic operation due to their higher methane productivity.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The reactors inoculated with MFW1 and MFW2 (belonging to cluster 3) were dominated by <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> sp. at <italic>t</italic><sub>0</sub>, although acetate accumulated and the <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> sp. population decreased by the end of the experiment. It is not completely clear why <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> sp. was negatively affected in these reactors. It is possible that the faster CO<sub>2</sub> depletion due to the H<sub>2</sub> addition in the reactors inoculated with MFW1 and MFW2 (clusters 3) than in the reactors inoculated with BM (cluster 1) have led to the inhibition of <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> sp. Agneessens et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and Mulat et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], have attributed such inhibition to low CO<sub>2</sub> concentration and high H<sub>2</sub> partial pressure. The loss of <italic>Methanosarcina</italic> sp. was probably the cause of acetate accumulation and low CH<sub>4</sub> production.</p><p id="Par43">The <italic>Archaea/Bacteria</italic> ratio was calculated for all reactors. The reactors belonging to the clusters 1 and 2, that grouped the reactors that have produced mostly methane (inoculated with AnS, GS, BM) had a significantly higher proportion in <italic>Archaea</italic> at t<sub>0</sub> (1:21, 1:2.5 and 1:29, respectively), while the other reactors had ratio approximately lower than 1:200 (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Moreover, in inocula BM (cluster 1) and GS (cluster 2) a higher amount of hydrogenotrophic methanogens (one order of magnitude higher) than homoacetogens was detected (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Hence, the hydrogenotrophic methanogens were the major hydrogen-utilizing microorganisms in these inocula. Lay et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] reported that the amount of homoacetogens and hydrogenotrophic methanogens in batch co-cultures had an impact in the H<sub>2</sub> consumption and the favoured pathway to form CH<sub>4</sub>. Such high amount of hydrogenotrophic methanogens might have contributed, at a local scale, to the rapid consumption of H<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, if considering the fact that H<sub>2</sub> has a low solubility in the liquid media, this could have helped to the decreasing distribution of the solubilized H<sub>2</sub> from the gas–liquid interphase to the liquid media and therefore, leaving zones in the liquid media where the H<sub>2</sub> partial pressure was low enough to allow syntrophic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Through these syntrophic microorganisms removing efficiently the VFA, VFA accumulation was avoided and CH<sub>4</sub> production was enhanced. Nonetheless, the inoculum AnS had a higher amount of homoacetogens than hydrogenotrophic methanogens, although in the same magnitude order. Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] reported that homoacetogens had a lower H<sub>2</sub> conversion rate than hydrogenotrophic methanogens, meaning that, under same proportions, hydrogenotrophic methanogens will contribute in higher amount to H<sub>2</sub> consumption than homoacetogens. Since inocula AnS showed the highest amount of <italic>Methanosaeta</italic> sp. among all the inocula, some of the produced methane was likely produced though the homoacetogenic pathway followed by acetotrophic methanogenesis.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The initial concentration of Bacteria and Archaea (number of copies of the 16S RNA from Bacteria or Archaea gene, respectively, per mL of sample), the initial concentration of homoacetogens (number of copies of the FTHFS gene/mL sample), the initial number of hydrogenotrophic methanogens (number of copies of the 16S archaea gene/mL sample*relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the inocula) and the initial number of acetotrophic methanogens (number of copies of the 16S archaea gene/mL sample*relative abundance of acetotrophic methanogens in the inocula) are shown.

Not only the presence of these initial characteristics but also the persistence of them can lead to the production of CH<sub>4</sub> or the accumulation of VFA, as the possibility of the microbial communities to cope with perturbations is related to the presence of specific tolerant species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. A Pearson correlation analysis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>) was performed in order to elucidate which features of the inocula could have impacted the final biomethanation performances. To perform the correlation analysis, several features of the inocula were selected. The initial and final amounts of archaea in the inocula were taken into account for this analysis because the reactors grouped in clusters 1 and 2 were inoculated with the inocula that presented higher amounts of archaea in their community. The amount of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and homoacetogens in the inocula likely influenced the predominant metabolite pathway in the microbial community as they are H<sub>2</sub>-consumer microorganisms and their amount in the microbial communities was reported to determine which microorganisms is the principal H<sub>2</sub> consumer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Hence, their amount and ratio in the inocula and in the final microbial communities of the reactors were taken into account for the analysis.

The initial or final amount of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and homoacetogens did not correlate with H<sub>2</sub> consumption, nor with CH<sub>4</sub> production or VFA accumulation, respectively. Interestingly, the ratio homoacetogens to hydrogenotrophic methanogens (HA/HM) in the initial inocula anti-correlated with the CH<sub>4</sub> production and H<sub>2</sub> consumption. Meanwhile, the final HA/HM ratio positively correlated to VFA accumulation. Therefore, a higher amount of hydrogenotrophic methanogens than homoacetogens probably favoured H<sub>2</sub> consumption and methane production. While a higher amount of homoacetogens vs hydrogenotrophic methanogens was correlated with the accumulation of VFA and with the amount of <italic>Clostridia</italic> at the beginning and at the end of the operation. Likely, the homoacetogens present in the reactors belong to the class <italic>Clostridia</italic>. In addition, the amount of acetotrophic methanogens in the initial inocula as well as at the end of operation correlated with methane production and H<sub>2</sub> consumption and anti-correlated with VFA accumulation, confirming that the persistence of this group of microorganisms is crucial to avoid VFA accumulation.</p><p id="Par46">Even though <italic>Methanobacterium</italic> sp. was one of the most abundant methanogen in all reactors, the increase in its abundance did not correlate to CH<sub>4</sub> production or H<sub>2</sub> consumption.
