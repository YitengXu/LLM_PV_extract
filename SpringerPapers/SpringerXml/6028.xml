These materials possess fascinating properties in terms of predesignable structure, controllable morphology, and manageable functionality which distinguished them from other polymers. COFs have also high chemical and physical stability, high surface area, and high adsorption capacity that these attributes make them excellent candidates for use in different fields. However, there are several approaches for the synthesis of COFs among which room-temperature synthesis approach is a green, versatile, and popular method which is due to its exceptional properties including simplicity, easy operation, and cost-effectiveness. In this regard, this review article presents a comprehensive view of the synthesis of COFs at room temperature as well as their applications, their limitations, and also their future

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Generally, the design and synthesis of new materials have always been welcomed by researchers. In the meantime, chemists have shown great interest in the synthesis of porous and crystalline structures using chemistry science [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Porous and crystalline materials have ordered structure and also have separate molecular space which can interact with other molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In this regard, Yaghi et al. introduced porous and crystalline materials, namely covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for the first time in 2005, which were formed based on the condensation reaction between two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) organic building monomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. COFs contain elements like H, B, C, N, and O which are connected together by covalent interactions (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. COFs have designable and controllable structures that introduce them as porous materials. Also, COFs have a lower density. In this regard, COFs keep their crystalline and ordered structure in different media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This high stability of COFs is related to the presence of strong covalent interactions. On the one hand, COFs are porous materials with the high surface area and subsequently high adsorption capacity. On the other hand, the presence of hydrogen bonding and <italic>Ï</italic>â<italic>Ï</italic> interactions in COFs improves the interactions and adsorption capacity of COFs. Hence, the flexible structure, high stability, and also high adsorption capacity make COFs as amazing platforms for use in different fields including catalysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], semiconductors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], sensors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], pollutant treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], separation science [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and other applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. After the year 2007 that Yaghi and co-workers as pioneers in the synthesis of COFs introduced the first COFs, many efforts have been done for the preparation of different COFs and their applications. These studies have been applied to different synthesis approaches that have both advantages and disadvantages. Up to date, this is the first review for the investigation of room-temperature synthesis of COFs and their applications. So, in this review, we focused on the preparation of a comprehensive article for the synthesized COFs at room temperature, their application, their limitations, and also their future perspectives.

The structure and morphology of prepared COFs can change by changing effective parameters on synthesis conditions like a solvent, temperature, catalyst, and so on. In this regard, different synthesis approaches have been applied for the fabrication of COFs. These methods are including solvothermal, ionothermal, microwave, sonochemical, mechanochemical, light-promoted, and room-temperature preparation methods. In the following, we will discuss each method separately.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Solvothermal method</title><p id="Par4">In the solvothermal method, the COFs are prepared using temperature by mixing the building monomer in the autoclave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In this method, the reaction conditions are highly dependent on the solubility and reactivity of building monomers and the reversibility of the reactions. Different parameters like time, temperature, solvent, and also the concentration of the applied catalyst are important in the morphology and structure of the prepared COF. It is worth mentioning that using the solvothermal method, some COFs can be synthesized on a large scale. The first 2D COFs were synthesized by the solvothermal method by Kaderi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In their study, COFs were synthesized at 120Â Â°C for 72Â h using dioxane and mesitylene as solvents. The pore sizes of the prepared COFs were in the range of 6â12 angstrom.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Ionothermal method</title><p id="Par5">In an ionothermal method, ionic liquids or molten salts act as a solvent or catalyst. The reaction is performed at a high temperature. The most applied monomers in an ionothermal method are amorphous materials and lack long-range molecular orderings. The application of ionic liquids for the synthesis of COFs makes these methods simple, mild, and green approaches. The first COF was prepared using ionothermal method by Bojdys et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Microwave method</title><p id="Par6">In the microwave synthesis method, the synthesis of COFs is done using microwaves as an alternative energy source. Compared to solvothermal and ionothermal methods, microwave synthesis method needs lower reaction time and also forms the cleaner products. Also, in microwaves methods, we can follow the synthesis progress visually and can control the reaction temperature and pressure simultaneously. A property of the microwave solvent extraction method is that it could remove oligomers in the COFs more efficiently and the resulting COFs possess better porosity. Recently, Ji et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] applied a rapid microwave synthesis approach for the fabrication of dioxin-linked COF for efficient microextraction of perfluorinated alkyl substances from water. The synthesis method is shown in Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. The prepared COF showed a high surface area (1254Â m<sup>2</sup>Â g<sup>â1</sup>). Also, the synthesized COF had high chemical stability in different solvents. The thermal stability of fabricated COF represented its good thermal stability up to 370Â Â°C.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The preparation of COF by microwave method.

This method is fast and cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Also, the effect of temperature and sonication waves as two main factors can investigate concurrently on the structure and morphology of the prepared COF. Most importantly, we can consider this method as a green method. The sonication waves not only can accelerate the desolvation of building monomer but also can introduce bubbles which can affect the prepared cavities in the structure of COF. Oliveira and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] synthesized COF thin film using ultrasound irradiation. The speed of production of bubbles can affect the morphology of the prepared COF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Mechanochemical method</title><p id="Par8">One of the modern methods for the preparation of COF is a mechanochemical method. This method is simple, fast, solvent-free, and room temperature which is done only by grounding the pre-resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The mechanochemical method is simple, economical, and environmental which can address the limitations of the other methods. In this regard, Biswal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] fabricated a COF by mechanochemical method (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

Based on the applied method, the kind of prepared COF and also the structure and morphology of prepared COF are different. Some of these methods are faced with main drawbacks in terms of needing high temperature and most importantly physical and chemical stable building monomers at high temperature. Some of them also need expensive equipment for the preparation of COFs. These drawbacks have cheered researchers to use alternative methods for COFs fabrication.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Room temperature synthesis of COFs</title><p id="Par11">One of the other main methods for the fabrication of COFs is the room-temperature method. Compared to other mentioned methods, the room-temperature method has exceptional properties in terms of simplicity and ease of operation which does not need temperature.</p><p id="Par12">Most of the applied building monomers are not stable at high temperature that this issue enhances the importance of the application of room-temperature method for the preparation of COFs. In addition, the prepared COF at room temperature does not need gas protection step. Also, using temperature especially high-temperature synthesis approaches can be dangerous and hazardous since the nature of some of the used materials can change with changing temperature and produce side materials that can change the morphology of the prepared COF and subsequently decreases the stability of the prepared COF. In addition, the room-temperature synthesis approaches can be considered as green methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Most of the synthesized COFs are time-consuming. Using the room-temperature method, the synthesis of COFs is more controllable. In spite of simplicity, the prepared COF at room-temperature methods shows high stability in harsh media and also has a high surface area and adsorption capacity.</p><p id="Par14">Other advantages of the room-temperature synthesis approach are its applicability for applying on a large scale as a facile and effective synthetic method. The other significant point for using room-temperature synthesis method is that natural materials like biomolecules can also use as building blocks that are unstable in higher temperatures. (Based on the nature of the proposed biomolecule, the temperature is different.)</p><p id="Par15">So, using room-temperature method can able us to applyÂ natural materials like biomolecules whichÂ act as building blocks. One of the main problems in the synthesis of COFs is their fabrication using high-speed methods that not only introduce high crystallinity and porous structure but also have high stability. Although high-speed methods cannot introduce the mentioned properties, they are more suitable for large-scale production and also commercial and practical applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Up to now, between different applied room-temperature methods, steam-assisted conversion (SAC) introduces a high-speed and fast approach for the synthesis of different kinds of COFs with unique properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">In this regard, a room-temperature COF was synthesized using a solutionâsuspension approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In this method, 1,3,5-triformylbenzene and p-phenylenediamine were dissolved in dioxane at room temperature. Then, acetic acid was added as a catalyst that changed the color of mixture to yellow. The mixture was kept for 3Â days at room temperature. The achieved COF showed a good crystalline structure. The surface area of prepared COFs was achieved to be 410â1537Â m<sup>2</sup>Â g<sup>â1</sup> with a pore size distribution of 2â50Â nm. The main point about this study is the preparation of COFs using a continuous flow synthesis approach (Fig.Â <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).

One of the effective factors is the applied building blocks. The applied building blocks for the preparation of COFs have different sizes and different properties in terms of solubility and stability. In this regard, according to kind of the applied building blocks, the fabricated COFs have different sizes. There are different building blocks for the synthesis of COFs which include boroxine linkage, boronate ester, borosilicate, triazine, imine, hydrazine, borazine, squaraine, azine, phenazine, imide, double stage, spiroborate, Câ=âC, amide, hypercoordinate silicon, urea, and 1,4-dioxin linkages. The other main factor on the synthesis of COFs is the time of reaction. The formation of COFs is based on the interaction of building blocks. To this end, changing reaction time can change the size and morphology of the prepared COF. The other main factor in the synthesis of COFs is applied solvents and catalysts. The change of solvent and catalyst can change the structure of prepared COF. The applied catalyst accelerates the formation of COFs which can directly change the structure of fabricated COF. Since the effect of these factors is very important, their optimization seems to be vital. In this regard, in most studies, the effect of these factors has been optimized.

The stability of COFs is mostly related to the structures of knots, edges, and linkages. The strength of chemical bonds determines the overall chemical stability of COFs; in particular, the linkages are key to chemical stability. For example, boroxine- or boronate ester-linked COFs are not stable under humid or protic conditions. Unlike the boronate ester and boroxine-linked COFs, most nitrogen-based COFs, including imine, azine, hydrazone, squaraine, phenazine, imide, and triazine-linked COFs, exhibit remarkable hydrolytic stability. Compared with other nitrogen-based linkages, such as imine, azine, and hydrazine linkages, CS-COF and CTFs exhibit exceptional chemical stability owing to the formation of ring-fused phenazine and triazine units, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Application</title><p id="Par33">One of the main area for application of COFs is their use in separation science for the determination of different compounds from the different matrix samples.

id="Par63">Although the room-temperature synthesis method has amazing properties, it is faced with the main drawbacks. The building monomers play the most important role in the synthesis of COFs since they can control the structure and morphology of the prepared COFs. Using a room-temperature synthesis approach limits us to fabricate special kinds of COFs. This is due to the fact that most of the building monomers are not soluble at room temperature and they need temperature especially high temperature for preparation. In this regard, using a room-temperature method, it is impossible for us to fabricate different kinds of COFs. Using temperature, we can change the nature of building monomers and introduce new monomers. One of the main areas about application of COFs is their combination with other materials like nanoparticles, metalâorganic frameworks (MOFs), and molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). The combination of COFs with other materials can improve their properties and also their application. But, most of nanoparticles, MOFs, and MIPs need temperature for synthesis. Indeed, temperature plays important role in synthesis of these materials. For example, the MIPs which have fabricated using radical polymerization need temperature for activation of the initiator. Or, some materials and reagents for synthesis of MOFs and MIPs need temperature to dissolve. These drawbacks limit the application of room-temperature synthesis of COFs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Future and perspectives</title><p id="Par64">One of the main aspects in synthesis methods is the synthesis and using of selective sorbent. Indeed, the applied sorbents must have not only stability, high surface area, and high adsorption capacity but also selectivity. This fact encouraged chemists and researchers to design and synthesis selective sorbent with high stability and high surface area. In this regard, most of the researches have been focused on synthesis of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as selective materials. MIPs are a man-made, selective, and versatile material with predefined recognition sites which are formed during the polymerization process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. After removal of target analyte, the recognition sites can act as selective cavities based on the size, shape, and functional groups of the applied analyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. MIPs are not only selective but also are simple, easy to synthesize, and cheap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. In spite of selectivity, MIPs are faced with main drawback, namely low adsorption capacity. To address this main limitation, many efforts have been performed. One of the interesting approaches is the combination of MIPs as selective materials with COFs as versatile materials with fascination properties in terms of high stability, high surface area, and also high adsorption capacity. Indeed, a combination of MIPs with COFs introduces novel kinds of sorbent that have both properties of MIPs and COFs. In spite of selectivity, most of MIPs and COFs have been prepared using toxic and hazardous materials and multi-step synthesis approaches. These approaches not only are hazardous but also are time-consuming and expensive. To remove these limitations, green synthesis approaches can be an ideal choice for the fabrication of green and room-temperature COFs. Up to know, most of the COFs have been synthesized using organic solvents which is not in the line of green chemistry. To remove this problem, synthesis of a new kind of building monomers that are soluble in water can be an ideal choice. This approach not only decreases using hazardous solvents but also enhances the water compatibility of the prepared COFs. Since one of the main areas for application of COFs is separation fields, this approach can enhance the performance of the prepared COFs for the determination of different compounds especially in water and aqueous media like water and biological fluids like urine, blood, and plasma samples. Most of the prepared COFs are not conductive which limits their application in the fields like water splitting, photodegradation, and also catalyst. To address these limitations, combination of COFs with conductive materials like MOFs and metal-oxide nanoparticles can open a new window for the widespread application of COFs. By the way, most of MOFs, MIPs, and also metal-oxide nanoparticles can be synthesized at room temperature which can improve their applicability. To enhance surface area and also adsorption capacity of the prepared COFs, we can use multi-functional building monomers which not only can improve the adsorption capacity but also can enhance the stability of the prepared COFs. Also, we can use natural building monomers which are stable at room temperature for synthesis of COFs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par65">In this review article, we focused on the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks as versatile materials with amazing properties in terms of porous and crystalline structure, tunable structure, high stability, high surface area, and also high adsorption capacity. Between different synthesis approaches that have been applied for the preparation of covalent organic frameworks, a room-temperature method is a versatile approach with unique properties in terms of easy, simple, fast, and green approaches. In this study, we focused on the properties of room-temperature synthesis approaches for preparation of covalent organic frameworks. Also, we compare this method with some other reported methods. Finally, the limitations and also future perspectives of the room-temperature synthesis approach were discussed. This study confirmed that room-temperature method can be used in different areas which is due to its fascinating properties. Although this method is faced with the main drawbacks, they can be solved and can be the subject of many types of research in the near future. Indeed, this review article will open a new window for the researchers who are willing to work and study on covalent organic frameworks.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was financially supported by Graduate School and Research Council of Yasouj University.</p></ack><ref-list
