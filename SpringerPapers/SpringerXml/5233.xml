Molecular modeling, particularly based on density functional theory, played a key role in (i) understanding the nature of interactions between the gas and the MOFs geometry (ii) establishing various binding pockets and relative binding energies, and (iii) offering design clues to improve the gas uptake capacity of existing MOF architectures. In this review, we have looked at various MOFs that are studied thoroughly using DFT/periodic DFT (pDFT) methods for CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>4</sub> gases to provide a birds-eye-view on how various exchange-correlation functionals perform in estimating the binding energy for various gases and how factors such as nature of the (i) metal ion, (ii) linkers, (iii) ligand, (iv) spin state and (v) spin-couplings play a role in this process with selected examples. While there is still room for improvement, the rewards offered by the molecular modelling of MOFs were already substantial that we advocate experimental and theoretical studies to go hand-in-hand to undercut the trial-and-error approach that is often perceived in the selection of MOFs and gas partners in this area.</p></sec><sec id="ASec2" specific-use="web-only"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p>The importance of density functional theory-based molecular modeling studies in offering design clues to improve the gas adsorption and storage capacity of existing MOF architectures is discussed here.

Non-renewable sources such as natural gas, coal, and oil dominate the list and account for around 80% of the primary energy consumption, and the combustion of these fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases such as CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> and contributes to 99.5% of greenhouse gas emission (GHC). It is essential to minimize the pervasive usage of fossil fuels; therefore, the transition to non-fossil fuel energy is essential. In this regard, many promising energy-conversion technologies have been proposed, widely explored, and developed in recent years for extensive use of clean energy, including fuel cells, water splitting, and the use of gases as energy carriers for electric power generation and long-term energy storage methods, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> Besides, all these energy conversion strategies that are broadly established to content energy crisis, the possibility of gas as an energy carrier, which can replace carbon-based fuels, offers wide possibility as it is a clean and safe method of storing energy. Though it is a welcoming and effective energy carrier, implementing various gases as an alternative for hydrocarbons and their conversion to energy is challenging due to their low volumetric energy density and flammability. The cryogenic distillation method for storage and separation of gases by compressing the gases at very high pressure is a challenging task considering the huge practical implications. To overcome this challenge, we need to design cheap and lightweight materials that can reversibly separate and store gases quickly and efficiently near ambient conditions. Thus, developing a secure and functional gas absorptive and separative system with high surface area, gas uptake, and low density is of great interest in today's scenario.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup></p><p>Various gas storage materials such as zeolites, Covalent Organic Frameworks (COFs), and Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are reported in the literature. Zeolites are a class of aluminosilicate materials with a highly crystalline nature, comprised of a network of linked cavities and molecular pores with sieving properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> Their peculiar properties, such as high thermal stability, large ion-exchange capacity, and caged structure, make them good encapsulating agents for nonpolar gases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>As the zeolites are readily available, low cost, robust, and easy to synthesize, they are beneficial over other microporous materials.</p><p>These materials' physical and chemical properties can be tuned and offer a variety of chemical compositions due to their ion exchange ability. The gas storage and separation in these microporous materials depend on factors such as the interaction of molecules with the internal surfaces of the micropores, optimal storage temperature, etc. Since the adsorption of molecules into the cavity of zeolites was occurring at high-pressure and low-temperature conditions, the practical use of zeolites for gas storage and separation was a limiting case. Further, the Zeolites have other disadvantages, such as they are hard to regenerate once utilized, it is hard to reuse the adsorbed materials, and they can not be fine-tuned at will for any specific gas applications (O<sub>2</sub> vs N<sub>2</sub>, etc.)</p><p>Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) comprise mainly organic linkers formed by boron oxide clusters through covalent bonds. They possess low densities than MOFs and have a large surface area and pore volume. COFs also has various applications in gas storage, catalysis, etc. The electrostatic contribution of framework charges in COFs is found to be smaller than that in MOFs. The limiting factor is the strong interaction of gas molecules with the COFs, as the host-guest interactions are often covalent in nature. Also, the covalent organic frameworks are not crystalline, which limits their application in various industrial processes. Besides zeolites and COFs, several hydrogen storage systems, such as conventional hydrides, complex hydrides, sorbent systems, and chemical hydrides are also available in the literature for gas storage and separation applications.</p><p>Although zeolites, COFs, and interstitial hydrides have emerged as gas storage/separation systems, they did not have large-scale industrial applications due to their less thermal stability, loss of crystalline nature, etc. Many strategies have come forth to improve the efficiency of gas uptake systems. Among all, MOFs based adsorptive gas storage system is envisioned as a long-term solution for an efficient gas uptake platform and replacement for carbon-based fuels.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> MOFs represent crystalline coordination polymers, which belong to a class of porous polymeric materials with numerous applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> They are peculiar absorbent materials constructed from secondary building units of metal-containing nodes and organic linking groups and are also known as porous coordination polymers (PCPs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> MOF chemistry is ubiquitous and one of the rapidly expanding research fields in chemistry due to its appealing functional and structural tunability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> The endlessly arising unique structures, research publications, numerous citations, and consistent enlargement of research ambit elucidate the same. The advancement in cluster chemistry, sophisticated organic synthesis pertaining to post-synthetic modification and ligand design, and progress in structure resolving through X-ray crystallography are attributed to the ever-expanding and extraordinary rise of MOF research. A signature of MOF is their crystallinity. The crystalline nature makes effortless structural characterization <italic>via</italic> X-ray diffraction, along with symmetry-adapted design techniques like the reticulate approach, enabling the prudent architecture of MOF topology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> This permits the meticulous discovery of MOFs, unlike the trial-and-error discovery of conventional solid-state materials in a black box approach. Due to their appealing properties such as structural and functional diversity, porous nature, size tunability, and enormous surface area. MOF is an attractive candidate for their potential applications in gas storage,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup> molecular separation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> sensors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup> and catalysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> among all other classical sorbent systems. The balance between the high gravimetric and volumetric adsorptive capacity of MOF makes them undeniably, a promising class of material for adsorptive gas storage application, apart from zeolites, COFs, and complex hydrides that are available for gas adsorption applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup> The tuning of MOF-based gas adsorptive systems can give rise to the creation of gas-based energy production and help secure the global ecosystem; for e.g., removing large amounts of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide is essential for limiting global warming effects. The selective separation/storage of gases such as hydrogen and methane is imperative for the prominent use of clean energy. To obtain a pure form of oxygen, cryogenic separation is the traditional method followed by industries; however, it requires extensive infrastructure and high-pressure conditions, limiting scalability and portability. As oxygen and nitrogen kinetic diameters are undoubtedly close to 3.46 Å and 3.64 Å, respectively, the membrane-based separation cannot be made practical. In this scenario, sorbent system-based trapping of oxygen is of great promise. Thus, MOFs serve as suitable candidate for the selective separation of gases due to their porous nature, enormous surface area and pore volume.</p><p>As geometry and structure play a vital role in gas adsorption in MOFs, several groups engaged in synthesizing and characterizing new MOF materials and tested them for various gas adsorption. The strategy employed includes the introduction of organic donor moieties with enhanced donor capability, increasing the coordination number of the open metal sites, and doping with other metals. While impressive progress had been made in terms of selectivity and binding for various gases with various MOF architectures such as (i) record high H<sub>2</sub> storage at 60 g H<sub>2</sub>/L was achieved with Mn-BTT MOF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup> ([Mn-(DMF)<sub>6</sub>]<sub>3</sub>[(Mn<sub>4</sub>Cl)<sub>3</sub>(BTT)<sub>8</sub>(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>12</sub>]<sub>2</sub>) (ii) very high selectivity of O<sub>2</sub> over N<sub>2</sub> and other gases was achieved with Fe<sub>2</sub>-dobdc MOF (8.16 mmol/g)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup> (iii) very high uptake for CO<sub>2</sub> of 130 mmol g<sup>−1</sup> with [Zn(adc)(4,40-bpe)<sub>0.5</sub>] (ADC = 4,4’-azobenzenedicarboxylate, 4,4′-bpe = trans-bis(4-pyridyl)ethylene)) MOF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup> (iv) very high binding affinity and selectivity achieved with a hydrocarbon such as methane<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> with ∼200 cm<sup>3</sup>(STP)/cm<sup>3</sup>, etc. Despite these impressive records, there is no prescribed protocol to obtain selectivity with any given MOFs. Most of the observations arrived after a heavy screening of hundreds of MOFs in a trial-and-error approach and then fine-tuning the selectivity/binding affinity <italic>via</italic> further experiments (desolvation, solvation, additives, etc.). Understanding the host-guest interaction between the MOFs and the gas is crucial if we need to develop further robust MOF materials.</p><p>However, these are challenging from the experimental perspective as obtaining structural or geometric information of MOFs upon gas bindings is often cumbersome. Particularly mimicking the best gas uptake conditions, which often involve high pressure throw up further challenges to get insightful information. Moreover, a search Cambridge structural database reveals a report of 1,10,000 MOF structures (updated still 2020), and a quick glance at the collected data reveals that most of the reported MOFs are paramagnetic, as shown in Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. This adds further complexity as obtaining structural information of gas binding in MOFs using spectral methods such as NMR is limited for such systems, even though sophisticated methods such as the polarised neutron diffraction method are available. In this regard, computational tools, both classical and quantum mechanical, are invincible, particularly methods based on density functional theory (DFT), which yield structural information upon binding, such as binding site, nature of the binding, uptake capacity at a given site, and binding energy for each of these sites. Combining this information with classical simulation employing Monte-Carlo or forcefield methods could yield further information and the simulation of experimental adsorption isotherm to yield vital design clues for a new generation of MOFs.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The distribution of MOFs as per CSD database (2020).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/12039_2022_2130_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>Theoretical and computational methods are now widely used for predicting various modifications of MOFs and how the gas adsorption capability of MOFs alters upon varying the coordination environment and metal sites. Among quantum mechanical methods of modeling MOFs, several approaches are followed (i) employ pDFT calculations which mimic the real system and the boundary conditions are enforced (ii) cluster model approach, which aims to focus on small or medium size models corresponding to the repeating units of MOFs for binding (iii) other approaches similar to QM/MM where multiple levels of theory are employed within the same network to reduce the computational cost and at the same time maintain a high level of accuracy and (iv) there are also other approaches such as quantum Monte-Carlo which take inputs from DFT calculations to generate insights.</p><p>In this review article, we aim to focus on various theoretical studies based on DFT calculations performed to understand the nature of binding of gases such as CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>4</sub> on various MOF containing first-row transition elements with some selected examples to have birds-eye-view on the role of metal ions and ligand linkers in obtaining selectivity and uptake capacity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Modelling carbon-dioxide capture in MOFs</title><p>CO<sub>2</sub> is an abundant gas in the earth’s atmosphere, and due to the industrial revolution and increased fossil fuel usage, CO<sub>2</sub> emission has been much higher in the last decade. The rising level of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere is the primary cause of the greenhouse gas effect, global warming, and climate change. Due to this increasing environmental threat, several kinds of research have been conducted for the effective capture of CO<sub>2</sub> and conversion to useful gases. Among the various strategies available for capturing CO<sub>2</sub>, material-based storage is a more effective and less energy-consuming technique for regeneration.</p><p>There are several efforts to capture CO<sub>2</sub> in MOFs, which can be further utilized for CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration. As modeling CO<sub>2</sub> in MOFs requires extensive benchmarking of exchange-correlation functionals and the role of dispersive interaction in the estimation of binding energy, the work of Siegel and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup> assumes importance. In this work, the authors have compared the BE with respect to the experimental enthalpies (Δ<italic>H</italic>) of CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption on four variants of M<sub>2</sub>(dobdc) (M = Mg-DOBDC,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup> Ni-DOBDC,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup> and Co-DOBDC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup>) (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) and Cu-HKUST-1<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref></sup> based on a series of GGA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup> functionals (optB86b, optB88, optPBE, revPBE, and rPW86) using VASP suite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup> employing projector-augmented-wave (PAW) method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref></sup> including Grimme's dispersion correction (DFT-D2).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref></sup> The studies show that the revPBE-vdW functional predicts the BE well; however, the metal-oxygen (CO<sub>2</sub>) distances were overestimated. Despite largely capturing the BE trends, the LDA and GGA functionals considerably overbind (LDA) and underbind (GGA) CO<sub>2</sub> in comparison to experimental enthalpies. When employing “off the shelf” DFT-D2 parameters to add a semiempirical r<sup>-6</sup> dispersion term to the GGA exchange-correlation energy, the trends and amplitude of the adsorption enthalpies are much improved. However, on average, this method under binds CO<sub>2</sub> by 7 kJ/mol (18%) in comparison to the experimental observation. Some of the nonempirical vdW density functionals provide better accuracy, with the revPBE-based functional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup> having an average inaccuracy of only 2 kJ/mol (4%) in comparison to the experiment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup> The revPBE functional overestimates the length of the metal–CO<sub>2</sub> bond by roughly 10%; thus, this gain in energetics is followed by a minor decline in the accuracy of predicted structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref></sup> For materials intended for carbon capture applications, long-range van der Waals interactions are essential for estimating thermodynamic features. The efficiency and reliability of revPBE-vdW functional indicate the potential of density functional methods for quick screening of possible CO<sub>2</sub> adsorbents (Figure <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). These approaches have advantages over costly, cluster-based quantum-chemical approaches as they can handle the large, periodic unit cells that are typical of MOFs.

To begin with, authors have performed cluster model, pDFT, as well as QM/MM approach employing MP2 method as QM workhorse. The generalised gradient approximation (GGA) functional PW91 was used for periodic calculations were lattice constants were optimised using local density approximation (LDA) with a kinetic energy cut-off of 520 eV and force on each atom less than 0.01eV. The cluster model calculations were performed using the G09<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup> suite with hybrid B3LYP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref></sup> functional employing 6-31+G(d) basis set with the energies corrected for the basis set superposition error employing counter-poise correction. The comparison of the experimental isosteric heat of adsorption (42kJ/mol) with employed DFT methods for seven metal series is shown in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Among the metal studied, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu were found to have antiferromagnetic interaction between the metal, leading to an S = 0 diamagnetic ground state, which is attributed to the nature of super-exchange which is mediated here <italic>via</italic> µO(R) group and a carbonate ion (Figure <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). As the ligand field environment presented here is relatively weak, all the metals found to have a high-spin state as their ground state, and this is found to be consistent with the experimental report. The experimental observations that Mg &gt; Ni &gt; Co &gt; Fe &gt; Mn &gt; Zn with the decreasing order of isosteric value for the CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption found to correlate to the charge on the metal ion with larger charges tend to yield lower binding affinity (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). While revPBE-vdW<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref></sup> was found to yield better geometries for M<sub>2</sub>(dobdc) MOFs, this function has not been tested in this work, though a direct correlation was made to MP2 methods.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The comparison of CO<sub>2</sub> binding energies (in kJ/mol) was calculated using DFT, MP2, and MP2- based QM/MM methods and experimental heats of adsorption Q<sub>st</sub> (in kJ/mol).

As suggested in the work of Siegel and co-workers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup> the dispersion corrected functional (rev-vdW-DF2 +U) was employed using VASP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref></sup> software to model the non-covalent interactions between CO<sub>2</sub> and framework. The authors have performed pDFT calculations using a plane-wave basis set with a kinetic energy cut-off of 800 eV. The DFT-based structural investigations have suggested that the open metal sites contribute to the maximum absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> in the framework. The predicted linear geometry in the intramolecular CO<sub>2</sub> angles matches the experiments. Notably, the binding energy estimated for the open metal center (site I) is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured zero-coverage isosteric temperatures of adsorption (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The computed bond distance for the interaction of CO<sub>2</sub> with metal M–O (CO<sub>2</sub>) in site I nearly matches experimental findings with a difference of ~ 0.04 Å in the case of Cr-BTT and Cu-BTT. If we compare the DFT computed binding energies for the metal centre (site I) and nitrogen (site II), the binding strength of CO<sub>2</sub> at site II appears to be not dependent on the metal, the binding energy of CO<sub>2</sub> at the site I depend heavily on the nature of the metal. Sites III and IV have very weak binding compared to sites I and II. In fact, the examined frameworks show just a difference of 2 kJ/mol in the computed binding energy for CO<sub>2</sub> at site II. Even at increased loading of CO<sub>2</sub>, the DFT computed results were similar to the experimental uptake capacities. The binding strength at site I is greater than at site II for Fe-BTT, Cr-BTT, and Cu-BTT, which can be attributed to the charge on the metal centre. The trend in adsorption energy follows Fe &gt; Cr &gt; Cu. The overall conclusion of the study is that DFT investigations are a useful tool to unveil the importance of the open metal site in the M-BTT and the unique role of the nature and charge on the metal centers in enhancing the CO<sub>2</sub> uptake capacity.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The comparison of the various MOFs, bound gas studied here, and

role of ligand functionalization in tuning CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption and N<sub>2</sub> adsorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref></sup> The Cu–BTTri (BTTri<sup>–3</sup> = 1,3,5-benzenetristriazolate) and Cu–BTT (BTT<sup>–3</sup> = 1,3,5-benzenetristetrazolate) MOFs (Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c) were chosen for the DFT investigations. The electronic structure simulations were performed in Quantum Espresso<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref></sup> software using PBE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref></sup> functional, considering the Grimme-D2 dispersion corrections. The spin-polarised calculations suggested an antiferromagnetic ground state for the Cu-BTTri system. The DFT investigation suggested four binding sites for CO<sub>2</sub>, with the open metal site, site-I has an estimated binding energy of -21 kJ/mol. The energy decomposition analysis indicated that the major contribution of binding energy is due to the van der Waal interactions (-17.6 kJ/mol). The second site is located above the metal cluster (see Figure <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>), and the binding energy for this site is computed to be -26 kJ/mol, which is slightly stronger than site I. The isosurface plot clearly shows the interaction between the electron-rich triazolate group of BTTri ligand and CO<sub>2</sub>, rationalizing a significant contribution to the binding energy arising from van der Waal interactions. The electrostatic interaction between negatively charged BTTri ligand and oxygen of the CO<sub>2</sub> leads to a favourable binding at site II. The differences in their electron donor ability due to tetrazolate and triazolate ligand moieties in Cu-BTT and Cu-BTTri is playing a role in controlling the adsorption pattern. The third adsorption site is near the benzene ring, and the binding energy estimated is lower than the site I and II (-17 kJ/mol), as the interaction of CO<sub>2</sub> with weak π-acceptor capability interacts feebly with the π-electron cloud of the benzene ring reducing the overall binding energy for this site III. Site IV is the cavity of the Cu-BTTri framework, where the computed binding energy is -15.8 kJ/mol. The adsorbed molecules in site IV interacted with nitrogens of the BTTri ligand at a distance of ~3.2 Å. After investigating the possible binding sites in Cu-BTTri, the author has also compared the binding of CO<sub>2</sub> in the Cu-BTT framework. The substitution of the triazolate with tetrazolate gave rise to a lower overall uptake capacity in Cu-BTTri compared to Cu-BTT, whereas the selectivity obtained over CO<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> was better for triazolate moiety. This can be attributed to the weak interaction of Cu and CO<sub>2</sub> in the triazolate due to the elongated Cu-C distance. The shorter metal-ligand distances lead to elongated bonds in the z-axis and, thereby, weak interaction with the incoming CO<sub>2</sub> molecule in the case of the tetrazolate counterpart. Hence, the study implies that various factors, such as uptake capacity and selectivity, together control the efficiency of the adsorption, and care must be taken in analyzing each factor controlling the adsorption and separation. This study shows how to modulate the linker groups in MOFs to improve the binding properties of gases and facilitate efficient gas separation.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Various binding pockets identified for CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption for Cu-BTT and Cu-BTTri MOF by the DFT calculations.

However, the lack of cost-effective H<sub>2</sub> storage systems remains a challenge as the current method available for large-scale hydrogen storage is the cryogenic method at the cost of energy and infrastructure. Metal-organic frameworks can serve as an appealing hydrogen storage device due to their exceptional diversity and tunability in chemical composition, topological structure, surface chemistry, and large surface area. Understanding the hydrogen adsorption in MOFs through modelling studies offers great interest in this context. Several DFT, coupled-cluster, and symmetry-adapted perturbation theory-based studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref></sup> are available in the literature on various issues related to H<sub>2</sub> binding and uptakes and exploring the possible binding pockets for hydrogen in MOFs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref></sup></p><p>Ihm and co-workers have performed the first principle electronic structure calculations on calcium-decorated and boron-substituted MOF-5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref></sup> The carbon atoms in the benzene ring of the BDC linker were replaced with two boron atoms at the ortho and para positions.

A total of 8 H<sub>2</sub> molecules were binding near the calcium atom with an average binding energy of 20 kJ/mol, which is reasonable for improved hydrogen uptake.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Relaxed structure of Ca-decorated B-substituted MOF-5 with 8H<sub>2</sub>'s adsorbed per linker.

This is correlated to the nature of binding with the 4d ions have more diffuse 4d orbitals and can make a stronger affinity for oxygen than 3d metals. Also, it is correlated to the occupancy of the d-orbitals as the metal-oxo/superoxo/peroxo formation is correlated to the metal-O<sub>2</sub> back donation, which is likely to diminish as we move from 3d to 4d as the 3d-2p (O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>) gap is expected to be smaller than 4d-2p orbitals.

Approximately ~0.25 electrons were transferred from cobalt to O<sub>2</sub>, and this modest charge transfer was further supported by the CASSCF multi-configurational wave function partial occupation number (0.20 electrons). The experimental measurement of 34(1) kJ/mol is within the error of the DFT- estimated enthalpy of adsorption of oxygen, which is 32.8 kJ/mol by M06 functional (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The Co-BTTri displays low binding energy, and hence, less selectivity is seen for this framework, along with low oxygen adsorption. So, the authors tune the ligand and synthesised H<sub>3</sub>BDTriP (5,5′-(5-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1,3-phenylene)bis(1H-1,2,3-triazole)) having Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of 1332(4) m<sup>2</sup>/g for checking the effect of changing ligand on selectivity. Although Co-BDTriP and Co-BTTri have fairly comparable O<sub>2</sub>-dosed crystal structures, a subjective assessment of the slopes of their oxygen isotherms showed that Co-BDTriP had a substantially larger propensity for O<sub>2</sub>. The Co-BDTriP displayed greater oxygen affinity along with smaller isosteric heat for N<sub>2</sub> at lower loadings. This, in turn, results in a better O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> selectivity because of the weaker Lewis acidity of pyrazolate-bound metal centres.</p><p>Using DFT calculations, isostructural organic linkers can fine-tune the selectivity, the heat of adsorption, and electronic structures, oxygen binding was thoroughly studied in the isostructural frameworks Co-BTT, Co-BTTri, and Co-BTP. The bond lengths of Co-O, Co-N, and Co-Cl decrease in the order Co-BTT followed by Co-BTTri, which in turn is greater than Co-BTP and this is reversed if we compare the amount of charge transfer from metal to O<sub>2</sub>. Based on these results, the authors have speculated that Co-BTP could be fascinating for applications involving higher-temperature air separation and aerobic oxidation catalysis. The authors have proved that considerably adjusting the ligand field modifies the O<sub>2</sub> heat of adsorption and the amount of electron transfer from Co to O<sub>2</sub> and have shown that a judicious choice of both frameworks as well as the ligand field is important for obtaining higher selectivity. However, the work on M<sub>2</sub>(DOBDC) discussed earlier underestimated the role of MOF topology and attached a prime role for the nature of the metal ions. Though Co-BTTri and Co-BDTriP showed appreciable selectivity and can adsorb O<sub>2</sub> reversibly over N<sub>2</sub>, their selectivity is dramatically diminished at temperatures beyond 195 K.</p><p>As a large number of nodes and linkers are available in the MOF literature, there is a requirement for design criteria that could be applied to effectively adjust the oxygen and nitrogen affinities at frameworks exposed metal locations because it takes a significant amount of time to create, characterise, and test novel MOFs for O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> separation.

Here the VASP package with projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotentials, convergence criteria of 10<sup>-6</sup> eV, the force acting on every atom within 0.03 eV/Å, and cut-off energy of 520 eV was employed to compute adsorption energies for the DFT calculations, with PBE-D3(BJ) theory level. The refinement of atomic locations was carried out with M06-L meta-GGA exchange-correlation functional with fixed lattice constants. All further computations concerning the adsorption of any guests were performed using a constant simulation unit cell employing M06-L functional. Adsorption of oxygen and nitrogen at unsaturated metal locations was explored for different families of MOFs using a screening technique based on pDFT. The authors aim to design procedures to tune the redox activity of the MOF-metal centers by altering the formal oxidation states, anions of bridging coordination entities, and functionalisation of the linkers to change the O<sub>2</sub> selectivity at open metal spots. The authors examined O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> adsorption at the open metal sites of different MOF types using a high-throughput pDFT approach.

The estimated <italic>J</italic> values for unbound and O<sub>2</sub> bound Cr-BTT is <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>1</italic></sub>=-25.8 (-23.8) cm<sup>-1</sup>, <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>2</italic></sub>= -41.8 (+3.4) cm<sup>-1</sup> and <italic>J</italic><sub><italic>3</italic></sub> = 0.3 (+0.5) cm<sup>-1</sup> (<italic>J</italic><sub><italic>4</italic></sub> = -1366 cm<sup>-1</sup>), which is suggesting a change in value of <italic>J</italic><sub>2</sub> after binding of O<sub>2</sub>. The ground state configuration of chromium has a spin density of ~2.9 (~3.8 on unbound MOF) and oxygen, ~0.9. The calculations suggested that the electron-transfer mechanism adopted by O<sub>2</sub> gives rise to Cr<sup>III</sup> superoxo species (O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup>) with a very strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the two centers.</p><p>This stabilizing exchange coupling interaction between Cr<sup>III</sup> centers and oxygen leads to spin-state-dependent binding. Further, the oxygen binding in various spin states like high spin, intermediate spins, and ground states was examined (Figure <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">15</xref>). Interestingly, the binding energy of high spin and ground state differed by ~47 kJ/mol, which suggests strong spin-state dependent oxygen binding. The successive oxygen binding and analysis of binding energy in various spin states corroborate the fact that the number of bound oxygen and the value of binding energy varied in the ground state and high spin state (Figure <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>c). The adsorption trend for H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> was similar in both high spin and ground states. This was also cross-verified by classical adsorption isotherm simulations where GS and HS have different adsorption capacities (Figure <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>a,b). The isotherm calculations were performed by considering the successive oxygen binding and capturing their uptake capacities. Up to eight oxygen binding, the isotherm matched with the experiments in the case of the ground state. In contrast, the adsorption isotherm for other H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> did not show any change in the isotherm pattern and followed a similar isotherm profile, both in high spin and ground state. Thus the adsorption isotherm calculations also demonstrate no spin-dependent binding for H<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> (Figure <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>b). Further, to cross-check if any radical formation occurs upon binding of nitrogen, a coordinate scan was performed to access the energetic cost associated with the radical formation of N<sub>2</sub>. The calculations suggested the formation of Cr(III)-N<sub>2</sub><sup>-•</sup> species at N-N~1.34 Å, with an energy penalty of ~150 kJ/mol (per site), revealing the reason for the very high selectivity towards O<sub>2</sub> (Figure <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">16</xref>d). This study offered a hitherto unexplored method of controlling gas adsorption selectivity in MOFs by applying spin-state/spin-coupling switching.<fig id="Fig15"><label>Figure 15</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The energy level diagram depicts different spin states comparative energies [kJ/mol] before and after oxygen binding.

There is great interest in storing and recovering methane as it burns cleanly compared to other conventional fuels like gasoline and has a greater H/C ratio. The fact that condensed methane's volumetric energy density is just 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of gasoline is a massive disadvantage. Therefore, there is a demand for better methane storage materials. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) established a benchmark for material-based adsorption of CH<sub>4</sub> storage, in 2000, of 180 cm<sup>3</sup>(STP) cm<sup>-3</sup> at 298 K and 35 bar to motivate research in this area. Traditional adsorbent materials like zeolites show a value within 100 cm<sup>3</sup>(STP) cm<sup>-3</sup>, carbon-based materials reasonably meet this value, but there is not enough room for better performance due to finite surface area. MOFs are of interest as they have already surpassed this value and are present in the literature, and a further improvement in the surface area can be made because of their tunable nature.</p><p>Molecular Simulation is vital in screening existing and hypothetical MOFs for any particular applications. For methane adsorption, Sanyue Wang,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref></sup> in 2007, simulated a series of 10 MOFs utilizing Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the required properties of an idyllic adsorbent.

To know the association between atoms of the framework and methane molecule, all-atom optimized potentials for liquid simulations (OPLS-AA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref></sup> force field was utilized. Adsorption of CH<sub>4</sub> across all frameworks was calculated using the conventional Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. Rigidity was considered during simulations in all MOFs. For LJ interactions, a cut-off radius value of 13.5 Å was employed with periodic boundary limits in all directions. The simulation used 10<sup>7</sup> iterations for each state point to ensure equilibration and 10<sup>7</sup> iterations to model the appropriate thermodynamic characteristics. The maximum overall potential energy and the ensemble average in the simulation cell are predicted to have an error of around 2% on the final results. Chemical potentials were computed from the NPT ensemble MC simulation. On the grounds of the simulated chemical potentials at different pressures, relationships between chemical potentials and pressure were built to convert them into each other. Simulations suggest that for methane storage, an ideal absorbent would be one with a specific surface area, low density, superior isosteric heats of adsorption, and free volume. With the comparison between methane uptake values in various MOFs considered, authors found the role of various factors in methane adsorption. They draw the inference from these simulations that the free volume and accessible surface area are crucial in determining the absorption of methane at 3.5 MPa and 298 K conditions. This study proved molecular simulations are a valuable tool to decipher adsorption capacity. This, in turn, directs rules for the design of novel materials. However, this study does not involve any quantum chemical calculations; thus, it completely ignores the role of open-metal centers and possible chemical bonding between the metal and the gas, as seen in earlier studies. The method used by authors in this study can only predict adsorption in frameworks which does not have strong binding sites. The above method is not sufficient enough to take into account the strong gas/framework interactions.</p><p>The function of open-metal sites was later explored in 2009 by Yildirim and co-workers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> Even though the CH<sub>4</sub> molecule is nonpolar and extremely symmetric, some increase in binding energy is feasible because the distribution of charges on the CH<sub>4</sub> molecule would change as a result of adsorption on the metal location. Thus, symmetry would be reduced, resulting in the formation of multipole moments. Authors explored the M<sub>2</sub>(DHTP) family of MOFs (Figure <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>a-d), which contains large volumes of unsaturated metal sites (where DHTP= 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalate and M = Mg, Mn, Co, Ni, and Zn). They found that the adsorption of a single methane molecule per site can produce a significant CH<sub>4</sub> storage capacity of about 160–174 cm<sup>3</sup>(STP)/cm<sup>3</sup>, reaching the objective set by DOE of 180 cm<sup>3</sup>(STP)/cm<sup>3</sup> for CH<sub>4</sub> storage in materials at ambient temperature conditions. The authors computed adsorption and desorption isotherms at 270, 280, and 298 K on five activated M<sub>2</sub>(DHTP) samples with the modified Clausius–Clapeyron equation and determined the heats of CH<sub>4</sub> adsorption. Excess methane uptake capacity for the five M<sub>2</sub>(DHTP) varies from 149 to 190 cm<sup>3</sup>(STP)/cm<sup>3</sup> at 35 bar and 298K. This matches well (within 10%) with these MOFs' (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) predicted largest uptake tendencies at open-metal sites. The largest methane storage capacity among MOFs under investigation is Ni<sub>2</sub>(DHTP), with an adsorption capacity in absolute terms of roughly 200 cm<sup>3</sup>(STP)/cm<sup>3</sup>, potentially exceeding the DOE goal by about 10%.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup><fig id="Fig17"><label>Figure 17</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>The representative MOF structures are taken for the investigation of CH<sub>4</sub> modelling studies in MOFs, (a-c) different binding sites in Zn<sub>2</sub>(DHTP)*, (d) bare structure of the Zn<sub>2</sub>(DHTP)*, (e) UTSA-76a, and (f) Crystal structures of HKUST-1, PCN-11, and PCN-14**. * Reproduced with Permission Ref. 70.

They investigated LDA and PBE functionals using Vanderbilt-type ultrasoft pseudopotentials with a cut-off energy value of 544 eV and overall energy convergence within 0.5 meV/atom. Based on the above calculations, the B.E of methane at open metal sites was found to be much higher than at any other sites. It was also reflected in the high heat of adsorption for CH<sub>4</sub> in these MOFs. They considered that the electrostatic associations among methane and open metals are responsible for the increased binding strength. However, in this work, the role of cage opening for the methane entering the framework was not explored.</p><p>One year later, in 2010, Zhou and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref></sup> revealed that small cages/channels are also important in methane storage. The authors published a thorough mechanistic analysis of CH<sub>4</sub> storage in three landmark MOFs, HKUST-1 [Cu<sub>3</sub>(btc)<sub>2</sub>] (btc=1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate), PCN-11 [Cu<sub>2</sub>(sbtc)] (sbtc=trans-stilbene-3,3′,5,5′-tetracarboxylate), and PCN-14 [Cu<sub>2</sub>(adip)] (adip=5,5′-(9,10-anthracenediyl) diisophthalate)) (Figure <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>f) through neutron powder diffraction trials, followed by GCMC simulations and DFT computations to know the precise positions of methane molecules deposited in these frameworks. The Rietveld refinement’s of experimentally determined positions and the relative numbers of the adsorbed CH<sub>4</sub> at each major binding site (apart from unsaturated metal positions) are in good agreement with those anticipated by GCMC simulations. Smaller cage openings and unsaturated Cu sites in HKUST-1 have a higher occupation, while the primary centre location of the small cages and corner location of larger cages are sparsely occupied. The fact that experimental findings and the results from the GCMC simulation are qualitatively consistent leads authors to believe the conventional force fields they employed can seize the main vdW-type interplay among methane and the MOF framework. DFT calculations provided additional support for the experimentally observed structures of adsorbed methane. The DFT optimizations for adsorbed CH<sub>4</sub> in HKUST-1 and PCN-11 were found to be entirely consistent with the outcomes of the experiment. The PWSCF software was used to carry out DFT-based computations using LDA with the Perdew-Zunger (PZ) exchange-correlation functional and ultrasoft Vanderbilt pseudopotentials, with an energy cut-off of 544 eV with convergence within 0.5 meV per atom was employed. The binding between methane and open metal position is underestimated by GGA approximation; therefore, it was not employed in this study. The authors summarised the experimental values of primary adsorption enthalpy and static methane binding energies derived by DFT for all adsorption sites. The binding capacity of CH<sub>4</sub> is overestimated by LDA approximation resulting in significantly higher adsorption enthalpies compared to experimental values. Authors discovered that there were two main types of strong adsorption sites where methane uptake occurs: (i) one at coordinatively unsaturated Cu sites, which show better Coulomb interactions with CH<sub>4,</sub> and (ii) the second at the sites having potential van der Waals pockets. It is interesting to note that the improved van der Waals locations are only found in smaller cages. On the other hand, CH<sub>4</sub> binds very little to larger cages having even pore overlays. These findings imply that rational novel MOF compound development for CH<sub>4</sub> stowage purposes must concentrate on increasing the number of open metal sites, limiting the proportion of larger pores, and raising the proportion of available small channels and cages.</p><p>Later, in 2014, Banglin Chen and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref></sup> found a new MOF, “UTSA-76a” (Figure <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>e), which had dynamic pyrimidine groups on the linker. It showed an extremely high CH<sub>4</sub> uptake of about ∼260 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP) cm<sup>–3</sup> at 65 bar and 298 K, which is much greater than the target value of DOE. The authors calculated the storage capacity of methane in UTSA-76a, and it was contrasted with NOTT-101a. UTSA-76a showed significantly more methane adsorption besides NOT-101a at 298 K and 65 bar. The capacity to store volumetric methane significantly increased from 237 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP) cm<sup>-3</sup> ( NOTT-101a) to 257 cm<sup>3</sup> (STP) cm<sup>-3</sup> (UTSA-76a). The elevated working capacity and methane storage observed in UTSA-76a implied that the immobilization of functional groups into pore surfaces of MOFs plays a significant role in the markedly enhanced methane storage performance. They thoroughly analyzed UTSA-76a and NOTT-101a from a skeletal standpoint by neutron scattering and computational studies to comprehend the cause of the greater uptake of CH<sub>4</sub> by the pyrimidine groups. They looked into the possibility that the CH<sub>4</sub> adsorption energies in these MOFs would be distinct and lead to the differences in methane adsorption isotherms. They used van der Waals (vdW) corrected interactions employing dispersion-corrected density-functional theory (DFT-D) computations. Observations showed that the binding energies of adsorbed methane molecules on the primary phenyl ring of NOTT-101a and those close to UTSA-76a's pyrimidine sites are comparable. Comparing UTSA-76a to NOTT-101a, they did not observe any novel, particular adsorption sites that had been brought by the pyrimidine rings. The DFT-D estimated adsorption affinities on the surface of the organic linker pore were virtually comparable to these MOFs' static structures and unable to explain the variation in methane storage capacity, which prompted them to think about the dynamic structure of these frameworks. However, researchers observed that the center linker's rings have rather high freedom of rotation, which might have some impact on methane storage. Thus, the energy required for this rotating movement about two corresponding configurations of the core rings was computed, in which they discovered that the central linker's ring of NOTT-101a is substantially more “static” than the central linker's ring of UTSA-76a as it possesses higher rotational barrier. They observed that UTSA-76a has a substantially lower estimated barrier for rotation of the benzene group than MOF-5 (55 kJ/mol). Therefore, compared to the central benzene rings in NOTT-101a, in order to maximize the methane packing at elevated pressures during methane adsorption, UTSA-76a's central pyrimidine rings could be easily altered and directed. As a result, both MOFs exhibit almost the same uptake at low pressures. However, with larger methane loadings, due to its flexible orientation of the pyrimidine ring, UTSA-76a is capable of adsorbing greater gas molecules compared to NOTT-101a, giving it a larger working capacity. This study revealed that MOFs with comparable dynamic linker freedom could provide greater CH<sub>4</sub> working and storage capacities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Modelling mixture of gas adsorption in MOFs</title><p>In 2014, Jeffrey B.

This research made statistical inferences that improved our knowledge of the role of different transition metal cations in small molecule binding at coordinatively unsaturated metal locations and pinpointing promising candidates for gas-separation applications. Due to flaws in correlation and self-interaction, traditional exchange-correlational functionals, like LDA or GGA, may not accurately describe localized <italic>d</italic> electrons. The fact that adsorption energies are significantly influenced by vdW dispersion interconnections among small gas molecules and MOFs and thus create a nonlocal correlation is typically ignored by local or semi-local exchange-correlational functionals. The authors employed vdW-DF2 with Hubbard U corrections for the d electrons of the transition-metal ions to resolve these issues as vdW-DF2 had displayed in the literature to reproduce appreciable values for smaller molecules. They evaluated the efficacy of their method by contrasting their findings with those obtained through measurements of MOF-74s' electronic structure, lattice characteristics, and isosteric temperatures of CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption. All computations are performed using the VASP suite employing PAW pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set with a high plane-wave cut-off energy of 1000 eV and binding energies that converge within one kJ/mol. They started with known Zn-MOF-74's established structure. Employing PBE functional, a triclinic primitive unit cell was modelled and utilized to produce the Zn-MOF-74's structure. Optimization of atomic locations and lattice vectors was performed till the stress tensor components were less than 0.2 kbar, and residual forces were less than 0.01 eV/Å. Swapping out the Zn atoms for Mg, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu creates isostructural analogues with different metal cations. These new structures are then re-optimized employing PBE functional having Hubbard corrections. The apical M-O bonds in Cr- MOF-74 and Cu-MOF-74 are longer than basal M-O bonds with Cu-MOF-74 depicting elongation of 0.46 Å, which is reasonably consistent with the experimentally observed elongation of 0.53 Å.

Molecular modelling played a tremendous role in this area.

Among the studied gas, the correlation is better for Cu<sup>II</sup> MOF than other metal ions (See Figure <xref rid="Fig21" ref-type="fig">21</xref> right), which suggests that semi-LDA functional employed for Cu<sup>II</sup> MOFs is perhaps at an acceptable level, but it tends to get worse for other metals.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><bold><italic>Take Home Messages for CO</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic>2</italic></bold></sub><bold><italic> binding in MOFs: </italic></bold>For the CO<sub>2</sub> gas binding on MOFs, there are several learnings from Modelling perspectives (i) while DFT calculations were able to reproduce the binding energies for this gas when charge transfer contributions are deciding factors such as those found in M<sub>2</sub>(dobdc), one needs to adapt methodology such as MP2. In this series, it is observed that a larger charge on the metal-ion yield lower binding energies. This is correlated to the weak π-acceptor ability of CO<sub>2</sub>, which prefers an electron-rich metal with fully filled d-shell or t<sub>2g</sub> orbitals (for octahedral geometry) to facilitate greater donations. For the M-BTT family, the Fe<sup>II</sup> site is found to have stronger binding for CO<sub>2,</sub> and the binding of CO<sub>2</sub> at other sites of the ligands was found to be not correlated to the nature of the metal ions. As the binding of CO<sub>2</sub> to the ligands is purely van der Waals type interaction, ligands that have such voids and π-electron cloud could enhance the uptake capacity. Further, ligand variation from benzene-tris-tetrazolate (BTT) to benzene-tris-triazolate was found to reduce the selectivity for CO<sub>2</sub> over N<sub>2</sub>, suggesting the importance of ligand design for the uptake/separation of gases.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold><italic>Take Home Messages for H</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic>2</italic></bold></sub><bold><italic> binding in MOFs: </italic></bold>The following points are proposed to increase the uptake capacity of H<sub>2</sub> in MOFs, (i) decoration of MOF with light metals such as those observed in calcium-decorated and boron-substituted MOF-5 (ii) employing metal ions that favours delocalization of its charge to the ligand (iii) greater volume of availability compared to halide linker also found to enhance the capacity. Among halides, F<sup>-</sup> found to adsorb better due to great charge-transfer stabilization. (iv) Further alteration of the metal center does not found to alter the binding energy for hydrogen adsorption as the binding energy for the M-BTT series (M= Fe, Cr, Mn, Cu) ranged between 10.0 to 11.9 kJ/mol. In all cases, Van der Waal interactions are the key to regulating the hydrogen binding energy.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold><italic>Take Home Messages for O</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic>2</italic></bold></sub><bold><italic> binding in MOFs: </italic></bold>In the case of O<sub>2</sub> adsorption on MOFs, (i) early transition metals were found to have substantially stronger binding for oxygen than nitrogen hence recommended for O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub> separation. This is associated with the π-acceptor ability of the metal sites, with O<sub>2</sub> binding to the metal being covalent in characters while N<sub>2</sub> binds in a van der Waals fashion. (ii) Further, ligands that are better donors that can enhance the electron donation from metal to O<sub>2</sub> were found to yield larger binding energy. (iii) ligand with a higher pKa leads to redox-active metal sites that are preferable for O<sub>2</sub> binding (iv) the acid strength of bridging anions also found to influence the O<sub>2</sub> binding with greater acidity leading to larger binding as stronger charge-transfer is expected (v) Our studies have concluded that the electron-transfer mechanism adopted by O<sub>2</sub> gives rise to Cr<sup>III</sup> superoxo species (O<sub>2</sub><sup>.−</sup>) with a very strong antiferromagnetic coupling between the two centers, and this stabilizing exchange coupling interaction between Cr<sup>III</sup> centers and oxygen leads to the spin-state-dependent binding. The adsorption isotherm calculations also demonstrate a spin-dependent binding for O<sub>2,</sub> unlike N<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>. Our study offers a new strategy for controlling gas adsorption selectivity in MOFs by applying spin-state/spin-coupling switching.</p></list-item><list-item><p><bold><italic>Take Home Messages for CH</italic></bold><sub><bold><italic>4</italic></bold></sub><bold><italic> binding in MOFs: </italic></bold>For CH<sub>4</sub> adsorption on MOFs the following points are crucial (i) free volume and accessible surface areas in MOFs (ii) open-metal sites found to increase the capacity where electrostatic associations among methane and open metals result in the distribution of charges and reduction of overall symmetry of CH<sub>4</sub> molecule. (iii) small cages/channels are also essential in methane storage, with enhanced capabilities that can be achieved by increasing the number of open metal sites, limiting the proportion of larger pores, and raising the ratio of available small channels and cages. (iv) MOFs with comparable dynamic linker freedom could provide greater CH<sub>4</sub> working and storage capacities.</p></list-item></list></p><p>All these summarised DFT investigations prove that there are limitless possibilities for exploring the capability of gas adsorption properties in MOFs using molecular modelling and simulation techniques. Hence, using DFT-based investigation in conjunction with experimental synthesis is an imperative tool in designing new-generation MOFs with enhanced uptake capacity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>GR and RJ would like to thank DST/SERB (SB/SJF/2019-20/12; SPR/2019/001145) for funding.
