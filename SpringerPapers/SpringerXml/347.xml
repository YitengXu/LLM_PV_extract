This work seeks to provide a better understanding of the changes in material properties that lead to crack formation and find appropriate accelerated tests to replicate them. The PVDF-based backsheet outer layer can have a different structure and composition, and is often blended with a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer. We observed depletion of PMMA upon aging with sequential (MAST) and combined (C-AST) accelerated stress testing. In field-aged samples from Arizona and India, where PVDF crystallizes in its predominant α-phase, the degree of crystallinity greatly increased. MAST and C-AST protocols were, to some extent, able to replicate the increase in crystallinity seen in PVDF after ~ 7 years in the field, but no single-stress test condition (UV, damp heat, thermal cycling) resulted in significant changes in the material properties. The MAST regimen used here was too extreme to produce realistic degradation, but the test was useful in discovering weaknesses of the particular PVDF-based outer layer structure studied. No excessive β-phase formation was observed after aging with any test condition; however, the presence of β-phase was identified locally by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). We conclude that both MAST and C-AST are relevant tests for screening outdoor failure mechanisms in PVDF backsheets, as they were successful in producing material degradation that led to cracking.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy</institution><institution-id

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Backsheets constitute the rear side outermost layer of protection for the active components of standard photovoltaic (PV) modules. One typical backsheet type is comprised of an opaque multi-layer laminated polymeric sheet on the rear side of the module. A thicker core layer provides insulating properties and mechanical strength. Thinner inner and outer layers are designed for good adhesion to the encapsulant and resistance to the outdoor environment. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a popular choice for the core layer, and fluoropolymers, such as polyvinyl fluoride (PVF) and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), are commonly used for the inner/outer backsheet layers. In this work, we will focus on the PVDF-based backsheet structure (i.e., backsheets containing at least one layer of PVDF polymer). PVDF-based backsheets currently make up ~ 50% of the world market share<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. PVDF is a semi-crystalline thermoplastic fluoropolymer formed of covalent C–H and C–F bonds. PVDF has high purity, excellent chemical inertness, mechanical abrasion resistance, and UV stability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. High electronegativity and dissociation energy of the C–F bond ensure good thermal stability of the polymer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. As is common in many polymers, PVDF can have different molecular chain conformations, i.e., orientation of alternating –CF<sub>2</sub>– and –CH<sub>2</sub>– units. When C–F dipoles are oriented in the same direction (trans-planar zig-zag conformation, TTTT), the polymer is in its crystalline PVDF β-phase. In the case of antiparallel C–F dipole packing, the polymer is in its non-polar α-phase (TGTG’ conformation)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. PVDF α- and β-chain conformations are visualized in a schematic in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The α-phase is the most common phase, as it can be obtained by crystallization from melt. The β-phase can be formed by mechanical deformation via uniaxial or biaxial drawing of the α-phase below 100 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Under special conditions, PVDF can form other polymorphs (γ, δ, and ε), but these are less common<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Schematic of PVDF α- and β-phase molecular chain conformation.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_18477_Fig1_HTML.png" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par3">To further complicate our understanding of the polymers in backsheets, the PVDF outer layer is a complex material containing pigments and additives, and it is typically blended with acrylic polymers as well [e.g., poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)]<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Depending on the manufacturer, fabrication process, and composition, the layer may have different physical and mechanical properties. PVDF-based backsheets in deployed PV modules have been seen to fail prematurely. Failure here is defined as cracking. Backsheet cracking can not only compromise the module operating power by enabling enhanced ingress of moisture and oxygen, but it also presents an electrical hazard by exposing the high-voltage components. In a recent field study conducted by DuPont, 23% of investigated PVDF-containing modules were defective by year 9 of deployment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Cracks were seen to form along busbars; however, no clear correlation with a particular climate was found.</p><p id="Par4">The mechanisms behind the observed PVDF-based backsheet field cracking are not fully understood. Single-stress test conditions, such as the 85 °C and 85% relative humidity (RH) damp heat (DH) test, UV exposure, and thermal cycling (TC), produce material degradation, but have not been successful at replicating failures observed in the field. This is likely due to a lack of synergistic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. In recent years, more sophisticated test protocols have been designed to incorporate some of the complexities of outdoor environments. DuPont’s Module Accelerated Stress Test (MAST) sequentially applies DH, UV, and TC. One cycle of MAST was demonstrated to produce overt microcracking in some PVDF-based backsheet films in the machine direction (i.e., the direction parallel to the extrusion, with polymer chains oriented longitudinally)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, different types of crack formation were observed when the MAST sequence was modified by omitting the UV exposure, with a single crack formed near the junction box<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Combined-accelerated stress testing (C-AST) developed at NREL successfully reproduced field failures in commercial backsheets, including PVDF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In the early stages of development, C-AST combined “tropical” and “multi-seasonal” protocols to simulate different climates. Cracks appeared on the PVDF-based backsheet over outward-facing topographic features when a long tropical sequence was followed by just one week of the “desert” test sequence in the multi-seasonal protocol. The desert condition applies mechanical load and TC at low RH. Under further aging in the desert sequence, cracks spread rapidly over the entire backsheet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">To understand how cracking formed in aged PVDF-based backsheets, Moffitt et al. studied microstructural changes in PVDF/PMMA backsheet outer surface using atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Pits and voids from the loss of PMMA and TiO<sub>2</sub> particles were observed upon aging. Mechanical stretching of the aged polymer formed micro-cracks by connecting these pits. In addition, a different polymer ordering was observed near the crack tip, which suggests a possible local phase change due to higher level of strain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. This work seeks to understand the mechanisms behind PVDF failure with respect to the test conditions applied. Material properties, including chemical composition, degree of crystallinity, and phase formation, are investigated. PVDF-based backsheets that underwent single-stress, sequential, and combined-accelerated testing are compared to failed fielded PVDF-based backsheets from two different climates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><p id="Par6">We applied various stress-test conditions to PVDF-based backsheets incorporated into silicon PV modules with poly(ethylene co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) encapsulant or as laminated glass/EVA/backsheet coupons. The single-stress test conditions included 2000 h of DH with a chamber temperature of 85 °C and 85% RH per IEC 61215-2 test protocol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>; 1500 h of UV exposure (65 W/m<sup>2</sup> at 340 nm, chamber temperature of 60 °C); and 200 thermal cycles (TCs) between − 40 and 85 °C<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. The sequential stress test (MAST) applied the following in sequence: (1) 1000 h of DH (85 °C/85% RH), (2) 1000 h of UV-A (65 W/m<sup>2</sup> between 300 and 400 nm at 70 °C black panel temperature), (3) three rounds of the following: 200 TCs (− 40 to 85 °C) followed by 1000 h of UV-A<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. C-AST aging consisted of two protocols: a tropical protocol combining DH, UV, humidity freeze, mechanical loading, system voltage, and rain spray to simulate hot and humid climates, and a multi-seasonal protocol with low humidity, TC, and mechanical load to simulate continental climates. Details of the C-AST protocols’ test conditions can be found elsewhere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. A summary table of all accelerated stress test conditions applied can be found in Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> in the Supplementary Information (SI). Backsheets from the fielded modules were exposed to an arid climate in Arizona, USA, for 7 years (7y AZ), and to a hot, semi-arid climate with seasonal cooling in western India for 7.5 years (7.5y India).</p><p id="Par7">Two types of opaque (white-pigmented) PVDF-based backsheet layers were used in this study. A single-layer PVDF/PMMA blend with a thickness of 25 μm (PVDF-A) was used in single-stress test conditions, MAST, and C-AST aging. A co-extruded three-layer structure composed of PVDF|(PVDF/PMMA)|PVDF with a total thickness of 25 μm (PVDF-B) was used in the fielded modules, MAST, and single-stress tests. Because of the limited chamber space and available test schedule, only PVDF-A backsheet was tested using C-AST. To the best information and diagnosis in this study, the three-layer PVDF-B is believed to be the same structure, composition, and fabricated by the same process in the reference sample as in the field aged samples, however a change in processing of the PVDF-B cannot be absolutely ruled out.

To reduce cost and improve adhesion properties, PVDF is often blended with an amorphous acrylic polymer, PMMA. PMMA has good insulating properties, chemical resistance, high rigidity, and good miscibility with PVDF<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Typical PMMA content is 20–40 wt%; however, the exact PVDF to PMMA ratio, as well as the additive content of commercial PVDF, is often proprietary. In this study, the degradation of two different PVDF-based backsheet layers is investigated. One type contains PMMA on the weathering-exposed surface (PVDF-A), whereas the other type has a layered structure with no PMMA at the surface (PVDF-B). FTIR is a surface-sensitive technique that allows detection of chemical changes in the outermost 2 μm of the backsheet exposed surface. Unlike additives, PMMA is easily distinguished from the PVDF FTIR spectra by the presence of the carbonyl (C=O) peak located at 1730 cm<sup>−1</sup>. Changes in the peak intensity can indicate degradation related to the PMMA component in the backsheet.</p><p id="Par11">Figure <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the FTIR spectra of the single-layer PVDF-A on the unaged sample and after the stress tests.

The intensity of the PMMA peak was greatly reduced after C-AST aging, and the peak nearly disappeared after the MAST regimen. This is indicative of PMMA depletion on the exposed surface of the backsheet. PVDF is known for high resistance to UV, although Gu et al<italic>.</italic> showed that UV exposure can cause acrylic degradation, leading to mass loss in the form of gaseous products<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.

No reduction of the PMMA carbonyl peak was observed after any of the single-stress test conditions, suggesting that the sequential and combined accelerated tests had a greater effect on the stability of the PVDF-A blend. No PMMA can be detected by FTIR in the PVDF-B type backsheet, as the outermost PVDF layer is thicker than the penetration depth of the measurement (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> in the SI).

Negligible changes in crystallinity in PVDF-A were observed for all test conditions except for C-AST, after which a small increase was measured.

Similar DSC peak shifts have previously been observed with varying PVDF/PMMA ratios<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Due to suspected mass loss from PMMA depletion, DSC is inconclusive on the changes in crystallinity after MAST aging. WAXS diffractograms are useful for qualitatively assessing changes in crystallinity. WAXS of PVDF-A (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref> in the SI) confirms an increased growth of the α-PVDF in the (020) plane after the MAST sequence.

We hypothesize that annealing the polymer during the high temperature MAST test sequences together with chemical damage including chain scission and PMMA depletion evidenced from DSC and FTIR resulted in conditions which favored PVDF orientation along the (020) crystal plane rather than along the (110) plane.

On the other hand, while MAST did produce cracks on PVDF-based backsheets, the test sequence applied here may have been too harsh, causing excessive degradation. Although the MAST test used here is extreme, it allows the identification of weaknesses in PVDF-based backsheets that single-stress test conditions overlook. Although C-AST cannot be directly compared to the outdoor data, C-AST protocols were successful in inducing changes in material characteristics (i.e., increase in crystallinity, PMMA degradation), leading to crack formation without being as extreme as MAST.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Impact of the PVDF β-phase</title><p id="Par23">Although the PVDF α-phase is the most commonly seen phase in PVDF-based backsheets, PVDF can undergo a structural phase transformation under applied stress. The α- to β-phase transformation can take place via mechanical deformation (stretching) of the α-phase. The exact location of the β-phase formation, its effects on material properties, and its relation to backsheet cracking are subjects of ongoing research. The two major phases, α and β, can be distinguished by WAXS and FTIR based on the position of their characteristic scattering peaks and vibrational bands, respectively<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. WAXS diffractograms of PVDF-B (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) show the presence of sharp peaks corresponding to PVDF α-phase at Q = 1.27 Å<sup>−1</sup> (100), 1.31 Å<sup>−1</sup> (020), 1.42 Å<sup>−1</sup> (110), and 1.88 Å<sup>−1</sup> (021).

The amplitude ratio of (110)β and (110)α peaks is expressed in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. A small amount of β-phase was detected in all samples, including the unaged sample, which indicates that some β-phase was formed during the backsheet fabrication process. Relative to the unaged specimen, the proportion of the β-phase identified by WAXS seemed to increase the most after DH, UV, and TC, but dropped after outdoor weathering in India and Arizona. No evidence of the presence of PVDF β-phase from WAXS was seen before or after aging in PVDF-A type backsheets (see Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S2</xref> in the SI).<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Relative peak intensity ratio of PVDF β- to α-phase from two different phase identification methods, WAXS and FTIR, in PVDF-B backsheets aged with different test conditions.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2"/><th align="left"><p>WAXS</p><p>(110)β/(110)α</p></th><th align="left"><p>FTIR</p><p>β (1275 cm<sup>−1</sup>)/α (1180 cm<sup>−1</sup>)</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="2"><p>Unaged</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.095 ± 0.040</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.110 ± 0.027</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3"><p>Single</p></td><td align="left"><p>DH</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.137 ± 0.028</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.136 ± 0.020</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>UV</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.189 ± 0.039</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.083 ± 0.050</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>TC</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.151 ± 0.040</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.052 ± 0.016</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>Sequential</p></td><td align="left"><p>MAST</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.094 ± 0.029</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.113 ± 0.018</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2"><p>Fielded</p></td><td align="left"><p>7 years, Arizona</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.072 ± 0.038</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.087 ± 0.075</p></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><p>7.5 years, India</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.049 ± 0.032</p></td><td char="±" align="char"><p>0.117 ± 0.035</p></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p id="Par24">As for PVDF-A, the FTIR spectra of PVDF-B (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">S1</xref> in the SI) confirm that the backsheet is predominantly PVDF α-phase. Figure <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows two regions of the PVDF-B spectra, focusing on the β-phase- specific vibrations found at 840 cm<sup>−1</sup> and 1275 cm<sup>−1</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The intensity ratio between the peaks at 1275 cm<sup>−1</sup> (β-phase) and 1180 cm<sup>−1</sup> (α-phase) is summarized in Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. FTIR suggests that the largest increase in the β-phase formation occurs after DH weathering, and a small increase occurs after MAST and outdoor weathering in India, but a decrease is seen after UV and TC. It is clear that the trends in relative quantification of the β-phase from WAXS do not correspond to those from FTIR. In addition, WAXS does not suggest the presence of β-phase in any of the PVDF-A samples, whereas FTIR shows the presence of β-phase and its increase after C-AST, MAST, and TC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A small amount of β-phase formed locally on the studied PVDF backsheets was also observed by Weiser et al. when performing multiple FTIR measurements<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>FTIR spectra of PVDF-B, focusing on the regions of spectra specific to PVDF β-phase.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41598_2022_18477_Fig6_HTML.png" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par25">The differences in identification and quantification of the PVDF β-phase from WAXS and FTIR spectra may be related to differences in how the two techniques interact with the sample as well as the location and depth of the measurements. In FTIR, the infrared light absorbed by the sample depends on the presence of specific covalent bonds. FTIR collects data from an area of 1.8 mm—defined by the crystal used—and it is a surface-sensitive technique with depth penetration of approximately 2 μm. Although WAXS also probes the sample on the atomic scale, the measurement is done on a 100 μm diameter spot and throughout the entire backsheet layer thickness. Furthermore, UV damage is typically only present within a few micrometers of the surface, and therefore FTIR may be more sensitive to this type of degradation. In contrast, thermal degradation affects the entire backsheet thickness, and thus WAXS is better at identifying it. Previous studies have suggested that β-phase may form locally in regions with large deformation, such as in proximity of a crack tip<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Further investigation of this region is necessary to draw conclusions about the formation of β-phase and its relation to backsheet failure. This work indicates that a small amount of β-phase may coexist with α-phase locally, but there is no evidence of excessive β-phase formation after outdoor or accelerated weathering.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par26">This work focuses on understanding the changes in material properties that lead to mechanical failure of PVDF-based backsheets in the field. PVDF chemical degradation, changes in polymer degree of crystallinity, and phase transformation are discussed. The PVDF-based backsheets studied here underwent various single (UV, DH, TC), sequential (MAST), and combined (C-AST) accelerated stress tests with the goal of finding the most suitable test to replicate premature backsheet degradation in the field.</p><p id="Par27">The complexity of the PVDF-based layer in backsheets arises from the fact that its composition (PMMA content, additives, and pigments), structure, and fabrication process will affect its chemistry, crystallography, and corresponding mechanical properties. This work showed that combined or sequential aging can lead to PMMA loss from the backsheet, regardless of whether the PMMA is exposed to the environment or protected by a PVDF matrix. DSC and WAXS techniques identified a significant increase in crystallinity in fielded backsheets from Arizona and India, and the increase in crystallinity in PVDF-based backsheets was also reproduced to some extent with MAST and C-AST aging. The changes in crystallinity occurred through an increase of PVDF α-phase, which is the dominant phase in the studied backsheets. FTIR and WAXS confirmed the local presence of the PVDF β-phase; however, the exact location of β-phase formation and its correlation with specific test conditions are inconclusive. No excessive β-phase formation was observed after the field or accelerated tests, suggesting that it was the overall increase in crystallinity that caused polymer embrittlement and consequent cracking in the studied samples. Further investigation of the local β-phase formation and its relation to cracking is ongoing.</p><p id="Par28">Single-stress test conditions (UV, DH, TC) alone did not show evidence of PMMA depletion or a significant increase in PVDF crystallinity, corresponding to the absence of backsheet failure in the form of cracking. Of the studied tests, the MAST sequence was the most extreme, producing excessive PVDF degradation. Neither of the single or sequential tests closely replicated the degradation mechanisms seen in the fielded backsheets; however, the MAST test was useful in identifying weaknesses in the material that led to failure. Although C-AST cannot be directly compared to the fielded samples, it was successful in replicating PVDF backsheet cracking during the “desert” sequence, while limiting the excessive PMMA degradation observed in MAST. Despite the fact that C-AST and MAST tests did not completely replicate the complex nature of the outdoor environment, both tests are valid for screening outdoor failure mechanisms in PVDF backsheets.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Funding was provided as part of the Durable Modules Consortium (DuraMAT), funded under Agreement 32509 by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy (EERE) and Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO).
