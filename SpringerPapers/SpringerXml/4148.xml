of short-wavelength infrared (SWIR, 1,000–2,000 nm) detector technology have recently inspired a new wave of optical fluorescence imaging, as longer imaging wavelengths promise increased spatiotemporal resolution, penetration depths and unprecedented sensitivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, with the emergence of SWIR imaging, the shortage of high-quality SWIR-emissive fluorophores has never been more apparent: the ideal imaging probe needs to exhibit high brightness for fast imaging speeds and narrow emission profiles that can be tuned over the entire SWIR camera sensitivity range for multiplexed and wavelength-selective imaging. Furthermore, probes should exhibit high stability of the quantum yield (QY) and wavelength of the emission peak, both under laser irradiance as well as during long-term storage. Lastly, and with respect to potential probe commercialization, fluorophore synthesis should run reproducibly at high yields.</p><p id="Par4">Indium arsenide (InAs) quantum dots (QDs) are among the most promising SWIR probes to address these challenges<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, as they exhibit size-tunable emission, broad absorption spectra, and show higher QYs than rare earth nanocrystals (NCs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, silver chalcogenide NCs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, or organic SWIR dyes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. While much recent SWIR imaging has focused on carbon nanotubes (CNTs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, the low QYs (&lt;0.1%) and broad emission profiles of as-synthesized CNT ensembles have rendered imaging in narrow spectral windows and multiplexed imaging applications challenging. In contrast to other SWIR QDs, such as PbS or Ag<sub>2</sub>S, InAs QDs can exhibit higher QYs and probe stability after transfer from the organic phase to aqueous media<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. This is mostly attributed to the zincblende crystal structure of InAs QDs that allows the straightforward overcoating with a higher band gap shell consisting of established II–VI QD materials, which isolates the InAs core from the environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, the synthesis of large, SWIR-emissive, InAs NCs with narrow emission linewidths remains challenging and conventional syntheses require additional post-synthetic purification, which drastically reduces reaction yields. Thus, to obtain fluorescent emitters in the red edge of the sensitivity range of SWIR cameras, small, near-infrared-emissive InAs QDs have been commonly overcoated with other materials to form quasi type-II heterostructures, which further redshift the emission. InAs-based QDs emitting beyond 1,400 nm have previously been characterized by low QYs (with the best reported value to our knowledge of 2.5%), and photobleaching of 50% after 2 h of irradiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we present an improved understanding of the underlying mechanisms of InAs QD growth and describe a new synthetic route that overcomes the shortcomings of previous methods. Our approach enables the synthesis of InAs QDs with narrow emission (&lt;135 meV linewidths) tunable from 700–1,200 nm without employing size-selective purification procedures. Based on these InAs QD cores, we develop improved core-shell-shell (CSS) QDs that span the entire sensitivity range of modern SWIR cameras (900–1,600 nm, <ext-link xlink:href="http://www.princetoninstruments.com/products/imcam/nirvana/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.princetoninstruments.com/products/imcam/nirvana/</ext-link>), exhibit QYs up to 82%, and show drastically improved probe stability both under laser irradiance and during long-term storage. With QYs of 16% at the red edge of the sensitivity range of SWIR cameras, our probes are more than six times brighter than previously published InAs-based QD systems and further maintain high QYs in aqueous media after phase transfer. Ultimately, we demonstrate how our SWIR fluorophores exhibit a 2–3 order of magnitude higher QY than CNTs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> across the entire sensitivity range of SWIR cameras and demonstrate their use in non-invasive through-skull fluorescence imaging in mice. The improved material properties position our InAs CSS QDs as the material of choice for SWIR fluorescence imaging and suggest possible use in other applications such as SWIR LEDs, photovoltaics, photodetectors and photon upconversion devices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Current challenges in the synthesis of InAs QDs</title><p id="Par6">Most synthetic approaches towards the growth of InAs QDs can be divided into two categories, based on the choice of the indium precursor. On one hand, the use of indium halides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> typically yields NCs with sizes ranging from 2–6 nm, though syntheses require size-selective purification to obtain narrow size distributions with well-defined absorption features, which is costly and impractical to scale up. In contrast, syntheses that use indium carboxylates are able to obtain narrow size distributions without requiring size-selective precipitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. However, these syntheses rely on an interparticle ripening process as a primary growth mechanism. Thus, the obtainable NC size range remains limited to small sizes and denies access to QDs emitting in the sensitivity range of SWIR cameras.</p><p id="Par7">To address the existing challenges in the synthesis of InAs QDs, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms that govern particle formation and growth. Predictions from theoretical growth models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> and experimental results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> for II–VI and IV–VI QD systems suggest that tight control of precursor conversion rates will result in the ability to tune size and size-distribution of the resulting QD samples. Recent results of Hendricks <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> have elegantly shown how chalcogenide precursors with different reactivities can be used to synthesize a broad size range of cadmium sulfide and lead sulfide QDs with narrow emission profiles at full reaction yields. While for those systems, precursor conversion and particle growth occur on similar timescales, we have previously shown that for common III–V QD syntheses the group-V precursors employed are consumed on a much faster timescale than the actual NC growth, implying that QD growth is dominated by non-molecular ripening processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Based on this observation, it was widely believed that less-reactive group-V precursors would be able to improve the control of III–V QD syntheses, which inspired multiple groups to examine group-V precursor reactivity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, it has recently been shown that changes in precursor reactivity play an unexpectedly minor role in the growth of III–V QDs and do not enable the synthesis of large InAs crystals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The role of precursor conversion rates</title><p id="Par8">Precursor conversion rate (Eq. 1) is a function of the precursor reactivity, manifested in the precursor conversion rate constant <italic>k</italic>, as well as the time-dependent concentration of precursor molecules in the reaction mixture.<disp-formula id="Equ1"><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2016_Article_BFncomms12749_Equ1_HTML.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p id="Par9">Following this rationale, we investigated to what extent control of the time-dependent precursor concentration could improve the synthesis of InAs QDs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1a<bold>–</bold>c</xref> shows a typical hot-injection synthesis of InAs QDs, using an excess of indium carboxylates and tris(trimethylgermyl)arsine, (TMGe)<sub>3</sub>As, as precursors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Due to the high reactivity of (TMGe)<sub>3</sub>As, both precursors are rapidly consumed upon mixing and, following nucleation, the size of the QDs barely changes over the remaining course of the reaction, as indicated by the minimal (&lt;100 nm) change in the peak wavelength of the emission (<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1c</xref>). Additionally, if the reaction is left in this state for an extended period of time, we observe a strong broadening of the size distribution, here reflected by the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the photoluminescence (PL) peak. This is evidence for the onset of Ostwald ripening, which increases the mean particle size through interparticle interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Growth mechanisms for InAs QDs.</title><p>Schematic representation of the temporal evolution of precursor concentration during (<bold>a</bold>) a typical hot-injection synthesis of InAs QDs and (<bold>d</bold>) during a combination of hot and continuous injection. As a single injection supplies all precursor material at the beginning of the reaction, growth is primarily dominated by interparticle ripening, leading to a small overall growth of nanocrystals that is correlated with a broadening of the size distribution at long time scales (<bold>b</bold>,<bold>c</bold>). If a single injection, however, is followed by a slow, continuous supply of precursor material, the system can be maintained in a prolonged size-focusing regime, giving access to large nanocrystals with narrow size distributions (<bold>e</bold>,<bold>f</bold>).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="JPEG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2016_Article_BFncomms12749_Fig1_HTML.jpg"/></fig></p><p id="Par10">In our new approach, we only employ 10% of the total amount of arsenic precursor used in <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1a<bold>–</bold>c</xref> to induce a nucleation event and supply the residual amount slowly via a syringe pump. As the time scale of precursor reactivity is much faster than the precursor addition rate, the precursor conversion rate and thus QD growth is ultimately limited by the precursor supply. Consequently, this method allows the precursor conversion kinetics to be independently tuned in the nucleation and growth stages by precisely adjusting the time-dependent precursor concentration profile via syringe pump. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1d,e</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1785">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> show how such an approach allows the continuous growth of NCs with tunable emission from 700–1,200 nm while maintaining narrow size distributions. Further, we note that the decoupling of the precursor reactivity and growth kinetics offered by our method enables the growth of QDs from reactive precursors at high reaction temperatures (295 °C), which improve crystal quality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Kinetic insights into III–V QD growth</title><p id="Par11">To probe the extent to which precursor addition rate affects QD growth, we varied the injection speed of the arsenic precursor ((TMGe)<sub>3</sub>As) from 0.15 ml h<sup>−1</sup> to 1 ml h<sup>−1</sup> to 2 ml h<sup>−1</sup>. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2a</xref> shows that for all three injection speeds an initial size-focusing is observed. However, for the fastest addition rate the QD size distribution significantly broadens after about 50% of the reaction time, yielding a bimodal final size distribution evident from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and two distinct PL peaks. We observed a similar trend in size broadening for the intermediate injection speed, which we found to be caused by shape anisotropy (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1785">Supplementary Note 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1785">Supplementary Figs 2 and 3</xref>). By contrast, synthesis at the slowest injection speed yields a narrow emission peak at about 1,200 nm and a unimodal size distribution.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Kinetic insights into the growth of InAs QDs.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Influence of the injection rate on the extent of size-focusing. At early stages of QD growth, size-focusing appears invariant to injection speed. However, at later stages, QD growth slows down and fast injection speeds lead to a secondary nucleation event, resulting in a bimodal size distribution, as identified by TEM and two distinct PL peaks (the feature at 1,200 nm in the emission spectrum of the 1 ml h<sup>−1</sup> injection rate originates from solvent reabsorption). Slow injection speeds, however, are able to maintain the system in a size-focused regime, providing access to large particles with narrow size distributions. (<bold>b</bold>) Variation of injection speed during growth within a single synthesis shows the capabilities of our approach. At the beginning of the reaction fast injection speeds bring the system into a size-focusing regime. As soon as growth slows down, as can be seen from the PL peak values slowly converging over time, size-broadening sets in.

Specifically, given that the injection rate is constant during each of the three experiments shown in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, the varying extent of size focusing at different injection rates implies that the precursor demand by the growing NCs changes over the course of the synthesis. Because we obtain improved results at the slowest injection rate, we consider that the size-broadening at late times results from an excess of converted precursor in the growth solution, which indicates that NC growth slows down as NC size increases.</p><p id="Par14">To test this hypothesis, we demonstrate that the growth of InAs QDs can be reversibly switched between a size-focusing and a size-broadening state via gradual adjustment of the injection speed from fast to slow (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2b</xref>). As seen in <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2a</xref>, size-focusing occurs at the beginning of the reaction even at elevated injection speeds as the growth of small particles is fast enough to accommodate for high precursor concentrations. As crystals reach a size of ∼4.5 nm, QD growth slows down, and the PL peak saturates around 1.2 eV. Meanwhile, the PL FWHM drastically increases from 120 to 220 meV. Upon slowing down precursor injection speed to 0.15 ml h<sup>−1</sup>, we note a second onset of NC growth, indicated by a redshift of the emission peak. Importantly, this NC growth is accompanied by a narrowing of the PL FWHM, showing that we have switched the system from a size-broadening state back into a size-focusing growth regime.</p><p id="Par15">Together our results reveal that the ideal growth conditions for InAs QDs significantly differ for smaller clusters and larger particles.

Samples with emission peaks between 1,000 and 1,400 nm were measured using a liquid nitrogen cooled InGaAs line camera (Princeton Instruments; OMA V, 512 × 1 pixels).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>PL quantum yield</title><p id="Par33">QY measurements were obtained using an integrating sphere (Labsphere RTC-060-SF). The sample was illuminated using a 785 nm diode laser with an excitation power of 25 mW that was chopped at 210 Hz. The output was collected using a calibrated germanium detector (Newport: 818-IR) through a Stanford Research Systems lock-in amplifying system. A coloured glass longpass filter (Schott Glass RG800 or RG850) was used to block the excitation beam. The sample was placed in a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) capped quartz cuvette and a solvent blank was used to ensure a consistent environment inside the integrating sphere. The measured photocurrent was adjusted to account for the external quantum efficiency of the detector when calculating the QY. Finally, the measured QY was corrected to account for leakage of the excitation light and the transmittance of the filter.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>PL lifetimes</title><p id="Par34">To measure PL dynamics by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), samples (solutions in glass vials) were excited by a train of 532 nm, ∼80 ps-duration pulses at a repetition rate of 500 kHz generated by a laser diode (PicoQuant; LDH-P-FA-530B). The 2 μs waiting time between pulses ensured that the delayed fluorescence decayed below the noise floor of the detector (&lt;10<sup>−3</sup> of the peak signal under these conditions). The pump was attenuated to yield 10–100 nW of average excitation power, to ensure a stop rate of ∼5%, and focused to a ∼200 μm diameter excitation spot at the sample. Under these low-fluence excitation conditions, the PL decay dynamics are independent of excitation intensity. The emission from the NCs was collected and imaged onto an InGaAs/InP single-photon counting avalanche photodiode (Micro Photon Devices; $IR-DH-025-C), fitted with a long-pass filter (Chroma Technology Corp.; EP900LP) to suppress the scattered photons from the visible pump. The detector was operated asynchronously from the laser source, with a 2 MHz gate frequency and a 90% duty cycle. Using a PicoQuant PicoHarp and standard software, a decay trace histogram was generated by correlating the times of detection events with the proximal trigger from the pump laser. The time resolution/instrument response, judged from the onset of the response to the impulsive excitation, was ∼300 ps. Accordingly, the measured data are presented without deconvolution, as their most rapid dynamics are more than an order of magnitude slower than the instrument response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>TEM images</title><p id="Par35">All TEM images were acquired on a JOEL 2010 Advanced High Performance TEM operating at 200 KV with a lanthanum hexaboride cathode.
