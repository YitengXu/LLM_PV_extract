Metals and alloys electrodeposited under constant magnetic field have greater thickness and smoother surface with finest grains. Metallic materials deposited under the influence of uniform magnetic field may have stronger corrosion resistance, than those obtained without the presence of magnetic field. Constant magnetic field also causes an increase of the electropolymerization rate and yield of some organic reactions. Our research also shows that the presence of constant magnetic field affects the electrodeposition process of alloys and their morphology to a great extent. The effects of magnetic field on metals, alloys, composites, polymers and other materials are due to the Lorentz force and the magnetohydrodynamic effect. It is possible that the further development of magnetoelectrodeposition will allow for using the constant magnetic field to improve the properties of metal coatings, alloys, polymers, and other materials in the industry.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Constant magnetic field

id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Effects of constant magnetic field on electrolysis have been studied for 40 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] on such objects as metals, metal alloys, composites, and polymers.</p><p id="Par3">A number of reviews of magnetic field effects have been published during the 40 years of research including very helpful reviews by Fahidy of 1973 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and 1983 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The author explained and reviewed the effects of magnetic field on the properties of electrolyte, electrode kinetics, mass transport, and changes in electrodeposited metal properties. Almost 20 years later, Fahidy wrote another paper in which he reviewed constant magnetic field effects on metal surfaces. In 1995, Tacken and Janssen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] published a review “Applications of magnetoelectrolysis” in which they described practical applications of magnetic field in electrochemistry. In 2014, Monzon and Coey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] wrote a review paper about Lorentz force and its influence on electrodeposition. The aforementioned review works are invaluable for any scientist who works with constant magnetic field. However, in the recent years, scientists have carried out many new studies which are not included in the previous review papers. Analyses and summaries of this recent research may lead to a better understanding of magnetic field effects on chemical processes. The aim of this paper is to present and summarize the most important discoveries and research on the effects of constant magnetic field on the selected compounds and to verify how the magnetic field affects the properties of metals, alloys, polymers, and other materials, thus to describe these phenomena and establish the reasons for them. Our paper also aims to popularize magnetoelectrochemistry, which is still a little known field of chemistry, in the scientific community.</p><p id="Par4">Studies described in this paper prove that the application of constant magnetic field in electrodeposition processes offers many possibilities. Along with the development of science, we find that magnetoelectrodeposition makes it possible to obtain improved properties of deposits or to reduce the electrodeposition time. The forces and phenomena arising during the electrodeposition under constant magnetic field are not yet fully understood and described, but researches still develop new explanations and equations and also look for new applications of magnetoelectrolysis. The subject of magnetic field effects is very wide. In addition to uniform magnetic field effects, researchers also study non-uniform magnetic fields and possibilities of their influence on chemical processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Inhomogeneous magnetic fields may cause changes in fluid flow, concentration, and convection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Because of the wide scope of the subject, our paper focuses only on uniform magnetic field.</p><p id="Par5">The effect of magnetic field on electrolysis may be due to its influence on mass transport, reaction kinetics, or metal deposition/dissolution. The first phenomenon which explains the effects of magnetic field, due to mass transport, is magnetohydrodynamic effect (MHD effect). In Moffatt’s paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], we read that MHD phenomena are caused by the interaction of velocity fields with electromagnetic fields. MHD effect is connected with “effects that arise through the interaction of the motion of the fluid and any ambient magnetic field.” The Lorentz force (<italic>F</italic>) is the total force, which acts on a charged molecule moving in an electromagnetic field and is expressed by the equation:<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><mml:math display="block" id="Equ1_Math"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">→</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>q</mml:mi><mml:mfenced close=")" open="("><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">→</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>υ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">→</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="true">→</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:math><tex-math id="Equ1_TeX">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

That force causes the increase of mass transport effect in the solution. The Lorentz force causes movement of the electrolyte which is near to the electrode surface due to the convective flow of the whole volume of the electrolyte. It causes a decrease in the thickness of the Nernst layer which is connected to the increase of the limiting current density.</p><p id="Par6">Under the influence of constant magnetic field, Navier-Stokes hydrodynamic layer is formed. The Navier-Stokes layer has an impact on the flow velocity of electroactive species to the working electrode.</p><p id="Par7">The effects of magnetic field may also be connected with electrokinetic-magnetohydrodynamic effect. It only concerns the diffuse double layer in the vicinity of the electrode. Under magnetic field, the charge moves across the diffuse double layer and this movement creates nonelectrostatic field.

O’Reilly and Hinds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] predicate that the paramagnetic gradient force causes the movement of magnetic ions in the diffusion layer. The ions move in directions which are opposite to the applied magnetic field. However, the most important role in the diffusion layer is the concentration gradient force, which is a driving force for diffusion. The paramagnetic force, which is present only in the diffusion layer, acts in parallel to the driving force for diffusion. In aqueous electrolytes at the room temperature, the typical values of paramagnetic force and driving force for diffusion are 10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>10</sup> N/m<sup>3</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], respectively. Therefore, the ratio of these two forces may be negligible. Hinds and Coey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] published studies which show that the paramagnetic force does not cause any visible effects in electrochemistry.</p><p id="Par9">In the paper about electrodeposition, it is necessary to write about the hydrogen evolution. This phenomenon accompanies each electrode reaction in the aqueous media and can change the properties of deposits. Hydrogen formed during the electrochemical reaction may deteriorate the properties of the electrodeposited metals or alloys. The atomic hydrogen, formed on the surface of the coatings, is adsorbed and evolves into molecular hydrogen. Recombination of atomic hydrogen to the molecular form generates pressure and causes fractures in the surface of the obtained metals or alloys. This phenomenon is called hydrogen embrittlement. Even small amounts of hydrogen in the coating spaces can increase the brittleness of metal or alloy. Constant magnetic field is a factor which increases the production of hydrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The influence of hydrogen evolution on coating surface depends on orientation of the electrode and magnetic field. An electrode in downward horizontal facing orientation is more exposed to the attachment of hydrogen bubbles. A magnetic field which is perpendicular to the current density lines causes the surface of the electrode to be more susceptible to attachment of hydrogen bubbles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Metals</title><p id="Par10">Some of the electrolytically obtained materials are metal coatings. In order to deposit a metal on the surface of the electrode, it is necessary to apply such voltage that will generate the overpotential. The electrodeposition of metals can be divided into three steps:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par11">Providing ions to the diffusion layer</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par12">Transition of electrons through electrolyte—electrode phase boundary and electrochemical reduction of ions and adsorption on the surface of the electrode</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par13">Electrocrystallization—transfer of the species onto the electrode surface and growth of the coating structure</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par14">The rate of electrodeposition process is determined by the slowest step. Therefore, if the first step is the slowest one, the process is a mass transport-controlled reaction. If the charge transfer step is the slowest one, the reaction is controlled kinetically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Metal coatings are commonly used for protection against corrosion and mechanical damage of various materials. Metal electrodeposition is useful in many industries: in the medical industry (manufacturing of surgical or dental instruments), in electroplating industry (strengthening of the working parts of machines), or in jewelry production (as decorative coatings). New applications of the metal electrodeposition emerge together with the technological development. Thin metal films, metal nanostructures, and alloys may be used in fabrication of thermoelectric devices, such as coolers and power generators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Metal surface modification processes, such as titanium anodizing, are widely used in the medical industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Controlling the electrodeposition parameters can allow to obtain different properties of the metal coatings. Constant magnetic field applied during metal electrodeposition may cause changes in the electrolysis process and in the deposit properties; therefore, there are many possibilities for its usage in almost every area in which electrodeposition is used. In this section, the issue of how the application of constant magnetic field affects electrodeposition process and received coatings will be discussed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Diamagnets</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Copper</title><p id="Par16">In 1998–2001, G.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] published works concerning magnetic field effects on copper electrolysis. The aim of those studies was to investigate the influence of constant magnetic fields on the electrochemical behavior of Cu<sup>2+</sup>/Cu redox system in an aqueous medium. At LSV (linear sweep voltammetry) voltammograms recorded in pH = 0.5 and 3.5, the current density was observed to increase with the increase of magnetic field magnitude in the mass transport regime on the cathodic and anodic branch. Similar requests were obtained in 2007 by Marsushima and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. They investigated copper potentiostatic electrodeposition from 1.85 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and 0.6 M CuSO<sub>4</sub> with a sheet of copper as an anode. Electrodeposition of copper was carried in the magnetic field up to 5 T.

In order to investigate the effects of constant magnetic field on the surface morphology of the copper electrodeposited on glassy carbon electrode from CuSO<sub>4</sub> at pH = 0.5 Hinds et al.

It can be observed that copper films which are electrodeposited in the presence of a magnetic field have a rougher surface than those which were obtained in the absence of a magnetic field. XRD spectra showed that there is no appreciable effect of the field on the crystal structure and texture of the electrodeposited copper. Interesting results, shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, were obtained by observation of fractal electrodeposits formed in the absence and presence of the magnetic field.

There were effects of magnetic field on mass transport-controlled regimes and no effects on the reaction kinetics. Firstly, in cases of all diamagnetic metals under magnetic field, the current density increased. The second effect that was discovered in the described studies is the change in morphology of the electrodeposits. The deposits of copper are less dendritic under the magnetic field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], which can be caused the nature of electrochemical process. Dendritic structure is connected with full diffusion-control processes, which means that the structure obtained under magnetic field is due to mixed-control process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. An interesting effect of the magnetic field is the shape of obtained fractal deposits of diamagnets. Effects of magnetic field on growth of fractal electrodeposits depend on orientations of applied field. Patterns of fractal electrodeposits are the result of Lorentz force and natural convection acting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Chirality of these patterns depends on the direction of the applied field. Fractal deposits are chiral when magnetic field is perpendicular to the area of their growth and when the magnetic field is in the plane; their patterns are asymmetrical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Both electrochemical and morphological changes in electrodeposition of diamagnets are due to the increase of mass transport rate under the influence of magnetic field. The decrease in current density is caused by the convective flow of electrolyte near to the electrode surface and the decrease of the Nernst layer. The limiting current density (<italic>I</italic><sub>L</sub>) depends on the strength of the magnetic field. For many years, scientists have been trying to find the comprehensive equation of limiting current density on magnetic field strength.

Electrodeposition of nickel was carried out at the constant current density, using nickel sulfamate, nickel chloride, and boric acid solution with 1-T magnetic field. It was observed that the overpotential decreased during electrodeposition of nickel in the presence of magnetic field. The decrease of overpotential is due to the increase of the microroughness of deposit—current density increases in greater true surface. Another explanation of this phenomenon is connected with Lorentz force, which lowers the concentration gradient and, in consequence, increases the deposition rate and decreases the overpotential. The increase of the limiting current, which occurs during metal electrodeposition under magnetic field, causes growth of fine-grained nickel electrodeposits as opposed to laminar type structures in absence of the magnetic field. STM, XRD, and SEM techniques show that spherical nanoparticles were formed in the magnetic field. As demonstrated by that research, in the presence of magnetic field, the overpotential decreases with time and rest potential shifts during electrolysis.</p><p id="Par34">Similar studies were carried out later by Bund and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].

This effect is a significantly negative shift in the rest potential, which results from domain movements in the ferromagnetic metal. As suggested in Ganesh’s paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], this change of the rest potential is due to the shift in chemical potential of the electrodes. In the case of ferromagnetic metals, electrons of opposite spins have different densities of states in the Fermi energy levels. This difference causes the shift of chemical potential in the electron system of ferromagnetic electrode. At the electrode-solution interface, the shift of the electrode potential occurs.</p><p id="Par40">The smaller size of metal grains under magnetic field may be explained by the enhancement of the ions mass transfer.

It can be assumed that in electrodeposition of metals under the influence of magnetic field, the evolution of hydrogen is an important factor, which affects the electrochemical process and the morphology of electrodeposits.

The resulting hydrogen bubbles may cause the formation of holes in the obtained electrodeposits. The presence of magnetic field accelerates the desorption of hydrogen bubbles and thus, results in the formation of more homogenous deposits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It is worth mentioning that more noble metals are more exposed to the hydrogen formation. Hydrogen is absorbed to a greater extent on the surface of those metals, which have low overpotential of hydrogen formation.

The lowest corrosion rate of Zn-Ni alloy (which means the highest corrosion resistance) is obtained under 0.8-T perpendicular magnetic field. Under the influence of the magnetic field, the topography of the alloy has changed as well. In 0.8-T magnetic field the topography was smooth and compact, in contrast to 1-T field application which caused the formation of a more porous surface.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Ni-Cd</title><p id="Par46">The same researchers in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] investigated the effects of magnetic field on Ni-Cd alloys electrodeposited at the constant current density on mild steel.

In the presence of perpendicular magnetic field, the thickness of alloy was observed to decrease and its microhardness to increase. The corrosion rate, in the case of both directions of the field, is lower than in the absence of the field and decreases up to 0.8 T. In 0.8-T perpendicular magnetic field, the corrosion resistance is about 35 times higher than without magnetic field.

The reason for this phenomena may be due to the cobalt mass transport rate, which increases because of magnetic convection. The deposition potential of less noble metals shifts through the interactions between components and the codeposition of cobalt and other metals becomes possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The situation is different in the case of an alloy with two ferromagnetic metals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. At a high potential, the amount of the more noble metal was lower in the alloy electrodeposited under magnetic field.

Firstly, in the cited studies, the thickness of the alloy was smaller under magnetic field perpendicular to the applied current density. This phenomenon is caused by a decrease of the diffusion layer thickness. When the perpendicular magnetic field is applied, the Lorentz force acts on the ions and causes an increase of mass transport rate and hydrogen evolution. Enhanced hydrogen evolution tendency causes a decrease of the deposit thickness. This phenomenon is not pronounced in parallel magnetic field. The increase in the alloys hardness is caused by magnetohydrodynamic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]—increased homogeneity of the surface causes the dislocation movement, which results in hardening of the coating.

On the surface of the substrate, the number of nucleating centers increase, which causes more chain-like structure and easier growth of polymer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. In the case of parallel magnetic field, the polymer crystallinity increases because of MHD effect. This effect causes proper alignment of the polymer species. The increase in the polymer crystallinity is a result of the alignment of rings and chains of the polymer at the right angle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The increase of polymers molecular weight is also due to the orientation of polymer chains and bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Organic reactions</title><p id="Par72">Zieliński et al. investigated the effects of magnetic field on the Kabachnik-Fields reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] and the aza-Pudovik reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>].

Then, the formation of aminophosphonates IIIa-IIIf was carried out under and without magnetic field. The conversion rates of the reaction carried out under magnetic field were higher than those obtained without magnetic field, which proves that magnetic field has accelerating properties in aza-Pudovik reaction. Those results can be explained by the spin reversal due to energetic conditions, which consequently allows to transfer the molecule in its excited level.<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 13</label><caption xml:lang="en"><p>Scheme of aza-Pudovik reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="GIF" xlink:href="MediaObjects/10008_2017_3875_Fig13_HTML.gif" id="MO13"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec34"><title>Cellulase</title><p id="Par75">In 2009, Chinese scientists investigated the influence of 0.15-, 0.30-, and 0.45-T constant magnetic field on cellulase activity. The studies showed that constant magnetic field can improve the activity of cellulase at various temperatures and pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. The authors explained that this phenomenon may be due to the availability of the substrate to the cellulase. Therefore, the enzyme subjected to the constant magnetic field has greater affinity to its substrate—it may be connected with the structural changes of cellulase.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Future applications of constant magnetic field</title><p id="Par76">A multitude of applications of constant magnetic field gives prospects for its application in many branches of industry, science, or medicine. Magnetic field effects on increasing the corrosion resistance of metals or acceleration of electrodeposition rate of metallic alloys provide many opportunities to improve the properties of metallic coatings in electroplating. The presence of magnetic field effects has also been confirmed in organic chemistry—acceleration of organic reactions rate and increase of their efficiency offers the possibility of carrying out organic reactions which take too long without magnetic field influence. Also, the chemistry of polymers may be developed using magnetic field, because of its influence on electropolymerization rate. Constant magnetic field is already used in clinical applications, for example in biomagnetic separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] of bacteria, cells or macromolecules for better detection and analysis. Strong magnetic fields seem to be a useful tool to improve properties of processed metals in materials engineering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Magnetic field may prove useful in the wastewater treatment. There are some promising results for the use of magnetic field in the removal of volatile organic compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. There are also numerous papers describing the influence of constant magnetic field on living organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].</p><p id="Par77">The use of constant magnetic field in chemistry is interesting because of many possible applications. It creates opportunities to improve the well-known processes (such as electrodeposition or electropolymerization). However, constant magnetic field effects on more complex processes are still not fully understood. Finding a solution to this problem and new applications of constant magnetic field could be interesting for scientists in various subjects, in particular chemists or physicists.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Summary</title><p id="Par78">Effects of constant magnetic field on chemical processes are a branch of science that is still developing. In the recent years, there have been many studies and numerous theories concerning magnetoelectrochemistry have been formulated. Analysis of the published studies investigating the influence of constant magnetic field on chemical reactions allowed to find several types of magnetic field effects. Firstly, electrodeposition, electropolymerization, and some organic reactions occur faster under constant magnetic field. The surface of metal and alloy coatings obtained in the presence of magnetic field is smoother, and their grains are finer. Uniform magnetic field, applied during electrodeposition, improves corrosion resistance of some coatings. Constant magnetic field also accelerates the transport of H<sup>+</sup> to the cathode surface and the desorption of hydrogen bubbles. Electrodeposition current of metals is shifted as a result of magnetic field presence, and in the case of ferromagnets, the rest potential is shifted as well.</p><p id="Par79">The effects of constant magnetic field have not been fully investigated yet. There is no uniform model for controlling constant magnetic field in electrodeposition. Nevertheless, the studies described in this paper demonstrate that constant magnetic field can be widely used in electrochemistry and electrodeposition industries. This is the reason why it is useful to study those phenomena and work on further development of magnetoelectrochemistry.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref-list><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Monzon</surname><given-names>LMA</given-names></name><name><surname>Coey</surname><given-names>JMD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title xml:lang="en">Magnetic fields in electrochemistry: the Lorentz force.
