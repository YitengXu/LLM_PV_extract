To prolong their service life and protect them from wear and tear in dynamic application environments, great efforts have been devoted to rendering soft materials self-healable without compromising their intrinsic softness. A popular strategy is incorporating weak non-covalent interactions into existing soft polymeric networks capable of recombining after damage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. However, the inherently weak bond strength of non-covalent interactions inevitably imposes an upper limit in fracture energy (a definition of toughness) around ≈0.1–1.0 kJ m<sup>−2</sup> or less. This limitation causes soft self-healing materials easily start to break at the site of microcrack exposed during deformation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, thus severely reducing or even depriving the operation reliability of their integrated stretchable devices. To address this limitation, double cross-link strategies based on two kinds of non-covalent interactions with different binding strengths have been implemented, in which the rupture of relatively weak interactions can realize reversible energy dissipation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Nonetheless, it still does not lead to a qualitative leap in terms of fracture energy. As predicted by Lake and Thomas, the threshold fracture energy (minimum energy necessary to break elastomeric network) of a covalent elastomer scales with <italic>J</italic>, where <italic>J</italic> is chemical energy per covalent bond<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Consequently, the stronger the bond strength, the tougher the elastomer becomes in theory; however, there is always a trade-off between the self-healing ability and bond strength<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. To circumvent this contradiction, soft self-healing polymers have been toughened by introducing permanent molecular-scale covalent crosslinks into reversible networks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, by incorporating stiff yet incompatible polymers/oligomers to form nano-/micro-scale phase separation structure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, or by embedding meso-/macro-scale rigid fillers into polymer matrix to transfer local stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. The optimizations of networks, structures or fillers at different scales are therefore expected to dramatically enhance fracture energy through increasing mechanical dissipation in regions around crack, but always at the cost of intrinsic softness (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">Our strategy is inspired by the soft yet tough smooth muscle tissue of animal’s small vessels that can withstand drastic changes in blood pressure during continuous contraction and relaxation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Vascular smooth muscles compose of spindle-like smooth muscle cells (major axis: ~20 μm, minor axis: ~8 μm) dispersed in intercellular substance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The muscle cells act as the soft toughened units resisting crack growth to offer remarkable defect tolerance and high fracture toughness. In essence, smooth muscle cells typically have core-shell structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, in which their thin outer shell is enclosed by cytoskeletal filaments of relatively high strength, while the large inner core contains mostly fluid viscous substances (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). According to the multimodal toughening mechanism, the breakage of outer cytoskeletal network at small strain increases mechanical energy dissipation near the crack tip<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>; and meanwhile, the intrinsic liquid character of inner core contributes to blunting, deflecting or even vertically eliminating the crack during crack propagation at large strain (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). Since the fluid viscous substances have almost zero modulus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, it preserves the intrinsic softness of vascular smooth muscles. Altogether, such a unique structure allows vascular smooth muscles to integrate excellent compliance and high fracture toughness. Inspired by this natural design concept, we are motivated to mimic the structure of vascular smooth muscles to tremendously increase the fracture energy/toughness of soft self-healing polymers while retaining their softness to the greatest extent. However, such a biomimetic self-healing material has not been developed so far due to the extreme challenge of assembling liquid micro-droplets within soft self-healing polymer matrixes, which necessitates good compatibility, dispersibility and miscibility.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Structural design of the SSPUGIT composite.</title><p>Schematic illustration of (<bold>a</bold>) a vascular smooth muscle structure and <bold>b</bold> the corresponding structure and size of a single vascular smooth muscle cell. <bold>c</bold> Schematic illustration of multimodal toughening mechanism of vascular smooth muscle cell in pure shear process; <italic>F</italic> represents the tensile stress, while <italic>T</italic> represents the shear stress in loading. <bold>d</bold> Schematic fabrication process of vascular smooth muscle-inspired SSPUGIT composite. <bold>e</bold> Optical microscopy image of SSPUGIT composite. <bold>f</bold> Size distribution of Galinstan micro-droplets in the SSPUGIT composite from <bold>e</bold>. <bold>g</bold> Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and the corresponding elemental mapping images of the SSPUGIT composite.

The SSPU system we used to illustrate this strategy is based on dynamic hard domains concept that our laboratory had previously demonstrated for constructing soft self-healing polyureas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. As expected, soft Galinstan droplet acts like vascular smooth muscle cells that can deform with SSPU matrix along the tensile direction, causing the transverse crack to branch and then longitudinally deflect to propagation until fracture. Such an autonomous crack elimination behavior allows the biomimetic SSPU/Galinstan (SSPUGIT) material to tremendously increase mechanical dissipation compared to traditional unfilled polymers or rigid-filler-containing composites, leading to the unprecedented enhancement of defect-tolerant performances. Compared to the initial SSPU, the biomimetic SSPUGIT material exhibited significant improvement in fracture toughness and crack-resistant strain by up to 34.9 and 12.2 times, respectively, while the increase of Young’s modulus was inappreciable. Specifically, the SSPUGIT composite was completely insensitive to crack propagation, and possessed an extremely high fracture toughness of 111.16 ± 8.76 kJ m<sup>−2</sup>, which far exceeds the highest value for reported soft self-healing material, and even higher than that of Al and Zn alloys. More interestingly, assisted with the outstanding photothermal properties of vascular smooth muscle-inspired architecture assembled from Galinstan droplets under near-infrared (NIR) laser irradiation, an ultra-fast self-healing with a high healing efficiency of ~98.13% ± 1.93% was accomplished within 1 min. Our work represents an exciting and straightforward bioinspired strategy for the mass production of soft yet tough self-healing materials. The methodologies developed here showed great potential to be applied to various liquid fillers/polymer systems based on other chemistries, inspiring the design of soft self-healing materials with extremely enhanced fracture toughness for a wide range of stretchable and functional devices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Material design and fabrication strategy</title><p id="Par6">Aiming to demonstrate our bionic strategy of extremely toughening soft self-healing materials without jeopardizing their softness, a model SSPU was first synthesized by a one-pot polycondensation reaction between bis(3-aminopropyl)-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS, M<sub>n</sub> = 3000) and a mixture of trimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate (THI) and 3,3′-dimethyl-4,4′-biphenylene diisocyanate (DBI) (molar ratio, PDMS:THI:DBI = 10:6:4). Detailed polymerization procedures of SSPU and their chemical composition analysis were included in supporting information (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Our core strategy to simultaneously achieve softness and self-healing is based on the irregular self-sorting of trimethyl hexamethylene-urea (THU) and 3,3′-dimethyl-4,4′-biphenylene urea (DBU) units at a molecular level, which contributes to a highly dynamic hard domain with amorphous structure constructed by multiple hydrogen bonds (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">7</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Meanwhile, the abundant urea motifs in SSPU network are capable of forming robust coordination interactions with the gallium oxide shell of Galinstan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>, which is highly desired for the uniform dispersion of liquid Galinstan into SSPU matrix, towards a dramatic enhancement of comprehensive mechanical properties, especially the crack-resistant strain and facture toughness.</p><p id="Par7">With the exquisitely designed soft self-healing polyurea, we proceeded to fabricate vascular smooth muscle-inspired SSPUGIT composite through a hierarchical structure design at multiscale levels. Specifically, micro-scale Galinstan droplets were embedded into a SSPU matrix through coordination bonding self-assembly at molecular level (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). A monolithic sample with dimensions of 220 × 200 × 0.5 mm could be successfully fabricated, reflecting the high scalability of this technological process (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). Attenuated total reflection FTIR spectroscopy was employed to analyze the compositions of the obtained SSPUGIT (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">9</xref>). The structure of SSPUGIT was characterized by optical microscopy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). As observed, spindle Galinstan micro-droplets were uniformly dispersed in SSPUGIT to form a unique hierarchical structure instead of macro-phase separation. Such a spindle shape was similar to that of the vascular smooth muscle cell, which was attributed to the rotational orientation of Galinstan micro-droplets during continuous stirring (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">10</xref>). More interestingly, the average sizes of the spindle micro-droplets in SSPUGIT are very close to that of the vascular smooth muscle cell, i.e, their major axis and minor axis are around 24.0 μm and 6.8 μm, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). In addition, as depicted by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping images, the abundant O element on the surface of Galinstan micro-droplets confirmed the formation of thin oxide shell (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>), which is similar to the role of outer cytoskeletal network in vascular smooth muscle cell. For better comparison, a control sample (SSPUGIT-C) was fabricated by extrusion combined with hot pressing method. Since the shearing process during extrusion can break the vascular smooth muscle-like structure (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, SSPUGIT-C is an ideal model sample to demonstrate the particularity of structure on comprehensive mechanical performance.</p><p id="Par8">The chemical structure of the robust interfacial coordination interaction between Galinstan and SSPU at molecular level is shown in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">12</xref>, and further confirmed by temperature-dependent FT-IR spectra and UV–vis absorption spectra (Supplementary Figs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>).

Figure <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>h, <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">i</xref> shows the synchronous PCMW spectra of SSPU and SSPUGIT, respectively. For SSPU, two correlation cross peaks centered at 1634 cm<sup>−1</sup> (positive correlation, hydrogen-bonded –C = O motifs, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>) and 1692 cm<sup>−1</sup> (negative correlation, free –C = O motifs, Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">13</xref>) are evolved in the temperature range of 20–80 °C (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1h</xref>). These variations demonstrated that the hydrogen bonding between different urea motifs gradually broke with temperature increasing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, as for SSPUGIT composite, the negative correlation peak of free –C = O motifs disappeared during the whole heating process (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1i</xref>). These results suggested that there were no free –C = O motifs generated upon heating, which could be attributed to the formation of robust coordination interaction between –C = O motifs and gallium oxide shell<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. This idea was further verified by UV–vis absorption spectra, in which the characteristic peak of Galinstan arising from plasmon resonance exhibited a distinct red shift feature after complexing with SSPU (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">14</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. Such robust and abundant interfacial coordination interactions could facilitate the uniform dispersion of Galinstan droplets in SSPUGIT composite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, thus improving the compatibility and miscibility between Galinstan and SSPU matrix to prevent macro-phase separation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">8</xref>). As the concentration of –C = O motifs was significantly decreased in SSPU network, Galinstan droplets would agglomerate and settle to form macro-phase separation (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>), demonstrating the key role of interfacial coordination interactions to the successful imitation of vascular smooth muscle structure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Soft yet tough performance</title><p id="Par9">Due to the uniquely bionic architecture of SSPUGIT composites, their mechanical performances, especially the crack resistance and fracture toughness, had been effectively improved with intrinsic softness retained. The fracture toughness (Г) of SSPU and SSPUGIT-X (X is the mass ratio between Galinstan and SSPU) were measured using the widely adopted Rivlin-Thomas single-notch method (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The Young’s modulus (E) was recorded to evaluate the stiffness or softness, which was obtained from the slope of the initial parts in stress-strain curves (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">17</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>, the tensile curve of SSPU exhibited a typical pattern of elastomer, showing a relatively low Young’s modulus of 0.72 ± 0.02 MPa (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>) comparable to that of other soft self-healing materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. However, the crack resistance and fracture toughness of SSPU were very poor. Once a crack existed in SSPU, its fracture strain would sharply decrease due to the continuous horizontal propagation of the crack (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">e</xref>, Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">1</xref>). Specifically, the fracture strain of the intact SSPU sample was up to 1193.29 ± 12.45% (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>), while it inconceivably dropped to 121.66 ± 21.24% for the notched sample (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>), corresponding to an ultralow fracture toughness of 3.18 ± 0.51 kJ m<sup>−2</sup>. In sharp contrast, SSPUGIT composites exhibited a distinguished combination of crack resistance and fracture toughness. As the Galinstan content increased from 100 wt% to 400 wt%, the crack-resistant strain increased from 380.21 ± 34.17% to 1541.75 ± 61.32% and then decreased to 1201.48 ± 81.29%; the fracture toughness increased from 21.51 ± 3.58 to 111.16 ± 8.76 and then decreased to 69.05 ± 15.47 kJ m<sup>-2</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">16</xref>).

As shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>, after the incorporation of vast Galinstan liquid drops, the fabricated composites were still highly soft, with a low tensile modulus close to that of SSPU matrix. Such a negligible increase in modulus or stiffness may be attributed to the stronger influence of rigid Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> oxide layer on stress, and interphases formed between SSPU and Galinstan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. The optimal Galinstan content for SSPUGIT composites was 300 wt%, i.e., SSPUGIT-3, which showed a soft yet tough characteristic with the best combination of high crack-resistant strain (1541.75 ± 61.32%), high fracture toughness (111.16 ± 8.76 kJ m<sup>−2</sup>), and low Young’s modulus (0.83 ± 0.05 MPa). Compared to the initial SSPU matrix, the improvements of crack-resistant strain and fracture toughness for SSPUGIT-3 are approximately up to 12.2 and 34.9 times, respectively (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>). These huge enhancements were also visually illustrated in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>, where SSPUGIT-3 presented a remarkable crack-elimination ability that the pre-existing crack gradually widened along the tensile direction but hardly advanced into materials even at high strains (Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">3</xref>). However, SSPUGIT-3-C control sample subjected to the shearing process showed lower mechanical enhancements, i.e., its crack-resistant strain and fracture toughness were only 190.73 ± 15.34% and 5.83 ± 0.45 kJ m<sup>−2</sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>; Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM4">2</xref>), respectively, much lower than those of SSPUGIT-3. Certainly, the particularity of microstructure is the core factor related to the toughening effect (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">11</xref>). SSPUGIT-3 featured an optimized structure working on a multimodal toughening mechanism similar to vascular smooth muscle, which had the ability to efficiently deflect or even eliminate crack with enormous energy dissipation, resulting in the significant improvement of fracture toughness for composites.</p><p id="Par11">For most soft self-healing elastomers, the fracture strain of the notched samples is always smaller than that of the intact sample even though they are crack-resistant. Typically, a tough self-healing polymer, reported by Bao and co-workers, showed a crack-resistant stretching up to ~780%, which is only ~45% of the fracture strain for the intact sample (~1730%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. However, as depicted by the pure shear test of SSPUGIT-3 (the size of notch is a third of the whole width), the notched sample possessed almost the same fracture strain as the intact sample (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">15</xref>). Moreover, when we proceeded to increase the proportion of notch to two third of the width, the fracture strain retention of the notched SSPUGIT-3 was still 100% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">18</xref> and Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">3</xref>). These results suggest our SSPUGIT-3 is completely insensitive to crack in service, far superior to self-healing materials ever reported to date (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">1</xref>). Generally, low fracture toughness hinders the long-term usability of self-healing materials, especially if they are exposed to mechanical damages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Therefore, we compared the Young’s modulus and fracture toughness of SSPUGIT-3 with other self-healing materials, as showed in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref> where the gray dashed line (Γ = 18915 kN<sup>3/2</sup>m<sup>−2</sup> × E<sup>−1/2</sup>) indicated an upper bound of fracture toughness to Young’s modulus among the state-of-the-art elastic materials proposed by Zhang and co-workers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.

For notched SSPU, its crack was easy to propagate promptly through the entire sample at horizontal direction (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>; Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM3">1</xref>), resulting in a smooth fractural surface with polymer chains aligned perpendicular to the stretching direction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). Contrarily, the advancing crack in the notched SSPUGIT composite gradually opened up and blunted, or even deflected at the beginning of stretching (Figs. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), similar to the crack-resistant vascular smooth muscle and the synthetic materials with preferentially aligned structures, that are, nacre-mimic or tendon-inspired architectures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Once the tensile strain further increased, the crack tip branched and generated two flaws (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">19</xref>), which tended to longitudinally move along the stretching direction until they reached the upper and lower ends of the SSPUGIT composite (labeled by a purple box in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>; Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">3</xref>). Moreover, SEM images of flaws of notched SSPUGIT revealed distinct fracture behaviors (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3e</xref>), where characteristic fibrillar delamination is along the tensile direction (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>), resulting in a rough interface with fibril alignment (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>). Such adaptive flaw movements during pre-notched SSPUGIT stretching enabled a unique sideway crack elimination that alleviated the local stress concentration around crack tip (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>), thus allowing the notched SSPUGIT stretch to its original strain limit with a high fracture toughness (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">f</xref>).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Mechanisms analysis for fracture process of the SSPUGIT composite.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic illustration of stress distribution for SSPU in a pure shear test; red, orange, and green lines represent high, middle and low stress, respectively. <bold>b</bold> SEM images of the fracture areas in <bold>a</bold>, showing straight crack propagation perpendicular to the stretching direction; <italic>T</italic> represents the local shear stress during the stretching process. <bold>c</bold> Alignment of polymer chains in a smooth facture interface of SSPPU. <bold>d</bold> Schematic illustration of stress distribution for SSPUGIT-3 in pure shear test. <bold>e</bold> SEM images of the facture areas in <bold>d</bold>, exhibiting sideway crack elimination parallel with stretching direction. <bold>f</bold> Amplified SEM images of <bold>e</bold> showing the fibril structure in SSPUGIT-3. <bold>g</bold> Alignment of fibers in a rough fracture interface of SSPPUGIT-3. <bold>h</bold> Stress relaxation curves indicating more mechanical energy dissipation of SSPUGIT than SSPU to 200% strain. <bold>i</bold> Optical microscopy images of SSPUGIT-3 at different strains (0, 200, and 600%).</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2023_35810_Fig3_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par13">Despite all these findings, it is necessary to profoundly understand why the transverse pre-crack in SSPUGIT can bifurcate and then redirect along the stretching direction in pure shear test, especially why the fibrillar delamination formed after longitudinal crack propagation. Thus, we first focus on the variations of stress-strain curves for SSPU and SSPUGIT (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). As depicted, a distinct yield point emerged at strain around ~200% for SSPUGIT composites, which was mainly attributed to the breakage of outer Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> shell and rupture of the interfacial coordination interactions between Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and SSPU matrix<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>. Remarkably, these mechanical behaviors at relatively small strain (≤200%) contribute to more energy dissipation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3h</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">20</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, permitting the deflection and branching of crack tip to diminish the stress concentration (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>). With the increase of tensile strain, the aligned liquid inner core was further elongated into long and thin fiber accordingly<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>, as confirmed by optical microscopy images in stretching (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3i</xref>). For the highly stretched SSPUGIT up to 600% strain, there were obvious interfaces between elongated liquid Galinstan and SSPU elastomer. However, their interfacial binding energy is extremely low (approximately zero) due to the ultra-high surface tension of the shell-bursted Galinstan (600 mN m<sup>−1</sup>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>, which hinders Galinstan from wetting SSPU. According to Cook-Gordan crack-stopping mechanism<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, if the interfacial binding energy between Galinstan and SSPU was lower than the cohesion energy of SSPU solid, the interface would be opened upon loading, vertical cracks subsequently initiated (flaws in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) and propagating along it (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">21</xref>). Such vertical cracks sometimes broke an elongated Galinstan fiber, which then transmitted to the adjacent one and continue to move longitudinally (Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM5">3</xref>).

Scratch-healing test was then conducted to demonstrate the self-healing performance of SSPU, in which a visible artificial scratch faded away upon autonomously healing for 15 h at room temperature (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>).

The cut-damaged SSPUGIT-3 film almost fully restored its mechanical properties (including Young’s modulus, tensile stress, and strain) upon NIR irradiation within 1 min, approaching a high healing efficiency of 98.13% ± 1.93% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4g</xref>), which is superior to self-healing at room temperature and high temperature (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">30</xref>). This outstanding healing performance was also visually confirmed in Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">31</xref> that the SSPUGIT-3 did not rupture at the healed portion but the non-healed areas. In general, our SSPUGIT-3 composite had a fracture toughness up to 111.16 ± 8.76 kJ m<sup>−2</sup> after an optimal healing for 1 min. To the best of our knowledge, such a fast self-healing rate with ultra-high toughness is much better than the reported to date for soft self-healing materials (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4h</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">3</xref>). Not limited to self-healing, our SSPUGIT composites also possess excellent solvent-reprocessibility and recyclability (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">32</xref>), which are highly desired for recycling waste offcuts. Moreover, the Galinstan droplets within SSPUGIT matrix can be recycled in a high efficiency as well, which can be reused for the fabrication of new composite successfully (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">33</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Capacitive strain-sensors application</title><p id="Par17">Soft capacitive strain-sensors are crucial in emerging domains including stretchable electronics, soft robotics and biocompatible human-machine interfaces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Such a capacitive strain-sensor usually consists of a soft dielectric layer sandwiched by conductive and packaging layers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">34</xref>). Traditionally, stretching the sensor causes the top and bottom electrodes closer together, and thus increasing capacitance (C) according to a universal formula of <italic>C</italic> = <italic>ε</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub><italic>ε</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub><italic>S</italic>/4π<italic>kd</italic>, where d is the distance between electrodes, <italic>ε</italic><sub><italic>r</italic></sub> is the dielectric permittivity (<italic>κ</italic>) of dielectric layer (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. Therefore, capacitive sensitivity to a given strain of soft sensors is maximized by using high-κ materials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup>; however, most soft materials used today like silicones, rubbers, or polyurethanes possess relatively low-κ values. A typical sample is the SSPU, the <italic>κ</italic> value of which is only in a small range of 3.47–5.64 across the whole frequency range (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>). Previously, various rigid fillers including metallic, ceramic, and carbon-based particles had been incorporated into soft polymer matrix to greatly enhance their dielectric properties, but this is always at the cost of intrinsic softness and compliance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. In essence, such modified materials generally show a characteristic of high rigidity/modulus and high-κ value, which is obviously incompatible with the high compliance required by soft and stretchable capacitive sensors. Intriguingly, our bioinspired SSPUGIT-3 composite was not only soft yet tough (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), but also integrated high-<italic>κ</italic> value between 11.36 and 16.37, which was 3.27- to 2.92-fold higher than that of SSPU. Such a high-<italic>κ</italic> value arose from the excellent electrical polarizability of Galinstan droplets, which contributed to an amplified electrical displacement (<italic>D</italic>) upon the SSPUGIT-3 composite was subjected to an externally applied electrical field (<italic>E</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. According to the formula of <italic>D</italic> = <italic>εE</italic>, a larger <italic>D</italic> value determined a higher <italic>κ</italic> value. Meanwhile, dielectric dissipation of SSPUGIT-3 was as low as the unfilled SSPU (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">35</xref>), well within the threshold for dielectric functionality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref></sup>. As a whole, our SSPUGIT-3 offered a unique combination of low modulus and high dielectric permittivity, far superior to many commercial dielectric materials (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>; Supplementary Table <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">4</xref>). Of particular note was that SSPUGIT-3 was always electrically insulating even elongated to a large strain of 500% (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">36</xref>). All these prove its potential as a robust dielectric material tailored for soft capacitive strain-sensors (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">34</xref>).<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption xml:lang="en"><title>Application in self-healing capacitive strain-sensors.</title><p><bold>a</bold> Schematic illustration of a soft capacitive strain-sensor based on SSPUGIT-3 composite. <bold>b</bold> Dielectric permittivity of SSPU and SSPUGIT-3 as a function of frequency at 25 °C. <bold>c</bold> Comparison of the dielectric permittivity and Young’s modulus among commercial dielectric materials with SSPUGIT-3. <bold>d</bold> Cyclic tensile tests of SSPU- and SSPUGIT-3-based sensors at 1% strain with a fixed time interval of 1 s. <bold>e</bold> Relative capacitance change of original, self-healed and notched SSPUGIT-3-based capacitive strain-sensors as a function of tensile strain; GF reparents the gauge factor of sensors. <bold>f</bold> Optical images of a notched SSPUGIT-3-based capacitive strain-sensor upon stretching to 200%. <bold>g</bold> Optical images illustrating the standard and wrong table tennis catching motions. <bold>h</bold> Relative capacitance response of the standard and wrong table tennis catching motions.</p></caption><graphic specific-use="web" mime-subtype="PNG" xlink:href="MediaObjects/41467_2023_35810_Fig5_HTML.png"/></fig></p><p id="Par18">The assembled capacitive strain-sensor based on SSPUGIT-3 dielectronic layer could quantitatively measure the external deformation to a high strain of 200% (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">37</xref>), which is due to the robust and stable interfaces between different layers. We observed that the loaded capacitance increased linearly along with stretching, matching well with the formula of <italic>C</italic> = <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub><italic>ΔL</italic>/<italic>L</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> (<italic>L</italic> is the length of capacitive sensor) to achieve a gauge factor (GF) of 1.003 (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">36</xref>). For comparison, we also fabricate a control capacitive strain-sensor by using SSPU as dielectric and packaging layers (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">38</xref>). As expected, the capacitive sensitivity at 1% strain of SSPUGIT-3-based sensor is much higher than that of SSPU-based sensor, together with a more distinct and regular capacitance curve (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5d</xref>). Meanwhile, the response time of SSPUGIT-3-based sensor is as low as 32 ms at 1% strain (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">39</xref>), which is comparable to previously reported soft capacitive strain-sensors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup>. Since the SSPUGIT-3 material showed fast and elastic deformation recovery at strain regions &lt;60% (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">40</xref>), the integrated sensor could sensitively detect wrist-bending motions with ignorable hysteresis (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">41</xref> and Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM6">S4</xref>). The whole sensor could also restore damages or cuts with a little sensitivity degradation because of the excellent self-healing performance of SSPUGIT-3 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e</xref>; Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">42</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup>. Most remarkably, even if a mechanical notch (~2 mm) was made on the SSPUGIT-3-based sensors, it still continued to work due to its inherently ultra-high fracture toughness that restrained crack propagation under deformation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>e, <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">f</xref>; Supplementary Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM7">5</xref>). In sharp contrast, the typical SSPU-based sensor ruptured at a strain of &lt;135%, limiting its strain sensing capability with mechanical damages (Supplementary Fig. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM1">43</xref> and Movie <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="MOESM7">5</xref>).</p><p id="Par19">Owing to its excellent strain sensitivity, remarkable crack resistance, ultra-high fracture toughness and fast self-healing capability, SSPUGIT-3-based capacitive strain-sensor was then employed to detect whether the motions or strokes met the demands in the table tennis training. Firstly, a soft capacitive strain-sensor was conformably mounted on the elbow of a ping-pong player (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5g</xref>). When he hit a ping-pong ball with a standard motion, i.e., keeping his elbows bent before hitting and fleetly applying external force upon hitting the ball, the capacitance line (pink) would exhibit a groove after a relative balance (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h</xref>). However, if the ping-pong player made a wrong shot, i.e., his elbow was straightened in advance and thus hitting the ball, the capacitance line (blue) would slowly generate a step and then display a groove (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5h</xref>). Accordingly, such standard capacitance curves could be used by ping-pong players to correct their wrong catching actions, demonstrating a great application potential of our soft yet tough self-healing SSPUGIT composite.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par20">In this study, we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first example of bioinspired materials to mimic the soft yet tough properties, crack-resistant ability and self-healing performance of human vascular smooth muscle tissues. This unique vascular smooth muscle-inspired material was readily achieved via a hierarchical structure design, that is, engineering core-shell structured spindle Galinstan micro-droplets into soft self-healing polyurea matrix through molecularly interfacial metal-coordinated assembly. The resultant SSPUGIT composite showed extraordinary enhancements of crack-resistant strain (from 121.66 ± 21.24% to 1541.75 ± 61.32%) and fracture toughness (from 3.18 ± 0.51 kJ m<sup>−2</sup> to 111.16 ± 8.76 kJ m<sup>−2</sup>), which is 12.2 and 34.9 times higher than those of initial SSPU, respectively, and retained the intrinsic softness with an inappreciable increase in Young’s modulus (0.83 ± 0.05 MPa). Such a soft toughening mechanism is due to the multiscale cooperation for tremendous mechanical dissipation, in which stress concentration at crack tip was first alleviated through the breakage of Ga<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> shell together with the rupture of interfacial coordination interactions in micro- and molecular scales, followed by complete elimination of primary crack that could adaptively moving along with highly elongated liquid Galinstan at mesoscale. Significantly, the SSPUGIT composite also possesses remotely controlled yet highly accurate NIR-induced fast self-healing and superior dielectric properties through the functionality of the vascular smooth muscle-like Galinstan microstructure. This extraordinary combination of properties allows SSPUGIT composite have a more central role in emerging stretchable electronics applications, where the devices’ robustness highly depends on the crack resistance, fracture toughness and healing performance of the soft materials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par21">Bis(3-aminopropyl)-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane) (H<sub>2</sub>N-PDMS − NH<sub>2</sub>, M<sub>n</sub> = 3000) was purchased from Gelest.
