However, examples of these materials are rare. Here we report an all-inorganic transition metal oxide molecular wire prepared by disassembly of larger crystals. The wires are comprised of molybdenum(VI) with either tellurium(IV) or selenium(IV): {(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>[XMo<sub>6</sub>O<sub>21</sub>]}<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> (X=tellurium(IV) or selenium(IV)). The ultrathin molecular nanowires with widths of 1.2 nm grow to micrometre-scale crystals and are characterized by single-crystal X-ray analysis, Rietveld analysis, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy, thermal analysis and elemental analysis. The crystals can be disassembled into individual molecular wires through cation exchange and subsequent ultrasound treatment, as visualized by atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The ultrathin molecular wire-based material exhibits high activity as an acid catalyst, and the band gap of the molecular wire-based crystal is tunable by heat treatment.</p></abstract><abstract xml:lang="en" id="Abs2" abstract-type="ShortSummary"><p id="Par2">Molecular nanowires, one-dimensional materials grown by repeating a molecular unit along a single axis, are fundamentally and technologically interesting materials.

A more interesting material is a molecular wire with an all-inorganic composition; inorganic compounds have various advantages over organic molecular wires, including stable structures, tunable chemical compositions and tunable properties.
